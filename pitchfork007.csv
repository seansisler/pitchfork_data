Wonderful Rainbow,Lightning Bolt,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd0b13d197565213b460/1:1/w_160/ad367309.jpg,2003-03-03 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4786-wonderful-rainbow/,Load,"Forming in 1995 and performing locally around Providence, Rhode Island, Lightning Bolt started out a sloppy but determined art-school trio with a penchant for Skin Graft-style noise-rock and aggressive live shows. It took them two years to get a record out, and when they finally did, it was released in a limited run of 750 copies. Since then, they've tightened up-- even dropping a member to become a bass/drums duo-- and the live shows which were once simply tenacious have slowly developed into juggernauts, atomic blasts of crystalline fury that send shards of feedback and blistering distortion into anyone who dares witness such savagery in the flesh. 2001 saw things quickly heating up for Lightning Bolt. Their first nationally released full-length, Ride the Skies, set an impossibly high standard for the band, its tightly wound maelstrom of brutal aggression earning them instant acclaim as among the most punishing new art-rock bands. But, in an unusual parallel with the early bands of 1980s indie rock, the record served mainly as a flier for their brain-damaging stage show, the main attraction. The massive, chunky noise violence that emits from bassist Brian Gibson and drummer Brian Chippendale onstage makes for an intensely visceral experience. Chippendale's vocals transmit via a contact mic rigged to his mouth inside a weathered, striped ski mask-- which, incidentally, was reduced to a mere shred of its former self by the third time they'd made it to my city last year. Their amps alone are about the height and size of a large-scale yurt, and when they're turned up all the way, the sound is both hypnotic and physically exhausting. Ride the Skies conveyed that power, earning the band comparisons to Ruins, Boredoms, and even Slayer. The bass came in clumps of crackled abuse, the drums clanged and thwacked with colossal precision, and Chippendale's searing, scorched vocal delivery was enough to blow holes clean through the most durable speakers at high volumes. Suffice to say, Lightning Bolt have got quite a myth to uphold with their second full-length, Wonderful Rainbow. One might expect this follow-up to either echo Ride the Skies, or diverge from that record's distinctive sound and collapse under the weight of its experimentation. I rank Lightning Bolt in my top ten live experiences of all time, and I wasn't quite convinced they weren't just a one-trick pony, all flash and magic. Fortunately, Wonderful Rainbow proves superior to its predecessor. Sure, there's less grating, scraping, and stabbing-- three traits that best defined their last LP-- and it may even disappoint those who love Lightning Bolt purely for the carnage. But Wonderful Rainbow delivers what Ride the Skies most lacked: musical diversity. Possibly taking cues from their psychic brethren and frequent tourmates Hella, Lightning Bolt have replaced much of their corrosive noise with throat-grappling melodies that are... actually kind of pretty, in a lacerating, destructive kind of way. ""Crown of Storms"", a noodly, chugging prog anthem spattered with muffled hollering, and the quietly chirping title track, show Lightning Bolt dropping some of their incredible audacity to further embrace a clearly awesome sense of humor. The result is something like a more contemporary, less D&D-oriented; Blind Guardian; titanic, complex metal distorted by bass and kickdrum shrapnel. The levity and melody lighten things up considerably, adding more energy and sparkling static, and making the band's traditional fist-throwing freakouts-- like the appropriately titled ""30,000 Monkies""-- resonate much more on the uptake. Though already known for naked aggression executed with highbrow overtones, Lightning Bolt have gone even artier on us with Wonderful Rainbow, and by balancing their strong-armed aesthetic with unexpected dynamics, they're now proving themselves as artists with actual range, a band that can deliver beyond the novelty that got people talking; perhaps for the first time on a broad scale, Lightning Bolt will have them listening instead.","Forming in 1995 and performing locally around Providence, Rhode Island, Lightning Bolt started out a sloppy but determined art-school trio ...

Sex Is Everything,Hint Hint,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0e913d197565213baf6/1:1/w_160/fd21b3b8.jpg,2003-03-03 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3874-sex-is-everything/,Cold Crush,"Half-time disco beats, heavy on the hi-hat. Synth lasso'd in heavy, crackly chunks. Screaming, pained vocalist. Dark angles. It's what characterizes the disco portion of early 21st Century apr√®s-punk, and its elements are bound together by The Rapture, Hot Hot Heat, Dance Disaster Movement, GoGoGo Airheart, Chromatics, Headphone, Liars, Radio Vago, Numbers, Radio 4, et cetera, et al. You've heard it before. You've been hearing it for three years. There's no reason disco-warped dance punk shouldn't proliferate-- it makes perfect sense. Come On got reissued. Dancing is fun. Neon is the new black. Now let's fuck shit up until the end of the world. Only now, it's getting to be sort of obvious. While most of the above bands and their many brethren have some distinctive quality to separate them from the dance beat-wielding, underground-infiltrating masses, and some of them are even great, it's simply no longer that distinctive or special to simply play disco beats informed by hardcore and 80s new wave and goth-- which is why I'm not crazier about Seattle four-piece Hint Hint. They have all the elements to be unique, but first, they must learn to fuse those elements with grace, space, and diversity, 'cause right now, they near-methodically plow over every predictable aspect of danceable punk rock music. It's not that Sex is Everything, the first record on Cold Crush-- a new label run by Dim Mak's Steve Aoki and Pretty Girls Make Graves' Derek Fudesco-- isn't enjoyable. Its six songs seethe with spiraling energy and tension between dual keyboards and guitar, while singer Peter Quirk lets out speedy, gravelly yelps like a steroidal Peter Murphy. (He even fronts British at times.) On ""Rung by Rung"", cymbals crash hectically behind a certain Bauhaus steez, all gloomy low-end and cracked guitar. ""Among the Blind"" is a damaged punk number above church-bells tolling. The song's lyrics go, ""Buried alive all the time/ But the doctor said I'm fine,"" but could just as easily be, ""The line between the devil's teeth and that which cannot be repeat,"" for the speedy way they're sung. The creepy, downturned ""Plastic and Whores"" begins with a mediocre taste of electronic beats, but explodes in a melting battery of crushing noise, static, and blood-curdling screams. Later, the electronics redeem themselves a bit with a scratch-mocking sputter on the hardcore end of glitch, only to end impotently in a hollering, fizzled-out jam. Individually, each song conforms to a similar tempo and explores virtually zero dynamic diversity. There's no breathing room for the melodies, so it sounds like a messy pile of molten, smoldering metal. This is a hindrance when their aesthetic is so similar to that of other bands, and makes their divergences-- that they're a little more hardcore, and like to sprinkle in the standard, rocker-using-ProTools beats and squelches-- not as significant on the whole.","Half-time disco beats, heavy on the hi-hat.

Armed Forces,Elvis Costello & The Attractions,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6739d034d5c69bf3536/1:1/w_160/b4cc4c09.gif,2003-03-02 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1621-armed-forces/,ColumbiaColumbia,"It could be said that Elvis Costello had the distinct pleasure of living out the ultimate dream of every sharp-witted, incurably bitter young bastard with hopes of achieving stardom. In only two and a half years, he was propelled from an awkward, computer-programming teenager with a Jazzmaster and ugly glasses to the prototype for chic geekdom. Virtually overnight, he established himself as among the most articulate songwriters rock music has ever seen, infusing punk with the literacy it had always strived for but rarely achieved. With superstar status and a reputation for pushing the envelope, Costello was able to crystallize the thematic threads of political and personal devastation that ran through his first two records into the concept of ""emotional fascism,"" the original title for Armed Forces. Though Armed Forces is in many ways the most conceptually aggressive and confrontational of Costello's first three records, it doesn't carry with it the same immediacy of his first two releases, 1977's My Aim Is True and 1978's This Year's Model, on which he came as a man with something to prove. There's something intensely subversive about My Aim Is True with its undercurrents of anger and frustration providing a foundation for his synthesis of pop melody, country twang, and punk energy. This Year's Model, meanwhile, saw Costello expanding his sound significantly, with each instrument coming through as clear and urgent as a warning siren. It was equal parts whispered confession and frantic street corner sermon, and though he never quite reached its apex again, Armed Forces comes very close. As Costello writes in the liner notes to this expanded reissue, Armed Forces marks the first time that he was actually aware of his audience. Perhaps in an attempt to elucidate the web of veiled and convoluted social and personal references running through his first two records, the album is lyrically much more general, and remarkably self-conscious, right from the opening lyric, ""Oh, I just don't know where to begin."" This, of course, doesn't slow Costello down-- ""Accidents Will Happen"", one of the finest songs in his, or any, repertoire, matches a signature smirking double-entendre with an almost Baroque pop sensibility. Melodically and lyrically, the song is above reproach, as Costello sings of infidelity with what could either be construed as regret or smug satisfaction. It's also one of several songs on Armed Forces to benefit from the album's dense production. Whereas both My Aim Is True and This Year's Model are sharply produced, relatively sparse affairs, Armed Forces is extravagantly layered with dense instrumentation and rich, effusive textures. Pete Thomas' maniacal drumming is much more consistent than on previous outings, and keyboardist Steve Nieve, for the first time, is as likely to be found at a piano as behind a synthesizer. On ""Accidents Will Happen"" and the similarly stunning ""Oliver's Army"", in which Costello winds catchy and elegant melodies around slightly off-kilter chord progressions, the production works to the record's advantage, filling the songs out with bombastic power-pop arrangements and giving weight to their urgency. ""Big Boys"" and ""Green Shirt""-- two subdued products of the same mold that produced ""The Beat"" and ""Pump It Up"", and make full use of steady, insistent rhythms and the unstoppable kinetic energy of The Attractions-- are near-classics as well, but are somewhat hindered by the album's smoother production. An earlier acoustic version of ""Big Boys"" included as a bonus track on Rhino's reissue of This Year's Model reveals layers of anger and heartbreak that the album version buries beneath impenetrable four-part harmonies and a heavy fog of reverb. Of course, even if the production on Armed Forces often serves to conceal, rather than reveal the nuances of Costello's songwriting and The Attractions' always impeccable playing, the songwriting can hardly be argued with. ""Goon Squad"" carries on the menacing tone and complex rhythms of ""Watching the Detectives"" and ""(I Don't Want to Go to) Chelsea"" with a prodigious sense of melody; ""Party Girl"" is yet another example of Costello successfully executing what would, in the hands of a lesser musician, quickly strike as overwrought; ""Moods for Moderns"" turns disco clich√© into new wave brilliance; and a fiery, acidic cover of Nick Lowe's ""(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love and Understanding"" mockingly closes an album packed with dauntless, condemnatory social commentary. In the end, the greatest strength of Armed Forces may be the same thing that makes it less viscerally powerful than Costello's two prior records-- its songs absolutely demand to be appreciated for their craftsmanship. In many ways, Armed Forces can be seen as the point at which Costello dropped the role of angry young upstart, and became more comfortable with his personification as a songwriter. And considering that he has since remained largely true to this sound, it can be seen not only as the consummation of all he had worked toward, but a window to what he would later accomplish.",,9.5,
Billions of Phonographs,The Instruments,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b971eb335119a49ec794/1:1/w_160/0165c42f.jpg,2003-03-02 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4106-billions-of-phonographs/,Orange Twin,"Less a band than a large, loose assemblage of musicians, The Instruments gather to play the songs of one Heather McIntosh. Members of Neutral Milk Hotel, Olivia Tremor Control, Circulatory System, Music Tapes, and Elf Power have all contributed, striving for the demented carnival feel of Tom Waits circa Swordfishtrombones and The Black Rider, alternately. They have an obsession with the sea that goes beyond lyrics or song titles like ""My Ship"" and ""Sea Chantey"": The entire album sounds like it was played on the deck of a galleon creeping slowly through the night on calm waters. That gentle swaying-- adrift on an endless expanse of ocean-- resides at the core of Billions of Phonographs. Its tension comes from dense harmonies and plodding rhythms, not anxiously anticipating disaster, but insistent, and focused on the ship's...instruments. Bordering overwrought, the complicated pieces will knock a few curious listeners off the Instruments' boat, but those with a thirst for detail should delight in McIntosh's intricacy of arrangement, made simultaneously more complex and naturalistic by the established, well-traveled collective that support her. The songs shuffle along, taking their time to develop, giving the impression they dictate the agenda to the musicians, rather than the other way around. It's is an intriguing approach in small doses, but taken at length, it's hard not to wish someone from the vaunted cast would firmly plant their spurs in this pony. Billions of Phonographs manages to slip into the background more often than one might expect given that it features such novel ingredients as theremin, mellophone, and a singing saw. Unfortunately, its vagueness is largely due to the fact that McIntosh isn't all that compelling as a vocalist, and when she puts together a harmony, she tends to overdo it, going too big, too loud, too overtly exotic. Flying solo, her druggy delivery merely hovers rather than soaring or swooping. Billions of Phonographs would probably function better playing in a quiet coffee shop than at home over headphones, intently analyzing each note, despite the considerable craftsmanship that on paper deserves the latter setting. The two laudable exceptions to this estimation are found at albums' end: ""My Ship"" and ""By and By"". Here, McIntosh gets it right, double-tracking her vocals on the first and offering a gorgeous adaptation of a J.R. Webster theme on the second. Acknowledging the chaotic, overstuffed material many of the contributors are infamous for, Billions of Phonographs is surprising in its direct emotional consistency; the players are able to subdue their egos and focus on their muse, but she's unable to answer their prayers, delivering sustenance rather than bounty.","Less a band than a large, loose assemblage of musicians, The Instruments gather to play the songs of one Heather ...

Empty Rooms,Canyon,by: Brian James,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a510c0084474cd0c062f/1:1/w_160/4e4fa56d.gif,2003-03-02 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1288-empty-rooms/,Gern Blandsten,"In the mid-to-late 80s, rebels from across the U.S. decided country music was the only pure reservoir of rock and roll left. Of course, straight renditions of Willie Nelson wouldn't do, so they went for the darker side, for Johnny Cash, taking the drunken outlaw rather than the church picnicker as their role model. Uncle Tupelo won some big victories, as did Whiskeytown. Now Canyon is taking their shot, and though they've accomplished a lot less than those two bands thus far, they have yet to implode, which gives them a big leg up as the competition continues to thin out. On their second album Empty Rooms, this elusive group infuses their country leanings with more exotic sounds, to the point where it sounds like they've forgotten the way to Nashville. Only the most hidebound purist would find this objectionable after hearing the best of the results, which find a way to balance disparate elements precariously enough that their lovely hybrid seems forever on the verge of collapse. The meticulously assembled guitars deserve full credit for this: When combined, they form a nuanced wall of sound that borders on feedback without ever crossing over. Instead of exploding like the Velvet Underground's axes might have done, Canyon lets their squall sit at a distance, like a storm cloud that can't decide whether to erupt or slink back over the horizon. ""Sleepwalker"", ""Head Above"", ""Blankets and Shields"", and possible Television allusion ""Magnetic Moon"" all achieve this queasy sense of foreboding, denying the release of climax and resolution. They develop tension and leave it there, and if Canyon gets credit for nothing else, they should be saluted for delving into perpetual tension, an underpopulated section of pop music's emotional spectrum. If justice prevails, this will not be the only thing that nets Canyon praise. Their sense of orchestration shows an admirable willingness to let vocals be swallowed up by other instruments; the lyrics are heavy on loss and alienation, but they let their music do the real talking, which is a bracing choice in this never-ending age of Bono-styled rock prophets and inspirational speakers. The weariness and resignation comes through clearly enough, but it does so with an adult dose of ambiguity, knocking a phrase off balance with a drum fill or a growling amp. It's this kind of mystery that outlines the best moments on Empty Rooms. After such flashes of inspiration, it's understandably disappointing when Canyon lets up on the gas. When they're not diving headlong into unknown waters, they're busy cranking out straightforward country rock ballads whose lack of imagination isn't at all disguised by overt electronic frou-frou. They still put a great deal of care into these songs, as the precision guitar rattle on ""Lights of Town"" shows, but these numbers aren't inherently exciting enough to compensate for their conventionality. There was a natural opening on Empty Rooms, for a comforting counterbalance to the reckless experimentation they had going, but Canyon fails to fill it, at least with any original style. These unearned anthems are a repeatedly embarrassing albatross, marring a steady, slow-burner of an album, one you'd hardly expect to find sullied by impatience and second-guessing.","In the mid-to-late 80s, rebels from across the U.S. decided country music was the only pure reservoir of rock ...

Hip Hop and the World We Live In,Aceyalone,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299feb13d1975652138266/1:1/w_160/1e0b789c.gif,2003-03-02 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16-hip-hop-and-the-world-we-live-in/,Project Blowed,"Aceyalone's transcendent smoothness is such that he can reference Laverne and Shirley and the overweight lover Heavy D in the same song, back to back. Both references seriously represent for the ladies, and when Acey's extrapolating on the hotness of his ""Dirty Birdy""-- who's ""So flirty/ Comin' out the house lookin' all nice and purdy,"" he sounds more shook on lovin' than LL Cool J. But the entirety of this longtime Freestyle Fellowship/Project Blowed emcee's persona is defined by his smoothness, as both an emcee and a lyricist (not that the two are-- or should be-- separable). His reclined, effortless flow is represented well on Hip Hop and the World We Live In, a compilation of tracks recorded from 2000-2002 with Elusive of the Living Legends (soon to be better-known after Def Jux releases a new record from crew member Murs). Though Hip Hop was made sporadically, within the same time frame as Accepted Eclectic (2001), it's a more consistent offering, without the weaker tracks that kept Accepted Eclectic from exceeding the comfort of ""classic"" and approaching the realm of ""masterpiece."" While Hip Hop doesn't necessarily launch Aceyalone into those circles either, it's a good, solid example of the art of rhyme. As always, Acey excels at his craft. As proven on earlier Aceyalone-Elusive collaborations, these two boys were made for each other. Acey's ""Got the ease/ Cool as a breeze,"" and Elusive backs it up with a layered, laid back shuffle of thick, consistent beats, inserting subtle elements of 20th century jazz and classical samples (flute, upright bass, cello, etc) whenever possible. It's somewhat freaky, twinkling darkly with distant skronks, deeply up front melodies, and scary piano lines that sound ripped from the deepest recesses of Henry Cowell, Gyorgy Kurtag, maybe even Mike Oldfield. None of that happy-schmappy, edgeless nu-jazz piano noodling here: this is purely ominous stuff. It especially works on standout tracks like ""I Think I Know Too Much"", in which Acey's authority and anguish is conveyed in a heated list of thoughts that clog his brain: ""Holidays/ Sorrow/ No one is guaranteed tomorrow/ Yesterday is borrowed/ Picture-perfect sunsets/ Ocean-front toxic waste dumps/ I think I know too much/ (You don't know shit!)"" Aceyalone is at his best when he's rapping in precise, simple polyrhythms (occasionally on a feelin' fine, Stetsasonic/De La vibe), proving that an emcee doesn't have to emote into oblivion to sound personal, nor does he have to rock fifty-cent words to sound intelligent. Throughout, he conveys a smart toughness, still speaking out against the bling and the thugs, while lauding a kind of humility in a battle rhyme: ""The bigger they come, the harder they fallin'/ All I wanna know is why your man got so much ego?"" The million-dollar question, then, is whether Acey's next release will launch him further into the public eye; after all, he's been a force in the L.A. underground since the late 80s, his fans are loyal, his records are numerous, and he's widely considered a strong talent. He wonders this himself on ""Say"", the now-obligatory, frustrated rant against the mainstream hip-hop machine: ""The question is how could a man like me/ Actually be/ A man that's free / Of speech and the ability reach the masses?/ Maybe I should refrain and let the unimaginative, non-creative ones give me some brains?""","Aceyalone's transcendent smoothness is such that he can reference Laverne and Shirley and the overweight lover Heavy D in ...

Sorry to burst your shiny, gold bubble, but out there in the thick web of backwater 'burbs and ethernet cables are PC warriors who've taken the shuffling, bloodshot riddims of dub and ragga, the blitzkrieg verbal skills of various dancehall MCs, and turned that shit into an Extinction Level Event that'd have you pissing your sagging Bushi pants. DJ Scud, Psychofreud, Knifehandchop, post-trauma Otto Von Shirach, Kevin Martin's The Bug project: Each one has severed dancehall's dreadlocked head and grafted it onto the body of their own brand of virulent breakbeat, from electro-gabba freak-outs to jungle doused in eleven rancid herbs and spices. In every case the whole transcends the parts, and disembodied Caribbean rants find new life as they forge through pelvis-shattering beats like mental patients sailing an endless sea of Ice-9. And no one right now is doing it as well as Enduser, Kentucky's own and Jah's favorite. 15 Tracks, his first full-length for Sonic Terror, is an S&M; orgasm of unrelenting stereo violence, an amalgamation of ganja smoke, severed heads, and 18 tons of rusty nails that puts everyone else's game to shame. Moving from head-bobs to bodyblows in the space of a few seconds, Enduser (that's end-user) takes cues from the aggressive cut-ups of Venetian Snares and Squarepusher, rolls them up in the cherry-scented skin of backpacker hip-hop, and lights that blunt with a butane torch until the sucker burns white hot. Be it nebulous drum 'n' bass or steel machete breakcore, Bounty Killer or Bj√∂rk, Enduser dips it all in battery acid and Red Stripe, and ferments a barrel full of digital moonshine worth going blind to drink. The opening round is a massive revamp of Meth and Redman's benign Blackout! cut ""Tear it off"", a clicking iron snare with eerie UFO landing themes that completely reshuffle the Brick City and Shaolin representatives around the beat. ""Blastin' Muthafuckaz"" brings in the thug MCs, packing stuttering handgun boasts, backed by drum kits made of steel beams and tin, but it's the cribbing of ragga verbals and melody-minded cadences that really spread the gasoline around. The industrial, vibrating bed of nails, ""Beatdown"", and the bitch-in-heat fervor of ""Rprznt"" are whales unto themselves, but the chirping ""I Come From Cincinnati"" is as unreformed as it is a party record, a fire and brim stone buildup broken up by fuzzed-out bass drops and a coked-up flute, racing a gruff bear of an MC and his vampiress sparring partner. Think D/J Rupture's Gold Teef Thief mix, drunk on Captain Morgan in an underground bunker, chased with Caribbean Drain-O. There are faces here no one has tried on yet, or at least haven't looked as good wearing. ""East Side Breaks"" plucks a long moan of senseless New-agey gibberish from what sound like a Deep Forest or Enigma record, and straps it lovingly on the back of a tranquilized sandworm, warming up the bed while ""Knuckle Fucker"" gets its ya-ya's out, a Commodore 64 riff in Wonka-vision, overpowered by cannibal breaks. ""Port 666"" has the most personalities: every barrage of bristling speed metal stomp and sliding digital hardcore comes at you like a bonafide headcase. 15 Tracks is a better discovery than cheap cigarettes: it's hot sex, imported beer and Dutch Masters, a hot-glue strip search from Pam Grier, with coat hangers and paper clips jammed deep in your ears.

It was a subtle, insidious change that could have been the result of Greg Wales taking on production duties, or Chris Prescott's increasingly subdued drum work, but it might have been something far more sinister: a quest for accessibility. The more polished No Knife are easier to listen to, but their shiny, post-punk-flavored morsels suit a wider variety of palettes because they're more agreeably bland. The oddest thing is that on the surface, No Knife are improving. Musically, artistically, and thematically, the San Diego quartet expanded their horizons on Fire in the City of Automatons; they slowed things down a bit, tried their hand at a few melancholy downtempo cuts, and still managed to bend the music to their aggressive, slightly-askew guitar rock aesthetic. But it didn't quite work. Fire lacked their singularly awkward, shambling gait, the rougher edges of their earliest recordings. Riot For Romance! was their chance to stop bathing, shaving, and flossing, to slouch back into the unpresentable slack rockers we were first drawn to. No such luck. No Knife remains as clean cut as they were on Fire in the City of Automatons, maybe cleaner. Their signature, ragged hooks are still sharp, but no longer break the skin; the rhythm shifts and breakdowns cut on a dime, but they're weighed down by a sense that they've become gratuitous. A passive-aggressive rut runs squarely through the center of this album. Plenty of these tracks start angry, but they all cave at the end, in eerily predictable fashion. The biggest miscues on Riot are songs that don't start at all, when No Knife explores their softer side, which unlike the more patient moments on Fire isn't touching, just squishy. ""Feathers and Furs"" is simply interminable: the same two chords are jangled back and forth until the end of time. Occasionally, there's a downy, 12 Rods-styled chorus full of soaring harmonies and cymbal washes (many actually pretty good), but I promise you'll get cancer and die waiting to hear it. ""May I Call You Doll?"" is, in isolation, Riot's most inspired piece (aside from the title track), a delicate, sorrowful instrumental straight from the forests of Twin Peaks, but it kills the album prematurely. The rush of energy that follows from ""Flechette"" seems wasted, and excess is the last thing this album needs. Amazingly, ""Riot for Romance!"" is strong enough to carry this one through its bleakest points on its own. The vicious, saw-toothed guitar line that staggers through the heart of this song is more fascinating and creative than the rest of the album doubled, then redoubled. Along with the perfect mix of anger, desperation, hope and defeat in Mitch Wilson's vocals, the song possesses the strength to carry Riot through its stumbling, over-reaching tracklist. Is it any wonder the highs almost perfectly counterbalance the lows on an album with such questionable aims? No Knife has learned to balance on the fence such that everyone might be included: never too fast, never too slow, but never daring or much fun. Perhaps year-round sunny skies and fair weather have finally taken their toll, but these guys need a knife now more than ever, to cut some edges into the encroaching, stifling gloss.","Somewhere between Hit Man Dreams (1997) and Fire in the City of Automatons (1999), No Knife became boring.

But chew on it a bit, give it a few spins around the noggin, picture it on a record bin namecard. Yep, still awful. But all genre names are, aren't they? Which gives me the confidence that this one just might stick, and be applied to the increasing flow of releases to which it might apply-- be it the near-toothache of The Postal Service, the smoove stylings of Super_Collider, or the bait-and-switch opener of Hrvatski's Swarm and Dither. And now, Pulseprogramming, who, should my creation gain popularity, would most adequately be referred to as run-of-the-mill lap-pop. ""Blooms Eventually"" tips their hand right off, with that most lap-poppy of devices, the vocoder-- you know, man, machine, the voice modified by technology, deep stuff. Despite the manipulated voice (w/vocodorized harmonies, even), synthesizer squiggles, and handclap hits, it's a rather melancholy affair more akin to a less organically grounded Notwist. It's a mood that continues throughout Tulsa in One Second, although further vocal tracks misplace the vocoder and leave the voices au natural. The singing rarely breaks out of a mopey drone, mourn-moaning through I Am statements on ""Stylophone Purrs and Mannerist Blossoms"" or drearily intoning ""Row Row Row Your Boat"" lyrics on ""Off to Do Showery Snapshots"". Whereas other microphone collaborators in this movement bring much-needed emotion to the binary codes of IDM-- Ben Gibbard brightening up the digitalia of Dntel, Max Tundra's sister verbalizing his amino-acid obsessions-- Pulseprogramming's lack of affect leaves their traditional songcraft sounding somewhat hollow. Not helping matters is the fact that Pulseprogramming's music is strictly blunt-edge, full of glitchyclickybuzzy noises that sound tired even to this electronic music skimmer. The lack of freshness is most apparent on the disc's instrumental tracks, most of which sound like hand-me-down versions of the micro-carols on Mum's Finally We Are No One. Only when the more driving bassline of ""Largely Long-Distance Loves"" breaks the album out of its tick-tack trance in the final act do the duo of Marc Hellner and Joel Kriske start to sound like more than a cut-rate Matmos, setting the stage for the majestic closing build of ""Bless the Drastic Space"". Still, even that final burst of electronic chopwork behind a catchy vocal is par for the course on the Postal Service's full-length, and proves that Pulseprogramming are a few lengths behind their peers. You might think I'd be upset with Tulsa for One Second for mucking up my freshly christened genre with a subpar release, but I'm not worried-- every new stylistic branch needs its mediocre releases to fill out the ranks. As for the possible spread of my squintingly terrible new genre label (remember kids, lap-pop! Use it in a sentence today!), don't worry, I can deal with the infamy. Worked for Douglas Coupland, dinnit?","Just how do genre names start anyway? 'Cause I wanna get one going. Seems to me there's a new ...

Unreleased Classics 78-82,N.O.I.A.,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c41d69fc7814a47cd7e1/1:1/w_160/9b4ee16f.gif,2003-02-27 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5825-unreleased-classics-78-82/,Ersatz Audio,"I sit down to write this half-expecting the official goon squad of the Record Review Office of Standards and Practices to emerge from behind my radiator and make me say it. And, oh no, here they are. (They have eyes that make dogs shiver-- and who'd have thought corduroy and epaulettes would go so well together?) The applicable by laws are firm on this point: If I don't say it, they can revoke my turntable and all of my Peel Sessions. So here you go: ""The Italian Kraftwerk."" It was either that or mentioning those ""Sprockets"" segments from Saturday Night Live. I think they're gone now. So yes, N.O.I.A. were Italian and sounded basically like Kraftwerk. And while they supposedly scored a few popular singles during the mid-80s in their home country, a good portion of their earlier work went unreleased. Two years ago, however, they went back and re-recorded some of those songs, and now Ersatz Audio-- Adult.'s label, and one I'm pretty fond of-- have offered up these ""unreleased classics."" At least two or three of them, you'll be glad to hear, are just mind-blowingly fantastic, really ridiculously enjoyable. All of these tracks were written between 1978 and 1982, in Italy, which might lead one to expect a discful of vintage Italo-disco, packed with dark enveloping swells and ominous grinds. But N.O.I.A., as noted, were under the spell of Kraftwerk, not Giorgio Moroder. So what we get is quite different: The precise, minimal beeping of synths and brittle little drum machines, mapping out gridlike streams of ultra-robotic pop so sterile and simplified that its funkiness can feel like a treasure. It's jerky and twinkly and sometimes adorably groovy: All you need to enjoy this is to be the sort of person who'd find watching a big wall of multicolored LED lights blink in repetitive patterns at least as entertaining as, say, watching grass grow. Because, you see, the Kraftwerk in question here isn't just Kraftwerk in general: it's the well-known Kraftwerk of Computer World, the Kraftwerk that, depending on whom you ask, either descended into amusing self-parody or finally matched their playfully rigid robotism to the context of stiff little pop songs. There are a few tracks in this collection that make it seem as if nothing else is even worth doing. One of the best is ""Be Alert"", where a cutely formal groove breaks down into a tight, yelping verse before shifting gears and cruising back round again. It's one of the most ingeniously plotted things I've heard in a while, and I'm sure that if you downloaded it you'd only be doing that to tide yourself over until you could attain it legally. Another winner is ""Stop Thinking"", which does, well, sort of the same thing, only with more of a ""Peter Gunn"" rhythm: It's the vocals here that prompted that really unfortunate Sprockets reference, with their clipped delivery of questions like, ""Don't you know your mind's too much slow?"" and repeated proclamations of, ""You must stop thinking!"" Tracks like these function as spazzy pop as much as Kraftwerk and Devo did, thanks in part to a certain carefree quality: On ""Korowa Milk Bar"", they even reconfigure that classic rock 'n' roll four-step harmony-- you know, the one from ""Twist & Shout"". Seven tracks later, they're offering ""grazie mille"" to Kraftwerk and paying homage with synth-speech reworkings of their songs, ""The Robots"" mutating lovingly into ""We Wanna Glow"". Obviously there's plenty of futurism: much talk of traveling in electric wheelchairs and computers making ""No Mistakes"". Interestingly, there's also Cold War politics: ""Stop Thinking"", for instance, is followed by the presumably less sarcastic ""West Is the Best"". (You can trust central Europeans to make more realistic moral distinctions about communism than Americans, who've never been allowed to take it seriously enough to form very enlightened responses.) Following that is ""Hunger in the East""-- a song about, well, Social Darwinism-- whose message has only grown more pertinent a couple decades on: ""Selection now means hunger in the East."" If you've listened to many synth records from this period, you'll be unsurprised to hear there's a song about Japan, only in this case it's called ""Nagasaki Forced Fun 1945"". You'll also be unsurprised to hear that this collection is a bit monochromatic (duh) and contains a bunch of cute beepy synth patterns that repeat a whole awful lot. If this sounds unappealing to you, it's safe to assume you're not a part of the target audience. So: I used to go around trying to convince people that Men without Hats' Rhythm of Youth was the best example of this kind of music that I'd come across-- and before you laugh, be aware that most of that record sounds as much like Gang of Four as it does ""Safety Dance"". But the best of these tracks (""Be Alert"", ""Korowa Milk Bar"", ""Stop Thinking"") are currently getting a lot more spins than much of other stuff in my bedroom.","I sit down to write this half-expecting the official goon squad of the Record Review Office of Standards and Practices ...

You Can Feel Me,Har Mar Superstar,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c057c0084474cd0c3193/1:1/w_160/b642dab2.jpg,2003-02-27 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3736-you-can-feel-me/,Warner Bros.,"Where haven't I seen Har Mar Superstar lately? Name one place. Really try. I promise, he's been there. Supermarket? Sorry, aisle 13 flashes issues of People and TV Guide. Post office? Nope, no less than four copies of You Can Feel Me have shown up in the Pitchfork P.O. box in the past two months, each accompanied by glossy 8x10s and novella-thick press kits. DMV? Great guess, but he even showed up there last week when I stood 74th in line wearing headphones blasting Loyola University's WLUW. Rolling Stone, Spin, CMJ, MTV, ABC... BET!! You guys, BET. How did this art-school joke from suburban Minnesota get all that publicity? The guy even co-wrote songs on Kelly Osbourne's debut and took her to the VMAs. Har Mar Superstar, as you may know by now, is Sean Tillmann, who got his start fronting the Amphetamine Reptile noise-pop band Calvin Krime. Not long after that group disbanded, he re-emerged with a new project, Sean Na Na, and his self-titled Kill Rock Stars debut as Har Mar, which, initially, he jokingly passed off as the work of a younger brother, Harold Martin. (The name, in fact, comes from a notoriously dilapidated strip mall in Roseville, MN.) But during the past three years, Tillmann's been thinking bigger. Not content as simply the latest successor to the indie rock oddity throne of The Frogs, Wesley Willis and Neil Hamburger, he's taken his rote R&B; caricatures to Warner, who've flung him headfirst into the 15-minute novelty spotlight that once shown on Tenacious D, The Jerky Boys and Green Jell√∂. And so he finally lives up to his moniker. You Can Feel Me is, predictably, a much glossier affair than Tillmann's Har Mar debut, and, in keeping with current trends, its instrumentation is far more minimal. Other than that, not much has changed. But what could, really? The entire persona's a joke, a sorta-funny-on-paper gimmick that wears out its welcome about three seconds after being made a reality. I mean, it's so obvious! A pudged-out, freakishly ugly white dude crooning soul cuts in his underwear? How'd this guy get a record out at all, much less one with such little actual entertainment value? I'll tell you how: America. The country's no-brow simpletons lap this shit up like a last meal. It'll sell for the same reasons The Man Show's lasted four seasons and Spencer Gifts can't keep inflatable tits and farting monkeys in stock. What are we, nine? You Can Feel Me only exists as a passing gag. It's an off-color joke we forget after flicking off the TV. And the label doesn't even try to disguise that the disc is pure merchandise, from its 29-minute runtime to its budget list price. They know no one actually wants to listen to this. People see the funny fat man on TV, they click to Amazon.com. It's that easy! If these tracks had even the slightest shred of originality, it would be one thing, but Tillmann's on autopilot from the moment we push play. You Can Feel Me's entire comedic arsenal consists of his off-key falsetto, and stock R&B; catchphrases that were already played-out when his debut hit stores in 2000: ""I'm all up in your grill"", ""baby mother"", ""all you haters, step the fuck off,"" ""I ain't got nothin' but love,"" ""tappin' that ass"", ""ungh, ungh,"" ""put ya hands up"", and ""booty call"" are just some of the tired colloquialisms we're expected to laugh at. Did I mention there's vocoder? Hilarity! Weighting this thing against other novelty records-- where a 10.0 might be, say, Spike Jones' Nutcracker Suite-- is a total loss; You Can Feel Me couldn't even battle 30 seconds of ""They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha Ha"". The melodies, which are incomprehensibly being touted as this record's secret weapon, might be worse than the humor. This guy is shopping songs to Eve and J-Lo? Get the fuck out. What PR flack got promoted for that one? Oh, and did you know Har Mar really takes this all very seriously? Did you? Check his quote from Canada's Eye Weekly in December: ""I'm not mocking it at all! I don't understand why people fucking think that. Because I'm white? Everyone has this perception that I'm mocking it because I perform and I do it with a straight face, but that's because I fucking love it. If you're going to laugh at it, fine, but buy my fucking record. The whole mockery issue really pisses me off, I think it's really retarded. If you put Usher's face on the cover nobody would know the difference, and I can sing better than that motherfucker."" Yeah, Tillmann, it's because you're fucking white. Jesus! Can you even believe the arrogance of this kid? Is he an asshole or something? Sorry, champ, but Usher wouldn't package promotional copies of his albums with gross-out glossies of his fat ass in thriftstore Underoos. Usher wouldn't play up his rank beastliness by neglecting his personal grooming habits before photo shoots. Usher wouldn't sport a cop-show 'stache and a rat-tail mullet. I can't even believe that needs to be explained!! ""Because I'm white?"" How do you even sleep after making a comment like that?! DUDE YOU HAVE A SONG ABOUT THE FUCKING ELEPHANT WALK!!!

All the King's Men,The Legendary Pink Dots,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcc9ea9e61561daa755f/1:1/w_160/bf6184c0.jpg,2003-02-26 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4722-all-the-kings-men/,ROIR,"You have to admire a band that just doesn't care at all about fitting in with any current trend in music. Legendary Pink Dots have wedged themselves so firmly into their own specific niche over the years that it's unlikely they could leave it even if they wanted to. In just over twenty years, they've kicked out nearly forty albums (live records and comps put them near sixty), and not one of those releases has ever seen them set foot into a realm you could call commercial. While obscurity and difficulty certainly aren't virtues in their own right, the various lineups that have revolved around the core of Edward Ka-Spel and Phil Knight have always found oddness without much effort-- some of their best records (From Here You'll Watch the World Go By, A Perfect Mystery, Chemical Playground 1 + 2) revel in sounds that most would roll their eyes at. And that's an important point-- most people will not like this music. That's just fact. The keyboards drip in sounds other bands avoid like the plague, Ka-Spel's lisping delivery can be over-the-top even for Goths, and huge swaths of this album are bathed with washes of sound that go places only when they feel like it, not when you want them to. The band's closest kindred spirits in terms of approach (though not necessarily in sound), are darkwave acts like Current 93 and Nurse with Wound, though their music only occasionally reaches the points of creepy surrealism or abrasion that those artists aspire to. And despite all this, there's something arresting about the music that Legendary Pink Dots make. The band grabs you with a song or two, blinding you to the fact that you're being gradually lowered into a morass of strange, uncompromising sound. In the midst of all this is the inescapable fact that Ka-Spel can't pronounce the letter ""r,"" a fact which will either drive you up the wall or endear you to him. I have to say that after a brief period of adjustment way back in the day, I came to like his voice-- it nicely suits the music. It's almost not worth getting into specifics about songs, as the whole record feels very much of a piece, from the weird synthetic opening to the droning club beat that guides the last thirteen minutes of its duration on ""The Brightest Star"". Programmed drums and little whizzing noises serve as the bed for ""Cross of Fire"", which is about as appropriate a bowshot as you could have for what comes after. Ka-Spel starts out at the back of the mix, before an army of buzzing devices lifts him on robot arms into the foreground. He still sounds like he's standing 20 feet down the hall speaking into a megaphone, but he somehow comes out ahead, at least before a guitar processed beyond recognition guts everything and leaves behind the artificial organ and string motifs of ""The Warden"". ""The Warden"" is one of a handful of comparatively straightforward dirges that populate the wasteland of guitar and keyboard drone that fills the album's middle. The drum machine is halfway between Enya and being switched off, the string patches are utterly fake and the tempo is molasses slow, but all of this, combined with Ka-Spel's dreamy intonations and some wandering, Leslie-coated piano, makes for something utterly unique and fascinating. ""Sabres at Dawn"" is a broken-down carnival ride waiting to maim a child, while ""Touched by the Midnight Sun"" is disquietingly empty, plying only a few sparse drones and some water-like ambience behind Ka-Spel's disembodied zombie sing-speak. The aforementioned closer picks things up at the end, and though its dance beat is a strong one, it's what's going on around it that's really interesting-- these sounds conjure images of clubbers being ripped to tatters by knives, splattering a blender load of distortion and whirring helicopter synths all over everything. When it finally sputters to a halt after 13 minutes of punishment, you'll be ready to come back into the light. It's difficult to say exactly who will like this, aside from those already along for the Dots' freakish ride, and saying, ""you'll either love it or hate it outright,"" though probably true, isn't very helpful. So let me say this: Legendary Pink Dots are a singular musical experience, and if that's worth your money, have a fun trip.","You have to admire a band that just doesn't care at all about fitting in with any current trend ...

Summer at Shatter Creek,Summer at Shatter Creek,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5a4c0084474cd0c077e/1:1/w_160/fa42aa84.jpg,2003-02-26 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7561-summer-at-shatter-creek/,Absolutely Kosher,"Well, my goodness, what a transcendent little album. First, the thing transcends its clunky name. Then it transcends its ""for girls""-ness. Whuh-oh: By that I mean, well... you know what I mean. The way Yoshimi was ""for girls."" And Jeff Buckley. Still good and all, just ""for girls."" That's no diss of lassitude-- in fact, the gender-reference is unfortunate; I was taught (by a girl! whew) that the phrase denotes a semi-precious, self-conscious quality, what proclaimed tuff-girls mean when they announce that they are dressed ""girly."" Compare Leo DiCaprio's eyes when he was a serious young actor with the twinkle-googly eyes of Titanic and the rest, in which he is ""for girls."" Think of the way Conor Oberst poses for pictures, or performs, or does anything except Desaparecidos. And don't act like your scene lacks a contingent of people barely into music, who instead relish, as is their right in this freest of countries, a band's ""hotness"" or ""cuteness."" At some points on this debut, Summer at Shatter Creek is a Jeff Mangum ""for girls,"" especially when songs bust into pageantry/fanfare with the piano-led lonesome cuddliness of march music deprived of its procession. And you know what ""F.G."" film director Summer at Shatter Creek sounds made tailor made for? Wes Anderson. Almost any song on Summer at Shatter Creek could slouch ethereally (however one does that) beside Elliott Smith and Emitt Rhodes on the soundtrack to the upcoming prequel Episode 1: Look Who's Tenenbauming. And dig the album cover's ornate frame of little-kid-type art: a perfect match for Anderson's fetishistic artifice-avalanches under which mature children and immature adults confound each other. Very ""F.G."" By the way, Summer at Shatter Creek is one guy: a Craig Michael Gurwich out of Kalamazoo, Michigan. And you know what else he transcends? That one-guy-band thing. But watch out, Gurwich, because you come very, very close to owing royalties to Dump, the solo project of Yo La Tengo's James McNew, whom you kind of sing like, but sometimes better, and produce like (when Dump is produced) and who also adorns his albums with homegrown ""F.G."" toddler-kitsch a notch beneath Hello Kitty. Another neverlander to whom Gurwich is similar, in terms of tempo, guitar tone, layered elf-vox, and fractured Beatlesiana is: Tobin Sprout. But Gurwich can't be stopped: He's on a rampage of transcendence! Because he also transcends that one-guy-band-that-sounds-like-a-huge-band thing. He's one of the best blends of lo-fi loner and Phil Spector aural huzzahdom I've ever heard. He's a bedroom Bacharach like Badly Drawn Boy, creating songs that trigger decades of pop reference points-- he's Edward Erahands. ""The Essence of Time"" asks what if Pet Sounds was a more psychedelic collaboration between Skip Spence and a Jan & Dean trapped in the phantom zone, burning incense blended with Elephant 6 ashes. ""The Drive"" is a drumless Zombies' ""Time of the Season"" if it were sung by cute zombies. In fact, much of the album suggests a otherworldly and eerie, but cute, Goodwill in which an otherworldly and eerie, but cute, oldies station is being played. Of course, some of the album's just prime indie rock, albeit on the mellow tip. The coed dreampop of ""I Don't Even Miss You"" conjures ""for girls"" classics by Slumberland bands Rocketship and Nord Express. And speaking of slumberland, the disc tellingly thumbs it nose at Wilco and Hayden and other such indulgers by boasting the obligatory lullaby (""Go to Sleep"") as its fourth song. The juh-hamm of ""Home for the Holidays"" is a collision of squeaky-cleanery and Thom Yorke's morbid wail-- imagine a Disney sitcom called Radiohead Meets World. Still more transcendence! The album's best song (""My Neighbor's Having a Seizure"") transcends both the ailment-song and concerned-neighbor-song subgenres, trotting on the victory lap alongside Suzanne Vega's ""Luka"", Dogbowl's ""Growing Up in a Wheelchair"", Joy Division's ""She's Lost Control"", and sometimes Metallica's ""One"". This track best capitalizes on the album's ethic of transmogrification; most of the tunes burp or blossom into expansive second acts, but when ""My Neighbor's Having a Seizure"" does it-- yeeeow. Gurwich goes from sounding like a detached artiste to belting out an ode to symbiotic suffering that reveals, via foil, the vulnerability of its speaker. Insipid lyrics (example: ""When someone makes you feel like you are just shit/ They are not a friend"") and too-long buildups keep the album from galloping into the promised pastures of Eight Point Five Plus, but Summer at Shatter Creek's elegant horses can practically smell that realm's hallowed poop. I predict a long shelflife for this record, but mang, there's so much other stuff on that shelf to choose from...","Well, my goodness, what a transcendent little album.

Maybe he pronounces it ""Kay-Dah,"" or maybe it sounds like ""Kah-Day."" To-may-to or to-mah-to, he's the newest cat on Mike Patton's Ipecac label, and this stateside debut of his is almost beyond words. What the fuck is this Frankensteinian aggregate stitched together from the American pop graveyard?

TweetyBird76: yeah, odd for oddity's sake.
TweetyBird76: so goes Ipecac...i placing in teh 6 range.
HallOatesIII: hah
HallOatesIII: sounds about right to me Be they the disembodied voices of discarded Lou Rawls prototypes, the lost Juanita Rogers, or Brenda Lee's li'l sister, Kaada fidgets and squirms a lot while putting all these samples in a row, grafting them onto some doo-woppy pop art with a palpable Pixie Stix 'n' Pepsi sugar high. That energy can be endearing: When's the last time Conway Twitty sounded as fresh as he does on ""Care""? (Conway Twitty was my very first concert, so I think I can safely say ""never."") ""Mainframe"" reiterates ad infinitum the peculiarly sweet metaphor, ""She is my mainframe,"" and is constructed out of a snippet of soft-dicked 70s funksters Climax, some harmonica, and a tribal pounding of tom and cowbell. It's catchy as fuck, even though there remains a weird plasticness to it all, like showroom dummies come to life to mack on you under the florescent lights of the neighborhood's new Polly Ester's. As queerly enticing is the klezmer clarinet, chord organ, and choppy guitars of ""All Wrong"", which drops a fetching Bee Brothers snippet in with samples of Kaada's previous group, Chloroform All-Scars. ""Black California"" resurrects the onomatopoeias of ""Tutti Frutti"" and ""Surfin' Bird"", but it's not nearly as much mindless fun as it thinks it is. And if you can imagine a miniature Prince claymation figure (well, an inch or two shorter) crawling around your body and screeching out those despicable gospel hollers off his recent albums, you have some idea of the terror within ""Burden"". HallOatesIII: you know, i'm not sure i'm feelin' it

For four minutes at the album's end, this pasty advertising suit grinds the title into your head: two-dimensional, stiff, trying to sell you home insurance and a refinanced mortgage even though you rent a loft space, and his heavy cologne just reeks. So what can I tell you? The disc is hit-or-miss to be sure, and all told, we find Kaada somewhat insincere despite his best-crooned efforts at the hard sale of wackiness, and a bit too eager to please. Of course, some folks might be willing to look past that if these kinds of pastiches are up their alley, but this type of release not being particularly rare, I'd suggest you get your fix somewhere else.","I've had this Norwegian editor for nearly five years now, and I'm still not sure I can either ...

Life's a gas
I hope it's gonna last""
--Marc Bolan, ""Life's a Gas"" Just before Marc Bolan was killed in a car crash in 1977, he seemed on the cusp of an artistic and commercial resurgence. His death marked one more lost opportunity in a career studded with them. He was the decade's first superstar in Britain, but he never hit it off with America, due in part to a stateside inability to comprehend camp, and in part to Bolan's own carelessness. Just as the support of his native audience was wavering, his ego burst from the pressures of fame and increasing drug abuse. He had missed his chance, and never got another. His few Yankee fans worried that the man unfairly derided as bubblegum by prog-leaning audiences and DJs would have his vital contributions reduced to his lone U.S. hit, filed next to Wild Cherry in the stacks. And with the exception of a devoted cult, that's exactly how the States still see him. Leave it to the saints at Rhino Records to preserve yet another precious slice of our musical heritage. They've now reissued T.Rex's Electric Warrior, the first and best of a trio of brilliant albums. Its two successors-- The Slider (1972) and Tanx (1973)-- have nearly vanished from music shops, and with a comprehensive best-of collection now available, Electric Warrior seemed destined to follow them into the void. Thankfully, this catastrophe has been averted: Bolan may have been known for his singles, but his albums-- and this one in particular-- deserve to be heard in their entirety. For those hunting down the singles, Electric Warrior does contain the immortal ""Bang a Gong (Get it On)"", but that's neither the only nor the best reason to pick it up. What makes this record so enduring is its almost accidental emotional depth: When T.Rex is kicking out the jams, they sound like they're having the most gleeful, absurd good time ever committed to wax. There's nothing so glorious in rock and roll as hearing Bolan croon, ""Just like a car, you're pleasing to behold/ I'll call you Jaguar if I may be so bold,"" over his namesake boogie. The most significant aspect of Electric Warrior isn't its arena rock confidence; it's that Bolan allows his grinning mask to slip. With the incomparable aid of producer Tony Visconti, Bolan sketches a vast, empty room, where, after the party's over, he resides alone, wide-eyed and desperate. On ballads like ""Cosmic Dancer"", ""Monolith"" and ""Girl"", he speaks in the same gibberish as elsewhere, but he's clearly haunted-- by what we can't say. But the gaping, searing question mark that comes at the conclusion of the album-- guitar feedback paired with a string section, holding a shivering and very ambivalent cluster of notes-- is just one of many clues that there's more to Electric Warrior than its surface lets on. This is not simply a man who plays party songs because he wants to: This is a man who plays party songs to fend off darkness. For this reissue, Rhino remastered the original tapes and added seven bonus tracks (six songs and an interview). The updated sound is a modest improvement over the first-generation CD, but no news is good news, recalling those hotly contested Iggy Pop and Velvet Underground remasters. Though the sound could've been polished more, it's most important that the production hasn't been inflated. Electric Warrior wouldn't be the same album with the meaty tone of The Slider, with all its shadows and doubt chased away or ignored. The bonus tracks range from decent to very good: ""Raw Ramp"" stands out for the lurid line, ""Woman, I love your chests/ Baby, I'm crazy 'bout your breasts,"" but none of them are as revealing as the interview, during which a thoughtful Bolan reveals that the album was a self-conscious attempt to win the attention of America. And because he had precious little time to accomplish everything he wanted to, there was a sense of urgency, that if he was ever going to take over the States, he had to do it immediately. It's a devastating interview, considering how his ambitions deteriorated into addiction soon after, but it offers keen insight into Bolan's mindset at that moment when he seemed poised to finally conquer the entire world. In fact, what makes Rhino's reissue wonderful is that it reminds us of that excitement with its every detail, presenting Electric Warrior to U.S. shores with the love and fanfare it always deserved but never received. It's bittersweet adulation for a tragically lost hero, but as the saying goes, better late than never.","""It really doesn't matter at all

Give Peas a Chance,Various Artists,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7735e6ef95969320fa5/1:1/w_160/566dea1d.jpg,2003-02-25 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1866-give-peas-a-chance/,Crippled Dick Hot Wax,"Something about television music makes it super music. I'm not talking about theme songs, but the ""background"" music most people barely realize is there. The composers of cop show chase tunes and ad jingles have to make everything come together in less time and with greater impact than even the most immediate pop. Furthermore, they have to make their presence known behind huge explosions and back alley shenanigans without jumping so far out front that their stuff detracts from the scene. It's a catch 22, you see, and the best TV music often betrays its supporting role by being eminently listenable beyond the big black box-- not that most people are running out to buy the Love Boat soundtrack. German rare grooves label Crippled Dick Hot Wax has made a point to dig up some of the finest in European media gloss from the 60s and 70s, making the case that maybe I've overlooked a musical goldmine on TV all these years. Similar to other CDHW comps (Popshopping, Beretta 70, Beat at Cinecitta, etc.), Give Peas a Chance, which focuses on German crime dramas and action sequence blare, seems most obviously targeted to DJs always on the hunt for a new break-- not that putting them out on an internationally marketed CD is a good way to protect their obscurity. The other part of the demographic would be a space-age pop crowd who isn't satisfied with only one Stereolab record every year, especially now that the whole campy lounge craze has died down. However, most of this music is good for any slightly off-center chill, and at the very least is better than watching old Columbo episodes. The bulk of the compilation features funky, jazz-informed jams from the 70s (though the music ranges for the 60s to the 90s). British composer (and former Olivia Newton-John bandleader, major plus) Alan Hawkshaw contributes two of the best tunes with ""Troubleshoot Vol. 2"" and the slick, Head Hunters-style funk of ""Name of the Game"". The latter track lays down a patented Barney Miller drum/bass groove over which the Fender Rhodes (greatest instrument of the 70s) drops solo breaks the likes of which should not have been possible outside of Harlem. And, oh yes, there are slinky porno strings. Lots of them. It's an old-school slice of fuzz-funk that trumps Guy Ritchie's entire career. Elsewhere is George Fenton and Ken Freeman's synth-heavy 80s track ""Mobil Unit"", which makes me nostalgic for Miami Vice even though I never watched it. Fred Berlipp's ""Crime in Beat"" is classic Dragnet-style shimmy-groove-- the kind that makes modern interpreters of this genre like John Zorn's Naked City seem all too mechanical in comparison. The overdriven ""Good Company"", with big band horns, strings, clavinet, tympanis and a solo 12-string guitar turns what was probably a run-of-the-mill chase scene into symphonic grandeur with a beat. It goes without saying that not every track is essential, and I'm a little confused as to why two new Freddy Gigele (one of the most active soundtrack composers in Germany today) pieces were included: They're good throwbacks to the era in which most of the other tunes were made, but stand out like digital sore thumbs. Also, some of the tunes tend to lapse into novelty, like the campy take on Middle Eastern music of Dieter Reith's ""Arabia"". But as a whole, it's not a bad way to get a party started.

La Nouvelle Pauvret√©,Jan Jelinek Avec the Exposures,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9e5eb335119a49ec8cd/1:1/w_160/04740bdd.jpg,2003-02-25 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4235-la-nouvelle-pauvrete/,~scape,"Every musician wants his own sound. I would imagine that in electronic music, the desire to carve a unique sonic identity into the endless wall of digital possibilities is even stronger. Simply put, with the amount of music being produced today, it's difficult to stand out, and the number of people who have created a distinct musical fingerprint in the last few years is relatively small. You can always tell Pole when you hear him (although, judging by his new EP, that's about to change). Same goes for Boards of Canada, Gas, Drexciya, and Aphex Twin. And way up on that list of laptoppers with an immediately identifiable sound is Jan Jelinek. Whether he's recording as Farben, Gramm, or under his own name, Jelinek always jumps out of the speakers. I reckon the laptop set has roughly equal access to all the sound design and processing software out there, but Jelinek is doing things with his programs that other artists haven't considered. He has an almost preternatural ability to burrow inside glitches and surface noise and emerge with the emotional heart of the sound. His fondness for jazz, which becomes more apparent with each record, is not a love of live improvisation, despite his recent Computer Soup collaboration's indications to the contrary; it's a love for the stacks of dusty, grimy, crackly vinyl artifacts of the post-bop era, a record collector's view of jazz history. One imagines Jelinek getting chills from a chewed-up copy of some late 60s combo featuring electric piano, that something in the hisses, pops and wavering tone of an unsteady turntable must have touched his soul. Jelinek's record referencing continues with La Nouvelle Pauvret√©, his follow-up to 2001's Loop-finding-jazz-records after last year's Textstar, a stunning collection of Farben EPs. (Jelinek's addition of the fictional ""Exposures"" finds him indulging in the dry German humor shared by Atom Heart and Burnt Friedman.) The record begins with the two-minute ""Introducing"", a gradually swelling gurgle of dread that ends abruptly with the sound of applause, and then ""Music to Interrogate By"" quickly drops into a groove. It's a classic Jelinek track in a housey, Farben-esque vein, driven by an acoustic bass riff, sampled ride cymbals, and a spacey electric piano melody. On the one hand, it almost seems as though a band could be playing, but Jelinek has a way of distorting the sonic signifiers in a way that makes you unsure of exactly what you're hearing. The mix is weird-- odd pops seem to bump the instruments aside, and the acoustic space just doesn't seem of this earth. The applause that starts the track reappears twice, at the end of what could be considered ""solos."" It's a brilliant and funny device, suggesting with a wink that ""Music to Interrogate By"" is the work of some band working a Village Vanguard in a parallel universe. When I listened to La Nouvelle Pauvret√© for the first time, halfway through ""Music to Interrogate By"", I decided that this was my album of the year. This was premature, though, as the rest of the record, while still very strong, doesn't make my jaw drop like that second track. What the album is, though, is a surprisingly varied work, incorporating new sounds and elements while remaining identifiably Jelinek. He's clearly experimenting, trying to figure out how to build on his already considerable accomplishments, and more often than not he succeeds. The most noticeable addition here is Jelinek's voice, which appears in some form on about half the tracks. ""Facelift"" features an oddly processed doubled vocal, an octave apart, mumbling something I can't quite understand. Underneath are a series of metallic taps, some clicks, and a deceptively funky acoustic bass. ""There Are Other Worlds (They Have Not Told You Of)"" has Jelinek sculpting feedback in a tuned, rhythmic drone as his dark vocals intone the title, singing this time. It's actually quite effective and borders on great-- if Coil invented gothic glitch, Jelinek brings it into the 21st Century. ""Trust the Words of Stevie"" is less successful, with Jelinek deadpanning, ""Do I love you/ I swear I do,"" in a kind of pseudo-soul loverman voice that doesn't quite work as either parody or the real thing, even if the backing music is typically fantastic. Two more standout instrumentals ensure La Nouvelle Pauvret√©'s greatness. ""If's, And's and But's"" uses some primo 70s soul samples-- primarily some disco strings, flute and an electric bass-- that Jelinek shapes into a nimble, bubbly pattern. The sublime ""Davos S (Trio 'Round Midnight)"" employs guitar samples to construct an homage to the gentle, reflective jazz of someone like Jim Hall. There are more odd string samples, which, when combined with drum programming that sounds like a digital ghost of a bongo, turns the piece into a Lynchian dream of the 50s West Coast sound. La Nouvelle Pauvret√© is not a perfect album and doesn't poke its head out quite the way either Loop-finding-jazz-records or Textstar did, but I'm glad to hear Jelinek shuffling the deck a bit. His conception of sound, which is one of the most breathtakingly original and creative going, also proves itself to be robust and adaptable to experiment.","Every musician wants his own sound.

Odds and Ends,Akio Suzuki,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5e95e6ef95969320bf0/1:1/w_160/e736eff8.gif,2003-02-25 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7639-odds-and-ends/,H√∂ren,"Akio Suzuki has been making earthy yet ethereal sounds for over four decades now, all quietly emanating from the Japanese countryside. Born in 1941, he's made outdoor sound the focus of his career, constructing installations that transcend space and time, turning the outside world into a lucid daydream. In 1997, Suzuki analyzed the French town Enghien-Les-Bains, precisely mapping out (with footsteps) areas where echoes were most resonant. He built a simple concrete enclosure on the banks of their lake, designed to eliminate vision but maximize sound, a natural sensory amplifier with disorienting, very Zen implications. Barely available on record, some of Suzuki's experiments are finally captured on this two-disc compendium available from H√∂ren (most readily available in the US from Forced Exposure). Most pieces grow out of wind-swept silence, sometimes gathering the force to transform into typhoons of feedback (see ""Howling Objects""), but most of this sound barely brushes across the leaves, turning all into Aeolian harps. ""Analapos '70"", named after an instrument Suzuki built himself, echoes like Watazumido Shuso's bamboo flute drawing its breath through Aphex Twin's ambient hull, an aural free fall that lets the body blow about, weightless. As Jim O'Rourke nicely put it, Suzuki's music ""reminds us that we don't need to rush to feel alive, don't need to 'be somewhere' in the next 15 minutes, because we're already 'there', all you have to do is listen."" ""Drumming"" builds to incomprehension, as incessant waterfalls on a hand drum cascade beyond any rhythmic pattern. The birds and glass tubes of ""Ha Go Ro Mo"" float between a Pygmy lukembi, Tibetan prayer bowl, and Javanese gamelan, vibrations somehow disembodied from any obvious geography. Most peculiar on the double-disc set is ""Plate Juggling"", an archived performance from 1984. Set up for lock grooves on three record players, Suzuki's sounds at times approximate ducks on a pond, kazoos, and Tuvan throat singers. As these odd bursts of quacks and skronks build, the audience's unmitigated laughter becomes yet another source, finding its place among the inimitable noises. At turns minimal and maddening, this piece makes for a most singular listening experience, drastically altering concepts of what can be made from such grating sounds. Suzuki's unadorned sense of play has been cause for admiration: O'Rourke, David Toop, and Eye from Boredoms all sound off in wonderment of what he's capable of creating from such nondescript items. To simply suggest that Suzuki makes incredible soundscapes out of sun-baked brick echo chambers, elongated springs, looping records, rocks, or empty beer bottles is to falsely convey that he's somehow distinct from these objects. As ancient scribe Tzu-ch'I put it: ""Blowing on the ten thousand things in a different way, so that each can be itself-- all take what they want for themselves, but who does the sounding?""","Akio Suzuki has been making earthy yet ethereal sounds for over four decades now, all quietly\n\ emanating from the ...

Beauty Party,Majesticons,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c374ea9e61561daa7f0a/1:1/w_160/134a596f.jpg,2003-02-25 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5050-beauty-party/,Ninja TuneBig Dada,"You wouldn't play a death knell at a sock hop, would ya? Well, for the past two or three years, that seems to have been the modus operandi of much underground hip-hop. While the beats of the mainstream have become progressively more dance-oriented (and have, in many cases, even incorporated some refreshing experimentalism), the beats of the underground have grown more defiantly straightforward and dance-hostile. Those of us who love a snappy club burner but despise the insipidness of gangsta-bling lyrics have been forced to suck it up and just pray the DJ mixes some Aesop Rock vocals with a little Miami booty crunk. But along comes NYC concept junkie Mike Ladd, the sole perpetrator behind The Majesticons and The Infesticons, two fictitious, rival hip-hop groups whose records have included guest spots from EL-P, Saul Williams, and Priest and Beans of Antipop Consortium. The short story: The Infesticons represent for the underground; The Majesticons rep the mainstream; both are entangled in a perpetual, futuristic battle of wits for the ultimate prize: TOTAL CONTROL OF HIP-HOP'S FUTURE. Beauty Party, the latest chapter in this ongoing saga, sees The Majesticons at the height of commercial dominance, having gained notoriety and risen to prominence in previous installments. With so much ""access to excess"", they go mad with their wealth, buying up every material possession imaginable. The joke is that they've transformed from hard street thugs rocking diamond-encrusted caps into full-blown yuppies. It's a great parody, but what's greater is that it's not just satire for its own sake; it's an excuse for Ladd to pile on platinum-shiny beats, scorching robotic tweak, and aggro-maniacal bling. ""Brains Party"" sees Ladd appropriating the chorus to a Pet Shop Boys song, Puffy-style: ""I got the brains/ You got the looks/ Let's make lots of money/ We are the game/ We are the crooks/ Let's take all their money."" ""Platinum BlaQue Party"" is a breezed-up, cocoa-buttered R&B; humper: ""Spellman lady friend and lesbian m√©nage a trois/ With a Wellesley friend, carafes of wine, la-day-da!"" And as usual, an all-star ensemble of guests fills out the record. When El-P, with Can Ox's Vast Aire in tow, rhymes, ""All y'all dealing with virtual money/ Shit, I wipe my ass with a twenty"" on ""Suburb Party"", the hilarity is pretty much beyond description. Beauty Party's got more one-liners than a night at the Apollo, but beyond the overlying humor, the record drives home a point by making a compelling argument against dogmatism and materialism, and addressing issues of class and value systems, and their impact on hip-hop culture. ""Pirahna Party"" illustrates the devouring conundrum of gentrification: ""We got the stocks/ We got the banks/ You keep the glocks/ We want the docks/ You keep the shanks/ We got the tanks/ We keep the goods/ We subvert the hood/ We buy you out/ Or kick you out/ Tear down your house/ Tear down the blocks/ Those mom and pops."" Through satire, Ladd has created a perfect amalgamation of underground and mainstream hip-hop. Beauty Party possesses an intelligent, cutting consciousness, and its club-consumability will allow that to reach far more people than if he'd just rapped some ""fuck the machine"" rhyme over a dragging, think-rap tempo. That these two seemingly disparate styles work so well together might strike some as a bit ironic, but it proves that if these warring factions can balance their diametrical opposition, they might discover a medium not just happy but straight-up blissful.","You wouldn't play a death knell at a sock hop, would ya?

European Onion,Pluxus,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0b7b1335d7bf16980a5/1:1/w_160/48ea99cf.jpg,2003-02-24 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6359-european-onion/,Rocket Girl,"Every so often, we music freaks have to fight through some tough aesthetics-- extremes of noise or kitsch, or eccentric or garble-throated singers. For some of us, just getting into country music was a struggle. But Pluxus is hard to take in a different way: Most of European Onion sounds just like an old video game (say, Super Mario Brothers for the 8-bit NES. The bleeps and bips can make this grating, the same way you wouldn't run out to buy a record of traffic noise or alarm clock sounds. If it doesn't bother you, the results can be charming, but don't say you weren't warned. This Swedish four-piece employs only synths and tinny drum machines, with a couple of vocal snippets thrown in for accent. The beeping, bloop-heavy music has a robotic beat and a disturbingly repetitive cheerfulness, as it chirps the same tune over and over. None of the tracks last very long, but just like a video game soundtrack they seem to go on forever, with insistent rhythms and bitmapped, digital rainbow flourishes. Let's say you don't mind that sound. Pluxus are often lumped in with electronica and IDM mainstays, but they call their music ""electronic pop,"" which is a less pretentious and more accurate description. Generally more ornate and less eclectic than their earlier work, European Onion is concise and melodic, with multiple sections weaving together into a marvel of twee songform. ""R√∂dval, Bl√•val"" (the opener) and the hyper-ecstatic ""Agent Tangent""-- which toots along like the theme for a marathon run by six-inch-tall people-- are the strongest examples, with infectiously bright, multilayered keyboards far more colorful than you'd expect from such a limited palette. The less piercing tracks-- ""Dagsmeja"" and ""Moni""-- are nice breaks into gentler, more standard IDM modes, switching to softer tones and background synth washes. For all the punchy melodies, Pluxus also try to take a plaintive tone on the somewhat nostalgic ""Ig√•r"" and the truly melancholy ""Molltolerans"". Still, it's about as suspenseful as watching someone else play your favorite game: ""Get the power-up! Jump over those mushrooms-- save the princess!"" Pluxus are more convincing when upbeat, when you can picture the bunch of them ' huddled around, drunk on technology, hammering out the most nauseatingly chipper music imaginable.

Eurotechno,Stakker,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a53b9d034d5c69bf325d/1:1/w_160/cdabb3d5.jpg,2003-02-24 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7457-eurotechno/,Rephlex,"For about thirty seconds in the mid-90s, the most interesting groups working in the electronica field were The Orb, Orbital, and the decidedly non-circular Future Sound of London. Gobbling up ethnicities and new technologies like handfuls of x-tabs, FSOL even hyped the ISDN by releasing an album created completely by way of the burgeoning young network, amalgamating odd strains of organic matter with digital detritus. But after Dead Cities, the techno game morphed out from under them, and the duo disappeared until their slight re-emergence with last year's Floyd-nostalgic The Isness. Taking the ancient paradox of ""child is the father to the man"" to the Braindance man-child scene, this EP is future-FSOLer Brian Dougans' earliest work from the incipient, hedonistically heady times in the early days of Madchester. Lost in the acidic mix of time, it's now come back around, on a label inspired by this self-same piece of music, Richard James' own Rephlex label. Created entirely on the Roland TB 303 (the bedrock for acid house noise squiggle and bump) way back in 1989, Dougans synched up with video artist Mark McLean for the influential Stakker video, one of the first visual projects to come out of the British electronic scene. An eye-candy standard for early raves and acid culture happenings (until co-opted into an epileptic-inducing advert), it was a massive statement as to the audio-visual possibilities of the new music, cutting and pasting at a pace that would drive even Brion Gysin dizzy. This isn't the first time Rephlex has reached into its head of halcyon flashbacks to pull forth a primordial, pre-computerized gem of pure acid ferociousness-- remember, they also reissued 808 State's Newbuild a couple years back. But even that resurrection couldn't match the speed of ideas at work here. The emergency-level frequencies quickly distort into a driving four-on-the-floor stomp, undergoing permutations with a particularly harsh powertools buzz cutting all around it, even as the beat cools into something a bit more classic after a minute's length. The frenzy of clashing sounds recalls Carl Stalling cartoons, going for the most absurd squiggles, rubbery yanks, and rhythmic juxtapositions possible within the different patches of synth sound and editing capabilities. The core of the soundtrack lies between tracks 7-10, which are the longest by far at roughly two minutes apiece. The droning of the keyboards is metallic, as if sparks are spraying off the grooves, while the machine beats chug on unabated. Track 9 has a very sharp twinkling of panned crystals while the 303 squirts basso profundo underneath, creating a curious ambiance that would become the M.O. of Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works Vol. II. Track 10 has the jet stream bubbles and processed voices that were crucial to the early 808 State sound, too. Twenty-one tracks go supersonic in just under twenty-five minutes, eradicating any recognizable patterns or large cogs of beat after more than a brief appearance. This attention span deficiency is the most telling influence on present-day activities by folks like Aphex Twin, Bogdan Raczynski, or Squarepusher, who can't keep still on a beat for more than a few seconds. Either as a history lesson through the classic Acid noises of a decade back, or as just a good ol' mix, Eurotechno is still quite quick and efficient work, even for a time machine.","For about thirty seconds in the mid-90s, the most interesting groups working in the electronica field were The Orb, Orbital ...

Life on Other Planets,Supergrass,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5dcc0084474cd0c0808/1:1/w_160/eb6427ca.jpg,2003-02-24 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7624-life-on-other-planets/,Island,"Supergrass have always offered a pretty fresh take on the grand traditions of UK rock (big guitars, big melodies, sly humor, caricatured self-confidence), from their early days as three-chord ruffians, to their brilliant sophomore effort In It for the Money, to the Stonesy swagger of their self-titled third album. Their fourth, Life on Other Planets, is a 40-minute tour of 70s British rock, but more to the point, it's a summary of Supergrass' own career, merging all of the band's many mutations into one decisive sound, for better or worse. On the one hand, there's an abundance of energy and some great songwriting; on the other, there's less focus here than on either of their previous two releases. This is clear from the outset, when the disc opens with a brief BBC-ish synth intro (could have fallen out of the back pocket of Rick Wakeman's flared, embroidered hip huggers, for all I know), before launching into the flashy, piano-pinned strut of ""Za"", a traditional Supergrass rocker stuffed with big, crashing Mick Ronson riffage, but backed by strange, wordless vocals. From there, we smash headfirst into ""Rush Hour Soul"", an unpredicted blast of musclebound guitar and thunderfingered bass with heavy eyeliner and a sequined jean jacket, before being faced with ""Seen the Light"", which features a questionable Elvis impression on the hapless line, ""I'm a rock 'n' roll singer in a rock 'n' roll band,"" compensated for with a great melody. So far, we've got a handful of strong showings from the shag-headed Londoners, and no actual cohesion. Then again, stability can only count for so much when tracks like the full-throttle murder melodrama of ""Brecon Beacons"" and the Moog-slathered ""Grace"", with a melody sticker than a sun-melted Baby Ruth, come bursting from the fray. Ahh, if only the whole album were that consistent. The thing is, their 100%-of-everything approach has its drawbacks, and nowhere is this more clearly evident than on ""Evening of the Day"", which-- though it nails a perfect balance between Small Faces-style Brit-rock and straight-up B.B. King blues-- isn't all that engaging, content to devolve into a kind of aimless music hall thing that sounds like it was recorded several beers after tipsy. Elsewhere, ""Never Done Nothing Like That Before"" marinates the Swell Maps in ""Strawberry Fields"" Mellotron, but what could be sonically interesting instead annoys in the context of a song whose vocals are contemptibly forgettable and whose lyrics regard ""blowing chunks."" ""The Funniest Thing"" has some subversively catchy, dark grooves in its verses, but the song's form is all over the place, and never gels into anything remotely memorable. But Life on Other Planets brings it back together at the end for the closer, ""Run"", whose glossy harmonies and squiggly effects pick up on the spacier bits of the 1970s and squash them into a glowing, noise-addled coda fitting for an album that spends most of its time burning energy with reckless abandon. And all told, the record's a fine supplement to the 70s, for those times when you just want it all in one place. Once the mild frustration with certain tracks subsides and you're strapped in, Supergrass deliver far better than expected eight years into their career. Which all goes to show that just because you've got nearly a decade into the Britpop game doesn't mean you have to go stale. Right, Suede?","Supergrass have always offered a pretty fresh take on the grand traditions of UK rock (big guitars, big melodies, sly ...

Holy Shit. I just can't avoid imagining the smug looks of self-satisfaction on the face of whoever okayed this. How droll! Nothing says ""cut loose"" like a faint attempt at wordplay, after all. Presumably, the intent here is to be clever through a contradiction produced through the combination of a mandate to have fun and punctuated restraint. The problem is, it's neither clever nor amusing. Instead, this cunningly summarizes everything that's wrong with Fontanelle, Style Drift, and the rapidly decaying post-rock genre itself; the music purports to entertain, but when it truly comes time to pony up the ""fun"", it generally fails to produce anything beyond cerebral bemusement. To all you turtlenecked purveyors of aural brainteasers: Music needs not only a mind, but a heart. Fontanelle have clearly not thought this through. They've given us three releases (two full-length) in as many years, and the only thing that's really changed is that each one has become progressively colder than the last. For Style Drift, they play up the electrofunk angle a little more than on 2001's F., but ultimately this is nothing more than yet another excursion into frigid, uncomfortably sparse arrangements of synth-driven jazz. Teflon-coated keyboard improvs and anemic percussion are the emotionally vacant core of Fontanelle's work; too fragile to embrace, too slippery to hold, and forever out of reach. Every snare hit, every note of this album is calculated, precise, and entirely soulless, like some terrifying, fusion jazz Terminator. I'm tempted to cite ""Red Light, Green Light"" as a sole exception, but it's not an easy call. On one hand, the delicate keys and wobbly, wah-wah guitarwork show signs of a pulse early on; for a moment, if you close your eyes, you can almost imagine flesh-and-blood people operating the instruments. But on the other hand, it's difficult to shake the impression that it's only an illusion created through comparison with the other tracks, just as if a coma patient were compared to a corpse. In the end, not even that flattering contrast will result in anything worth recommending here. Once again, Fontanelle prove to be long on technique and short on the emotion necessary to move their audience, and that's the real tragedy. When it comes to ability, these guys clearly have detailed files, but it's a shame to see it wasted on little more than technical exercises. Every time a new Fontanelle record comes out, I keep wondering if it'll finally be the album where they actually sound like they care about what they're playing more than how they're playing. Nope, this one, either.","It's a difficult thing for a band to accurately reflect the measure of their work in song titles alone ...

ABC DEF,Nathan Michel,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c4565e6ef95969323a2e/1:1/w_160/ef37bba7.jpg,2003-02-23 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5262-abc-def/,Tigerbeat6,"There are two types of Moms in the world: The kind that took all your Star Wars figures, your He-Man Snake Mountain playset and that plastic guitar by Tiger and shipped them off to the Goodwill in cardboard boxes; and the kind that took all those little plastic chunks of your childhood and entombed them in the attic, where they sit waiting for a boring snow day or a summer of unemployment to be rediscovered and put back into use. With all of the plastic Casio beats, Master System interludes and chirping electric knick-knacks floating in the nostalgic soup that is ABC DEF, it seems pretty obvious that Nathan Michel's mom falls into the latter category. You can almost see her hanging his spelling tests on the fridge. There's not a slide whistle or battery-powered keyboard or Rock'em Sock'em robot that hasn't been brought along for Michel's long imaginary drive through the broken-glass crystal city of pre-pubescence: Plastic recorders whimper, lonely video games repeat their Boss Level tunes in a desperate bid for attention, and tin toys of every stripe and temperament lose their shit, filling the play room with the rusty click-clack of brass keys slowly grinding down to a halt. This isn't group play-- make no mistake-- but rather an intense session of (presumably) dextromethorphan-fueled make-believe for Michel and the monsters in his closet. And just like any other intensely private childhood game, the rules of this one are almost incomprehensible to any of us other kids who wandered in late. It's trying to play Calvinball with an autistic chess prodigy. The framework of ABC DEF, whose title suggests a much more robust and beat-conscious affair, is fairly simple and without much variation: an abyss of fragmented loops, sometimes as devolved as a dime store Indian drum, layered with various random patterns of everything from electric acoustic guitar and acid-soaked xylophone (""Pound Louder"") to the fluctuations of walkie-talkie frequencies backed by scrambled-egg organs (""Thirty Six to Forty Two""). The composition technique here is extremely randomized and discordant in some places, more consistent and even catchy in others; ""Untitled"" remains anonymous probably because it shares an ear with Team Doyobi and even Phoenecia for sublimely sick rhythms crafted from decimated analog clicks and burps, interrupted by a tense melody right out of Kangaroo. And the sorrowful atmosphere generated by the faded Casio beat of ""Hello (Constant Sorrow)"" is as tender as it is cardboard-worthy. This is the senior year soundtrack for the love-struck kids at Nintendo High, but it starts the album off with a misleading message. The majority of ABC DEF is not a big slumber party, but rather the story of one kid alone in his room, under the covers with a flashlight, plagued by a head cold and too much cough syrup. Some fascinating ideas spill out from Nathan Michel's fevered dreams, fully formed (the anthill micro-rave of ""Mufice"") and brief (the telephone coma that wraps itself around ""Hosey""), but introverted fantasies like this are going to take four years of art school and some heavy drinking to make sense of. But then again, maybe some kids were just meant to play alone.","There are two types of Moms in the world: The kind that took all your Star Wars figures, your He-Man ...

Feast of Wire,Calexico,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4d413d1975652138ddf/1:1/w_160/9fba7314.jpg,2003-02-23 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1230-feast-of-wire/,Touch and GoQuarterstick,"Calexico have always been restless experimenters, juxtaposers and journeymen, crafting a unique fusion of bluesy Mariachi, desert-rock and jazz, and injecting healthy doses of experimentation into the otherwise straightforward records on which they've made guest appearances. Yet, for their innovation and distinctive sound, their albums have always had their weak spots-- moments in which their ideas seemed to be running away with the band's ability to execute them. That time has passed. All of Calexico's previous strengths come home to roost on Feast of Wire, the band pushing their experiments further than ever before and pulling each of them off unfalteringly. In short, Calexico have created their first genuinely masterful full-length, crammed with immediate songcraft, shifting moods and open-ended exploration. A brief acoustic guitar figure and pounding waltz beat open things at a crisp gait. Joey Burns quickly intones with the lines, ""Washed my face in the rivers of empire/ Made my bed with a cardboard crate,"" immediately establishing the tension of the borderline that pulls Calexico's music in its many directions. Burns is suddenly a singer-- he's always made do with what he had, but the limitations that were once so apparent have developed into a strong and confident tenor, assertive and emotive. The music behind him feels bolder and more courageous, too, as the veil of obscurity that guarded so much of their previous releases has vanished. The detail of this album is utterly stunning, as melodies rise against countermelodies, subtle electronic processing seals guitars in amber, and instruments blend in fascinating and unpredictable ways. The band keeps things tight and concise across sixteen tracks, and John Convertino's drums corral the rush of sound into all the right spaces, pushing the steel guitar motifs that color the background of ""Quattro (World Drifts In)"" up to meet Burns' vocals and beating back the bombastic strings that cascade over ""Black Heart"" like a desert thunderstorm. ""Not Even Stevie Nicks"" is pristine pop that makes me wish Burns would find more occasions to use his falsetto. It also makes me wish he'd print his lyrics, even if lines like, ""With a head like a vulture and a heart full of hornets/ He drives off the cliff into the blue,"" convey such a rush of emotions that they virtually fill in the blanks by themselves. He's still full of border stories, too, with narratives like ""Across the Wire"" packing up tales of dodging the border patrol and leaving everything you know for the abstraction of hope. ""Woven Birds"" is a hushed reverie for an abandoned mission that even the swallows have left to the ghosts, building to spine-tingling moments where the vocals, Melodica and vibes all meet on the same note and coalesce into a single sound. The piano and strings of ""The Book and the Canal"" serve as a moody pivot into the album's mostly instrumental second half, though the darkness of that piece is largely swept aside by ""Attack El Robot! Attack!"", which mashes Pharaoh Sanders, Portuguese guitar and German IDM into a beautiful stew of sci-fi strangeness. ""Dub Latina"" and ""Crumble"" show Calexico burrowing deeper into jazz than ever before, with the latter featuring fluid guitar, trombone and trumpet solos squaring off against each other over a white-hot groove. ""G√ºero Canelo"" is a curious flamenco strut built around what sounds like a distorted Speak-n-Spell sample and sliding sound effects, while ""Whipping the Horse's Eyes"" and the closer, ""No Doze"", each examine big skies and desert stillness-- one with steel guitar and bowed bass, the other with bowed vibes, nylon strings, static, percussion and steel. Burns is back to a whisper on the closer, but here it strikes as though he's trying not to wake someone sleeping in the room rather than shielding the listener from his limitations. Calexico have always threatened to make a spectacular record, and even came close on 1998's The Black Light, but having spent the last three years honing their skills has paid off for them in ways no one could have predicted. Feast of Wire calls on a stunning, finely kept arsenal of genres, textures and images to transport you to the Southwest's forgotten places and put you in the shoes of the people who stare across the border in both directions. It is the album we always knew they had in them but feared they would never make.","Calexico have always been restless experimenters, juxtaposers and journeymen, crafting a unique fusion of\n\ bluesy Mariachi, desert-rock and jazz ...

Greatest Hits,Screamer,by: Brian James,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a29d9d034d5c69bf2c3e/1:1/w_160/19269b83.gif,2003-02-23 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7036-greatest-hits/,Teenbeat,"One night in 1979, a young man soon to be known to the world only as The Screamer called in to a local talk radio show and, halfway through his quite ordinary comment, yelled ""SCUM!"" The host, perplexed, hung up. Moments later, a young man in cahoots called and, halfway through his equally ordinary comment, also yelled ""SCUM!"" Thus was the career of The Screamer born. Over the next fourteen years, he continued to refine his practice, quickly abandoning the Dadaist approach of his early days and moving on to a more evolved style, at one point calling in to a Pro-Life program to testify to the pain of abortion with his tale of being an aborted child. Now, his greatest hits have been collected and released by TeenBeat so that anyone who didn't sift through hours of routine talk radio in the Washington D.C. area during the golden years leading up to 1993 can hear what was going on in condensed form. The Screamer's body of work stands today as a sometimes boring, sometimes hilarious, always compulsive piece of folk art. In repressive suburbia, there always appear signs that the teenaged members of the clan are not as enchanted with the idea of settling down into an utterly normal, regulated existence, but usually, the results are a few smashed mailboxes and a lot more smashed high schoolers. Perhaps different strains of destructive urges might converge, causing local teens to take their empty liquor bottles and throw them at cars as they pass by. But there is no art, no imagination, no bracing adolescent poetry to any of this. Not so with The Screamer. Greatest Hits shows him dipping fingers, toes, and even naughtier appendages into the stream of bland regularity so as to divert it just a little bit and test out his power to oppose the monolith that drives so many other youngsters to illicit sex and drugs. Perhaps The Screamer couldn't get his sweaty hands on either of those, but if this was ever cause for complaint with him, it's certainly not for those able to hear his calls today. While guardians of the old artistic order constantly complain about the stultifying effect of our whirring electronic media, The Screamer proved (as did many of his fresh-faced cohorts, liberated from the shackles of tradition) that you can take any medium, no matter how apparently vapid, and turn it into something great with only creativity and a will to subvert. Which is what makes Greatest Hits an enjoyable listen even when the jokes fall flat, which they occasionally do. To hear the hosts sputter as The Screamer trips them up, or to listen as they rant with excessive hyperbole about the immaturity, stupidity, even insanity of their assailant is to be informed of the fact that this little brat had done some real damage, that beyond just entertaining his small cabal of admirers, he was also reaching beyond the station appointed to him by society. While picking up a phone may not have been as glamorous as picking up a guitar in the late 70s, it was just as punk, and if the humor on Greatest Hits sometimes grows monotonous, well, so did the music of The Damned, and you forgave them, didn't you?","One night in 1979, a young man soon to be known to the world only as The Screamer called in ...

Op.,Ryoji Ikeda,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1b25e6ef9596932374b/1:1/w_160/3ff5784d.jpg,2003-02-23 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4070-op/,Touch,"Recently, the mouse problem at my apartment has gotten out of control. They run up the walls and crawl into my bird's cage to eat seeds, nibble through unopened loaves of Orowheat, and most heinous of all, they ate out the crotch of my roommate's old panties. Forgoing all the glue traps and classic spring-loaded devices, we opted instead for ultrasonic devices to drive out the rodents, and as you shuffle into the kitchen now for that late-night nibbling, you can hear its subsonic pulsing through your head: deet-deet-deet-deet. So when the newest Ryoji Ikeda CD came in the mail, I figured it'd free one more room of the house from these pests, as his past oeuvre laid similar sonic matrices throughout the acoustic spaces of the room, sometimes clearing it, other times hypnotizing it. +/- was an instant classic of edge-of-perception phenomena, frequencies being felt more than heard as their components vacillated in and out of the range of the human ear, destabilizing the crystals within and altering their audible nature as the listener's position changed in relation to the stereo. Matrix was scalpel-sharp sine waves and similarly minded clinical clicks on two separate CDs. But hopes for hole-free laundry sunk considerably when I read the fine print of this release, which states: ""No electronic sounds used."" I could imagine the mizzle of little teeth through the walls as the CD started to spin, and although the opening seconds could fool you, this is not only a completely live instrumental affair, but it's all composed for strings, executed by the Musiques Nouvelles Ensemble, as well as a Japanese string quartet at the New National Theatre in Tokyo. ""Op.1"", segmented into four movements, is scored for nonet, although its austerity would never reveal so many players without the acknowledgements. Strings resound in single file, before being bowed into different laminal contexts with a sympathetic relation to the other entities. Ikeda's compositional attention is as an alembic, distilling all players into the true physical sound of their rosined bows on the strings, and the auras emitted from each string-- the attack, sustain, and decay works individually and then in combination. The first two movements are stunning, as the violins, violas, and cellos swell with a deliberate asceticism, making achingly slow passes over their strings, as disembodied as headlights in the absolute darkness of highway night driving, glowing singularly yet creating a chain of luminous entities in ensemble. This is not unlike the Doppler effect of +/-, whose observed nature was dependent on subjective factors such as speaker setup or whether the disc was heard on headphones and at what volume. That phenomenon is relegated to the music itself now, not in how it transmits to the listener's ear. By the third movement, the violins and violas are passing like ships in the night, the double bass thudding against their hulls as if to mark their dimensional presence. The spatial destabilization is similar to the late works of Morton Feldman, not in terms of scale or chromatic problem solving, but in its subtle outlining of the void in which it all hovers, like Sonar describing that which encases it. Isolated, each instrument is made to resonate or fluctuate much like an electronic tone in the studio, and it's in merger that the actual physical nature of the sound becomes more readily apparent. What serves as the greatest hurdle of Op. is a problem many contemporary composers (especially those using technology) face when working with more classical instruments that carry hundreds of years worth of historical weight within their sounds: How do you recontextualize these instruments to where they express something in a new manner? Or in Ikeda's case, where his previous electronic compositions drew so much attention to sound's physical occupation of the air and how it reacts to the placement of the ear, what is he going to express, emotionally, melodically, or structurally, with these scored string ensembles, be they quartets or trios? With the arrival and passing of two versions of ""Op.2"", apparently not too much, I'm afraid, aside from how interesting these instruments sound as they slide past each other over time. Sections of Op. remain fascinating, distilled into a new acoustic context that still reveals the audio essence Ikeda has made his own over ten years, but it remains on the surface of the sounds only, not to what resonates and connects it all underneath. One could also marvel just at how the bow moves on, say, Bach's Unaccompanied Cello Suites or even Xenakis' scores for the Arditti Quartet, but there's also an essence beyond mere physicality. As I begin to discern the high squeal of bus brakes outside or the incessant pulsations of the electric pest repellent already plugged in as they fuse with and then secede from Ikeda's latest compositions, I keep thinking that by refusing his electronic past for this compositional project, he might have missed the pointillism.","Recently, the mouse problem at my apartment has gotten out of control.

Tomorrow Right Now,Beans,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a23e9d034d5c69bf2b5f/1:1/w_160/da293956.jpg,2003-02-23 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/603-tomorrow-right-now/,Warp,"When Beans' new press photos started making the rounds, depicting him decked out in pro-skier Terminator sunglasses against a hot pink background, a sharp fear plagued me, and some tough questions burned in my mind. Had the former Antipop Consortium rapper/genius gone... electroclash?! And, like, what's going on with the fauxhawk? I refused to believe the future poet had fallen prey to the inflated ego that often comes prepackaged with a solo career-- especially since this guy's former group, Antipop Consortium, helped pull a mostly unwilling leg of hip-hop kicking and screaming into the future by shouting peripheral rhymes through a whooshing holodeck of a recording and strapping it with clicky avant-garde beats. Would Beans really betray us by releasing something... banal? Well, it's not quite that easy. The beats on Beans' first solo record, Tomorrow Right Now, have wrapped themselves in a bare, futura-glitch of machine hi-hat claps, scratched-out bass, and blurred, trebly kickdrum, with the assistance of Antipop producer E. Blaize. The record is also deeply rooted in electro, but even with that said, it's not nearly what you'd expect. Tomorrow pays homage to the gods of early 80s drum machines in a method consistent with Antipop Consortium: It melds the elements of current hip-hop with the Warp label's signature Powerbook programming. The lyrics belie a certain nostalgia, as with ""Mutescreamer""'s lyrical mix of tight, beat-hopping styles, set against a chorus whose cadence sounds straight from a rare Enjoy Records cut, circa 1980. On ""Hot Venom"", Beans spits, ""King Daddy, disco rad/ Totally tubular.../ Y'all need to quit like Nicorette."" And with America fully thrust into popular aesthetics of the 1980s, it's debatable whether dropping the words ""totally tubular"" and showing an affinity for neon is nostalgic or terribly cutting edge. The single-- and the track in which Beans states his mission of intent-- is the incredibly def ""Phreek the Beat"", a pared-down mash of island flavor with a true-school-styled lady singing the staccato pre-chorus. Beans sings an easy, dubby boast, declaring himself ""the new wave vandal"": ""So unbelievable/ As a human being nothing holds a candle."" It sounds like Roxanne Shante cheerleading Beans into space-- like it was recorded in a vacuum, all clipped and dry and closed-in, a paradox of time where the cadence of Bronx '79 meets the vision of Brooklyn '03. It is Beans' manifesto of ensuring the past's concrete place in his funkyass future. This is where Beans excels, when the beats are bent and everything sounds like a fresh voice-over on an old episode of Star Trek-- the drifting deep tempo of ""Toast"", the spiraling, oscillating keyboards of ""Hot Venom"", the plastic-y, cheese-grater whirls of ""Mutescreamer"". ""Booga Sugar"", meanwhile, is a silky-flowed poem in first person about a blunt-addicted rapper who eventually dumps rhymes for a life suckling the crack pipe (Nancy Reagan and her gateway drug pamphlets would have shit her pants for this one), and ""Crave"" forgoes the future for a jazz-style scat featuring a capella vocals, finger snaps, and simple beatboxing. On his solo debut, Beans twirls and stretches his language, depicting the life of a poet-rapper, heavy on non-traditional boasts and battle rhymes. But he lacks the gulping, deep tone of former APC cohorts Priest and Sayyid, which means the beats usually usurp his rhymes-- especially on the only halfway-there track ""Mearle"", where he employs an atonal style of yelling that seems almost disdainful of the listener. He did an excellent job of programming percussion and synth, and throwing unexpected loops everywhere like secret codes. And there's no electroclashing on this record, so that counts for something. Yet, while it sounds extremely fresh right now, I can't help but wonder if, ten years down the road, Tomorrow Right Here will feel as dated as the cardboard backdrops of Lost in Space.","When Beans' new press photos started making the rounds, depicting him decked out in pro-skier Terminator sunglasses against a hot ...

Catechism,DJ SpookyKillah PriestWard 29,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9d713d197565213af46/1:1/w_160/f64aa996.jpg,2003-02-21 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2387-catechism/,SynchronicBlue Juice,"Originally released as two EPs on the Blue Juice label, last summer's re-issue of Catechism collected those hip-hop remixes into a cohesive, if somewhat redundant, whole. DJ Spooky and Killah Priest's latest collaboration couldn't compare compare to their previous collaboration on Spooky's 1998 album Riddim Warfare, but nevertheless, the single was laid out on many a remixer's operating table, stripped, gassed, and primed for surgical exploration. Featuring the competent if not spectacular skills of extended Wu-Family member Killah Priest, the original mix is nothing special, a half-assed stab at urban grit that fails to generate synergy between the academic street arrangements of Professor Spooky and Killah Priest's innocuous, nondescript flow, a mix of Shaolin grandstanding and failed philosophy struggling to break out of its tired, rehearsed rut. While Riddim Warfare's ""Degree Zero"" held its own next to the complex rhyme equations of Kool Keith and Sir Menelik, ""Catechism"" needs all the help it can get to break free of a mediocre blueprint. Yet the listener gets only a taste of the possibilities. The majority of the chosen remixers-- including Big Dada representatives New Flesh and turntablist extraordinaire Deckwrecka-- walk down a less inventive path, and turn in straightforward variations that target the track's obvious hip-hop flavor, taking a cue from the dirty atmosphere in Killah Priest's delivery. New Flesh's mix is predictably Ninja Tune: With big, acid jazz horns and a drum beat that gets lost under Killah Priest's bombast, it's repetitive in the worst way, an under-the-radar nephew of every tired loop you've heard on Urban Radio since 2000. Much more satisfying is Mex Black's ""Grass"" remix, which pairs a haunted piano and Fantasia strings with flanged synths, and a sped up rip of Priest's vocals, finding an untapped energy in his flow that makes the cut spark. The woodwind dancehall of Deckwrecka's remix also shines, its crown jewels the guest MCs MCD and 2Ice, with his rough ragga growl. Long the scourge of 12"" promos and import singles the world over, one third of Catechism is instrumental and acapella; a potentially interesting bonus for crate diggers when spread over two vinyl EPs, but a surefire momentum killer on one CD. It's torture enough hearing Killah Priest's weak opening line ""I seek revenge upon the earth like Christ"" repeated a dozen times before the disc ends, but back-to-back versions of Ward 29's pedestrian ""Runaways"" remix make for masochistic overkill. Mex Black's contribution is begging to be heard sans vocals but, curiously, it doesn't get the instrumental treatment. What this all boils down to is a lack of invention. Catechism is forgettable for much of its 40 minutes, and not until the final cut does the track get a fresh, inventive interpretation courtesy of Unreals' remix, which pushes ""Catechism"" further up the genre family tree into drum n' bass territory. It's still a fairly safe branch to dangle from, but it works, with a droning intro, and an increasingly aggressive high roller of a break; the track delivers, and successfully reworks an easily missed Killah Priest boast-- ""Comin' as the ill-ass rappuh/ With that sick ass laughtuh""-- into a crafty, memorable hook. The whole point of the remix as an art form is to bring something new and personal to the table: Dogmatic adherence to the source material isn't going to produce anything revelatory. The massive 2x12"" free-for-all on the East Flatbush Project's ""Tried by 12"" from a few years back took that track's loping hip-hop spine and contorted it in a million directions; almost every cut was a success. Catechism, despite a few solid vertebrae, is in desperate need of a chiropractor's second opinion.

I was so pumped full of Ritalin that I couldn't even sit through the 16-minute masturbation marathon of the title track-- it's so sloppy and limp, like they can't even play their instruments, and worse, can't be bothered to even summon up some enthusiasm for the effort of trying.""

If you don't grow old and die while waiting through the rough patches of the early tracks, Darkness -> Light, as the name implies, improves substantially. Tara White's eerie coos drift in from somewhere just outside mortal realms of perception, breaking the vast lull in the interior of the album. 'The Endless Winter' and 'Love' are really standard, jangly, acoustic pieces, but they're very compelling. Tara White's vocals are in a separate league from Rick's whispered melodrama, mournful and haunting; the vocal duets between them have a fantastic air of mystery surrounding them. 'Down Here' sports a sharp, evocative solo that hints at the psychic crush of the first tracks, but couples it with actual musicianship for a slick closing piece.

How I Learned to Write Backwards,The Aislers Set,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0315e6ef9596931fec2/1:1/w_160/bc9c3ff5.jpg,2003-02-20 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/86-how-i-learned-to-write-backwards/,Suicide Squeeze,"We're surrounded by pop music, yet it's rare to find full albums packed solid with irresistible, brain-picking hooks, melodies so catchy you can identify the exact note or syllable that addicts you. How I Learned to Write Backwards is the rare exception. Never merely ""nice"" or ""fun,"" Amy Linton's songs are chiseled like diamonds, and set to some of the coolest arrangements ever taped in somebody's basement. More spacious and lighter on the guitars than the Aislers Set's first two albums, How I Learned to Write Backwards shows Linton, the band's writer/producer/singer, in a full 60s pop pastiche. You can find the obvious nods to Laura Nyro's stoned soul melodies and the most mesmerizing basslines ever given to Nancy Sinatra; ""Through the Swells"" all but rips off the bubblegum classic ""I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus"", and the harmony vocals on ""Emotional Levy"" have the grace of a choir of French schoolgirls in matching soft blue uniforms. Here, Linton's indie quintet becomes a pop orchestra. The band's music is denser than ever before, laden with sleigh bells, handclaps and horns piled atop the conventional guitars, drums, bass and keyboards-- and all are drenched in cavernous reverb, providing the ambiance and intimacy of a gigantic, empty concert hall. And yet, this is also a noise-pop band: Beneath the layers of instrumentation, the music is propped up on barbed wire, unsteady and ready to topple. The tracks are short: The single, ""Missions Bells"", is one of the few to break two minutes, and ""Langour in the Balcony"" seems to end before it's even started. And the band cuts quickly from one influence to the next-- the gingerbread candy house of ""The Train #1"" runs into the rumbling punk guitars on ""The Train #2""; the massive, verbose pop of ""Attraction Action Reaction"" balances the spooky-bleak voice and barely-the-will-to-strum guitar on ""Unfinished Paintings"". The noise makes the pop spark, and the soul influence makes the nervous energy digestible. Linton mixes and paces all of these elements flawlessly, but what's more, the engineering is extraordinary for its budget, carefully crafted but fun and spontaneous. The only problem is Linton's singing. It's not that she's not a great singer (well, maybe partly)-- the issue is how she records her voice. On almost every track, she Spectorizes herself in oblivion with effects and reverb added to, presumably, lend a distant and dreamy effect. Sometimes it works (the late-night loneliness on ""Unfinished Paintings"" is poignant), but at other times, she sounds completely displaced. The most unfortunate example of this comes on the album's closer, ""Melody Not Malaise"", where the band is recorded with minimal post-production trickery while Linton is mixed far too low beneath the instrumentation, and reverbed into the stratosphere. Maybe she's not happy with how her voice or words sound unaided, but I'd rather be given the opportunity to connect to them than be left guessing. This, however, may be How I Learned to Write Backwards' only shortcoming, and when stacked up against such effortless, finely-crafted pop tracks, it almost seems trivial. These songs are blanketed in a magnetic charisma, and contain a vigor and effortlessness that projects youthful vitality and a joyousness unhampered by looming adult concerns. It's pure fun-- insanely, immediately likable, and ingenious in how much it achieves.","We're surrounded by pop music, yet it's rare to find full albums packed solid with irresistible, brain-picking hooks ...

Merzbeat,Merzbow,by: Kim Shannon,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c44569fc7814a47cd843/1:1/w_160/d177ef85.jpg,2003-02-20 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5245-merzbeat/,Important,"Most people, by the very concept, find cement blocks of sadistic noise alienating. A percentage of those that actually enjoy auditory suffering argue as to whether a popular practitioner such as Merzbow doles out a potent and varied enough blend from album to album. Most people contend that if you've heard one Merzbow album, you've heard them all, but his new release Merzbeat might baffle those usually alienated by noise, as well as those who feel Merzbow is monotonous. It will even surprise those who've become accustomed to the cochlea-stampeding trauma of his earlier records. Merzbeat is approachable. There are drum beats and guitar riffs. It's been compared to Neu, although Tony Conrad + Faust's Outside the Dream Syndicate might be more apt: A pummeling drum line repeats for 10 minutes, Tony Conrad's buzzing violin replaced by Merzbow's trash compactor. All of the anti-academic, yet still intellectualized thought regarding Merzbow's blatant, harsh releases is hidden within Merzbeat. It's still subconscious, cultural detritus, sure, but it's rock music first. In fact, to hell with all the Krautrock name dropping: Merzbeat strives to be Led Zeppelin I. Despite these almost accessible aspirations, one could hardly say any piece of music in Merzbow's canon is unprecedented. Merzbeat is like a stripped-down Aqua Necromancer, a prominent, almost pleasurable loop underneath the sounds Merzbow is known for; Necromancer however is much harsher, and more monotonous, where Merzbeat, surprisingly enough, is melodically varied. It's a Merzbow album with near-tunes that actually change over the course of each piece. Factor in the fourth track, ""Tadpole""-- what might be the most traditionally beautiful piece of Merzmusic-- and it's hard not be optimistic about the future of Masami Akita's work. Merzbeat is engaging, yet to laud the work as an achievement-- or even a standout release-- might be beside the point. For Merzbow, music is garbage: This CD is just the result of the wild excesses of information in our lives. It's essentially the most accurate form of folk music we have. Anyone can make noise; you just take the leftovers around you and extract sound. Make it loud and cathartic, or quiet and resigned: Each Merzbow release is a call to do it yourself. While a similar release like Massimo's Hello Dirty-- which also preys on noise and rock music-- achieves a certain artistry in the equation, the bizarrely more impressive thing about Merzbeat is its imminent disposability.","Most people, by the very concept, find cement blocks of sadistic noise alienating.

Or yesterday maybe, I don't know. I got a telephone call from the house: ""Andy, your father just got back from the dentist's office, and he had some very important news that I thought you'd like to hear."" ""Uh, okay, does he have any life-threatening cavities?"" ""No, but the dentist warned him to stay away from whitening toothpastes and anything with abrasives in it. She said the worst one was that natural toothpaste you use with baking soda in it. It can scratch the enamel off your teeth."" ""Not to worry Mom, I don't use that sort of stuff anymore. I use Hecker."" ""Hecker?"" ""Yeah, Florian Hecker. It's by Mego."" ""It's got fluoride in it? That's good, I suppose."" ""No, Ma, Florian. It's not that mellow Peelu ambiance like Tim Hecker nor that cool saccharine sparkle of Hecker and Miss Kittin. It's not even the Aquafresh of Maximillian Hecker. This stuff is from Austria, and I'm not sure if it's even legal here yet."" ""Are you on dope?"" ""Mom, this is the most abrasive shit I've ever come across! This grounds out all the enamel and bone in my fucking mouth, and it's just nerve-endings dangling in there now! I'll never have to brush again!"" She didn't want to listen to what I had to say, and you might not want to listen either, but much like last year's lauded (and brutally unlistenable) To Live and Shave in L.A. disc, this will be the most highly nuanced, insanely articulated carving and polishing of digital noise to come along this year, and Hecker knows it. ""But wait, what about Kevin Drumm?"" you may ask, who also placed high in these pages with a similarly nasty disc of white noise and black death on the same label. True, it was rough, but at least its heart contained the very core of rock, as its ending revealed. You could at the very least think about distorted guitars and be close to understanding. Sun Pand√§monium is something else entirely, its computer codes and structures inscrutable through and through. In what must surely be the aural equivalent of tapping the gas pedal as your buddy reaches for the door handle on the car, Hecker begins the disc with four minutes of toggling the on-off switch on the hyperspeed for ""bsf¬∞tyk 5"" and you're uncertain whether you really want to ride or not. When ""Stocha Acid Zhook"" starts up, though, it is pure alien abduction, and the probes are readied for some prolonged root canal work. Holes are painfully drilled straight through to the cortex stem, and at the surface it seems to be done entirely at random, but when every single speck of toothy shrapnel and grinding spin of the diamond bit is placed within the extraterrestrial drone underlying it all, there is a far greater intelligence that can be discerned, and it's frightening. Gurgle and spit all you want, you'll be unable to evade this malevolence; the piercing frequencies pin you down, no matter how you writhe or turn. And just when you think the twenty grueling minutes of skull-trepanning might be over as the piece dies out, Hecker even gives you a fake ending and returns with the drill for a few minutes more! The nerves! Once through the album's centerpiece, the remainder of the album spurts by quickly in minute bursts. The smaller fragments squiggle around a little bit more, but the refinement of each sound particle, be it a glitch or the digital dust shaved off of that isolated glitch, has so much meticulous gradation as to render every grain audible and infinite. ""Quantum Spark Reality"" melds some ungrounded pops and fluctuating hums into these exquisite cosmic murmurs, cutting it all with flummoxing squeals so that the experience remains destabilized and damaged. ""Vi Retrospect"" is lightning quick, with edgy quivers and quakes, as physically visceral as any vinyl scratching. As the nerves tense to the point of synapse snapping, unable to process it all, Hecker fizzes the track out with some outlandish twittering and dribbling. It's a perfect ending, as the listening experience will do nothing if not reduce you to puddling drool at the end. Loud and overwhelming at any volume setting, these are the sounds and frequencies not only of diamonds being sharpened, but then being used to etch directly on the lenses of your optical readers. Call him a sick fuck, a genius, or even Mister Antichrist, but this will cleanse the audio palate as it blows your teeth out. Trust me.","Mama called today. Or yesterday maybe, I don't know.

10th,Nobukazu Takemura,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a722b1335d7bf1698fb0/1:1/w_160/268e17b7.jpg,2003-02-19 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7923-10th/,Thrill Jockey,"One bored afternoon a few years ago I decided to let Amazon.com know what kind of music I like in order to receive some recommendations. I rated a few CDs, checked the suggestions, then rated a few more. No matter how many records I rated, Amazon kept telling me I just had to buy Nobukazu Takemura's Scope. Curious, I clicked the link to the RealAudio clip for ""Kepler"" and proceeded to have the kind of music listening epiphany that only comes along once in a great while. It was like this track was designed specifically to trigger the greatest possible emotional response in me personally. There was the mathematical beauty of the repeating percussion pattern, right out of Reich's bag of tricks. A warm organ ran counter to this, suggesting some kind of humanity at the center of this perfect geometry. And then, floating on top and skipping along to the saddest beat I could imagine, was the voice of Aki Tsuyoko, chopped to pieces by the broken machines Oval introduced in the mid-90s. I ordered Scope within a few minutes, and then went back to this painfully brief 30-second clip several times daily until the disc arrived a week later. I was turned on to Nobukazu Takemura by a computer algorithm. It's fitting, really, considering the direction his music has taken since. Starting with Hoshi No Koe, Takemura has devoted more and more energy to looking for the tin man's heart. I'm guessing that this particular obsession, the search for the emotional core of the machine, has something to with being raised in Japan, a country that seems very comfortable with the idea that robots have feelings. Through the Sign and Mimic Robot EPs Takemura's interest in this area continued to grow (last year's limited edition Water's Suite was clearly a detour, and was constructed from old material besides), and now it comes to full flower on 10th. While ""Sign"" stood out on Hoshi No Koe with its pop structure and incorporation of vocals, these elements are the norm on 10th. This is an interesting development because Takemura's handling of vocals is so unique. The vocoder has been in regular use for more than 30 years, and in the past five it's become something of a clich√©, but Takemura's treatments are original. With Takemura's music, you never get the sensation that you're hearing a human voice processed by a machine, the way you might with Kraftwerk or Air. Takemura lets the machine sing to the audience directly. In fact, on 10th we're not hearing vocodered human voices, but the sound of a speech synthesizer originally developed for the handicapped. With the human element removed from the voices on 10th, the effect is ironically even greater pathos. The way Takemura positions these lonely robot boys and girls, we're led to believe that they might never find love. I only wish he'd given them better songs to sing. The musical arrangements are just right, consisting of his usual assortment of electronic instruments and percussion that sound like broken toys. Hearing these tools applied in the service of well-written pop songs would be divine, but the melodies, as performed by the speech synthesizer, just aren't moving. The tune that makes up ""FallsLake"" sounds like it was written on a keyboard using one finger on a cluster of three black keys. The slippery bass and clouds of harmonic distortion that make ""Wandering"" sound so damn nice are wasted when the singing machine comes in and pays absolutely no attention to the chords. ""Lost Treasure"", which appears on the Mimic Robot EP, is better, with a nice bassline, lazy, head-nodding drums, and an interesting vocal rhythm, but there's no possible defense for letting it stretch to nine minutes. Which brings us to the usual Takemura complaint: 10th is a 16 track, 78-minute record. At a time when albums seem to be moving back to a more reasonable length, Takemura's are still pushing an hour and 20 minutes. So that's the bad news. On the upside, there are a number of great tracks on 10th, and all of my favorites are instrumentals. The simple and poignant CD skipper ""Cons"", which was also on Mimic Robot, still works for me. The textured drones of ""Mumble"" manage some interesting harmonic interplay. The playful and sad ""Tadasu No Mori"" sounds like a lost Child's View classic, with by far the best melody on 10th and some compelling background voices. The disappointing hit-to-miss ratio on 10th might also have something to do with my introduction to Nobukazu Takemura. The sound I fell in love with when I first heard ""Kepler"" seems like something Takemura has lost interest in. But the impact of that track on me was so strong, I think of it every time I put on a new Takemura release. I'm always interested in what I hear and I often find something great (""Chrysalis"" from Hoshi No Koe is brilliant, for example), but the intensity of that one experience, I'm realizing, is not likely to be repeated.","One bored afternoon a few years ago I decided to let Amazon.com know what kind\n\ of music I ...

What is Sands? Lanterna primarily solo project of Illinois-based Henry Frayne, who has played with the Moon Seven Times, Area, and many others. Sands is the third Lanterna release, after 1995's self-titled debut and 2001's Elm Street. What kind of music does Lanterna play? If Lanterna had to filed under one category, it'd most likely be ambient, although that label is also inadequate: Brian Eno's famous quip that ambient music should be as ignorable as it is interesting applies only partially to Sands. Frayne adds much stronger rhythmic drive to his work than is typical of ambient composers; he sometimes uses a drum machine programmed by Steve Day, other times he employs chugging guitars, as on ""Greek Island"". Could you tell us more about this ""Greek Island"" song? Certainly, since ""Greek Island"" is perhaps the strongest track on the record. It has an elegant sense of movement, and surpasses the other cuts on Sands. Frayne tries to lend the whole album a cinematic sweep, but he carries it off most successfully on ""Greek Island."" I already own an ambient album. Could you please tell me why I'd want to buy another one? Perhaps you wouldn't. For some people, ambient music is nothing more than pleasant room spray for when they don't want something intrusive on their stereos. Other people-- let's call them ""fans of ambient music""-- enjoy the subtle emotional shades woven into the genre's best albums. On Sands, Frayne often hints at mood shifts that never come, casting shadows of perception that enrich the delicate resonance of his never obvious material. Sands also tends to grab more attention than one might expect, like Eno's On Land. Frayne doesn't exactly straddle the boundary between pop and ambient, but he does take a couple steps towards the former. Is that good? Yes and no. Frayne runs into trouble, primarily because he mandates varying degrees of attention: Listeners will find their expectations shifting across tempi, volume levels-- even styles-- in a short period of time. Sands alternates between rewarding and frustrating on close listen, as subsequent tracks run afoul of any audience bias, whether toward ambient or pop. *I'm told the guitar sound on this album is horribly dated and retro-futuristic, that the drum machine sounds like it was picked up at Bobby Brown's yard sale, and that generally, * Sands sound like the most technologically sophisticated release of 1981. Is that true? Yes. Why would I want to buy Sands in that case? As the lessons of ambient music have remained all too segregated from pop, Frayne should be saluted for his attempt to break down the barrier between these fields. Sands is incrementally successful in doing so, and should be welcomed by anyone who likes ambient, but resents its limitations. Yet Frayne has the same problem as everyone from Eno onwards: how to get an inevitably prejudiced audience to listen to a genre whose very function is a drastic departure from the norm. He hasn't solved it here, and will pay the price of marginality for his modest failure, but he's searching for a bridge that could connect two worlds, and as he's one of very few architects with a solid blueprint, you'll want to keep his card in your rolodex.","A Series of Questions and Answers on Lanterna's Sands:

Seana Carmody is trying to erase your memory of the last ten years, and only you can stop her! Get out your secret decoder rings to find out how, and remember, all the information you're about to receive is top secret, for your eyes only, not to be shared with anyone-- not even your Mom and Dad. The first letter is...wait! What's that sound? That beguiling sound...so clear, so...French, in a Bostonian kind of way. That voice, it's calling me back to 1992, back to the days when indie rock was supposed to take over the world and save us all from pre-packaged blandness. And that music, it's so hazy, so...swirly. ""Rocket Out of Time"" pretty much says it all, in title and execution. Seana Carmody's voice tumbles out of the speakers, dripping in ambience cooked up in some half-remembered stereolab. I'm not sure if she departed from the Swirlies ten years ago or yesterday: Her henchmen-- Orrin Anderson on drums and keys, and Adam Brilla on bass and ""space guitar""-- put you in double headlocks of strutting rhythm and shocking fuzz, driving home the auto-vehicular double entendre of the album's title. Struts & Shocks is like the core of the Swirlies, with the apple eaten mostly off; it's still pretty sweet, but the seeds are mildly poisonous. The songs that drove that first band's noise and experimental edge are largely swept aside, in favor of a cozier bedroom ambience. There's still some racket to get the neighbors pounding on the ceiling, but it's mostly-- disarmingly-- underplayed. It's concise, too, plowing through ten songs in 33 minutes, eight of which are devoted to the dusty shoegazer mini-epic ""Stay Awake"", which closes the record in blissfully spaced out fashion. Other highlights include the gorgeously lopsided groove of ""Deirdre"", topped by a triple-tracked layer of Carmody sauce, and guitars operating at orbital zenith. The heavenly swirl of ""Tornadoes"" kicks up a cloud of distortion and percussive fence posts that belies the calm of Carmody's delivery. And that's part of what makes Struts & Shocks so great: Carmody certainly recalls her glory days in the Swirlies, but she's the only one in the driver's seat, and brings a new focus to her work as a result. All told, her plot to rob us of the last decade seems to be coming to fruition. Save your old records, kids, they're the only decoder you've got.","Holy flashbacks, website readers!

Antipop Vs.

Yes, he's the greatest pianist of the modern age, blending diverse atonal qualities with an unequivocal spryness and an effortless range of emotion, and all those other things that come with being a brilliant player. (Free cocktails?) But when you compare the sentiment in a record like Nu Bop to that of most 20th Century composers with a similar vision, Shipp's stuff just doesn't hang on the low end of the friction enough. I want his music to punch me in the face with its dramatic, chaotic authority. He is for the advancement of jazz. He is supposed to be the Edgard Var√®se, the Charles Ives of our generation, goddammit, interpreting the city sounds around him through improvisation and a sensitive, reflective ear. Unfortunately, the purpose of his recordings-- evolving jazz by including its urban peers in hip-hop and electronics-- has always stopped a hair short of success. The performances are airtight, but the crust is soft. As it turns out, one thing that was missing was Antipop Consortium, and more specifically, their unequalled, futuristic, split-atom beats. Up 'til now, Shipp's beat programmers have been all wrong. Past collaborators DJ Spooky and FLAM are decent from an electronic and an emotional standpoint, but what they've offered hasn't ever defied expectations. If Shipp truly wants to advance jazz into the realm of youth-popular urban culture, he's gotta break bread with the crazy funk, collaborate with the most innovative musicians. Antipop vs. Matthew Shipp opens with a brow-furrowed block of Shipp's piano chords cut into the boom-bap of the bass and hi-hat. It's an imposing, rhythm-heavy intro, and while not a complete song, its neon spritzes of keyboards and backwards-looped cymbals offer a clear theme of what's to come: future jazz in the most definitive sense. From there, Shipp's piano turns backflips all over APC's swimmy, electro-alarms. William Parker's bass and Shipp's low-end counter each other as Beans and Priest holler, ""Stereo! Stereo, Stereo! It sounds so fresh, I'll sing it once and repeat!"". From here, the mix alternates between rap solos, piano solos, some loose drums, chunks of chords, sample of dogs barking (two breeds), keyboards on the holodeck. Shipp's piano is sampled for melody and rhythm, as much as it solos-- and even the high-end, winky optimism with which Shipp sometimes flirts holds up way deffer as a platform with a little electro street beat. There's not much of that froufy shit, though; it wouldn't be an Antipop joint without their cold, twitchy vision: ""Svp"", ""Stream Light"" and ""Coda"", specifically, feature their marble-clinking rhythms and bleak, controlled atmosphere, M. Sayyid rapping with a resigned wateriness in his voice, and blooming with heavy-footed atonal melodies. ""Monstro City"" has a cigarette-burning be-bop vibe, lyrics unfurled like spoken word in tandem with clicky bongo and, yes, more gaping hunks of piano chords, teetering into a dark chasm of a future. This is true-blue street jazz, and you can tell it comes straight from the heart and head. Okay, but the thing is, this is billed as an Antipop Consortium record-- their absolute last release, as a matter of fact, since they broke up last autumn. (R.I.P!!!) And while this is a step forward for Shipp, for APC, it's a side-step from their gleamingly tricked-out, beat-tweaked and freaky Arrhythmia. Antipop vs. Matthew Shipp is solid, yes, but the experimentation doesn't always work in their favor, and it often dilutes the propulsive fire beneath their final release. Then again, maybe it's appropriate that their last hurrah-- Antipop's final track, ""Free Hop"", has them melting scratches and turntables backwards over a charged improv session, marking a deflated and untimely end, for eight years was simply not enough.","Matthew Shipp hasn't reached his teeth-baring potential.

Dixie Fried,James Luther Dickinson,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b97e5e6ef9596932298f/1:1/w_160/8098ddfc.jpg,2003-02-18 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2305-dixie-fried/,Sepia-Tone,"Jim Dickinson's got a resum√© that makes him sound an awful lot like the protagonist of LCD Soundsystem's ""Losing My Edge"". He was there, in 1969, when the Rolling Stones were recording ""Wild Horses"". He was there, in 1974, taping the drugged disintegration of Big Star's Third/Sister Lovers. And he was there, stringing out Spiritualized's Ladies and Gentlemen, We Are Floating in Space. From 1969 to 1999, he was there, with Pet Clark, the Flamin' Groovies, Sam and Dave, Mudhoney, Primal Scream, Ry Cooder, Bob Dylan. He recorded and played with them all. But Dickinson was there long before those more popular artists, going by his full Christian name and digging in the Memphis humus for some ""self-buried dope by motorcycle moonlight,"" with his band, the Dixie Flyers (the house band for many late sixties Atlantic artists, second only to the Muscle Shoals crew). Thirty years later, his dope is again unearthed, and the vintage is quite potent, if not a bit ragged. ""Wine"" cracks it all open, an ode to potables that leans heavily on ""Wine Spodee-Odee"" for support, but cuts loose with a drunken bottleneck slide flashing into white-lightning blindness at each break. The raucousness is palpable, barely controlled in the bellowed choruses and clouds of sawdust. The sluggish, morning-after regret ""The Strength of Love"" is soused with the kind of heavy molasses that coated Elvis' pill-popping gospel material, sung in the sort of preachy baritone Nick Cave's invoked in recent years. ""Wild Bill Jones"" is back on the bottle, with throat-scratched choruses from his cronies, strumming and slurring like it's a juke-joint's last call. The centerpiece of the disc is ""John Brown,"" an early Bob Dylan tune rendered unrecognizable-- much like the title character-- by heavy processing and some swamp gas bass. A churning, surly six-minute take, the synth simmers like bile midway through, and Dickinson's voice turns as foreboding as Jim Morrison's drawl. It's curiously psychedelic, in the sense that it unlocks a region of the mind seldom explored, and looses the darkness found there in a most horrific way. The talent that led to Dickinson's status as highly-sought producer in later years is his inherent grasp of ancient American folk forms, and his ability to invoke them in present times, allowing the ghosts to swirl about in other people's songs, be they by Dylan, Carl Perkins, or even a little known piece archived by a New Orleans dentist and musicologist. ""O How She Dances"" staggers on by way of dobro, rattle, and talking drum, channeling sinister turn-of-the-century carny snarls and the freakish sneer of proto-rockabilly Harmonica Frank Floyd in its brief three minutes. With a nod to Memphis blues legend Furry Lewis, Dickinson and what's left of the band fire up the train for ""Casey Jones"", taking it for a loopy, acoustic ride that brings this strange musical trip to a surprisingly mellow end, considering it's about a train wreck and all. Most of the individuals involved with this record wound up with some serious drug problems during and after the recording; it would take Dickinson himself until 2001 to get to his follow-up, Free Beer Tomorrow. Part evening porch blues, part Saturday night rave-up, and part Sunday morning hangover prayer, Dixie Fried doesn't stand alongside wasted white-boy classics like sideman Dr. John's Gris-Gris or the Stones' Exile on Main Street. It doesn't approach Third/Sister Lovers either, but like Dickinson himself, it's close by. Without restraint or focus, his band fell apart around him as he tried to put his possessed vision to tape. Dickinson rooted for an essential drug outside of time on this record, a high to illuminate the exact moment when ether and molecules become definable sound, to capture the space between singing and song.","Jim Dickinson's got a resum\xE9 that makes him sound an awful lot like the protagonist of LCD\n ...

Hello Dirty,Massimo,by: Kim Shannon,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3ca5e6ef959693238e7/1:1/w_160/98e7818c.jpg,2003-02-18 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5132-hello-dirty/,Mego,"If you're in college like our target demographic is, you probably feel a little wistful for the stress and suffering of teendom, perhaps best exemplified by the SATs. I thought it would be nice to once again, take time out of my busy schedule to accommodate the reader. Sentence Completion 1. Massimo's new album, __________ , is accompanied by a rather __________ press release, comparing the new __________ to a fully erect __________. A. Hello Dirty, humorous, compact disc, penis.
B. Hello Nasty, unpleasant, president, penis.
C. Goodbye Jumbo, insightful, coca-cola, guitar.

B. Squarepusher : Friends of Distinction
C. Massimo : Black Sabbath
D. Keith Fullerton-Whitman : Pitchfork Critical Reading: Hello Dirty is a surprising effort by Sicilian Massimo Sapienza. His Hey Babe, Let Me See Your USB and I'll Show You My Firewire LP, while dealing with similarly sexually explicit subject matter, hardly compares for the potent revelations on Hello Dirty. With so much electronic music substituting morality and personality with Deleuzeian theory, Massimo's release comes at precisely the right time. Steeped in the extremism and nihilism of noise music, Massimo has developed a unique hybrid between the language of DSP noise and popular culture. Yet, unlike so many other releases, rather than focusing on sweetness and melody of pop music, Massimo seems to be grasping for rock instead. He is reaching for the hormones, and grinding eroticism, choosing to tessellate the results though his computer. This might be the first experimental electronic album intended specifically for the fed-up, sex-deprived teenager, rather than the intellectual college student. All of those confused feelings of apocalypse and libidinal appetite stand in staunch opposition to the sugar-coated nostalgia of many of Massimo's colleagues. This is not to say Hello Dirty is a thoughtless album, however; by the last track, the primordial sludge shifts into a sharp, distorted parody of electronic dance music. It is relegated to the same message as rock music: Go out and fuck. Hello Dirty is about reveling in an uncivilized part of yourself, the part of you that likes to break expensive furniture, the person you were before you were sensitive and accommodating. It's a temper tantrum, filled to its histrionic brim with sincerity. Hello Dirty is more alienating than any punk or hardcore album you're going to hear this year, and there's a good chance that it will be a sight more cathartic, as well. Conclusion 1. The primary function of this essay is to: A. Give more acclaim to the already regularly lauded Mego label.
B. Sway the reader to buy a copy Hello Dirty, and truly challenge his or her ears for what might be the first time this year.
C. Present Massimo as an immature misogynist hiding behind a computer.
D. Use some avant-garde electronic buzzwords to give Pitchfork additional, unnecessary indie credibility. Score: 8.1. Maybe now Massimo will be able to get into a good Ivy League college and find a nice girl who appreciates brooding young men, and finally start programming his high-concept album about Leibniz's Monadology.","If you're in college like our target demographic is, you probably feel a little wistful for the stress and ...

Stories Often Told,The Sadies,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3305e6ef959693205bd/1:1/w_160/1252d1b9.jpg,2003-02-18 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6963-stories-often-told/,Yep Roc,"Welcome to Sadie Ranch, where a man can be a man and there ain't a cow that can't be tamed. Later on, we'll be corralling steers into the pen, watering horses and tending to repairs-- I hope you didn't expect this to be easy work! But it ain't all backbreakin' labor out here on the range; come evenin' we'll have a good, old-fashioned cowboy campfire, eat some good Tex-Mex grub, and sing some of those good ol' prairie songs. After that, we'll drop some acid and hit the waves at high tide-- that's when the surfin's best! Toronto's Sadies see no barriers between old-fashioned country 'n' western, Duane Eddy surf rave-ups and freaky psychedelic rock. If they perceive distance between those sounds at all, they've attempted to traverse it on their fourth album, Stories Often Told. The album feels like a step toward something more complete, as though the one that follows it will deliver the fully functioning Frankenstein they're trying to animate. Stories Often Told opens up with one of several widescreen blasts of spray and sea foam, drenching the quartet's twang in deep reverb. The galloping rhythms underneath are about halfway between John Wayne and Annette Funicello, if you can imagine it. Waves wash over the record constantly, but they're most enjoyable in concentrated bursts: Tight surf instrumentals like the graceful waltz ""A#1"" and ""Monkey & Cork"" are the most easily enjoyable songs here. ""Mile Over Mecca"" is a change of pace, and one of the most interesting songs the Sadies have done yet, submerging a slower surf melody under Rio Grande horns and psychedelic ambience. The Sadies stumble when they sit down around the proverbial fire to crank out old-fashioned C & W. They're not bad as a country band, but the album is bogged down by the slower tempos and under-developed melodies in songs like the pedal-steel ""Such a Little Word"", or their limp duet ""A Steep Climb"". When these country leanings collide with their surf jones, the results are fantastic, especially on the loping ""Oak Ridges"", where Dallas Good's Johnny Cash baritone sounds right at home amongst huge twang guitars. The shuffling folk of ""The Story's Often Told"" works the combination more subtly, transferring the sheets of reverb over to the steel guitar, which enshrouds the dusty campfire ballad in a gossamer cloud. Their biggest departure is undoubtedly ""Of Our Land"", which starts with a guitar progression exactly like the beginning of ""Stairway to Heaven"", then cuts off a credible slice of gnomes & fairies psych-rock, served up smothered in more reverb and phaser. To call it an entirely successful detour into psychedelia would be an overstatement-- it's not quite focused enough to be truly great-- but it's certainly entertaining, not to mention entirely unexpected. Ultimately, the Sadies seem just a touch away from creating a viable, unique genre, and I'll be dead honest with you: I would buy an album of psychedelic cowboy surf rock. If you think that prospect sounds appealing-- if you were raised on the Butthole Surfers and wondered when their insanity would come home to roost-- Stories Often Told is worth a listen. Their genre synthesis isn't quite complete, but it's getting there, which is often half the fun.","Welcome to Sadie Ranch, where a man can be a man and there ain't a cow that can't ...

To Get a Better Hold You've Got to Loosen Yr Grip,Boyracer,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a372c0084474cd0c0290/1:1/w_160/153ab759.gif,2003-02-18 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/898-to-get-a-better-hold-youve-got-to-loosen-yr-grip/,555,"Indiepop, which is different from just indie that is pop, is one of the most insular genres on Earth. It's so insular that its fans just call it ""pop,"" as if the word weren't already taken by the stuff on the Billboard charts. Let me explain. The whole story started with punk, which wanted to fill itself with urgency and anger and Big Themes. Somewhere in the middle of that came one of the first ""indiepop"" singles: the Television Personalities' ""Part-Time Punks"", which consisted of three dorky kids playing a half-assed, cutesy singalong about the punks on the street. It was an embrace of punk's DIY ethics, but also a big ""fuck off"" to punk's poses: a cute little pop song existing in (and analyzing) a scene that had very little use for such things. This became the core idea of indiepop: In environments where everyone desperately wanted to show strength and style and importance, these bands thumbed their noses and thought hard about kittens. Beat Happening, for instance, appeared on a west-coast indie scene still preoccupied with hardcore, but they sang childlike songs about apple-picking and death while throwing candy to their audiences. Henry Rollins heckled them, and they probably threw him candy, too: What kind of idiot is too cool to like candy? Following this stuff is a little like following pop, only in a tiny room that no one ever bothers with: It's all about ""legendary"" bands that only released one single, big pop-idol crushes on the women from Heavenly, endless mixtapes and little social scenes. So long as no one is watching, the fans can trade seven-inches in peace, in a realm that runs solely on their own enthusiasm: The whole thing is like a grand experiment in the ""indie"" idea of how bands should relate to listeners. But this is exactly what's led the genre to the depths of self-parody it currently wallows in: When everyone's happy to party in the same closet, no one bothers with quality control. At this late date most of the bands are just being cute for its own sake, writing still more songs about having crushes on one another, or deciding, to all appearances, that writing decent songs is no longer even necessary. Many have forgotten the key thing their precursors knew: That pop can be catchy but still serious, pissy, even sinister. And then there's Boyracer. In this little indiepop world, Boyracer is an institution-- maybe not The Beatles, but The Kinks, at least. Stewart Anderson, the group's only permanent member, has buzzed and shambled his way across more than a decade so far, releasing precious few full-lengths but a daunting array of singles, EPs, compilation tracks, and collections, all against a constantly mutating backdrop of band members and solo projects. This is the ""legendary"" Stewart Boyracer-- one friendly English guy with a mangled guitar and a revolving-door band spilling forth scattershot strings of bashed-out lo-fi pop songs. Indie rock fans might think that sounds like someone familiar, and it should: Bob Pollard and Guided by Voices have been travelling this road for just as long. The differences, though, are all content. Guided by Voices create a world of dirty-haired guys drinking cheap beer, of ""serious"" rock tropes, of obtuse, impressionistic lyrics. Boyracer's world is less skeptical: Just boys and girls excitedly bashing out the sort of pop that makes you bounce, the sort where clever knife-sharp lyrics about the everyday world of that latest crush will always beat vague stuff about blimps and robots. And that's exactly what you get here: twenty-odd tracks of speedy bopalong pop songs, all reckless and lo-fi, covered in noise and rigged together with duct tape. You get people attacking drum sets like eager kids; you get Stewart strumming guitars unbelievably fast; you get him and bandmate Jen calling ""Tell me where my hands should go!"" in enthusiastic unison right before overfuzzy bass and handclaps roll in. You get wistful bedroom duets that end with the sound of a teakettle coming to boil; you get an answering machine message in which an irate record-pressing rep tries unconvincingly to sound threatening and calls Stewart a bitch; you get ridiculously lovely covers of pop landmarks The Primitives and The Marine Girls. You get, in essence, what so much of indiepop has forgotten: That the point isn't just to be sweet and congratulate yourself for it, but to make sweetness powerful, to make it say something. Stewart understands this. He understands simpler issues, too, like how to write good songs (the hooks and structures here are consistently devastating), and how to just plain rock (or rather ""pop"": this album reminds me why The Wedding Present were once considered part of this genre). But mostly he gets how this stuff can work, how he can sit behind drum sets and guitars and have fun with you, or how he can set up a four-track somewhere and offer you a picturesque slice of the life he happens to lead: ""Are you still defending him?"" he begins one song. ""Is he still ruining your art-rock band?"" Wipe away all those pretensions to being ""avant-garde"" and it's the entire concept of ""indie"" in one album. Plus about a million great hooks. Indiepop is insular, yeah, but if there's any album in the genre right now that can toss that aside and offer something to people who couldn't care less about Tiger Trap, this is it.","Indiepop, which is different from just indie that is pop, is one of the most insular genres on Earth.

Or, even better: when you buy an unlabeled cassette at a thrift store, which, when played, consists of some guy talking to himself-- thinking no one will ever hear the tape, he's completely uninhibited, and by extension, genius. That's pretty much The Weather. It sounds like Daedelus, Bus and Radioinactive drank sick amounts of cola and recorded this album in their boxers. It's pleasantly casual, as if intended solely for their own entertainment. Bus and Radio are like, ""Fuck it, we are theatrical hams, and now we're gonna freestyle/sing over this tweaky exotica track Daedelus crunched and mashed for us."" Whacked-out humor, clever beats, and incomprehensible free-association abound, and it's awesomely pure, like the triumphant stink of a 12-year-old-boy's socks. You can't expect anything else from three guys calling themselves ""America's favorite boy band."" Daedelus drops his Kinderegg production, slipping loping beats inside candied organ, wispy string samples, and the occasional launch into futuristic feedback-- it's an early 70s variety-show backdrop similar to the one on Radioinactive's Pyramidi, but far more playful. It also helps that Los Angeles' Busdriver is among the most inventive emcees around right now, forging new directions in style (he's nasally, jazzy, and rhymes faster than anyone) and lyricism: ""You are confusing that Mercedes emblem for a peace sign/ And I'm mistaking that peace sign for a crosshair."" (If you're desperate for a follow-up to his mind-exploding last record, though, Bus doesn't cut quite as sharp on The Weather as on Temporary Forever.) On the opener, ""Exaggerated Joy"", Radioinactive rhymes, ""Laundering money in Laundromats, here is detergent,"" after which Bus sings a really funny, Michael Jackson-esque ""ah!"", sans irony, that's more suited for a sexy funk jam than the calliope-sounding rap presented. Sugar-fueled lyrics are alternately multi-layered and brilliant, and utterly incoherent. Example: The line, ""Just because the world runs on oil doesn't mean oilmen should run the world,"" is an astute, assertive and clever play on words, followed by, ""Just because the sky's my paved road doesn't mean you should pave a road over the sky."" Um, what? But it's not, like, a comedy album, nor is its wackiness cLOUDDEAD redux. These three state their mission clearly in a theme song of sorts, ""Carl Weathers"": ""We're too old to smoke blunts, so we promote funk that makes adults hump. We catapult jump."" Warm bass and a voice sing softly behind them: ""Partly cloudy with an increased chance of rain."" The Weather is smart but not pretentious, skeptical but not misanthropic, and it proves avant-hiphop doesn't have to be avant-crappy.

The Message at the Depth,DJ Krush,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9bdea9e61561daa7063/1:1/w_160/3abf044e.jpg,2003-02-18 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2364-the-message-at-the-depth/,Red Ink,"If a pterodactyl flies by my window, and I hear it make a screeching noise like ""AAAHK! WAAHK!"", does that make me an expert on dinosaurs? No, it does not. If you get members of Antipop Consortium and Anticon to rap on your album, does that change the fact that you've just released what amounts to a stale, heavy-handed trance record? No, it does not. Fortunately, there are enough pterodactyls flying around going ""AAAHK! WAAHK!"" on DJ Krush's seventh full-length, The Message at the Depth, that if all else fails (and it does), he can at least pretend that this album was 65 million years before its time. It reminds you of.
You know. Those raves you went to.
In, like, the 90s.
(haiku) Krush's beats are just unbelievably stale here, but that's not this record's only problem (even if it is its most immediate). It's the studied melodrama with which he introduces every echoing layer of synth debris at the exact correct, premeditated machination of a tom trill. And the songs don't go anywhere. He sounds like he's either bored and cranking this shit out or trying to prove how spooky he is. For his sixth album in a row. Fractals. So profound!
The beats. So heavy-hitting!
Just one, wing, flapping. DJ Krush is hellbent on illustrating his own interpretation of HELL: a war-torn, apocalyptic world based on history and current events that also falls in line with the premise of many a Manga. Good. Evil. Their timeless, endless battle. But the biggest flaw here is that there's just no good to drive home The Message at the Depth's evil. This record relies on the sorriest aural metaphors, the saddest cliches of late-90s electronica: Krush even employs a recurring theme of a black hole to illustrate war and destruction. It seethes and sucks beneath Anticon's anti-G.W. rants, the cocky hair-flipping diva crooning about Hiroshima on ""Alephevo (Truthspeaking)"", and ""What About Tomorrow"", this album's triumphant look towards the future. It's just so fuckin' hammy! He tries so hard, but just Beats! You! Over! The! Head! This stuff is way too dense, with no respite and no real crescendo. Remember, there ain't no hell without a heaven, no yin without a yang. There ain't no midlife-crisis sax solo straight out of a Bravo channel commercial on ""But the World Moves One"" without a chick listening to it on her headphones 3,000 miles away and rolling her eyes. YO. CAN YOU FEEL IT?
DJ Krush is in the vortex.
So medium-rare. The one moment of release on Message comes in the second half of ""Song for John Walker"", a track smoothed out with undeniably great lyrics: ""He wanted Hammer pants, he joined the Taliban,"" spits Doseone, in a surprisingly abrasive and uncharacteristically agitated tone. ""He sought an absolute truth, the alfa clech/ But he got the omega and bucked/ How many more humans will wear gun spit in their guts?"" The relief comes when Anticon's Pedestrian, Sole, Why?, Alias, Passage and Dose spiral into their signature, drugged-out spoken-harmony-- a rare placement of feather lightness on a record even Antipop Consortium's stellar diction can't save. But it lasts only a second, a pinhole of supernova in a vast universe anchored by Krush's murderous concrete-block beats.","If a pterodactyl flies by my window, and I hear it make a screeching noise like ""AAAHK!

Down with Wilco,The Minus 5,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c550ea9e61561daa819a/1:1/w_160/bcb43233.jpg,2003-02-17 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5318-down-with-wilco/,Yep Roc,"Welcome to Wilcomania!, your one stop source for all things Wilco! Wilco is launching out of the gates for 2003 with a multitude of musical releases-- light snacks to tide over the faithful until the release of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot 2: Die Foxtrotter! Please select the album you'd like to hear more about: Here are some testimonials about The Minus 5's Down with Wilco! ""I saw I Am Trying to Break Your Heart, and that Jay Bennett got a raw deal. After all, he wrote that cute ""My Darling"", didn't he? Since it doesn't look like they'll be bringing him back anytime soon, thank Jesus they met Scott McCaughey!"" ""Experimentalism is fine, but really, everything that could've been done to expand rock music's boundaries was done by Brian Wilson, am I right? Why doesn't Wilco remember that?"" ""Well, actually, this album is hardly a Wilco album."" [message deleted] Down with Wilco is the latest release from Scott McCaughey's The Minus 5 project, a revolving-door series of collaborations serving as a vehicle for the former Young Fresh Fellow's pop explorations. For this album, bittersweet Pazz & Jop victors Wilco were called in for a few days of backing band duty, during which they built upon some one-off studio performances of McCaughey's songs. The result is a watershed of publicity for the generally low-profile McCaughey, and a confirmation that Minus 5 sideman Peter Buck (also featured here, along with The Posies' Ken Stringfellow, Sean O'Hagan of High Llamas, and other indie-cyclopedia entries) no longer has the starpower to draw media attention himself. Down with Wilco even went through its own sort of mini-YHF record company saga, The Minus 5 being drop-kicked by Mickey Mouse himself when Mammoth Records dissolved last year. But it looks like Michael Eisner hasn't been taking calls from Steve Case, as Down with Wilco, rather than being cleverly shifted to another Disney tentacle, is being released on the rather low-budget-sounding Yep Roc Records. All that is just window dressing, however, as Down with Wilco is harmless sounding enough that even the most militant anti-major activist couldn't come up with a conspiracy theory about artistic suppression. McCaughey has made a career out of crafting slices of pop that are most directly described as ""nice""-- material that's hardly groundbreaking or original but that nevertheless appeals to that large sub-section of indie music listeners with a shrine to Pet Sounds in their humidity-controlled record-storage rooms. As can be expected from an album with Sean O'Hagan in its credits, homages to the big Bea- bands (no, not the Beastie Boys) abound in both melody and orchestration, though the arrangements never reach levels of string-caked Fridmann-phonics. The album's high points are effortlessly catchy and direct pop-rock tunes: Witness the lightly violin and Rhodes-infused ELO-rock of ""The Old Plantation"", the George Harrison-derived vocals on the melancholy piano epic ""Daggers Drawn"", or the DJ pop explosion ""Retrieval of You"". Not every track is a winner, but none will have you reaching for the '>>' button, either. But wait a second, there was a concept here... oh yeah, Wilco! Wilco! Wilco! It's actually rather curious that Wilco was the band that McCaughey drafted for this batch of songs, as it rarely sounds like Tweedy & Co. playing in the background, and never like the most recent semi-blippy incarnation of the group. Instead, it's mostly a revisitation of the Summerteeth days, all keyboard-heavy and 60s fetishism, except without the uneasy clash between sunny arrangements and Tweedy's burnt-coffee outlook/vocals. Jeffy lends his vocals to a song-and-a-half (a verse of ""The Town That Lost Its Groove Supply"" and the entirety of ""The Family Gardener"") but sounds like he's there on a distinctly guest-star basis, sleeping with another man's words. So Down with Wilco shouldn't be purchased simply on the desire to hear new Wilco material, but would almost certainly appeal to fans of the Summerteeth era, and confirms that the current foursome has a knack for orchestral pop even in the absence of Jay ""Dead Weight"" Bennett. Oh yeah, and as a Minus 5 album it's up to snuff-- as pleasant and listenable as their previous peak, The Lonesome Death of Buck McCoy. So act now! Act now! Act... ah, forget it.

Where the Dream Syndicate specialized in American underground rock via anyone from The Byrds to Neil Young to the Velvet Underground, Last Days of May are defiantly acidic; their exhaustive, instrumental psych-rock jams will vastly disappoint anyone expecting even the slightest concession to his paisley pop past. Anyone ostensibly lining up for full-throttle space noise might be underwhelmed too, by the distracting lack of edge or even direction throughout Inner System Blues, the band's third release, recorded live. Could it be freaking out is harder than it seems? The most interesting action occurs when Last Days of May inject more than just atmospheric asides into the music: ""Rangerland/Bewitched"" comes on like the skeletal cousin of Can's ""Pinch"", replete with insistent James Brown beat on loan, and barely-there low-end, courtesy of Thomas Howard, who seems to have attended the Holger Czukay school of minimalist bass work. At the same time-- despite omnipresent congas-- it isn't terribly exotic, and that's fine as spacing out may not have been the point. Its rhythmic drive keeps the moss off, which is more than I can say for tunes like ""Drive, It Said"", a monstrously lengthy excursion into uncharted waters most bands purposely steer clear of: A wah-wah pedal and extra reverb too easily decay into unraveled yarn. Twelve minutes in, when it's clear the ""climax"" was that sort-of head-banging beat accompanied by even more wah and reverb, I wonder 1) why they couldn't arrive there sooner, and 2) if they might've fared better editing these pieces-- a la Can or Miles' In A Silent Way-- into something at once compact, and even more out there. ""Solitary Realizer Vehicle"" picks up the mess where ""Drive"" leaves off, though luckily it drops a semi-massive acid riff a few minutes in. It doesn't take very long for the band to begin another freeform jazz-rock (or is it rock-jazz?) odyssey, but they keep the pulse, which takes some of the murk out of their sound. At one point, Precoda's guitar sounds eerily close to some of Hendrix's spacier concert escapades, without quite the overdriven bravado. Ultimately, Inner System Blues meanders more than it initiates discovery: The music never breaks through to the other side.","Karl Precoda formed Last Days of May in the mid 90s, almost a decade after leaving his former band, the ...

Kicker in Tow,Hangedup,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c053eb335119a49ed389/1:1/w_160/c3a9a3a5.jpg,2003-02-17 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3731-kicker-in-tow/,Constellation,"What images would this album conjure if it came in a plain sleeve, without song titles? Or if we didn't know it was released on Constellation Records, the label famous for Godspeed You! Black Emperor and other bands that champion repetitive instrumentals with an anti-capitalist subtext? I ask because the packaging of Kicker in Tow, the second album by Montreal's Hangedup, bears images of workers and Olympians racing through giant iconic gears straight out of Metropolis. Song titles like ""Moment for the Motion Machine"" and ""Automatic Spark Control"" evoke the burdens of industry, where we can assume that the proletariat's getting the short end of the paradigm. But is that prejudicial? Hangedup has given us a context to hang onto, but the music brings the anxiety: The first track, ""Kinetic Work"", decks you with an urgency reminiscent of CNN's ""A Nation at War"" theme music. Even when the pace slows the mechanical clamor never lets up. But describing this in industrial terms may be misleading, because these are two acoustic musicians, and they conjure these images impressionistically, with organic, rather than rigid, music. Hangedup is the duo of Genevi√®ve Heistek on viola, and Eric Craven on drums and percussion; both are also members of the band Sackville. (Sackville bassist Harris Newman guests on a track, and to keep it in the Constellation family, GY!BE member Efrim Menuck recorded it.) Their duet project, however, is massive. Heistek bows with a fine tone but a welder's touch, sawing raw waves of notes to stay above Craven's busy yet austere drumming. There's some overdubbing, and Heistek throws in some pedal-triggered samples, but that just accentuates the band's girth: This isn't a duo that sounds like a full band, so much as two people who tread like giants. From the brief ""Moment for the Motion Machine"", which sounds like a small hammer tapping an anvil, to the heavy, almost danceable ""View from the Ground"", the nine tracks sound not like songs so much as individual machines that get switched on, whirr, and shut down again. ""Motorcycle Muffler"" demonstrates a steady build-up but only the longest piece, the twelve-minute ""No More Bad Future"", has truly fluid development; and while some tracks are springier than others, the dark mood only lifts on the last one, ""Broken Reel"" (presumably meaning a dance). Its role on the disc is less clear: Is this where the workers find their way to freedom and the clouds break? Does the more natural rhythm counteract what preceded it? Or did they just want to end on a high note? Hangedup can sound like a one-trick pony, in spite of how awesome that trick is. The acoustic-industrial sound starts off innovative, but you can get tired of listening to ""CHUGGA-CHUGGA-CHUGGA-CHUGGA-CHUGGA-CHUGGA-CLANG-CLANG-CLANG-CLANG."" And compositionally it might be tighter if they trimmed the pieces to a concise suite-- say, the kind of thing you'd hear from the percussion-friendly new music ensemble Bang on a Can. But Bang on a Can never rock this hard: For sheer proletariat energy, Heistek and Craven knock down all contenders.

Love or Perish,Pocket Rockets,by: Brian James,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0b89d034d5c69bf27b9/1:1/w_160/f3c45739.gif,2003-02-17 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6360-love-or-perish/,Teenbeat,"From the sound of their debut album Love or Perish, Pocket Rockets appear to have spent a lot of time splashing around in the musical backwaters of the sixties and seventies, soaking up records like ""The Little Black Egg"", whose earnest failure to win widespread acceptance finds a more self-conscious articulation in this modern resurrection. The Rockets position themselves as defiant outsiders, kids who look on with a mixture of jealousy and disgust at their popular counterparts. This snooty imagery is aided by the fact that the band are still teenagers and sing about the sometimes petty concerns of their age. Though the world would scarcely be a poorer place if all the collected teen angst were swept into the Atlantic, the Pocket Rockets are at least intriguing enough to make you think twice before you break out the push brooms. Love or Perish announces itself as lo-fi early on, but despite the inevitable accompaniment of insularity, bratty sneers and hiss flatter the music more often than not. The Rockets seem as if they're coming in from far away, like a radio station that barely comes in as you drive through a spooky small town late at night. There's something penetratingly strange about their songs, as their straight pop becomes unintentionally twisted in the process of trying to play it well. All three members-- Carmen Clark on vocals and bass, Lili Schulder on guitar, and Mat Lewis on drums-- are much longer on imagination than chops, and this gives them a na√Øve if not quite primitive quality. With such limited artifice at their command, it's natural that Love or Perish sounds less like an album than a diary, with all the strengths and weaknesses of unrestrained exhibition. Periodically egocentric, cliched and clumsy-- ""Cookie Blows a Fag"" is a tipsy, more leaden ""Arnold Layne"" if ever there was one-- Love or Perish has its selling points. In addition to plucky songwriting, its sheer honesty offers a voyeuristic thrill: Clark sounds naked to the point of sexual, even when her subjects are far removed from impure thoughts. She reveals the good and the embarrassing in equal measure, but the more blushingly confessional she gets, the more candid, unrefined and gloriously nasty the record sounds. Pocket Rockets should be given points for rawness, but they might gain or lose a few depending on whether they chose rawness or it chose them. A major question remains: How will an audience receive them in the bitchy, trendy world they tread? With the more bluesy garage revivals, singers recite their problems for the sake of the audience, for explanation and ensuing empathy. Robert Johnson would interject, ""You know what I'm talkin' 'bout,"" and you would. The Pocket Rockets don't appear to care if you know what they're talkin' 'bout: Their music is not designed to be universal, rather firmly personal, and without apologies. Whether this strikes you as solipsistic or bold depends on your proximity to the band's point of view. Either a quintessential cult record or another cocky slice of childish bombast, Love or Perish is still a more personal confession than many of its posey peers.","From the sound of their debut album Love or Perish, Pocket Rockets appear to have spent a\n\ lot of ...

Incest Live,Sutekh,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5e8ea9e61561daa524b/1:1/w_160/e6034e02.jpg,2003-02-16 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7638-incest-live/,Force Inc,"To my ears, Sutekh's debut full-length, periods.make.sense, was very average. Occasionally when I'm scanning the S section of my collection I'll think to myself, ""Oh yeah, I have the first record by Sutekh, that guy Seth Horvitz from San Francisco who hangs out with Kit Clayton."" And then I think, ""Right, so. what else do I have here..."" There were some interesting moments on periods.make.sense and a good track or two, but I pretty much tuned Sutekh out after giving it a dozen spins. There's so much music to hear these days-- much more music than time-- that a ho-hum debut is all it takes to be removed from my list. So I missed Fell, which I kept hearing was quite good, and after hearing Sutekh's second release of last year, called Incest Live, I certainly believe it. Simply put, the progression from periods.make.sense to Incest Live is astounding. On the former, Sutekh sounded like just another practitioner of glitch-ridden, dubby techno, one without any sort of definable sonic signature, and the way the record alternated between the uptempo 4/4 tracks and dull ambient washes killed any sort of momentum. Incest Live, on the other hand, is pretty much a model record in terms of overall structure and pacing, and there's more to absorb every time you hear it. Despite the title, this not a live album. Instead, Incest Live was constructed using the techniques Sutekh uses for his live sets, drastic real-time manipulation of existing tracks from all of his records. I can't say how any of these bits and pieces might differ from their counterparts on Fell or his many twelve-inches, but I do know that whatever elements remain from periods.make.sense are transformed so radically (and improved in the process) as to make them effectively new pieces. In any case, Incest most obviously mimics a live album in the way it segues seamlessly from one segment to the next. It sounds like it could be an excellent DJ mix-- it has a real arc and story to it, but the tracks are all Sutekh. With fifteen distinct tracks spread out over about 44 minutes, Incest Live has a lot of variety. Though beats dominate, Sutekh approaches his ""set"" here like someone who wants to squeeze a maximum number of ideas into his allotted time. Odd ringing sounds will appear for the first time 2/3 of the way through one track and then form the hook of the next. The age-old mixer trick of dropping the track out repeatedly on the beat is thrown in. Fifteen seconds of a piano sonata will surface from nowhere only to disappear again into the static fog. There's a lot of sound to digest, but Sutekh makes it easy. Above all, Incest Live is danceable. Some of the beats veer toward house, others are classic techno, and then in more cluttered passages they take on an almost tribal, neo-industrial flavor, but the important thing is that you want to keep moving. The way the tracks maintain such a sense of funky propulsion while managing to incorporate about 58,782 different squiggly computer noises is amazing, and it makes me wonder if this is what Autechre might have sounded like had they gone in a dance direction instead of disappearing up their own assholes (it should be said that they still do some interesting things up there occasionally). As demonstrated here on Track 7 (no song titles), Sutekh has a real skill in taking a seemingly random assemblage of glitches, clicks, taps, and banging noises and wrapping them around a killer bassline, allowing them to come together as something soulful and, dare I say it, catchy. Next time you want to spend \xBE of an hour listening to beat-driven IDM you could do a hell of a lot worse.","To my ears, Sutekh's debut full-length, periods.make.sense, was very\n\ average.

Jerusalem,Steve Earle,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbdc13d197565213b1a9/1:1/w_160/e90305aa.jpg,2003-02-16 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2647-jerusalem/,ArtemisE-Squared,"Maybe when I'm pushing 40, and I've survived heroin addiction and plowed through six wives (as this artist, pushing 50, has), I'll ""get"" Steve Earle, or be able to get excited by him, because from where I'm sitting, his albums consistently sound like the kind of stuff that folks over 35 find ""edgy"" or ""raw."" Lucinda Williams, 50 this year, would be his female counterpart. Having heard the best moments of, say, Will Oldham and Cat Power (for all their melodrama and actorly distance), I am loathe to describe the Earle/Williams catalog as ""haunting"" or ""intimate."" Though some of their work is stunning (2-3 songs per album), one has to adjust to the borderline overproduction and to the straightjacket of trad-songcraft. I'm willing to bet you an illiterate folk artist's lucky paintstick that some of the Earle/Williams praise comes by default, because they use elements of country in ways that are exponentially more interesting than their competition (the committee-written popaganda leaking from the bowels of whatever lunkhead cowboy or smiley slutloaf got corralled into sing-slinging it), the same way the dithering, blah Democrats can seem noble next to Ashcroft's Army. That political analogy is apt, too, if one compares, say, Ford truck pitchman Alan Jackson's (complete with requisite parenthetical) ""Where Were You (When The World Stopped Turning)"" to Earle's ""John Walker's Blues"". Jackson's 9/11 song is a predictable piece of vaguely Christian know-nothingism, with the very telling line, ""I watch CNN but I'm not sure I can tell you/ The difference in Iraq and Iran."" (I immediately thought of an acquaintance who has lectured me on the Bible, but who asked, when the U.S. started bombing Afghanistan, ""Is Israel Islam?"") Earle's song is an agenda-less character study of a confused everyteen with a martyr complex on a search for meaning beyond ""MTV"" and ""the soda pop ads."" Where Jackson's gesture required only Nashville greed-sap gumption, Earle's song took cojones, especially if you remember the climate into which the song was released, a phase of kneejerk ""No Muslims Allowed"" nationalism that some of us in 2003 look back on laughingly, like unfortunate bangs captured in a yearbook photo or a Stevie B. cassingle under the bed, as if our flaggery was an odd fad in which we goofily got caught up. For all the bluster over ""John Walker's Blues"", the song merely aims to humanize an enemy/unpopular perspective, down to its chant fade-out. But we Americans often just want to perceive our enemies as they're presented in Independence Day, as alien and cultureless insect-like villains, just black circles to shoot out of the sky (see WWII portrayals of the Japanese, etc). So Earle risked bristling the reactionary segment of his audience, an audience he has fostered over the course of a slew of albums on which he has been a ""progressive,"" but Nascar-twangy version of the Midwest's Mellencamp, the Northeast's Springsteen, or the South's-but-he-doesn't-flaunt-it Tom Petty. His audience expanded particularly after The Mountain, his all-bluegrass album (only hinted at by the sinister banjo of this record's song ""for"" the wrongly-convicted West Memphis 3, ""The Truth""). Webboard damnations of Jerusalem aren't hard to find, and even Amazon customer reviews contain someone spooked by ""Satanic"" and ""demonic"" vocal effects (""Ashes to Ashes"" is tuff-Earle, sounding campier than Vincent Price) and someone abandoning Earle due to the ""liberal agenda fest"" of his ""social commentary."" Yes, seven of this album's eleven tracks qualify as commentary, but except for bassline-driven ""America v. 6.0 (The Best We Can Do)"", which is a kind of ""Like a Rolling Stone"" account of complacent former activists, most of the critiquin' is done so allegorically or abstractly that it could qualify as storytelling. That means four of the songs are standard singer/songwriter fare, catchy love-ditties (such as the duet with Emmylou Harris, ""I Remember You"") or fuzzy mythmaking (such as ""Shadowland""). The closer, and title track is an ambitiously optimistic but ultimately frustrating song that tries to apply the ain't-we-all-god's-chilluns syncretism of ""John Walker's Blues"" to the Middle East. The song also borrows ""I may be a dreamer"" logic from John Lennon's blues, ""Imagine"". But ""Imagine"" was an atheist utopian fantasy, whereas Earle's ""Jerusalem"" pines for a peace that will come from ""the children of Abraham"" on ""the ground where Jesus stood."" Though Earle admits he sounds like a ""fool"" and sings of ""looking into his heart"" instead of subscribing to the defeatist attitude of the ""man on TV,"" the song is dang hard to take seriously because, even when you strip away the situation's socioeconomic muck and the occupation debate, you get, fundamentally: groups of racists chosen specially by their respective gods, murdering each other over the gods' specially chosen dirt. Earle's ""peace together"" is just too long a shot. You may have noticed how this review has been yammering almost exclusively about Earle's lyrics. That's not just because his narratives are abubble with big ideas, or because I assume you know his gruff-to-nasal voice, but because, aside from the occasional Eastern touch, or smoking blues-harp solo, or Gary Numan-esque keyboard trill, the album's music is what you'd expect: Three minutes of radio-ready guitar-and-drum arrangements. Of the tone experiments, one really works (the Doug Sahm-ish zydecali-texmex immigrant's plea ""What's a Simple Man to Do?"") and one fails horribly (the female call-and-responders of ""Conspiracy Theory""). While Earle could be commended for his tireless examination of the death-penalty or for distributing, on his label, the great what-if-Costello-led-a-cowpunk-bar-band Six String Drag, I can only say that his new album is ""good, for what it is,"" and that is still a great concession for ears honed to more expansive sonic approaches. So if you ever had a fusion snob successfully argue to you that The Replacements were just overrated bash-n-pop (I mean, look at Westerberg now, and Tommy Stinson's next band was even called Bash & Pop), you won't find anything of value in Jerusalem's music. These tried-and-true structures can seem fried-and-false. Though Earle comes off as more a son of Dylan than Jakob, Bob at 60 writes much fresher songs, songs that one doesn't have to be weathered to enjoy.","Maybe when I'm pushing 40, and I've survived heroin addiction and plowed through six wives (as this artist ...

Looks at the Bird,Brokeback,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3aab1335d7bf169879c/1:1/w_160/c42f5421.jpg,2003-02-16 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/950-looks-at-the-bird/,Thrill Jockey,"Those of you who think music critics are just opinionated jerks who do no real work may wish to consider the following: Every so often, we're called upon to review something like this new Brokeback record. Reviewing a record like this is like reviewing a baked potato: You already know if you like baked potatoes, and you already know if you're in the mood for one right now, and there's not much to add in the way of qualitative commentary. The nature of this particular baked potato is as follows: Brokeback is the side project of one Douglas McCombs, who plays bass for Eleventh Dream Day, and perhaps more notably, Tortoise. McCombs is responsible for those rich, languid, highly-melodic basslines that make up so much of Tortoise's personality, and Brokeback records tend to sound as if someone has taken a few of those basslines and stuck them alone next to a little pond so they can chill out and reflect. (In fact, both of the project's previous full-lengths have featured tracks on which McCombs borrows and rearranges his riffs from proper Tortoise albums.) In Brokeback, McCombs collaborates with Chicago Underground Quartet bassist Noel Kupersmith. McCombs mostly plays six-string bass; Kupersmith mostly plays upright. The regular cast of locals drops by to contribute here and there; John McEntire on drums and organ, Chad Taylor on just drums, and the honorary locals from Stereolab-- Laetitia Sadier and the late Mary Hansen-- on largely wordless vocals. If you remember what horn Rob Mazurek plays, chances are you've already heard this record. That's the schedule of particulars. Note that some of us have fondish memories of a time, in Chicago, when one could buy several albums a week and find at least one of those people playing something on it. This was a time when there were two dozen different bands filed under the TORTOISE/SEA & CAKE sections of local record stores (yes, they used to be together), when handwritten stickers pimped half of everything else as ""w/members of... something or other,"" when every week brought some new permutation of the same guys doing mellow, contemplative records full of bossa rhythms, vibraphones, and squidgy synths, records that seemed to lay back and scratch their chins and say: ""Indeed, quite so, my dear Pilkington, but what of Brecht's writings on the matter?"" Those days are now over and suspiciously large numbers of people deny having enjoyed them. I am not ashamed: I enjoyed them immensely. But what interests me now is that, with the exception of Gastr del Sol's Camoufleur, it's the flotsam and jetsam of the scene, not the flagship releases, that holds up the best: I have dug out the solo album by The Sea and Cake's Sam Prekop at least a dozen times over the past year, and Tortoise's Millions Now Living Will Never Die not once. What seems to be operating, at present, is a free pass for being, well... unassuming, and it's on these grounds that this Brokeback album sounds as good as it does. Because this is, as mentioned, a good solid potato: Unsurprising, and not much of a main course, but a tasty and satisfying side dish nonetheless. There are the contemplative bass duets; there are the daintily progressing builds of subtle drum programming and subtler melodies; there is the old post-rock sense of listening to folk songs from some yet to be discovered cartoon planet where the landscape is awfully scenic-- and, thankfully, everyone involved seems to know exactly what that counts for these days, so they offer it up smiling. If you already know this drill, you already know what you think of it. If you don't, this isn't the worst place in the world to sample it. It helps to have hardwood floors and natural sunlight and lots of plants and enjoy lying in bed pretending you live in Paris or Tokyo in the year 2100. It helps if you ride lots of super-modern trains or like things that are very clean and lie at right angles to one another. It helps if you like to hear the faint, pleasant echo of Chicago post-rock, bouncing nostalgically around an empty apartment after everyone's already decided to pretend they're not listening.","Those of you who think music critics are just opinionated jerks who do no real work may wish to consider ...

More Parts Per Million,The Thermals,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a76613d19756521393e5/1:1/w_160/2c66063e.jpg,2003-02-16 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7990-more-parts-per-million/,Sub Pop,"Starting a band with an ""all-star lineup"" is often a foolproof recipe for overblown egos, Rick Wakeman-sized hairdos, and-- last but not least-- shitty music. Take Zwan: Each of its members started out in decent if not great bands, yet they're content playing whatever melody Billy Corgan sees fit to shit out of his guitar, presumably with the ultimate goal of a payoff to fund their better, post-Zwan projects. But what happens if your all-star lineup has the star power of...the twins from Double Trouble, with a devoted cult following but nothing to inspire capes or facepaint. Therein lies the exception: A semi-all-star lineup that's not necessarily doomed from the start. The Portland, Oregon-based Thermals feature Hutch Harris (of Hutch & Kathy, formerly known as Urban Legends), Kathy Foster of the All-Girl Summer Fun Band (also Kathy from Hutch & Kathy), Jordan Hudson of Operacycle, and Ben Barnett (lead singer, Kind of Like Spitting). They automatically have one up on Zwan in the cuteness category; let's explore the other areas in which The Thermals excel. First of all, The Thermals break out of the twee/emo/instru-jazz constructs of the bands they steal members from by gumming up their tight, yet spastic three-chord punk rock with heaps of skuzzy production and hip-cocking sass. Every melodic moment of More Parts Per Million sounds as if punctuated by an exclamation point, as Harris sings in a nasal Valley Girl accent: ""Stuff your sentences into your boring diary!/ Stuff your senses into the back of your jeans!"" The melodies aren't entirely unfamiliar, and the overall sound doesn't diverge much from itself, but the stickiness of the choruses is undeniable. Fuzzy, static guitar and cymbal-crazy drums spew like a bursting pi√±ata in every song, all about fucking shit up, though never in the nu-punk, armchair anarchist sense. Thankfully, The Thermals aren't victims of the Sub Pop Curse. Every third Sub Pop band in the new millennium has had a really specific, contrived theme-- usually based around a blatant nod to some ""era""-- but The Thermals' steez is based more on the loose idea of doing all you can now, 'cause fuck, man, you're gonna be dead soon. ""Get fat and waste/ Get smashed in the face,"" Harris advises in ""It's Trivia"". Later in the song, he admonishes you to do whatever the hell you feel: ""It's only trivia, so don't freak out!"" From any other voice, these words might carry a more nihilistic or apathetic meaning, but Harris winds the essence of teenage exuberance through a megaphone in the span of three great seconds. Musically, The Thermals can't compare to a real supergroup: Supergroups tend to be funny, where The Thermals are simply fun. A more accurate comparison would be to Guided by Voices, because-- oh yeah!-- The Thermals do sound a lot like them. Harris recorded More Parts Per Million in his basement (dubbed ""Moss Motel""), and Chris Walla (aka the Dad of the Pacific Northwest) mixed it so that every note sounds wrapped in cracked, crunched tinfoil. Not to diss on the vast legacy of Bob Pollard & Co., but it's such old news, I like The Thermals better: They sound like a fresher, more excited (younger), less boozy version of GBV. For all the easy outs I could take to crash this party, More Parts Per Million taught me not to glorify the past.","Starting a band with an ""all-star lineup"" is often a foolproof recipe for overblown egos, Rick\n\ Wakeman-sized hairdos, and-- ...

Journey Through a Burning Brain (Anthology),Tangerine Dream,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7295e6ef95969320eea/1:1/w_160/4ebca77f.jpg,2003-02-13 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7930-journey-through-a-burning-brain-anthology/,SanctuaryCastle,"There's a case to be made for Tangerine Dream as being among the most historically important experimental German bands from the early 70s. Beyond the fact that their mastery of all manner of synthesizer technology predated the digital boom in the 80s, they're arguably the grandfathers of ambient music (despite what the church of Eno may preach). Edgar Froese's outfit began as one of many rambunctious noisemakers in Berlin in the late 60s, but has survived as one of the most long-lived groups in rock. Of course, the group has tweaked their sound considerably over the years, and this curious set, containing one disc of early 70s pieces, and two of mid-80s live tracks, makes clear that not every chapter in Froese's manual is required reading. The first disc in the box contains the most interesting music, by a considerable margin. Covering the underrated early period of the band on Ohr Records (1970-73), the sounds are spacey, spacious and determinedly sprawling. ""Genesis"" and ""Cold Smoke"" are both taken from the band's first release, Electronic Meditation, the only record to feature future kosmiche icons Klaus Schultz and Conrad Schnitzler (later of Kluster). Similar to their peers Guru Guru, Ash Ra Tempel (also featuring Shultz) and Amon D√º√ºl II, Tangerine Dream were, at this point, about freeform mind-expansion, and that alone: ""Cold Smoke"" rumbles and skirts via heavily reverbed crashing drums, maniacal violin, post-Hendrix guitar ejaculation and even an excitable vagrant shouting cosmic obscenities in the distance. ""Fly and Collision of Comas Sola"" and ""Sunrise in the Third System"" are taken from the group's second album, Alpha Centauri, with Chris Franke and Steve Schroyder replacing Schultz and Schnitzler. Keyboards began to play a greater part in the arrangements (as well as flute here), but the general ticket was still an acid-laced blur. In 1972, Tangerine Dream released their early masterpiece, Zeit (featuring Peter Baumann, and completing one of the most longstanding of the band's lineups), and because Castle Music felt the need to whip me into submission with two discs of live meh from the 80s, only one track from that double LP is included. That's too bad, because ""Origin of Supernatural Probabilities"" represents a command of sound on par with the greatest studio masters. The opening guitar chords sound as if they were recorded under two feet of water, and when the synth begins to babble and whales begin to cry, I'd as soon sport gills as leave my stereo. Simply put, 70s electronic music does not get better than this-- unless you count their follow-up, 1973's Atem, of which two pieces are included on this set: The Mellotron-soaked nature hymn ""Fauni Gena"" and an atypical vocal (of sorts) track ""Wahn"", also featuring primal percussion akin to that on the first record. Now, skip forward about 10 or 12 years to the mid-80s, when Tangerine Dream had become quite a different beast. Gone were the psychedelic trance-outs and echo chambers, replaced by big light shows and Jan Hammer's drum machine. In fact, Froese and company were still playing psychedelic music, but what that meant 20 years removed from the era was much different; they were providing escapists soundtracks for the overstressed and nostalgic alike, far from the boundless ""mind-expansion"" of a bygone time. And yes, I absolutely abhor those crystalline, programmed 80s beats-- Mannheim Steamroller at Christmas is one thing, but I will not stand idly by and listen to men who once tripped like kings through the nether regions of consciousness play crowd-control for yuppies. That said, if you don't pay attention-- and that's the real difference: early Tangerine Dream was good for escapism and repeated, detail-obsessed listening-- some of this works as decent background pitter-patter. Not surprisingly, the better tracks are the longest: the 22-minute ""Poland"" begins as a practically unlistenable exercise in new age pep, but does have scattered moments of old-fashioned krautrock whim, particularly during the parts that forgo dance beats for drone. And it's not as if Tangerine Dream + dance music is a necessarily bad concept (why hasn't there been a movement to remix these guys, a la Kraftwerk's The Mix or Can's Sacrilege?), but this stuff is perilously close to skincare instructional video soundtracks. Just when I thought it couldn't get worse, disc three drops ""Song of the Whale"", parts one and two! Wow. In summary, skip this set and check out the early Tangerine Dream records instead-- they're all being remastered (with bonus tracks!), hopefully making Journey Through a Burning Brain obsolete sooner rather than later.","There's a case to be made for Tangerine Dream as being among the most\n\ historically important experimental German ...

Univers Zen ou de Z√©ro √† Z√©ro,Acid Mothers Temple,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299feec0084474cd0bfa3c/1:1/w_160/9ed293b4.gif,2003-02-13 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/19-univers-zen-ou-de-zero-a-zero/,Fractal,"God bless AMT. You know, in all the commotion over sorting through the silo of Makoto Kawabata related releases last year, it seems we plum forgot to write about the best one. Nothing personal, you understand, but sweet heavens he put out a lot of stuff. He's still putting out a lot of stuff, not least of which are the ""space opera"" St. Captain Freak Out & The Magical Bamboo Request (which actually preceded this Univers Zen thing), Live in Japan, and the unnecessarily-three-parted Magical Power from Mars series. For most bands, issuing enough material for better than six LPs in a year would tip off their opportunist intentions to steal your money and valuable listening time. Hell, AMT probably are trying to steal your money-- but when the stash is as potent as even their least inspired hyper-cosmic overload, bang for the buck doesn't seem like a major issue. For the discriminating consumer (i.e., the ones who can afford a maximum of three new AMT records per year), the question of how Univers Zen ou de Z√©ro √† Z√©ro distinguishes itself amongst the band's other records becomes paramount. I should note that finding a place to start in their discography can be a mind-enslaving task in itself, especially when you take into account compilations and reissues, almost all of which contain different tracks than the original releases-- even Kawabata couldn't locate the cover of one of his records on the Acid Mothers website. All of that said, this record would be a very nice place for someone who had never heard the band to start, as well as being a watermark release for longtime fans. They didn't have to make it so easy, but they did. The opener, ""Electric Love Machine"", takes its cue from the preceding LP, Electric Heavyland, in name and sound: The intro guitar figure and uptempo drum skiffle do little to prepare us for onslaught of distorted wah-wah mayhem and good old-fashioned psychedelic space noises that splash themselves all across the stereophonic plane. In the midst of this glorious mess, Cotton Casino's vocal threatens, for one verse, to bring the noise back down to earth and into more traditional hippie jam-band realms, but then Hiroshi Narazaki's (Les Rallizes D√©nud√©s) guitar joins with Kawabata and turns my speakers into ramshackle fuzz boxes with what sounds like two or three different solos happening at once. And yet, despite the general chaos, when Casino's vocal returns, it's apparent that AMT are playing their version of pop (verse - CCCCHHHHOOOOORRRRRRUUUUUSSSSS - verse). But then the solos come back, and the space noises, and maybe I wasn't really onto something there with the pop thing. But I'm catching up! ""Ange Mecanique de Saturne"" is a very pretty lullaby/hymn featuring Casino's entirely convincing childlike coo, and acoustic guitar played with more understated care than you'd think anyone involved in the previous tune would be capable of. Stepping back, the form is actually similar to ""Love Machine"", in its verse/really long solo/verse structure, but the execution is the key: Unlike most of their noisy peers, AMT have a way of bringing out aspects of psychedelia like wonder and naivet√© which lend their more bombastic moments all the more impact. The centerpiece of this album is the epic ""Soleil de Cristal et Lune d'Argent"", beginning as an ominous, almost regal cosmic march, led by strident piano, crashing drums, acoustic guitar, and Casino's disembodied, but persistent chant. AMT has often opted for lengthy excursions into the unknown, but have rarely sounded so mythic as they do on this piece. When the pace picks up for the middle solo section (see a pattern?), anyone with even a drop of Pagan blood will be up in arms with glee. Casino and a host of other singers return for a finale almost operatic in its grandeur, and if I didn't suspect that these guys would probably release 4-6 more in the next few months, I'd call it a masterpiece. On the other hand, I could just enjoy the moment; AMT are making out well enough doing so.","God bless AMT.

Yank Crime,Drive Like Jehu,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba205e6ef95969322b1a/1:1/w_160/4251776f.jpg,2003-02-13 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2459-yank-crime/,InterscopeInterscope,"""And the watchman told, saying, He came even unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he driveth furiously...""
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†(2 Kings 9:20) San Diego's Drive Like Jehu were always Old Testament kinda guys: locusts, rats, frogs-- you name it, they could summon it forth from their amps with a simple touch of pick to string if you claimed to worship any Band before them. Now, hardness of that scale can tend to push a group toward the fringe, but for DLJ, it led to indecent propositions from Interscope, an improbably good album (you know, the one you're reading about), and, even more improbably, a place in the indie rock canon that seems to have been progressively solidifying since the moment they split up. Post-unfortunate-breakup, things seemed to be going pretty well for the ex-band and their opus, until the illusion of major-label visibility caught up to them. Without a moneymaker to shake, Yank Crime fell through the slit in Interscope's big dollar-sign sack and into the proverbial cracks. Fortunately, Jehu's John Reis hates out-of-printness like Yahweh hates a sinner, and so, thanks to a reissue on his own Swami label, Yank Crime broke the ""obscure classic"" yoke for good this past November. Rick Froberg and John Reis, of course, are well-rooted in indie history. Prior to forming Drive Like Jehu, they had a band called Pitchfork (no relation); while playing with DLJ, Reis fronted (and continues to front) Rocket from the Crypt; and more recently, the pair begat Hot Snakes. So why Yank Crime should be singled out from the continuity of the duo's output is a perfectly reasonable question. It'd be bullshit to claim that DLJ's dalliance in time signatures gave them any great intellectual edge over their relations; in fact, the aim with this record (and to a lesser extent, the duo's similarly awesome debut) was to see just how messy math could get. ""Luau"", a solid 9\xBD minutes of shifting, epic muck in the middle of the album, is a strong contender for that (or any) crown. Somehow, though, it's still a sing-along, with Froberg and Thingy's Rob Crow exchanging weird, plaintive, and perfectly placed cries of ""Aloha! Suit up!"" Same goes for the sprawling ""Do You Compute"": Every shard of feedback, icy harmonic blast, and doomed-out power chord refers back to and revolves around Froberg's desperate repetition of the titular mantra. So, could be it's the tunes. Opening an album with a song as bracingly great as ""Here Come the Rome Plows"" would be a shot in the foot for almost any other band, with its snakepit verses and a chorus that goes from balled-up fists to open arms and back again before you can take a breath. ""Golden Brown"" does the same in almost half the time. These more straightforward songs sting like snowballs packed with rock-hard chunks of melody, and in each case, Froberg's voice abrades the solid lines down to the bare minimum, and the band fills in the resulting space with pure venom. It's often easy to forget that DLJ were considered emo in their day; Froberg's howls of ""Ready, ready to let you in!"" on ""Super Unison"" seem like a sick parody of stylish vulnerability. Then the song mutates into a gorgeous, snare-drum rolling open sea, and everything you've ever liked (and still like) about this genre in its purest form comes flooding back. Maybe it's that openness in spite of everything else that keeps bringing me back to Yank Crime. The unexpectedly delicate instrumental (now standard on most albums in the artsy-hard mode) ""New Intro"" drops the standoffishness for a minute or two before buzzing off in feedback, but the tactics are pretty much the same as on the rest of the album. You feel like something transcendentally wonderful is at the bottom of this shark tank; even if it means turning to chum, you can't help diving in. The reissue is, predictably, a little reticent with regard to bonus material, but it does include another out-of-print artifact (the 1992 ""Hand over Fist/Bullet Train to Vegas"" single), as well as the ""original version"" of the album closer ""Sinews"". It's hard to see the harmonic ""Yeah!""s and the shouted chorus of ""Hand over Fist"" as anything but Nirvanic (maybe that's what turned Interscope's collective head), while the straight thrash of ""Bullet Train to Vegas"" sounds more elemental. Both are catchy as hell and interesting as precursors; still, the hooks don't quite sink as deep. The revelatory new ""Sinews"", however, strips a few more layers off of the already raw album version, and the resulting bedroom angst is, disarmingly, almost cozy. Froberg's distant vocals and the band's narcoleptic start/stop timing tempt your ears closer and closer to the speakers; each time they blast you away, it's done with the cruel confidence of a band who's always known you'll be coming back for more.","""And the watchman told, saying, He came even\n\ unto them, and cometh not again: and the driving\n\ is ...

Here to There,DJ Spinna,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9cf5e6ef95969322a4f/1:1/w_160/39848608.jpg,2003-02-12 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2380-here-to-there/,BBE,"As part of the acclaimed hip-hop group Jigmastas, DJ Spinna rose to prominence with a catalog of tracks that exuded a diaphanous cool and open-air jazziness. Like fellow Beat Jedi Madlib, Spinna adhered to a jazz-based aesthetic but was willing to dig into other genre's for a pasticcio rewarding in its eclecticism. Although Spinna's religious approach to beat-mining resulted in some of the genre's slyest rhythms, Spinna's lyrical counterpart, Jigmasta MC Kriminul, wasn't the most compelling lyricist around-- at least, not for the duration of an entire album. Spinna then went on to more tangential projects, which reached a zenith in Strange Games and Things, an excellent cornucopia of 70s soul and rare-groove nuggets. Here to There marks Spinna's contribution to the excellent ""BBE Beat Generation"", a series that's yielded some of the most sought-after beatfests of the past two years, including excellent outings by the likes of legendary hip-hop producers Pete Rock, Jazzy Jeff, and Jay Dee. Although there's no mistaking Here to There for anything other than a hip-hop album, Spinna weaves a thick musical lattice of R&B;, house, jazz, and blues. Like DJ Shadow's classic Endtroducing, the breadth of music cultures covered on Here to There is nearly overwhelming, and once again reaffirms the producer's role as cultural archivist. But unlike Shadow's often sullenly aggressive and disparately derivative style, Spinna's vision of American music in the latter 20th century is irrefutably harmonious. For Here to There, Spinna mines the jazz cool of Art Blakey, the bittersweet swoon of classic Marvin Gaye, and the dancehall euphoria of Carl Craig. On ""Rock (Unplugged)"", Tortured Soul multi-instrumentalist Jay Rodriguez punctuates Spinna's ""rock the house"" cuts with blasts of sax while Ethan White adds a welcome Rhodes-fueled funk groove. ""Idols"" has a Wurlitzer twinkling atop shifting kool-jazz breaks as the sultry soultress Vinia Mojica slithers between subtle vibraphone tones. Spinna even harks back to his previous work on the house compilation Raiding the Crates for the broken beat production of ""Music and Me"". The guest MCs on Here to There are exceptional, and manage to maintain the vibe of eclecticism and optimism. A synth wobbles on top of a slow and sweet break as Shadowman reclaims his failures in a paean to self-determination on the stand-out ""Driven"". And the Apani B. Fly and Jean Grea guest spots on ""Hold"" are a testament to the increasing popular assertion that females are the future of hip-hop lyricism. Sometimes, though, the melding of different strains of music is almost too seamless. As flawlessly as everything blends, Here to There doesn't really suggest any new relationships between the various genres that Spinna incorporates. While aural fission is obviously something Spinna is trying to avoid at all costs, the music occasionally takes on the qualities of smooth jazz, especially on Soulive-backed track ""All Up in It"". Still, if the listener wants to be seduced by the music, rather than confronted and challenged, Here to There comes highly recommended.","As part of the acclaimed hip-hop group Jigmastas, DJ Spinna rose to prominence with a catalog of tracks that exuded ...

Nocturama,Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a561b1335d7bf1698bae/1:1/w_160/c0d5c488.jpg,2003-02-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1366-nocturama/,Anti-,"Until 1997, The Nick Cave Songbook read like a set of William Blake Mad Libs filled in by undertakers, jilted lovers and John Wayne Gacy, with a few American folk covers thrown in for variety. Cave had built his career and reputation on twenty glorious years of human misery; God was an alien creature to be feared, and true love was just the first step toward some poor soul meeting a gruesome end. But then, after the grisly Murder Ballads LP, it seems Nick and Jesus sat down and sorted out their differences. With The Boatman's Call and No More Shall We Part, the anger of Cave's youth had finally lapsed into spiritual angst; murderous desire had given way to simple longing. Now, I don't want to say specifically that Cave has been showing his age, but in a way, he's been driving with his turn signal on for the past couple albums. So when Nocturama was reported as an attempt to ""do it like they used to do it,"" referencing the prodigious output of his elder folk influences as well as the sturm-und-drang of his own early work, I furrowed my brow with concern. Could the passive, contemplative evangelist of ""As I Sat Sadly by Her Side"" summon even an ounce of the sulfurous hellfire he so elegantly spewed as recently as the immaculate Let Love In? I sincerely hoped so; lyrically, the elder Cave hadn't lost more than a step in decades, and the overwhelming emotional sincerity he'd laid bare was often stunning, but such exhaustive preaching could make Billy Graham blush. The skepticism, fortunately, was largely unfounded-- seemingly incompatible halves-of-self, the righteous and the damned, have indeed both come to play in Nocturama. Also, as it turns out, that's not nearly as impressive as it ought to be-- neither half puts its best foot forward. The languor of newer Cave material remains, albeit with a darker, more sorrowful air. Certain songs (""Wonderful Life"", ""Bring It On"") nod toward some of the apocalyptic prophecy of classics like ""Tupelo"", if minus the actual climaxes. He mercifully strays from redundant tales of religious salvation toward distinctly more personal issues of fulfillment (but never leaves Boatman's Call turf), and generally improves upon his last few outings. But with two (admittedly gigantic-- hold on) exceptions, Nocturama reneges on its promise-- something's still missing from most of these tracks. Where once the Mr. Cave and his Seeds unearthed the distinctive roots of Blues tradition, holding them aloft with bloody hands and the panache of a hellacious sideshow emcee, they continue to consciously avoid the schtick that made them indie darlings. Entertainingly dismal, piano-hearted tunes are the core instead, backed by uneasy strains of violins, haunting vocals, and funeral march percussion; in truth, it may still be the group's best work since Let Love In, but it had the potential to be so much more. Cave has clearly made a choice to embrace a more ""mature"" sound, and though I enjoyed older work more, it's hard to fault a man for a choice-- it's a strong album even if it doesn't stand up to his past greatness. Yet, when he goes and outdoes himself so remarkably on the very same album, it's even harder not to. Exhibits one and two: ""Dead Man in My Bed"" and ""Babe, I'm on Fire"". This is what a real fusion of the old firebrand and the mature musician should sound like; the passion and aggression of ""Deanna"", or ""Janglin' Jack"", minus the raunch, with superior arrangements and musicianship. ""Fire"" closes with fourteen minutes of flawless, incendiary madness; The Bad Seeds produce a Latin-and-blues-tinged collage of shredded organ and guitar strings, dub bass, and Cave at his howling, vitriolic best. It fits squarely in his personal hall of fame, and in particular makes a moldy joke of the remainder of Nocturama; they didn't all need to be this good, but a few more stormy rattlings of this caliber are sorely missed. He's obviously more than capable of it. Lyrically, at least, Nocturama demonstrates (like most everything he's done) why Cave consistently earns votes for all-time vocal achievement, but it's rarely more appreciated than on a tune of such grandiosity. Cave sings even such mind-bending lines as, ""The Viennese vampire says it/ The cowboy 'round his campfire says it/ The game show panelist/ The Jungian analyst says/ Babe, I'm on fire,"" with convincing zealousness. What should never work does. There are supposedly a few more albums on the way soon, and all that can be done is hope that he picks up where the hot streak of ""Babe, I'm on Fire"" leaves off, the way it ought to, with Nick not merely smoldering, but blazing.",,7.0,
Phoenix Album,The Warlocks,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9d45e6ef959693214a5/1:1/w_160/e8f52504.jpg,2003-02-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8585-phoenix-album/,Birdman,"Much has been said of L.A.'s Warlocks that contradicts my late, unfavorable opinion of their sophomore release on Birdman Records. ""All due respect to The Hives, Clinic, and the Soundtrack of Our Lives, but the best garage rock I heard in 2002 came from this Los Angeles quartet, which tapped into the darker psychedelic vibes of the classic Nuggets bands, with a heaping dose of The Velvet Underground and Spacemen 3 added on top. Not for nothing does the album open with a song called 'Shake the Dope Out'."" (Jim Derogatis, Chicago Sun-Times) ""Freak out, then, to 'Hurricane Heart Attack'-- a bastard brother of the Stones' 'Street Fighting Man' played with titanic slowness, that finds frontman Bobby Hecksher drawling 'I wanna hurricane heart attack/ I wanna hurricane/ Dressed in black.' A veritable Altamont of bad vibes!"" (NME) There is nothing, sad to say, that grabbed me about this record, a mix of calculated psychedelic garage and jaded indie rock that finds The Warlocks daringly aligning themselves with some pretty imposing ghosts of rock n' roll past in one breath: ""Imagine this: It's 1966, and you're at the Exploding Plastic Inevitable, in the Electric Circus, upstairs from The Dom in the East Village. The cavernous room throbs with pulsing strobe lights, while black and white scenes from Warhol's Chelsea Girl flicker on a freshly-painted rear wall. Onstage, The Velvet Underground are in the midst of a harrowing version of 'Heroin'."" (The Warlocks' online bio) Then refuting those very obvious influences with the next: ""I think that we live more in the 1980s. We are like The Butthole Surfers and The Flaming Lips back then. All that was what they called ""College Rock."" Those bands may have drawn from the 1960s. I don't think that we are going for any 1960s garage sound. You are going to get those comparisons that you would never expect. Just because we are on Bomp Records people make those comparisons. The label shouldn't dictate what people think about music. Unfortunately that happens sometimes."" (Guitarist JC Rees, interviewed by Insound) This is not Hear It Is or Hairway to Steven. The references to cocaine, the use of Hammond organs, sitars and high harmonies, and the painful, ""Wow, we look like Jefferson Airplane!"" live photos sure as shit brought the 1960s to mind, regardless of Rees' shpeal. Nowhere in the tired riffing, uninspired lyrics, and god-awful wankery on Phoenix Album did I hear a lick of the inspiration that makes The Flaming Lips and Butthole Surfers indie rock staples. What I did hear is a faceless, generic variation on the current indie rock obsession with minimal ancestors, in this case the late British invasion (The Animals, The Kinks) and the rough-around-the-edges garage rock of the Northwest (The Kingsmen, The Sonics), coupled with rigor mortis-stiff drumming and the most obvious elements of psychedelia, having more to do with fashion than fucking rock music. Add to that insipid lyrics about ""cool guitars"" and ""make-out sessions"" (""Baby Blue""), written and delivered in a Wayne Coyne nasal whine by frontman and former Beck session musician Bobby Hecksher, and you've got perfect background music for a straight-to-video Janeane Garofalo movie, replete with feedback outros and fuzzbox strumming that can't decide whether to try on a paisley shirt, or a flannel and some Doc Martins. If The Warlocks are trying to make the old new again, to blend the most relevant elements of post-Beatles acid art-rock with a swaggering post-punk sensibility, they've managed to make the old absolute shit instead. They're competent musicians, but so are half the bar bands in America. Proficiency and idol worship do not a standout release make. But then again: ""The Warlocks are creating sounds and sights that have been long needed and long forgotten during these synthetic times. A powerful, hallucinatory world with amazing pop songs and addictive guitar mayhem anchoring the trip. Why the visions of Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd or The Exploding Plastic Inevitable were left behind is a complete mystery to me. When I walked into my first Warlocks show, it was like getting a fix that I had needed for years."" (Dave Katznelson, Birdman Records owner) So who do you believe, music fans? Let's put it like this: If a chorus of ""Shake, shake, shake the dope out"" and endlessly droning, spiraling guitar solos (""Inside Out"", ""Oh Shadie"") are your ideas of a good time or a symbol of true musicianship, add two points to the Pitchfork rating above-- you've found another incredibly unoriginal band that's right up your vintage Vespa alley; if this kind of shit makes you fantasize about firebombing the nearest Fred's Guitar center, subtract two.","Much has been said of L.A.'s Warlocks that contradicts my late, unfavorable opinion of their sophomore release on ...

6,Supersilent,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5e0ea9e61561daa5239/1:1/w_160/acb54891.jpg,2003-02-11 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7628-6/,Rune Grammofon,"It's difficult for me to hear Norwegian music without tying it to ECM Records, the fine art label that has recorded some of the country's best jazz musicians and brought others from around the world to work with the locals. From the cover photos of winterscapes and frigid oil rigs that look so cold they make your teeth hurt, to the label's signature sound of vast reverb and chill precision, ECM was made for Norway. The label has indulged emotional high notes that would embarrass more straight-laced jazz players, but no matter what happens on an album, authenticity radiates from its musicians' independence: The music is framed, not molded. The experiences can be unabashededly rich or pure and still, but they always come directly from the players, who are effectively alone, responding directly to the moment. The Norwegian quartet Supersilent record for Rune Grammofon, but they're distributed internationally by ECM. In many ways, they'd be the perfect ECM band, though they have an edgier, almost sinister undercurrent that's unlike anything that label has approached. And for all the images they may summon, the band makes music as abstractly as possible: The albums and tracks are numbered, not titled; the personnel aren't listed on the cover; and for all the attempts to label them ""jazz,"" ""electronic"" or ""ambient"", the band eschews genres: The music's played so close to the vest that it slips under any classification. Supersilent is an electroacoustic ensemble, formed when the free jazz trio Veslefrekk-- Arve Henriksen on trumpet, keyboardist St√•le Storl√∏kken, and Jarle Vespestad on drums-- played a show with producer, live electronics artist and self-described ""audio virus"" Helge Sten (aka Deathprod). That show's success encouraged them to record a three-disc, three-hour set titled 1-3, which was an intense barrage of rhythms and assaulting sprays of electric noise, plus extras, like a monotonous voice reading instruction manuals. They reined it in slightly on the follow-up, 4, and in 2001, they released 5, culled from live recordings that changed the focus to slowly shifting textures and an almost ambient pace. But their latest album, 6, is their most engrossing and tactically varied yet. It's also the most accessible. For music this moody, it's surprising how neutral that mood turns out to be. The atmosphere is thick, but the band stays emotionally reserved. The sound is almost stoic; its sonic extremes don't so much as nudge the slow tempo or contemplative tone. A piece may be based on a repeating figure or simple rhythmic pattern, but that repetition comes from improvisation: Everything this group plays, every time, is improvised, and each track is presumably edited from a longer session. More to the point, it never settles: Vespestad never locks down the beat, the ambience never grows static, and they never make a noise just to fill space. You can't treat this as background music without getting distracted by the decisions being made at every second, and although the end result is restrained-- almost weirdly cool, even at its messiest-- it refuses to be anticipated. The electronics largely define Supersilent's music: Sten does live manipulations and processing, and, with Storl√∏kken, deploys sounds from the group's many synthesizers-- one of which is built around the sound processing chip of a Commodore 64. These sounds are incredibly varied, seemingly created with both state-of-the-art and harsh, lo-fi equipment. The keyboards crash like waves on ""6.5"", one emitting a howling, piercing noise that rises over a great shifting mass below, while on ""6.1"", the chords are neither bright nor dark, but neutral and stern, like stone chimneys of sound. Drummer Vespestad is a formidable improviser and colorist, though he plays with considerable (some would joke ""Scandinavian"") restraint. He shifts expertly around the keyboardists on ""6.1""; and on the erratic cat-and-mouse game of ""6.3"", Sten and Storl√∏kken chase each other, sneaking more and more quietly until Vespestad abruptly slams down on top of them. But Vespestad's jazz drumming comes through on ""6.2"", which emerges as the most strictly jazz-like track: It's similar to the measured pace and dark, giving textures of Miles Davis' 70s fusion ballads, which are also an influence on trumpeter Henriksen. Henriksen serves here as the soft voice against his colleagues: His tone sounds breathier and more faltering than Davis', but he also sometimes sings-- wordlessly, in a beautiful, pinched high voice-- and near the end, he even whistles, a lone, aching sound against a gently buzzing texture. 6 has gentler passages than Supersilent's previous albums; on ""6.4"", Sten's introduction of a guitar puts the group close to Sigur R√≥s or Godspeed You! Black Emperor-- two bands the label is gunning for as they convert new listeners abroad. But most post-rock sounds numbingly rigid next to this: Supersilent may go for a big finish but the crescendos can rise suddenly, or appear so roughly and naturally that it's obvious that no single player is forcing cues or smoothing out the arc. On those terms, ""6.4"" is both an easy entrance for new listeners and a pinnacle of everything the band strives for. Melodic without any set tune, it gently escalates on Sten's guitar and the warm synths, with what sounds like an autoharp interjecting in the background. The almost forlorn sentiments appear as the volume climbs, and even though a big finish seems inevitable, you can hear the band deciding moment by moment how to ascend and when to hit the climax. Every note is demandingly gorgeous, every phrase as solid but irregular as a natural object, and the majesty it achieves comes out jagged, loud and even harsh-- and it comes entirely from the musicians: It's a communication that's fierce, human, and immense.","It's difficult for me to hear Norwegian music without tying it to ECM Records, the fine art label that ...

Ally in the Sky,Bosco and Jorge,by: Kim Shannon,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a357b1335d7bf16986ec/1:1/w_160/5c6fffe4.gif,2003-02-11 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/874-ally-in-the-sky/,Sixgunlover,"Instrumental guitar-- specifically finger-picking-- has enjoyed a popular resurgence since Jim O'Rourke's Bad Timing and the coinciding revisionist revival of John Fahey's consistently challenging work by hipsters. The repetitive motifs and lingering gestures of a large percentage of underground music (results vary from Town and Country to Howard Hello) easily lend themselves to a shimmering, warm guitar tone. On top of that, it's a pretty interesting contrast to the Albini-inspired, sharp and brittle guitar splatters that round out the rest of independent rock. It's easy to drop Fahey's name in there as a representative for the phenomenon, but Fahey gets cited for the simple mention of the word ""finger-picking,"" rather than what his albums actually dealt with. America, certainly, and a distinct sense of pacing, yet what also shows up is some considerably intense personal conflict. 1967's Requia dealt with a loved one's mental breakdown; Fare Forward Voyagers (1974) showed Fahey looking into Buddhist religion, and 1997's City of Refuge offered a pretty bleak perspective on his once awe-enamored and surreal view of the world. Another defining aspect of Fahey's work: An overwhelming sense self-mockery and musical parody, represented most notably in his alter-ego, Blind Joe Death, and the opening track from Days Have Gone By. It's important to note that finger-picking is more than a technique; a genre was born through Fahey's experimentation, but by the time people like Leo Kottke and Robbie Basho were borrowing from the same American and World music roots, something had changed. A part of Fahey broke in his first couple of albums, a part he was reluctant to return to; his work got to be more and more adventurous, conforming less and less to the genre, while a whole culture of new age gurus began to devour the plaintive meditation his style engendered. Over the past decade and a half, more and more rock artists have borrowed from the golden age of instrumental guitar Fahey brough to bear. Independent music's martyrdom complex works its way into the somewhat sad, introspective music, while still containing those inherent themes of American cultural history embedded in the work. You know, for added depth. Thankfully, the new album by Bosco and Jorge doesn't conform to this tradition. Ally in the Sky certainly contains its share of American nostalgia, augmented with the familiar suspects (pedal steel, acoustic bass), yet isn't hell-bent on milking sympathy. Yes, there's repetition and contemplation, but there's also an incredible amount of joy: The pieces burst rather than brood. Looking at the performances on Ally in the Sky by veterans like Rob Mazurek and Fred Lonberg-Holm, one sees revelry and eruptive sound. The tradition of each intricate guitar part is latticed with banjo arpeggios and cello harmonics; there are multiple phrases and ideas in each song, something of a departure from the current aesthetic. Ally in the Sky is on the verge of uncovering something forgotten under the weight of strictly ""post-"" seriousness. It's not only the sadness of a lost America, it's a celebration of it. Jimmy Corrigan creator Chris Ware once described the strength of the George Herriman, creator of Krazy Kat: ""He didn't use many words, the characters literally seemed to be moving around on the page."" Ally in the Sky is a somehow similar constant, where implied motion lays deep within the set orchestration. Krazy Kat had the same basic story line repeated over and over, relying on the personalities of its cast; likewise, the instruments on this record interact with each other as well-defined characters, whatever the setting, whatever the mood. It's not so much about humor as the absurdity of continuing: these characters have a clear destiny that they're oblivious to: Riding in the car, looking out our window at exit signs and farmland, at animals and crops, we hear this unrelenting, proud march. Ally in the Sky shows Bosco and Jorge developing into something more complicated than Kottke gestures; it gives a sense of a world outside of music. Somewhere, for a couple of bucks, you could buy dinner and some records, a newspaper. Sunsets, smokes, opinions; family, neighbors, low-wages. It's a little idyllic and romanticized, sure, but the extra steps into reality make Ally more tangible than the usual daydreams of days gone by.","Instrumental guitar-- specifically finger-picking-- has enjoyed a popular resurgence since Jim O'Rourke's Bad Timing and the coinciding revisionist ...

Flage,Rovo,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2b79d034d5c69bf2c75/1:1/w_160/c6b1f18f.gif,2003-02-11 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6847-flage/,Warner Bros.,"Violinist Katsui Yuji plays with such a particular (some might say awful) tone, that I find it hard to focus on anything else when he's playing, including the actual song. In fact, Yuji's sound is so cringe-inducing, so thin and elastic, that I always wonder how he's able to fit in with other musicians-- and yet, I almost always love the bands he performs with. But it struck me as I listened to the latest offering by Rovo, one of many bands Yuji can claim membership to, that it's come to the point where I can predict exactly what he'll do in any given situation, be it deft, repetitive figures or drawn-out, single-note moans. Rovo usually plays hard trance that borders on funk but never quite gets there, and Yuji's lines supply what little melody is able to make it through the layers of noise. The problem is, this makes things a tad monotonous when the rest of the band isn't on fire. And while Flage does have some very hot moments, it can't quite match the energetic glee of Sai or Imago when taken as a whole. The opener, ""Canvas"", begins with Yuji's overdubbed string lines recreating a string quartet; this is a new sound for Rovo, who rarely stray far from arrangements that can't be duplicated live (and make no mistake, this band is much easier to fawn over live). Beneath the strings, a pulse brews, beginning with a barely audible shaker, eventually building to include two drummers and the rest of the band. The song repeats Yuji's simple violin lines throughout-- which alternate between extended brush-stroke lines and bouncy, synth-doubled figures-- and the beats range from faux-techno to full-on samba. In the 70s, Rovo might have been considered a fusion band, similar to mid-period Weather Report; they have the eclecticism down, but for better or worse, nowhere near the color. Where these guys excel is in dancefloor rave-ups-- one that are too fast to actually dance to-- like ""Spica"" and ""Sukhna"". The first tune, though it sounds less like a ""song"" than an impromptu jam, mixes in manic James Brown beats with light electro touches and the ever-present fusion aftertaste, via constant group interplay and Yuji's improvisation. The latter kicks down the doors with a furious percussion coda wherein bass drums and Chinaboys endure a brutal punishing in the name of hyper-badass pogo flailing. The near ambient ""Mov"" begins with Japanese bells and a percolating, cotton-coated minimalist guitar figure. Per Rovo's general form, Yuji's violin enters with long, reverb-heavy tones, and the synth and cymbals build to a subtle high that many new age composers might happily lose themselves in. It's not that I'm not impressed by Rovo's mastery of this texture (though I'd be perfectly happy to see them develop a few more)-- after all, calming music can be lovely in spots-- but when trance-heavy post-rock is the game, sometimes the details seem glossed over. Rovo are one of the most popular bands in Japan right now-- this album debuted in that country's Top 40-- and there's something to be said for infiltrating a nation's pop-conscience with semi-out music. At the very least, I'm happy for the musicians, most of whom spent a decade or two prior to their formation paying noisy dues. However, one of the things I notice with each passing Rovo disc is a tendency to cruise when going full throttle would be more fun, or to stay put when leaping for joy would pull the listener back in. But I can't fault them for what they aren't, so I'll let the record play and chalk up the even-keeled vibe to the band's experience.","Violinist Katsui Yuji plays with such a particular (some might say awful) tone, that I find it hard to focus ...

Highly Refined Pirates,Minus the Bear,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c557c0084474cd0c370d/1:1/w_160/9f154bd8.jpg,2003-02-11 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5324-highly-refined-pirates/,Suicide Squeeze,"""It's indie rock. Eh."" I throw a sidelong glance at my brother's ""record collection"" and take note of the names: Moby, Foo Fighters, Eminem. The best and brightest from the radio dial. He wouldn't know indie if it came to his party and spent the whole night pining for some girl, but he's clearly an expert on ""Eh""; after a lifetime spent cultivating an appreciation for marginal-to-mediocre mainstream runoff, my brother has finally applied what he learned. In one sentence, he trumped everything I could write about this record. How can an album as tight, consistent, and energetic as Highly Refined Pirates be at once so thoroughly unimpressive? Minus the Bear is a talented bunch with a somewhat eclectic pedigree (Botch, Sharks Keep Moving, Kill Sadie), but the brainy arithmetic of its hooks, and the growly, sensitive-but-angry vocals are every inch the bastard sons of the middling indie norm. Through changing time signatures, dynamic, bouncing rhythms, and thirty-one flavors of guitar noises, Minus the Bear make a Herculean effort to maintain their audience's attention. They even slip in beat-driven electronics from time to time, digital ear candy to distract from the core blahness of their particular spin on well-spun clich√©s, but it's never more than a flourish. When the dizziness subsides, J. Robbins asks, ""Eric, why not listen to For Your Own Special Sweetheart instead? Doesn't this just make you long for Emergency & I?"" And I want to say to him, ""You know, Mr. Robbins, you're right. Why eat hamburger when you can have steak?"" Rock's a finite genre, after all-- not everyone can innovate. Imitation's a fact of life, but the cardinal rule is to refine what's been done before, and while Minus the Bear expertly execute existing formulas, they never once look beyond the tablature. This only serves to underscore the greatness of their inspirations (Dismemberment Plan, Jawbox, Built to Spill), and by track three on Pirates, I can't shake the thought that everyone who's listened to any independent music in the last ten years has heard this record before. Maybe it's just that the Bear choose to emulate a sound that's too fresh to be paraded under the banner of purism or revival; maybe it's less inspired derivation. That's a subtle distinction in any case: The bottom line is their roots are showing badly. Am I jaded? Maybe a little. On some level, music is a visceral pleasure, and though it veers towards bemusement, Minus the Bear's second full-length release manages to entertain. In particular, ""Get Me Naked 2: Electric Boogaloo"" and the opener, ""Thanks For the Killer Game of Crisco Twister"" come close to mustering some of the grandeur and transcendent glory of the more powerful acts that obviously inspire them. Despite the emotion in Jake Snider's voice, and a few soaring melodies, they never quite find their way out from the shadows of the past. If only the songs lived up to the promise of their titles: An album even half as fun as a rousing game of Crisco Twister might have justified repeated spins.","""It's indie rock. Eh.""

Make It Pop,Giddy Motors,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf23ea9e61561daa79f4/1:1/w_160/58d4a13d.jpg,2003-02-11 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3447-make-it-pop/,Fat Cat,"Punk was the future of rock 'n' roll way back in 1969, and I'll wager even money that it still is. It's the sheer ""fuck you"" of it. That doesn't mean aggression, or spiked shoulders, and certainly not the late 70s marketability that came from politicizing it-- just a band's desire to play whatever the hell they want, without regard for anyone who may or may not want to hear it. The Velvets, the NY Dolls, The Ramones, X, Big Black (and the list continues intermittently ad infinitum) were all just raising their middle finger to their audience; the people who saluted back were the keepers. But naturally, punk's elements of style were slowly, inexorably co-opted and assimilated into ""markets"" for particular ""sounds,"" finally settling into various media-friendly blocks like new wave and grunge. The punk movement fizzled with the backslide into further genre Balkanization, but that doesn't mean the desire for confrontation has subsided. For twenty years, punk has bided its time, and bands like Liars, Black Dice, and now, Giddy Motors are poised at the starting line of the next big race in rock-- the race to get wherever it is they want to go, and fast. Make It Pop is the Motors' case study in hellish cacophony; with just guitar, bass, drums, and a little sax (the most underused instrument in rock), Giddy Motors lurch, stomp, and eventually plunge headlong into near-total bedlam. The only constant throughout is Manu Ros' flawless percussion; rhythm is the heart of any band, and with drumming this solid, a band would be justified in doing just about anything, period. Not an ounce of that opportunity is wasted, either-- when the Motors throw their act into high gear, the bass clatters with a menace almost unheard since the days of Big Black (not surprising since Nietzschian superman Steve Albini is working the controls), and Gaverick de Vis' guitar wails like thunder and lightning, matched only by the orgiastic spasms of his own vocals. Together, the sound is hell on wheels, with a beat that absolutely slaughters. It's not until the band slows things down that Make It Pop is discernable as anything more than well-assembled chaos, but finally, the influences start to fall into place: A slightly malicious take on modern free jazz (evidenced most clearly by the intro to ""Bottle Opener""), rhythmic stretches of post-punk minimalism, and de Vis' fire and brimstone chants combine with violently swaying, stabbing melodies, directly conjuring memories of Nick Cave and The Birthday Party (especially on the overwhelming ""Cranium Crux""). A sneering rap (of sorts) opens ""Sassy"" before it downshifts into a plodding assault of bass and snares, punctuated by the occasional anguished yelp. Here, what is superficially pure chaos starts to make incredible sense. And then Giddy Motors catch you offguard: ""Venus Medallist"" enters as if your disc-changer had skipped ahead to another record without your realizing it. All the contorted shouts, rumbling bass and dense percussion give way to gently rolling acoustic guitar and gorgeous string swells. The disorientation this track produces is almost palpable-- I spent the first half just waiting for a crash, an explosion, anything. Instead, I ended up having to go back and listen from the beginning to what might actually be the highlight of an already strong album. Beautiful and unexpected, ""Medallist"" is the signature on the Giddy Motors' frantic mission statement for the future of rock.","Punk was the future of rock 'n' roll way back in 1969, and I'll wager even money that it ...

Submers,Loscil,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd6413d197565213b523/1:1/w_160/87ffe726.jpeg,2003-02-11 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4867-submers/,Kranky,"Ambient music is about the creation of aural environments, and one of the most popular constructions is the womb. The womb is the place where we all imagine ourselves at peace and feeling good. Your body floats in warm, liquid space, and your senses are at rest. If you could experience light in the womb, it would only be the dimmest flesh-colored glow. Maybe your folks pump the Raymond Scott records and the Mozart into your Mom's belly, but the only thing you hear are soft, indistinct noises run through a low-pass filter. A friend of mind used to drink cup after cup of TheraFlu when nursing a hangover. He claimed the medicine put a five-inch thick layer of warm cotton between him and the world. And that's how I imagine the womb: A tuned-out heaven perfect for dreaming. With Submers, Vancouver-based artist Loscil (Scott Morgan) practices the art of the aural womb. This is music without sharp edges. The synth textures are warm, deep and viscous as amniotic fluid, and like Wolfgang Voigt's legendary Gas project, Loscil knows that you can't live inside the body of another without hearing a distant heartbeat. So a delicate 4/4 thump drifts in on occasion to remind us of the source of this safe and wonderful place. Calling Submers ""The Best Album to Fall Asleep to in 2002"" (it came out late last year) might seem like a backhanded compliment, but this is seriously gorgeous stuff that just happens to be the right sort of thing for drifting into another consciousness. Submers has a concept: All of the tracks are named for submarines. And if ""womb-like"" is one apt description for Submers, ""aquatic"" is another. In additional to sounding a bit like Gas, Loscil also reminds me of Japanese ambient collective Neina in his focus on textures so complicated and detailed they can pass for nature. The drones in ""Argonaut I"" are piled at least four layers high, enough to get lost in, as a glowing edge of higher pitched sound twists around something deeper and harder to fathom. ""Gymote"" adds the slightest wisp of static and gentle, almost bell-like tones as rhythmic accompaniment, and then sends the whole thing on its way with a speedy, steady bass drum. ""Diable Martin"" has a similarly quick pace, but something about the distance of the thump makes tempo matter little. It still feels like a drone, even if the BMP is technically over 100. ""Diable Martin"" has a few other techno bits to it, a quivering synth sequence and light taps of percussion, though these elements don't disturb the reverie. But the delicate touches are what really make it. The unsteady drone in ""Resurgam"" is fragile as hot glass blown to its bursting point, such a beautiful sound that could possibly fall apart at any moment. ""Triton"" adds the slightest bit of tension and dub undercurrents, along with a ghost of an orchestral sweep, and though it seems less tied to the theme it's one of the best tracks here. Finally, ""Kursk"", a tribute to the lost Russian sub, ends the album on an ominous tone, with the kind of mid-bass cello-like drones that Stars of the Lid dream about. Then comes silence. It's time to open your eyes, walk slowly to the CD player, and press ""play"" again.","Ambient music is about the creation of aural environments, and one of the most popular constructions is the womb.

Grava 4,Drexciya,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba1d9d034d5c69bf53a6/1:1/w_160/c3de1720.gif,2003-02-10 06:00:06,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2456-grava-4/,Clone,"Just when I got used to the idea of submariner Drexcyens living their life on the ocean floor, the offspring of slaves drowned in transatlantic crossings, they've left the earthly realm for a voyage into deep space. Grava 4 is one of the seven ""storms"" recorded as part of a cryptic plan that was to bring Detroit's Drexciya to its next stage of development (a project that founding member James Stinson sadly did not live to see completed-- he died last year), and the explicit theme on this record is celestial travel. Track titles like ""Astronomical Guidepost"" and ""700 Light Years from Earth"" combined with a sleeve that maps the tracks onto a map of some distant planet's night sky help set the mood, but the music sticks closely to the established Drexciya sound, which happens to adapt quite well to a space motif. ""Cascading Celestial Giants"" eases us into this cold, barren world with a recurring sample of a men's chorus, the kind of sequenced bleeps that planetariums played between shows in the early 70s, and a sweeping synth melody that announces, ""You are embarking on a journey..."" It's melodramatic as hell, but in the best possible way, introducing the album with a theatrical flair. The following ""Powers of the Deep"" is a good example of what I'm loving about Drexciya: how each of a track's individual elements seems so discrete and separate, and yet somehow it all congeals into a listenable whole. The percussion is stiff as ever; drum machines in this world are meant to dispassionately scoop endless units of time from the universe. There are no breaks, no fills, little syncopation, and the beats rarely drop out. But in and around the unforgiving techno and electro beats, electronic sounds swirl unpredictably. In contrast to the most machine-like beats imaginable, the synths in Drexciya often show a human hand at the switch. The surges in volume and odd filters don't seem applied by an unthinking algorithm; the patterns seem too well timed to fit the arc of the track, to be controlled by anything but a brain. This contrast and complement between man and machine, where the purpose of each in the music seems so clear, is part of what makes Drexciya so special. Diego Rivera painted a series of murals in the 1930s, known as the ""Detroit Industry"" murals, the most famous of which captures something similar to what Drexciya seem to have gone for. It portrays a massive factory scene, with dozens of men working in and around all-consuming machinery, and the way it's painted, it's hard to tell where the machines leave off and the people begin. The line from the steel edge of a blast furnace merges gracefully into the back of the man shoveling fuel into the belly. Sonically, a brittle, aggressive tone presides through much of Grava 4. On the fourth track (which might be titled ""Grava"" but isn't listed on the sleeve) everything is overdriven and harsh, from the gurgly Speak'n'Spell pattern out front to the relentless banging happening in the background somewhere. The ""thwack"" of the beats on ""Drexcyen R.E.S.T. Principle"" feel like a slap across the face, and the menacing vibe is not allayed by the stalking, angry bass pattern. There's occasional lightness-- ""700 Million Light Years from Earth"" is a nice slice of the kind of warm, downtempo electro found on Lifestyle of the Laptop Cafe, a project recorded for Warp Records by members of Drexciya under the guise The Other People Place-- but darkness is pretty much the rule. Life on earth is ugly, and escape from the depths of the ocean into the heavens turned out to be no escape at all, but at least Drexciya got to tell us about it.","Just when I got used to the idea of submariner Drexcyens living their life on the ocean floor, the offspring ...

Jessica Bailiff,Jessica Bailiff,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1fe5e6ef959693202fb/1:1/w_160/ba5f0255.jpg,2003-02-10 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/533-jessica-bailiff/,Kranky,"This could have been tear-makingly dull: Droning textural music under one woman's ethereal voice, all caught in gauze-like overdubs, each one softer than last. Plus, it was recorded at home, which can often pull an album down from ""slowcore"" to ""nubby gray pajamacore."" But while Jessica Bailiff's third record relies heavily on atmosphere, the sharp execution makes it work: With good songs and inventive arrangements, she made the album taut and precise, turning simple elements into well-realized mood pieces. Plus, her voice is beautiful. Restrained and almost expressionlessly consistent, it shimmers whether laid flat over an acoustic guitar or treated to sound far off, like... well, if you've ever had the ghost of a young girl stuck in your plumbing, you'll know what I'm talking about. Bailiff's words help with the spooking, too, with lines like, ""I heard you creeping under the bed,"" or the eerie way she floats the word, ""disappear."" The mood of this record doesn't waver, but the arrangements keep things interesting. After recording her first two albums with assistance from Low, Bailiff made this one with her Red Morning Chorus bandmates, Jesse Edwards and Noel Keesee, providing unspecified help on the instruments that buzz, drone and beat behind her voice. They provide enough variety between the songs without overwhelming any one track: Each one comes out stark and minimal. Take ""Hour of the Traces"" (the title of which, curiously, is a variation on the title of her previous full-length), which starts with low handdrums playing a rhythm that echoes Native American music. Gradually, she adds piercing long notes from a ""violin-uke"" (a weird, bowed tabletop instrument that arcs over her chanting vocals), and an almost-subliminal, serpentine bass guitar to wind underneath. ""Disappear"" takes a similar beat but adds an electric drone, possibly from a guitar, and on ""Big Hill"" a string-like sound pans and vibrates slowly around her voice like a bug. The droning may not work for all listeners-- you might get a little round-eyed when she sings a dazed, one-note melody throughout ""You Were So Close"". But it's not all dust bowls and dry chills: The first track, ""Swallowed"", splurges on a piano and ringing strummed guitar. It even has a hummable melody, as does ""Mary"", the liveliest of her mournful dirges. This album can't avoid the dilemma where it may be too foggy for some listeners, yet without so much focus we couldn't dig so deeply into the wide plains and dead, gnarled tree roots of Bailiff's head. She solves the problem better than most with the edgy instrumentation, not to mention that voice, which, with or without effects, is captivating. With this release, Bailiff has made her first deeply intimate and intriguingly rendered full-length. With any luck, it gets even better from here.","This could have been tear-makingly dull: Droning textural music under one woman's ethereal voice, all caught in gauze-like overdubs ...

Lost Time,12 Rods,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a83eb1335d7bf1699234/1:1/w_160/5e461b4b.gif,2003-02-10 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8202-lost-time/,12 Rodsz,"A quick, tangentially related diss from our sponsors: In what twisted mockery of a universe does a label like V2 give Moby the green light to crap out opportunistic schlock like 18, while simultaneously cutting loose a band as talented and unique as 12 Rods? I mean, okay, the Rods' last product for V2, the ass-Rundgren'd Separation Anxieties, was a complete disaster from any angle, failing to satisfy the band's devoted fanbase and completely tanking on a commercial level. But isn't there something to be said for sticking behind bands with artistic merit, bands with the potential for greatness? Sad, but true: In the end, the age-old struggle of quantity versus quality (or lack thereof) is the simplest explanation for this seeming judgmental error, and 12 Rods had to take the fall. Fortunately, the karmic scales are being righted even now. Though this band no longer has the resources and backing necessary to move the kind of volume an operation like V2 could provide, Lost Time is rich in quality, and if self-releasing the record is what it takes to get the boys back on track, so be it. Bear in mind now that unlike some people, I wouldn't have you believe that Gay? was the sound of God's orgasm, nor did I find Separation Anxieties quite as terrible as it's sometimes made out to be. It seems to me that, on their previous outings, 12 Rods have served as a balancing act of sorts, combining a bewildering array of desultory styles and influences, sometimes successful and sometimes not. Their full-length debut, Split Personalities, nailed the ratio of spacy, synth-driven lounge jazz to sharp-toothed arena-pop, and when it was on, it was both incredibly original and stunningly catchy. Lost Time is that record's proper follow-up. Here, 12 Rods juggle slow grooves, killer hooks, and stop/start changes with the same practiced ease that endeared them to so many in the first place. The manic, metallic sheen of Anxieties has been subdued and replaced with more of the organic production that marked Gay?, albeit of much higher fidelity. But most importantly, the band has rebounded from the uneasiness of Separation Anxieties to actually sound comfortable with their material again. The tempo and mood of Lost Time change with virtually every song. The glitchy, slow-burning harmonies of ""Fake Magic 8-Ball"" dissolve seamlessly into a tower of guitar and complex rhythmic shifts to open ""Twenty-Four Hours Ago""; trilling keyboards segue the bouncing power-punk of ""Terrible Hands"" into the laidback stadium rocker, ""The Time Is Right (To Be Wrong)"". 12 Rods can't seem to sit still long enough to commit themselves to any one monolithic sound, so they simply bend every atmosphere they create to their own inventive aesthetic. The result is entirely natural; nothing is out of place, nothing is overdone. A significant portion of the credit for Lost Time's paradoxical feeling of simultaneous unity and diversity can be attributed to Ryan Olcott's vocals; his slickly treated delivery shows chameleon-like adaptability across all of this album's varied terrain. He croons, shouts and wails with equal proficiency, maintaining the record's remarkable pace without losing so much as a step. In fact, in many ways, Lost Time's consistency even gives it an edge over Split Personalities. Now, admittedly, consistency often amounts to little more than a critical consolation prize in the art of album-building, something to be trotted out when other defenses fail to justify quality (""But, at least it's consistent!""). Not this time. Lost Time is an exceptional start-to-finish listening experience, and on top of that, it hits as high as, or higher than, any Rods album to come before, minus any of the awkwardness that occasionally accompanied earlier releases. In short, Lost Time brings 12 Rods back from the brink of irrelevance to thrive outside the corporate clutches of V2, and shows them poised to finally deliver on the promise of the early material they built their name on.","A quick, tangentially related diss from our sponsors: In what twisted mockery of a universe does a label like V2 ...

Mansion,Boas,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a333ea9e61561daa4c17/1:1/w_160/8bcdd79e.gif,2003-02-10 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/840-mansion/,Overcoat,"That old-time music... boy, I tell ya, it really kind of blows. I mean, naturally, people made good music at every point in history, but at present, more and more musicians are dredging up the recent past (new wave, electro, garage) and expecting to haul up gold. So, when the results of their wholesale extirpation turn out mixed, we're forced to admit that either a) the past wasn't up to snuff after all, or b) nostalgia isn't what it used to be. Chicago's Boas seem to think that by digging deeper than most bands, they have a shot at striking the golden vein, but they often disagree on how far back to reach. There's a bit of sappy orchestral pop in their mix, some vintage organ sounds here and there, a lot of languid C&W; picking, and above all, John Klos' sick-of-his-own-soul yowl, begging to be wrapped in static. It could be they get teary-eyed for mid-90s indie, with the meandering start/stoppage and often obtuse refusal to rock in any straightforward way. But however you want to describe their sound, it's all very intentional, and referentially ""old."" Boas come off like fairly competent young dudes with an ear for a lazy melody, on whom old age has been suddenly and painfully self-inflicted. Sometimes they profit from their wealth of influences: A song as exhaustedly sprawling as the piano-fueled shuffle ""The Last Zoo House Band"" covers so much territory, it's bound to hit something good eventually (the horn coda at its end). Often, though, the songs are too broken down to crawl toward any sort of significance: ""Ghetto Pond"" doesn't have the energy to make Klos' gargled non-sequitirs and stark declarations of, ""Ain't nothin' not special no more,"" seem anything more than hollow; ""Get Up, Crippled Wife"" lacks the strength to break through its fog of synthesizers. Good or bad, Boas seem like they've been coated with an impenetrably thick layer of dust. It's not really clear why Boas want to engage in this sort of cover-up; when the outlines of real songs start to show at the end of the album, I like the pretty young things I see. ""Mrs. Mother"" dispels the pall with a burst of wistfully playful pop, while ""For Sheriff Allison"" trades in affected age for unstrained, deceptively simple folk. Finally, on ""Oh, Doctor"", the band's scattered Wowee Zowee-isms congeal into raucous, joyfully overdriven axe-thwacking. But just when they're really getting going, the album ends, its best songs buried behind a stack of less vital, less engaging material. Still, it's not every day that you get to watch years roll back right in front of your eyes; if time keeps on running in the wrong direction for Boas, they could hit upon the same sort of kaleidoscopic revue that worked so well for seasoned vets like The Flaming Lips and Mercury Rev.","That old-time music... boy, I tell ya, it really kind of blows.

Primary songwriter Tony Carbone takes his cues from most of the same resuscitated sources as his peers-- namely Brian Wilson, Arthur Lee, and The Beatles-- but he and his bandmates pull it off with such enthusiasm and invention, it's hard to pay any mind to critics who'll cavil endlessly about a lack of originality. Like any true power-poppers, Bikeride wink at their source material before offering their take: Does ""Sleepyhead"" sound like ""Eleanor Rigby"" after a few Mountain Dews? Certainly, but if you like The Beatles and high-caffeine beverages, why not imbibe of both. ""Small Faces"", a nod to the mod gods, pays tribute without slavish or academic recreation. Fans of power-pop tend to accept this sort of conservatism from their favorite bands, but Bikeride should play to wider audiences, even lure away a handful of the jaded critics sneering, ""Teenage Fanclub was such a Big Star rip-off,"" and, ""Evan Dando, what a necrophiliac stoner."" Carbone takes real risks with his writing while the band adds an unmistakable flavor of modernism without letting their ironic detachment drown out the ingenuous excitement. It's a good thing, too, because Carbone's irreverence toward standard structure could easily have led down a path that should have come to an end a few years ago, somewhere in the emotional wasteland of Beck's Midnite Vultures. As it stands, the daring ""Fakin' Amnesia"", ""Norwegia"", and several others come across as pure fun, a bravado balancing act that's all the more thrilling for how close it comes to falling apart. ""Lemonade"" and a minority of other tracks occasionally take wrong turns into booby traps like lounge jazz, but that's the price of forsaking comfort and predictability. No matter how much style and imagination Carbone & Co. exhibit, some will inevitably dismiss it from the start. Carbone sings in a voice that few others could achieve without the aid of helium or neutering, an admittedly difficult sound to absorb for long stretches of time. This is the most damning piece of evidence for the case that Bikeride is simply too cute to tolerate, but complaints will probably extend to other areas. The twists and turns featured so prominently on nearly every song will surely strike some ears as forced experimentalism, but if you're too embarrassed to buy an Electric Light Orchestra record after humming ""Mr. Blue Sky"" as it slid by in that Volkswagen commercial, you should find Morning Macumba a less humiliating alternative.","Bikeride is another entry in the growing list of Southern California bands trying to inject sorely needed joy into the ...

Sure, there were snatches, be it from his last (and convolutedly enough, most popular) work, the theme to Space Ghost, or his extra-dimensional tremors as sideman on Pharoah Sanders' Tauhid. But unless you felt like digging for some buried moments on Herbie Mann records (or his unaccredited turn on Miles' Jack Johnson), you were stuck with his 80s and 90s work. While Ask the Ages was furious (again teaming him with Sanders), and Guitar burned through Bill Laswell's slickness, most of us were stuck gleaming his six-string prophecies from the sludgy supergroup Last Exit, where he shared earspace with Laswell, Peter Br√∂tzmann, and Ronald Shannon Jackson. Only in the last two years has this changed, with a CD version of Black Woman finally unveiling the free-jazz fury that Sharrock concocted at the end of the 60s with wife Linda, pianist Don Pullen, and percussive octopus Milford Graves. A singular testament in the proto-forms of fire music's freedom skronk and feral rock howl, a follow-up would be daunting to any artist. And so, when he next turned up, in the BYG-Actuel series with Monkey Pocky Boo, Sharrock avoided the instrument that he reinvented for the free jazz genre, instead reaching for the, uh... slide whistle for half of side one. Paradise was released five years later, and it headed straight for the cutout bins, rarely even filed under the ""jazz"" section in record stores. Looking like a disco-diva record, it came at a time when George Benson and Chuck Mangione were what ""jazz"" sounded like. And while the free and furious improvising of Sharrock's past two records could arguably not be called jazz, either, this time around the Sharrocks did away with their own history, as well as that of the genre, letting out something that defiantly remains unclassifiable and as outside of human time as that oft-idealized Paradise itself. Taking their cue from modern R&B; radio and slick funk, ""Apollo"" commences with a dusted Diana Ross-like sighing before Linda decides to have a deep-throating contest, taking the mic far down her gullet for some gurgling. Meanwhile, the backing band starts acting like a zooted Gap Band before morphing into a prog band midway through, escalating into the upper registers of the synth. Sonny Sharrock starts off with a jubilant, almost African guitar tone, but then performs some positively dripping primordial No-Wave slobber in endlessly cascading/ascending guitar lines that slurp and go just far enough out, setting the table for the next 20 years of New York guitarists-- right up to Sonic Youth's shredding on ""100%"". By the time Linda's punched back into the track, with her salving vocal sighs and soft instrumental bedding, the crazy jag that just occurred is all but forgotten. Producer (and noted tape composer in his own right) Ilhan Mimaroglu has a definite hand here in mashing the disparate strands of ""Apollo"" together, somewhere between his graceful massaging of the exotic jungle into the hairy back of Mingus' Cumbia & Jazz Fusion and his political acid-trip tape-splicing frenzy of Freddie Hubbard's Sing a Song of Song My, but it still makes little sense in the overall scheme of things, a belle confusion. Continuing the schizophrenic oscillations between barbed Ono-outburst and velvety vowel abstraction is the beautiful respite of ""End of the Rainbow"", where Linda's wordless serenity swirls with washes of cymbals. The concord doesn't remain for long-- ""Miss Doris"" comes along clanking cowbells and timbales that bleed into a clavinet quiver. The sound quickly reaches g-funk frequencies as piercing as the continued caterwauls of the Missus, which go to that unholy place between Diamanda Galas and Curly of the Three Stooges. For more glottal oddities, she turns her lingua into a wah pedal on ""1953 Blue Boogie Children"", mixing Mellotron with Morse code as Sonny alternates channels of ping and pulverization brilliantly. The climax comes with the closer, ""Gary's Step"", which continually crescendos and then levitates even higher into the stratosphere for eight minutes, invoking the Ecclesiastics of classic free jazz's soulful wail, the one such piece that harkens to their past. This is a strain of funk far from that of the Mothership, or even the tumultuous punched-in lurch of Miles' On the Corner. It's somewhat like the proto no-wave achieved on Yoko Ono's Plastic Ono Band, combining Yin yips with hubby's masculine string malevolence over a rock-solid rhythmic pulse. No matter how much gibberish is splattered about by the couple, the bass and drums chugs along intact, greasing the broken chunks of tongue and guitar so that it's easier to swallow down. A quarter of a century on, Paradise is coming to be delectably digestible.","In my nascent days of free-jazz lapping, it was much easier to hear of Sonny Sharrock than to actually hear ...

The Best of 1990-2000,U2,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8c7b1335d7bf1699370/1:1/w_160/02c1a83a.jpg,2003-02-10 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8327-the-best-of-1990-2000/,Interscope,"As anyone who has read this site's reviews of The Eminem Show or Source Tags & Codes knows, Interscope bought Pitchfork editor Ryan Schreiber one of those personal, surfable wave pools like the guy from M√∂tley Cr√ºe has. Otherwise, why would we review this? Pitchfork's quasi-pride is in opening reader ears to new music, and unless you're a Kaczynskian separatist, these songs have already been smuggled into your pop consciousness like drugs into Woodstock 99. Speaking of that rape-tastic festival and time-lapse history of market forces, what from the 90s will be remarkable to future armchair musicologists? The subcurrents way outperformed the mainstream, and even those subcurrents look to be outperformed by the 00s' bustling underbelly-dwellers. Please tell me that, as fads recycle, 2013 won't see the kids snorting coke off of each other's ripped-up leather as they rock out to industrio-clash. U2 spent the 90s either in a war with Negativland, or marketing themselves as a celebration of, spoof of, critique of, and source of rampant consumption and multimedia force-feeding. No one in the 90s thought of warplanes when they heard the name U2; they thought it referred to the band's exponential unit-shiftin'. Having a remotely acronymic name put U2 in good company in the eighties (REM, XTC, PIL, INXS), while the 90s saw the proliferation of TLC, KFC and AIDS. So I can hardly blame U2 for becoming a satire of U2, then a lite-techno version of U2, only to emerge in 2000 as a U2 tribute band. As if the band internalized the poet Wallace Stevens' line, ""We have been a little insane about the truth,"" U2 flagrantly tested the elasticity of their sound, appearance, attitude, and fanbase. One thing the band hasn't dicked around with is how many ways they'll grub for your filthy lucre, releasing, as is well within the rights of any band this huge, a zillion different nation-specific versions of their singles, and even several different limited import versions of this comp: There's a bonus-track edition with ""The Fly"", a Japanese set with 31 tracks, and another two-disc version including a DVD and many of the one-disc version's curious absentees, albeit in B-side (sigh) remixed form. Best of luck to any stormchasers who want to pay shipping for all that; I'll stick to discussing the 16-track version you're most likely to find at Wal-Mart or Jaded Colonel's Aging Towny Discs and Vinyl. If'n I was an exec at the band's label, I'd have recommended wide-releasing a two-disc lookbackamajig rather than equitably represent the lesser material. Simply repackage the gorgeous Achtung Baby as The Best of 1990-2000, and then include a bonus disc anthologizing high points from their other recent records, entitled either a) the humbling Things We Dropped Along the Way, b) the 80s-linking Still Haven't Found What We're Looking For, c) the Clinton-nodding Mistakes Were Made, or d) the spiritual When There Were Only Two Sets of Footprints, That's When the Rhythm Section Was Carrying Us. By now you've no doubt heard the limerick (apropos for this Irish quartet) so popular with sixth graders who, preferring to blame the man who made PJ Harvey boring, overlook the work of sirs Eno, Lanois, and Orbit: There once was a band named U2,
Who ruled and then mightily blew.
When asked, ""Hey, what happened?""
The band took a crap and
Flood had someone remix their pooh. But there's something interesting about U2's willingness to endlessly reconfigure their recent songs. Either they're admitting that the quality of their output has declined and is no longer utterly singular, or they're admitting that they're tired of operating under the weight of having their work regarded as so damn canonical. The band definitely, and consciously, shed its sacrosanctity in the 90s, and it's fitting that one of this collection's brand new songs appears in a remix version, while the ""original"" is relegated to a B-side of one the many versions of its remix's single, as if the band disdained it. Maybe all the tinkering is an attempt to circumvent how the populist, but diluting, dance touches of Zooropa and Pop date themselves. That new song, ""Electrical Storm"", is a fine one for this version of U2, which means that it plays like a funkier, happier, more colossally passionate Coldplay/Radiohead hybrid. ""Electrical Storm"" also brings up the quandary of why two songs from 2002 are on a collection that's supposed to be an honest-to-goodness decade-spanner. Please tell me these tunes weren't tossed together unscrupulously in order to spice this November release up for that clusterfucked ""holiday"" that blends druids and messiahs and credit limits and gorging on mall foodcourt slurry. The other brand new tune on 1990-2000 is the theme from Gangs of New York, Scorsese's ambitious film about a magician's rivalry with a younger version of the cowardly lion of Oz for the heart of a transvestite, set against the backdrop of the riots that almost destroyed the Muppet Christmas Carol soundstage. Instead of living up to the film's gleeful taste for swindle and skullduggery, the song, ""The Hands That Built America"", is a woozy wedge of that empty grandeur that plagued the band's return to seriousness on 2000's All That You Can't Leave Behind. See that album's pre-9-11 ""New York"", or the band's 9-11 tribute during the tragedy's subsequent Super Bowl. The band's heart is in the right place, but in that heart/place lie stupid songs. With the heavy-handed ""Hands"", U2 have finally penned their answer to ""This Used to Be My Greyhound"", or whatever that Madonna song was a commercial for. Another way ""Hands"" sucks is that it pillages the cool operatic moment from ""Miss Sarajevo"", a song otherwise a pillage of a Velvet Underground chorus and a pillage of The Byrds' pillage of Ecclesiastes, from U2's clever Passengers project, a record of songs for fictional movies that worked as a tongue-in-cheek statement about how good the movies have been to U2, a band whose image and tours have always seemed larger than life. Even the videotaped footage of the indignant Bono goose-stepping through ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" was somehow cinematic in scope, and made their later film Rattle and Hum a no-brainer. One prays that an Imax feature isn't looming if U2 devolves into the Stones. In addition to the Gangs theme, and the Pavarotti-sampling film-fake ""Sarajevo"", this disc features soundtrack work from Wim Wenders' Until the End of the World and Batman Forever (U2's song is, of course, their orchestral-rock action-franchise counterpart to McCartney's Bond-anthem ""Live and Let Die""). Curiously absent are U2's songs from the bad Wim Wenders remake City of Angels and the bad Wim Wenders original Million Dollar Hotel. And hey, where's Adam Clayton's solo version of the Mission: Impossible theme? J'accuse! Okay, so Achtung is criminally under- and misrepresented. You do get ""One"", which Johnny Cash did better on his Solitary Man. (Where's the Cash-sung Zooropa oddity ""The Wanderer""? I'd prefer that to the questionable half-rap of-- a new mix of!-- ""Numb"".) The problem with U2's ""One"" is that the pimpy music never sounds as despondent as the lyrics, like how critics charged Billy Bob Thornton's character in The Man Who Wasn't There with looking too suave to be believably pathetic. To U2's version I picture white people in their apartments clutching wine glasses, unbuttoning the top button of Gap shirts and giving each other come-hither looks. Cash's cover invokes an image of an epic judgment day for a planet festering with failed lovers. I can't get past how the verse part of ""Gone"" (new mix!) recalls The Beatles' ""Taxman"". And the redundantly titled ""Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of"" is one of those positive advice songs that flow from Bono when he's in his Christian altar-ego. ""Beautiful Day"" is the best of these, and its Edge bombast can transform quarter-beer night at the bowling alley into a precipice of gladiatorial triumph, the way the melodrama of ""Pride (In the Name of Love)"" can leave patrons of a diner that used to be a Shoney's agog. While ""Discotheque"" (new mix!) is still unforgivable, ""Stay (Faraway So Close)"" is still a great pop song, even as it sounds like U2 doing Sebadoh doing the Smiths. The sassy ""Staring at the Sun"" (new mix!) even kind of kicks ass. But oh well. This CD is for the fairweather fans who can afford the good seats at U2 shows; it's a coarse chronicle of a band inarguably masterful at creating four-minute forty-second atmospheres in which Bono pants and prolongs his falsetto triple-threat of ""heeeee,"" ""hooooo,"" and ""hiiiiii."" Are the buffalo adorning the packaging an activist reference to whitey's waste of these animals that the Native Americans handled more efficiently and reverently, or is the band joking about being bloated and on the edge of extinction? These songs were designed to keep us warm in our cubicles, to prevent us from leaping from dorm windows or attempting to mate with vending machines. Like too much of the entertainment from 1990-2000, this disc contains beautifully recorded, and expertly executed, piffle.","As anyone who has read this site's reviews of The Eminem Show or Source Tags & Codes knows,\n\ Interscope ...

Siamese Pipe,Heroine Sheiks,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0c1c0084474cd0c322d/1:1/w_160/05d49fc2.jpg,2003-02-09 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3837-siamese-pipe/,Rubric,"I really never saw Shannon Selberg as the poster boy for anything, aside from maybe one of the nastier forms of mental illness. As the voice of Minneapolis thrashers The Cows, he managed to swing requisite menace and a disarmingly arch, lowbrow wit at the same time, leveling both barrels at the oozing backalley/trailerpark underbelly of life. The ugly version of Americana Selberg wallowed in always used to strike me as a bit too extreme to represent reality (which, of course, was most of the fun); however, since the Cows split up, it seems like Selberg and America have been on the same road. Take the first track on the second full-length from Selberg's first post-Cows project: ""Army Brat"" doesn't just nail the zeitgeist, it knocks it up and refuses to pay child support. Selberg hawks up lines like ""I am an army brat/ My dick's a baseball bat/ That oil's gotta flow/ Cuz I say so, so so!"" with utterly convincing belligerence, while ex-Swans/Foetus guitarist Norman Westberg crunches away like a T.Rex with a mouthful of Grape Nuts. As with everything Selberg's ever articulated in galvanic ultra-scumbag mode, you get the feeling he's either completely messing with you or sneaking up from behind with a loaded shotgun in his sweaty hands! If you laugh along with the song, you're aligning yourself with this maniac; if you ignore it, you're missing the point. Which puts it-- along with the Dead Kennedys' ""Kill the Poor""-- in the ranks of the best sarcastic protest songs. But still: Shannon Selberg? A conscience? Maybe not. All this newfound relevance doesn't imply that he's actually changed-- not for the better, at least. The Cows' concept of artistic development mainly involved learning to play their instruments; once they could claim some success on that front, they proceeded to tear down whatever they'd accomplished with a snowballing sense of self-parody a hell of a lot funnier than most. True to Selberg's primitivist intentions, it kept ""art"" at a safe distance. You'd think, though, that with a fresh start in a promising new band-- Westberg is ample replacement for Cows axeman Thor Eisentrager (minus the kickass rock name), and the John Fell/Eric Eble rhythmic axis is just as evil-- they wouldn't have that much to parody; they certainly don't have to lay it on this thick. And while the Heroine Sheiks still have a lot of things going for them, Selberg's recent keyboard fixation isn't one of them: When he's playing it like an actual instrument, as on the creeping noir narrative ""Grab the Wheel"", and during the frighteningly visceral pop violence of ""Open You Up"", it's good enough for flavor. As a noisemaker, though, it often sounds like a lump of plastic tossed around on the ocean of real skronk the Sheiks muster elsewhere. While the band's leanings toward novelty actually complement some of the songs-- well-placed bicycle bells push their nigh-impossibly sleazy cover of Sonny Boy Williamson's ""Good Morning Little Schoolgirl"" into twilight-zone pedophilia-- they just as often take the edge off of Selberg's ferocity. The album's redneck-baiting final track, ""Mas Suicide"", has the makings of another sarcastic classic: Selberg growls ""My life's a shotgun/ Without a sight""; arguments over ""Freebird"" escalate to homicide, etc. However, after a couple of wheezing synth interludes and unfortunate monkey-hoots from Selberg, the song loses enough of its razor focus to fade into another simple joke. Maybe it's just that over the past few years I've become desensitized by the flood of junk culture, but where Selberg once distinguished himself by perpetually sinking lower than America, in 2003, Uncle Sam's finally caught up.","I really never saw Shannon Selberg as the poster boy for anything, aside from maybe one of the nastier forms ...

Give Up,The Postal Service,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1049d034d5c69bf286b/1:1/w_160/0da23510.jpg,2003-02-09 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6432-give-up/,Sub Pop,"To tell you the truth, it never even occurred to me. Sure, there were the countless nights spent listening only to ""(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan"", the apparent one-off collaboration between Death Cab for Cutie's Ben Gibbard and Jimmy Tamborello that served as the brilliant centerpiece of Dntel's Life Is Full of Possibilities. And there were my frequent, semi-coherent rants about how ""Evan and Chan"" was not only one of the best songs of 2001, but perhaps the perfect synthesis of IDM production and indie pop songwriting. The thought of further collaboration between Tamborello and Gibbard, however, never crossed my mind, so when I heard last year that they were collaborating on another single, I shit a brick-- and when it was later revealed that the single had evolved into a full-length album, I practically shit a whole firehouse. First, the bad news: Give Up doesn't offer 45 solid minutes of the same wholesale excellence that appeared in condensed form on ""(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan""; if anything, the album's occasional missteps serve to elucidate what exactly made the first collaboration between Tamborello and Gibbard so effective. Still, the core tension between Tamborello's intricate production and Gibbard's cutting voice makes Give Up a pretty damned strong record, and one with enough transcendent moments to forgive it its few substandard tracks and ungodly lyrical blunders. Tamborello and Gibbard put their best foot forward with ""The District Sleeps Alone Tonight"", which exemplifies the two best elements of this entire collaboration: contrast and subtlety. Here, Gibbard's vocal melody and Tamborello's instrumentation build independently to a perfectly orchestrated emotional climax, replete with hiss-laden sampled strings and ethereal background vocals. There's a noticeable clash between Gibbard's emotive singing and the upbeat drum machine line that drives the track's second half, but Tamborello's production is loaded with enough warm, melodic instrumentation to provide a surprisingly apt background for Gibbard's sincere tenor. The song also benefits from possessing some of the album's stronger lyrics. ""Such Great Heights"", the album's debut single, offers Give Up's strongest melody, but its lyrical parallels to N'Sync's ""God Must Have Spent a Little More Time on You"" make it just a bit hard to swallow. It hurts me to hear the words, ""I am thinking it's a sign/ That the freckles in our eyes are mirror images/ And when we kiss they're perfectly aligned,"" sung to such a unique and riveting melody. Of course, the song is a fine work of literature compared to ""Sleeping In"", which claims the record's most thoroughly cringe-worthy lines: ""Last night I had the strangest dream/ Where everything was exactly how it seemed/ Where there was never any mystery/ About who shot John F. Kennedy."" I realize there were probably some time constraints, but the vivid and intriguing lyrics of ""Evan and Chan"" proved Gibbard capable of much, much better than ""I want so badly to believe that there is truth and love is real."" Fortunately, Give Up overcomes its highly questionable lyrical choices, and the sometimes painful duets between Gibbard and indie folkster Jen Wood, purely on the strength of Gibbard's consistently strong melodies, which carry far greater impact in the context of Tamborello's hyperactive electro-pop than they have on recent Death Cab for Cutie releases. And Tamborello's production gives the intricate precision of Life Is Full of Possibilities a caffeinated overhaul, here forsaking the time-honored glitch of that album for bright, danceable beats. While it may be impressive that the unified and cohesive vision of Give Up was the result of a par avion collaboration, it's anything but surprising given the talent behind it and the immense chemistry shared by these two musicians.","To tell you the truth, it never even occurred to me.

Hard/Solid Gold,Gang of Four,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bee4c0084474cd0c2f5f/1:1/w_160/4edd33ea.jpg,2003-02-09 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3387-hardsolid-gold/,Wounded Bird,"The logic of this release escapes me completely. For those unfamiliar with Gang of Four's discography, let me first explain: This reissue compiles the band's second and fourth albums onto one disc, in reverse chronological order. I wish I could say its failings were predominantly linear, but the cruelty of this juxtaposition runs much, much deeper. Gang of Four's initial artistic trajectory (pre-reunions) can best be defined as tragic. They announced themselves to the world in 1979 with Entertainment!, one of the best debut albums ever released, and a powerful statement, encapsulating radical politics in a supreme assembly of accessible, Spartan punk-funk; it almost single-handedly gave birth to the post-punk aesthetic still widely mined today. The original lineup went on to record Solid Gold and the Another Day/Another Dollar EP, which both count as towering releases in their own right. Unfortunately, the band's material suffered as their lineup shifted; the departure of bassist Dave Allen, who went on to form Shriekback with former XTC keyboardist Barry Andrews, fundamentally changed Gang of Four's dynamic on their third LP, Songs of the Free. That album still has some classic moments, but it's far less incisive than either of their first two albums, and the rhythmic intensity that drove the band early on was all but lost. No disrespect to ace bassist Sara Lee, but she was no replacement for Allen, whose style was far more direct. Next to go was drummer Hugo Burnham, which left only Jon King and Andy Gill to create the band's final studio album in their first wave of work, Hard, which relied heavily on drum programming. In light of where the band started out, Hard wasn't just a letdown, it was an outright travesty. The would-be ironic title wound up a joke King and Gill played on themselves; in execution and content, the album is anything but its namesake. The female backing vocalists who open the album chanting, ""Is it love?"" are so overproduced, they sound practically synthesized, and the drum programming is straight-up Oingo Boingo. But the really sad thing about Hard is that it seems a blatant attempt to sell out. Hard does offer one or two decent moments, mostly hip-swinging grooves and Gill's guitar parts; Andy Gill was such a unique guitarist to begin with, it's no surprise his contributions are still fresh, even as he backed away from the slashing, confrontational style he made his name on. King doesn't fare nearly as well: He comes off sounding utterly disinterested at almost every turn, the urgency of his old, oft-imitated declamatory style completely lost, as he allows himself to become a conventional singer. About the only thing I can say for the folks at Wounded Bird is they at least distinctly separated the two albums, making it easy to skip straight to Solid Gold. Listening to the whole disc straight through, the transition between these records couldn't be more jarring, as the ultraslick pop of ""Independence"" is wiped clear aside by ""Paralyzed"", with its sputtering slow-motion funk and eerie spoken vocals. The intense grind of ""What We All Want"", the sheer propulsive force of ""Outside the Trains Don't Run on Time"", and the wry, anti-consumerist humor of ""Cheeseburger"" paint a vastly different picture of the band that went on to record Hard. Ultimately, it's extremely difficult to recommend a disc like this, but I can't give it a full thumbs down: Solid Gold is a canonical record, and for anyone with even a passing interest in the post-punk era, it's a must-own. Unfortunately, the comprehensive Infinite Zero reissue from 1995-- which appended the classic (and concurrent) Another Day/Another Dollar EP-- is out of print and uncommon in used bins (I won't be selling my copy anytime soon). Why that disc couldn't have been reissued intact is beyond me. Regardless, there's no real reason a disaster like Hard needs to be on the market while the band's definining moment, Entertainment!, remains out of print; presumedly, Wounded Bird couldn't afford the rights to issue that record, or chose to stretch the return on Hard by affixing it to one worth buying. It would have made more sense to pair Hard with Songs of the Free-- they're more stylistically similar, and the latter is also out of print-- but obviously that would hurt sales. If this is your only means of owning Solid Gold, you have to buy it, but exhaust other possibilities first, as Hard is nothing more than a grotesque exhibition of a once-great band on its last legs.",,3.8,
Everybody Makes Mistakes,Shearwater,by: Brian James,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a216ea9e61561daa495e/1:1/w_160/a67f7646.jpg,2003-02-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7102-everybody-makes-mistakes/,Misra,"Looking over the list of song titles from Shearwater's second album, Everybody Makes Mistakes, one may find a subtle theme. ""Room for Mistakes"", ""Mistakes"", and ""You Took Your Mistakes Too Hard"" all indicate an interest in mistakes, and the title of the album only confirms that concern. Others, like ""An Accident"", ""Wreck"", ""All the Black Days 1"", and ""All the Black Days 2"", branch off in subtle ways from the main thesis to announce in no uncertain terms that this record is positively sadcore. Though their lineup has expanded since 2001's The Dissolving Room to include Angels of Light percussionist Thor Harris and ex-Glass Eye frontman/Dead Milkmen producer Brian Beattie, Shearwater is still primarily the side project of Okkervil River's Will Sheff and Jonathan Meiburg. But this album boasts a much fuller sound than their last, due in no small part to their new contributors. Everybody Makes Mistakes broadens the band's sonic palate beyond the Leonard Cohen/Nick Drake school's timeworn standbys of acoustic guitars and pianos by incorporating vibes, accordions, glockenspiels, and organs (amongst other instrumentation), with which they weave together plenty of interesting textures-- the chords they use never sound slapped together, showing some real care and intelligence. ""Well, Benjamin"" and ""Mistakes"" even have some honest-to-God bounce, a nearly astonishing ingredient in an album like this. It becomes frustratingly obvious as the record plays, however, that the musical accompaniment is designed to be just that. Shearwater has a better sense of craft than their moping contemporaries, but their lyrics still stand front and center, with genre cliches doing most of the talking. Most of these songs sound like conversations the pair were too introverted to ever have, and usually express either a deep inner torment to a friend/lover, or analyzing a deep inner torment of a friend/lover to that friend/lover in the voice of one who knows how it feels and how to make it better. Take, for example, the following lines from ""Soon"": ""When no one else would suffer me, I threw myself at your ankles/ 'He treats his friends like customers, he treats me like a given,' your letter read/ 'Come down,' you said, 'And let me know I'm living.'"" It's hard not to wish the musical garnish would overwhelm the main course when the latter consists of such attempts to appear as wretchedly sensitive as this. Which is too bad for Sheff, as occasionally he sounds like he's got some spark in him. The same can't be said for Meiburg, however, whose lyrics and delivery are frustratingly dull. This kind of melodramatic navelgazing grows overly demanding at LP length to anyone not cemented in a similar mood, making Everybody Makes Mistakes ultimately too depressing for its own good. Of course, listeners who don't mind such emotional monotony-- surely, there are some who actively enjoy it-- can find a lot to like in the material Shearwater crowds to the back. As for me, the self-pity is all a bit too much.","Looking over the list of song titles from Shearwater's second album, Everybody Makes Mistakes, one may find a subtle ...

Hearts of Oak,Ted Leo and the Pharmacists,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcdaea9e61561daa7590/1:1/w_160/2c3e1bcf.jpg,2003-02-07 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4739-hearts-of-oak/,Lookout!,"Leafing through The Complete Pitchfork Works of Rob Mitchum, Year One, I've noticed that the prime recipient of my venomous ire has been the insidious ""Return of Rock!"" movement spawned by those over-enthusiastic Brits. Chock-full of worthless style-first bands, the whole phenomenon has left me cold from the get-go-- partially because my definition of rock isn't entirely confined to the Nuggets box. It's not that I don't like rock; I just prefer it to be motivated more by passion than retro fetishism. Exhibit A: My love for Ted Leo, the man who perhaps most embodies any kind of Jesus act rock 'n' roll still has left in it. He's one of the few guitar slingers I'll still go to bat for, and not just because he hails from the same city-district in which I make my residence. Shunning standard-issue hipster influences like the Velvets and The Stooges in favor of didn't-know-they-were-supposed-to-be-good bands like Thin Lizzy and Dexys Midnight Runners, Leo wields his two specialty instruments-- manic guitar and maniac voice-- with unbridled enthusiasm. Note the lack of studied posturing. So, naturally, I've been thrilled this year to see one of my favorite incredibly short people enthused over in the pages of Spin and Alternative Press for his new record, Hearts of Oak-- almost as thrilled as I am to write about him personally. But my critical duties compel me to point out that Hearts of Oak is a few steps off the pace of Leo's previous album, The Tyranny of Distance, an album so good it makes me want to commit that ultimate indie sin and preach that if Everyone Had Heard It, It Would've Been a Nationwide Top 10 for Sure. Freeing Leo's sound from the punk constraints of his former band, Chisel, and the experimental dub leanings of his pretty much unlistenable debut Rx/Pharmacists, Tyranny was, put simply, thee rock album of 2001, Strokes and Stripes be damned. For such a drooling fanboy as I, Hearts of Oak almost can't help being a step down, but thankfully, it's a nearly imperceptible one. Leo mostly sticks to Tyranny's formula, playing to his strengths with only minor alterations. Most notably, Leo reveals a deeper fascination with all things percussive-- rarely does a track not feature noisemakers or tambourines rattling around somewhere in the mix. The head Pharmacist still pulls combustible pop songs like ""The Anointed One"" and ""2nd Ave., 11 A.M."" out of every orifice with apparent effortlessness, and each is coated in a Krispy Kreme-like glaze of sale items from Maracas Plus. This approach culminates in the album's centerpiece, ""The Ballad of the Sin Eater"", where the only things not being shaken or hit with sticks are the bassline and Leo's vocal cords. Like ""Sympathy for the Devil"" on methamphetamines, Leo speak-sings a tale of traveling the world with American guilt (""you didn't think they could HATE ya now, didja?!""). It doesn't pack the wallop of the live version, already known to throw out the backs of the unprepared, but even the recorded version steals my attention away from whatever form of entertainment I'm simultasking. Elsewhere, Leo takes a more traditional route, quaffing liberally from barrels of big riffs and catchy hooks. Not-a-Paula-Cole-parody ""Where Have All the Rude Boys Gone?"" eulogizes The Specials as Leo unhinges his voice like a snake swallowing a rabbit, caterwauling, ""Foo-awoo-awoo-awoo-awoo-LESH!!"" at the unconverted. And through it all, his revolving-door crew of Pharmacists sound anything but transitory, even slipping into a convincing Booker T. & The MG's groove on the Boston-referencing ""Bridges, Squares"". Yet, as I said, I still find Hearts of Oak to be a slight sidewalk trip from The Tyranny of Distance, so let's just get my complaints out of the way now, shooting gallery-style. ""Dead Voices"" is the first time I've ever heard Leo's pipes fail him, resonating at an uncomfortable range like someone who started the national anthem in too high a key. Leo's assets usually mean he can hold an audience rapt with a solo number, but ""First to Finish, Last to Start"" is marred by an overdubbed guitar solo that's completely oblivious to the chord changes. And yeah, I could do without the whistling in ""The Crane Takes Flight"". Still, Hearts of Oak comes out smelling far sweeter than the releases of Leo's fellow glossy-mag guitar loyalists. Eschewing pretentious unpretentiousness for unguarded passion, strict '77-'82 influences for the classic rock stop on the FM dial, calculated instrumental inadequacy for guitar solos that are less technical flaunting (looking at you, Malkmus) than skillful, noisy exorcisms, Ted Leo makes a sound filled with so much authentic abandon that the British mags probably can't handle it. And that, my friends, is just about the biggest endorsement I can offer. ","Leafing through The Complete Pitchfork Works of Rob Mitchum, Year One, I've noticed that the prime recipient of my ...

Satanstornade,Masami AkitaRussell Haswell,by: Kim Fing Shannon,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c4425e6ef959693239fe/1:1/w_160/61841b26.gif,2003-02-07 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5242-satanstornade/,Warp,"Despite a deluge of recordings that might suggest otherwise, Merzbow did not invent noise. What he is responsible for is an incredible insight, a leveling glare into our perceptions of musical functionality: Merzbow's music intrinsically refutes academic hierarchies, self-important artistry, mindless fluff, fame, and craft. His work is, in a grand sense, about the mass proliferation of sound in our lives, the morbidity of our culture's regurgitation and recycling of aesthetics, and of course, a fundamental disagreement with thoughtless complacency. The very essence of this-- the need to represent, or in some way possess the constant influx of cultural trash-- merits Merzbow's rigorous release schedule. Even at their most aurally identical, each release is a different approach to Merzbow's preoccupations, be it bondage (which, for those who thought Merzbow was a one-trick pony, seems to be mysteriously absent in his work as of late), or jazz drumming. In the past 25 years, it's pretty doubtless that these releases have finally started to epitomize that endless cultural subconscious that Merzbow set out to recreate. Yet, describing this work in strictly academic or critical language undermines the sheer velocity and disruption a listener might feel, having never heard anything along these lines before. No Merzbow fan will ever be able to relive that initial shock, torment, and displeasure, that moral incongruence, or the satisfaction that someone finally took that extra step they always anticipated. At least not until they stumble onto Whitehouse. Warp Records have just released a new Merzbow record. Not to be filed under Merzbow proper, it's attributed to Merzbow's human incarnation, Masami Akita, who appears here alongside equally disruptive experimentalist Russell Haswell. Due to labelmates like Aphex Twin and Squarepusher, this will be the most widely distributed Merzbow album. Whether or not you're looking for a place to start, Satanstornade will be the one in your local record store. Perhaps there's been a climate change; maybe those pissed-off rap-rock kids in bubble coats are going to get even angrier when they get drafted. Maybe they'll need something more substantial to pump out of their subwoofers while they do figure-eights in a mall parking lot. Hell, Merzbow isn't that inaccessible: There are basslines looping back and forth all through the album. In fact, the most emblematic feature of Merzbow's noise music of the past decade or so is the fact that he's largely abandoned the random household noise of his earliest experiments, as well as the tape-collage work it evolved into. The precipitous, unabashed searing rushes that followed-- and settled-- after some experimentation headed, in the past five years, toward the use of underlying loops. Maybe it has to do with his decision to integrate a laptop into what used to be such distinctly physical musical method, or maybe it's just another view into the way our cultural waste works. All of those albums released and recorded, all of the television, sharing the same general content, day in and day out, lulling in its calculated directness. Or maybe it's just that all of that trademarked feedback is just a tiny loop anyway, being picked up by a microphone which sends it to speakers that send it to the microphone, over and over again. Whatever is emblematic of Merzbow's work in and of itself has been offset fairly recently by his newfound enthusiasm for collaboration. Not that there weren't traces of it earlier in his work, but Zbigniew Karkowski, Ladybird, Kouhei Matsunaga, Otomo Yoshihide, and now, finally released-- despite being several years old-- a collaboration with Russell Haswell have come to be a major factor in deciphering Merzbow's work. Merzbow's conceptual approach and aesthetics seem to dominate any situation heenters, however. Junk, waste, the violent cascades of sound, are mixed with Haswell's particularly digital-based aesthetics. The sounds of CD errors, binary yelps, and tinny crunches barrage Merzbow's typical noisy landscape. Considering Haswell's Live Salvage: 1997-2000 collection on MEGO, perhaps it's not even a question of Merzbow battling for dominance, but rather two artists reaching for similar territory. Live Salvage had a twist somewhat absent from Merzbow's work, though. There was a sense of location-specificity, a keen ability to integrate the physical, concrete nature of his noise into the space he was playing it in. Haswell has been looking for new ground after people like Merzbow have already staked their claims, and to shy away from a collaborative effort with such a central figure would've been absurd. Unfortunately, two men brandishing their laptops in public seems a little bit weak, a bit too hasty for either artist to make much of a dent. It's not a failure-- it fits neatly into Merzbow'slongstanding theories, and even serves as a bit of a challenge for him considering the collaborative aspect-- but the promise of Haswell's creativity is too quickly usurped. Hopefully this collaboration will be a bit more than a one-off, and the two can find a stronger equilibrium.

Another Beginning,Rockfour,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a297b1335d7bf169850f/1:1/w_160/402277d8.jpg,2003-02-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6816-another-beginning/,Rainbow Quartz,"I can hardly imagine what it must be like to be living in Israel right now. Terrorism and conflict may have finally hit home here in the U.S., but we're not even remotely close to the numbing cycle of violence and counterviolence the people of the Levant live with every day. The geek in me just has to ask: What kind of bands form in that sort of climate? It's easy to think of angry, depressing music coming out of every practice space in the country, but I somehow doubt that's what prevails; if anything, I'd think people would be eager to escape the news of the day whenever they throw a CD on, or head out to a club. Tel Aviv quartet RockFour sound so removed from the Negev Desert and the Wailing Wall, you'd be hard-pressed to even guess at their origins. In fact, RockFour sound incredibly like a product of late-60s Britain-- a little bit of early Pink Floyd, a lot of Beatles, a pinch of Byrds, a smidgen of The Zombies-- with the occasional exception in the form of a punishing interlude, or strange, studio-strangled breakdown. I don't need to tell you that the 60s revival game has been played to played-out, but that's probably the most remarkable thing: These four guys from Israel make it fresh again, and in the process put to shame just about any American or British throwback act you could point to. For one thing, their English lyrics slay any neo-hippie garbage the average neo-Nuggets band tosses out, ranging from incisive questioning of institutions and social responsibility (""Government"") to things as fundamental to pop music as love. And mind you, their first language isn't even English (it's Hebrew). Far more impressive, though, is RockFour's uncanny grasp of their influences, and their ability to expand on those points of reference, to the point where Another Beginning largely transcends them. ""Oranges"", with its opening jangle and impeccable harmonies, is undeniably indebted to the Byrds, but it gradually morphs into something else entirely, as swelling keyboards and darting Moog overwhelm the 12-string jangle. Unpredictable twists and shifts in texture seem to lurk around every corner, from weird vocal interjections and charging codas on the title track to the startling tempo change that rips open the shifting guitar and lilting melody of ""One Fantastic Day"". The guitar tone in its faster interlude is incredibly dirty and sinister, and the shift back into familiar territory is nearly as disorienting. RockFour clearly have their craft down pat (the band has four other albums out), as there's literally no filler on Another Beginning. In the end, it's probably best to ignore the relative novelty of their origins, as every one of the thirteen songs here delivers. Another Beginning is a remarkable collection that, while it treads widely-covered ground, is also sharp, inventive and most importantly, unpredictable.","I can hardly imagine what it must be like to be living in Israel right now.

Electronic Meditation/Alpha Centauri,Tangerine Dream,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a72b5e6ef95969320eee/1:1/w_160/80102e58.jpg,2003-02-06 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11847-electronic-meditationalpha-centauri/,OhrOhr,"Psychedelic music spawned so many fragmented genres of rock in the late 60s, it's easy to forget that at one point, most of the bands were trying to accomplish the same, basic thing: To change the world with music. Failing that, they might have settled for freaking themselves out, but exploration into the unknown was the key. Peace and love? Sure, sometimes. Surreal visions of the beyond? Check. Crazy backwards guitar solos? Extra nice. This kind of faith in a better tomorrow through experimentation (or at least the aping of experimentation, in the hopes of stumbling over a little second-hand wisdom) is one of the aspects of late-60s music culture that makes it so unique, and consequently why, in many ways, it was the last time rock was free of its own self-conscious ambition. American and British bands were quick to establish national schools of psychedelia, but continental European bands evolved differently. Countries like Germany and Sweden, far from the epicenters of pop and rock flourish, got their news via weekend radio shows and imported LPs. German guitarist Edgar Froese, playing with a beat combo The Ones, had already formed a long-distance attachment to Jimi Hendrix when he met Salvador Dali, and was inspired to form the earliest version of Tangerine Dream (named after a lyric in The Beatles' ""Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds"") in 1967. Froese met Berlin club owner Conrad Schnitzler, himself a student of avant-garde sculpture and music (via his former teacher Karlheinz Stockhausen), and later, drummer Klaus Schulze. Along with organist Jimmy Jackson, they formed the version of TD that produced their first LP, Electronic Meditation. TD oozes their way out of the gate with the primordial muck of ""Genesis"": A short, but telling introduction to a world apart from your mom's wholesome rock and roll. Fuzzy guitar flutter and Schulze's rin-tin-tinny cymbal rattle the stage clear for Schnitzler's basso profundo cello moan. That moan, for better or for worse, is the ""melody"" here, and I suppose that makes the quivering electro-effects a counterpoint. Flautist Thomas Keyserling (uncredited on the original release) bubbles here and offers a glissando there; at the height of synergetic convergence, Shulze drops a caveman stomp on the toms. If this was hippie music, it was borne of the most sincerely gone magick available. The two epics (a compositional preference Froese never abandoned) are ""Cold Smoke"" and ""Journey Through A Burning Brain"", both of which sound much more in tune with music Shulze and Schnitzler would go on to create than anything TD became famous for. In fact, parts of ""Journey"" remind me of each of Schnitzler's Kluster LPs, with unidentified sound effects and a hard-line approach to free improvisation: Any melodies are purely coincidental, and should not detract from the generally horrific vibe. The band does lapse into prototypical krautrock beat-mantra midway through, but makes sure to mix in sufficiently atonal flute soloing, and Froese's boundless, rhythmless guitar stylings. ""Cold Smoke"" begins with a different strategy, one much closer to what most folks think of when TD is mentioned: Keyboard-dominated atmospherics. That strategy lasts for exactly one minute before Shulze's cymbals rip apart the solemn organ chords; the organ tries to come back, and Shulze destroys it again. In the end, things end up fairly similar to the previous tune, though the seeds of a gentler TD have been planted. ""Ashes to Ashes"" takes the organ from ""Cold Smoke"" and adds some Doors-ish cocktail-rock drumming, and of course, more free guitar and flute. On Electronic Meditation, this tune is as close to rock as the group played, and in places is not unlike concurrent Grateful Dead (or more accurately, Amon Duul II). ""Resurrection"" tidies up the biblical concept with church organ and a backwards sermon (devilish!), and a return of the gooey acid-ballet of the opening song (hereby allowing TD to corner the market on psychedelic, freeform biblical concept albums from Germany). It was a far cry from the mystical impressionism of their mid-70s LPs (with only Froese remaining from this trio), and anyone who thinks the band is good for little more than New Age background moods will be surprised by this music. Shulze left the band before Electronic Meditation was released, and Schnitzler stayed on only long enough to see the induction of 16-year old drummer Chris Franke into the band. Schnitzler's replacement was the rambunctious organist Steve Shroyder (himself a member for only one album). The trio of Froese, Franke and Shroyder (along with two guest musicians) recorded TD's second record, Alpha Centauri, and had little difficulty living up to the freaky promise of the Dream's debut. Pieces like ""Sunrise In the Third System"" (an organ-led mystic processional) and the single (!) ""Ultima Thule Part 1"" (with a very non-TD rock thud) proved the band were learning how to pour maximum mood into more compact structures. That said, the centerpiece is the massive title-track: Not only does this piece take up the bulk of Alpha Centauri, it's an almost perfect summation of everything they'd accomplished up to that point. Beginning with distant flute, and gigantic cymbal swells, the track (like many before) takes a while to get off the ground, but when Froese's brand new VCS3 synthesizer makes with the siren calls, the outer limits are within reach. Even at this early point, Froese was fascinated with the possibility of the synthesizer, though he hadn't quite mastered its range. Flautist Udo Dennebourg plays a starring role for much of the piece, adding melodic, if flighty, direction to an otherwise malleable form. Dennebourg begins announcing something at the close of the piece, and wordless, choral backing vocals deliver the dark finale. Each of these records (as well as 1972's Zeit and 1973's Atem) were originally released on Ralf-Ulrich Kaiser's legendary Ohr imprint, also home to the first recordings of Ash Ra Temple, Popol Vuh and Amon Duul. Over the years, Tangerine Dream has undergone a number of personnel changes, and Froese gradually transformed the chaotic Technicolor of his band's first recordings into an altogether different trip. However, as products of the psychedelic era (and the budding German experimental rock scene later dubbed ""krautrock""), these albums are fine nuggets indeed, even if the best was yet to come.","

Private Lines EP,Manishevitz,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c391c0084474cd0c34cd/1:1/w_160/0312da76.jpg,2003-02-06 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5076-private-lines-ep/,Jagjaguwar,"Since it's just one guy named Adam Busch who writes songs, plays guitar and sings, with a constantly rotating backing band, you can only call Manishevitz a band in the same way you could call, say, Guided by Voices or Nine Inch Nails a band. Thing is, in that regard it's a fantastic band. The songs are quality, nicely arranged and beautifully produced. In the ""actual band"" regard, however, the outlook's not quite as sunny, since the growth of the collective as a whole can only mature at the rate of its central member, and perhaps more importantly, because the results can vary greatly from record to record. For the occasion of this EP, Busch has torn a few pages out the family photo album of Chicago's well-established indie (post-)rock scene, and lured them into a studio. But this is one of those instances where the payoff isn't what it should be: This method has equated to some utterly exquisite music in the past, even from this band-- and mind you, it's not actually half-bad-- but here, the results are somewhat frustrating. The recording itself may be somewhat to blame, as it doesn't ring with the kind of clarity that brought 2000's gorgeous Rollover home so effectively. You could practically hear that album breathing, and that's the kind of treatment Manishevitz needs-- Busch's voice is a limited instrument, and he needs some space in the mix to be most effective. Here, there's something almost muted about the sound, as though the decidedly pale colors on the cover were the inspiration for everything contained within. And that's a shame, because the music deserves better. The two originals, co-written by Busch and guitarist Via Nuon (aka Bevel), are still inspired pieces of work. ""Back in the Day"" is a loopy waltz in the grand Manishevitz tradition, with a smart arrangement by long-term contributor Fred Lonberg-Holm, and sports a great instrumental passage where Lonberg-Holm plays some nicely crunchy cello parts, and Nuon heads up top with some searching phrases. It's immediately outdone, however, by the excellent title track, easily one of the most energetic pieces Manishevitz have recorded. Nuon's lightly embellished melodies are the carrot pulling the rest of the band along, and they duly whip the song up to a full gallop. But aside from a rather incidental tape collage called ""Backwards Deck"", the rest of the EP consists of two covers-- Robert Wyatt's ""Free Will and Testament"" and Roxy Music's ""2HB""-- neither of which are especially interesting in this context. ""Free Will and Testament"" just kind of drifts along, and while Nuon and Lonberg-Holm try subtly to spruce it up with various embellishments, it's a losing proposition. ""2HB"" suffers more, though, as Busch just cannot do Bryan Ferry's swooning vocal melody justice. The song gets further bogged down in its intentionally cluttered outro, which basically ends up sounding like Radiohead's ""The National Anthem"" with no muscle. Taken alongside Manishevitz's other work, I'd label Private Lines a minor letdown, though I hardly think it's cause for alarm-- EPs are frequently used as clearinghouses and stopgaps between albums, and this seems like a case of that kind of mentality. In short: fans will likely be interested in what they find here, but newcomers are much better advised to head straight to Rollover.","Since it's just one guy named Adam Busch who writes songs, plays guitar and sings, with a constantly rotating ...

Absolutely Nothing,Townes Van Zandt,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a91fb1335d7bf169943d/1:1/w_160/63185612.jpg,2003-02-05 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8412-absolutely-nothing/,Normal,"If to live is to fly, as Townes Van Zandt would warble, then he himself, to quote from his devout admirer Willie Nelson, was an angel flying too close to the ground. His quavering voice flattened with alcoholic pickling, the burdensome weight of bodily pain palpable in his throat, Van Zandt's powerful songs resonated through artists such as Emmylou Harris, Steve Earle, the Cowboy Junkies, and Tindersticks over the decades with a decidedly dark edge to the proceedings. While often compared to Bob Dylan in terms of songwriting prowess, Van Zandt's words relied less on stream-of-conscious glossolalia than on the barren wastelands inside his own head. The result is more Samuel Beckett than Lightnin' Hopkins, and lines like, ""I got a friend at last.../ His name's Codeine/ He's the nicest thing I've ever seen/ Together we're gonna wait around and die,"" convey a trailer-park existentialism that can make for a rough listen-- one preferably with the windows shut and the whiskey opened, the gas on and the lights off. The last in a series of fervent exhuming by the German label Normal, this posthumous release couples a 1994 solo performance in Ireland with five songs recorded days before Townes' death on New Year's Day, 1997. Opener ""Flying Shoes"" is of the trunk-packing blues variety, although there's a greater weariness on display here than in earlier versions, leaving one to wonder if Townes could have even put his boots on by this point. A tape buzzing distracts the fidelity of the bleak ""Kathleen"", but the downward spiral of emotions comes through painfully clear, and throughout the concert, his playing is still lucid. The audience is rapt and appreciative throughout, if not dropping like flies as the concert continues. When it comes to women in Townes Van Zandt's songs, they are of one variety only: succubi posing as barflies, pulling him down deeper into the burning hellfires with each drink of bourbon. In ""Two Girls"", they're of a Lynchian dichotomy, one light and one dark, abstracted beyond mere gal-flesh. The wicked witch tale, ""The Hole"", is harrowing, despite its obvious imagery; Van Zandt's voice is a haunting amalgam of Hank Williams' ""Luke the Drifter"" persona preaching the allegorical estrangements of Franz Kafka. ""Don't go sneaking 'round no holes,"" he croaks at the concluding moral, ""there just might be something down there, wants to gobble up your soul."" It's not all doom and gloom though, as Townes was known for interjecting jokes during his shows, if only to keep the suicide rate down. Some appear here, as does a funny talking blues about discovering the pocket-change pleasures of Thunderbird wine and its cloudy-brained oblivion. With Van Zandt's well-documented history of alcoholism, though, it seems to laugh to keep from crying. The last studio recordings are not culled from the aborted sessions with Sonic Youth drummer Steve Shelley and Two Dollar Guitar-ist Tim Foljahn, but from earlier in that fateful December. Aside from a Pogues cover (""Dirty Old Town""), these are slower, eerier versions of old material, almost from life's other side, and are difficult to stomach with foretold death so palpable in the air. ""Nothing"" was harrowing enough on his 1971's Delta Momma Blues, but here he merges with the death rattle itself, barely exhaling the final lines: ""Sorrow and solitude, these are the precious things, and the only words that are worth remembering."" Absolutely Nothing is fascinating, albeit extremely dismal listening, but, sharing seven songs with the classic double live album Live at the Old Quarter, Houston, Texas, is ultimately more for completists and those searching for an aural equivalent of Faces of Death.","If to live is to fly, as Townes Van Zandt would warble, then he himself, to quote from his devout ...

Lost Horizons,Lemon Jelly,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bccd13d197565213b3d1/1:1/w_160/95bcc9e4.jpg,2003-02-05 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4726-lost-horizons/,XL,"I'm a sucker for a goofy sample. And ever since I first heard Lost Horizons, I've been humming an insidious children's tune sung by a theatrical English baritone: ""All the ducks are swimming in the water, falderalderaldah, falderalderaldah."" That voice is sampled in ""Nice Weather for Ducks"", a happy-slappy lollipop of a song that nicely sums this record up: Sunny, bright, and vaguely irritating. On Lemon Jelly's first full-length, following a collection of their first three EPs called Lemonjelly.ky, Fred Deakin and Nick Franglen stuck to a simple pattern. They made eight upbeat, ebullient instrumentals with slick beats, synths like plastic-cast rainbows, trumpet solos, acoustic guitars, and killer vocal samples: Charlton Heston moaning on about how he's a ""Ramblin' Man"", or on ""Space Walk"", the ecstatic transmission of an astronaut proclaiming ""it's beautiful"" again and again. This is the perfect disc to throw on after your four-disc Ultrachill Dub Groove Mix has put the whole party to sleep. It's like eight flavors of ribbon candy, beach balls hitting the ground like hail, and a big plastic clown face that blows helium. The novelty wears thin, though, and most of the tracks aren't as neat as the samples they're built around. The ""Ducks"" song is the most likeable (the meringue band that shows up in the bridge clinches it), but Lemon Jelly's own parts sound blunt and somewhat bland. They do better when they ditch the novelty techniques: ""Return to Patagonia"" has propulsive melodies and a dramatic rhythm, and ""The Curse of Ka'Zar"" builds a loping mix of harmony voices, jazzy rhythm samples and anthemic brass to a swollen climax. ""Experiment Number Six"" is the only break in the mood. While the music stays in the same loungy/poppy vein, the subject is haunting: A detached doctor's voice narrates an experiment in which a human subject is killed with a stimulant and analyzed as his vital signs drop. It's so different and sinister that it's more intriguing than the rest of the album, and yet annoyingly displaced-- especially when the next song (""Closer"") throws you right back on a strawberry-flavored hot air balloon ride. So how you feel about Lost Horizons depends on how much it charms you. Make no mistake, the record is extremely endearing and flawlessly constructed-- it's just hard to love an album that has a dazzling surface and not much underneath.","I'm a sucker for a goofy sample.

Yes, they have, on occasion, featured a little searing guitar and hyper-spatial reverb acoustics, but those have seemed more ornamental than core aesthetics of their songs-- as opposed to, say, Acid Mothers Temple. I hear them as straight folk-rockers, perhaps more Neil Young than Pink Floyd, with a flair for atmospherics. In any case, there aren't many artists (outside of Jagjaguwar's entire roster, that is) representing for the flowers-in-your-hair old-school as well as Shibayama and company. On the Love Beach-- a play on the band's name in Japanese, On the Beach-- was Nagisa's first record, from 1995, and while a bit lighter in scope than their current stuff, is clearly of the same muse. For the most part, Shibayama plays it very cool here, allowing his pick-up band to handle all of the freakier parts. ""Me, On the Beach"" features folky acoustic guitar strumming, slack drumming and a barely-there lead vocal from Shibayama, accompanied by occasional harmonica and his own whistling. This song, like many in Nagisa's catalog, is perfect for afternoons when zoning out seems a better choice than just about anything, particularly for anyone who likes their psych on the sweet and lowdown. Also typical is the beamed-in acid flashback of a guitar solo that closes the tune. If it weren't for interjections like that (see also the atonal solo in ""Elegy to Betrayal""), Nagisa Ni Te might be mistaken for any number of college campus minstrels, albeit ones with a knack for tuneful melancholia. Perhaps because of their general sunny slackerdom, Nagisa Ni Te's outright pop moments stand out: ""Yesterday's Story"" is top notch, Donovan-styled vibes with a tight arrangement of brush percussion, bells, handclaps and vintage backwards cymbal. And at less than three minutes, it's remarkably concise-- who says psychedelic folk meanders? ""Deserting You"", the second of two completely dissimilar versions of this tune, goes so far as to include faux-cabaret piano and brass (provided by Hiro Nakazaki and Tori Kudo of Maher Shalal Hash Baz), and comes out sounding like a young Tim Buckley rewriting the theme from ""Cheers"" for a community band. On the Love Beach is never unpleasant or overly strange, in spite of the occasional forays into echo-chamber psych or strange stylistic experiments. In fact, I get the feeling that Shibayama isn't really so amateurish as his sometimes-unstable singing (except during the background harmonies, when he's always spot on) would have me believe. The arrangements are all ace, and taken as a whole, the songs really do transmit some brand of spaced-out na√Øvet√©. However, I wouldn't say they were terribly interesting by themselves. At this point, Nagisa Ni Te hadn't yet found a way to push their sweet nothings into the outer regions of cosmic balladry.","Osaka's Nagisa Ni Te, headed by Org Records (Maher Shalal Hash Baz,\n\ Hallelujahs) owner Shinji Shibayama, have never ...

The Raven,Lou Reed,by: Brian James,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a23e13d1975652138811/1:1/w_160/8c0704ff.jpg,2003-02-05 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6732-the-raven/,SireReprise,"When the dust finally settles on rock and roll, Lou Reed will be placed in its frontline of geniuses. A truly astonishing chunk of the sound, style, and ambition of rock's avant-garde has been directly or indirectly copied from the four proper albums Reed made with The Velvet Underground over three decades ago. Ever since he walked away from the sex 'n' drugs circuit, though, Reed has frequently sounded unsure of himself, unable to find a new home. He came awfully close to true renaissance with his New York trilogy, but towards the end of the 90s, Reed lost the plot once again. Suddenly, he was approached by theater god Robert Wilson to apply his music to a stage adaptation of Edgar Allan Poe's work called POEtry. Wilson's collaboration with Tom Waits led to The Black Rider, one of the weirdest albums ever to be so simultaneously good; it's only natural Reed was excited about the possibilities. The music from POEtry has been released as The Raven, and it does nothing if not confirm that Reed is currently as clueless as his most spiteful detractors could suspect. Packaged as either a 75-minute single disc or an even more exhaustive double-disc set that tacks on more poetry and stories, this album is as much of a baffling nadir as Metal Machine Music, with nowhere near the stoned bravado. Perhaps it works when it accompanies whatever Wilson put on his stage, but as a listening experience, it implodes with the combination of grand ambition and an equally massive void of ideas. An impressive cast of guest stars including David Bowie, Laurie Anderson, The Blind Boys of Alabama, Ornette Coleman-- even Willem Dafoe and Steve Buscemi-- do their best to help cover up Lou's wanting prose, but a list this long should provoke more trepidation than interest. Whenever that much decaying gunpowder is scraped together, the result is usually less a bang than a whimper, and in this case, it's an exceptionally drawn-out, irritating whimper. Reed's songwriting shows no daring, producing flaccid, indecisive experiments that never get off the ground, and when he settles for the tried and true rock mode, he really settles. For example, the simply ridiculous ""Edgar Allan Poe"" strikes like a PG-13 Schoolhouse Rock lesson with shabbier vocals. It's not bad enough that Reed actually sings the lines, ""These are the stories of Edgar Allan Poe/ Not exactly the boy next do'""; incredibly, he repeats them several times. Musical crimes like this abound, but what's more noisome about The Raven is the inept way the Poe tie-in hangs over the proceedings. The poetry readings are adequate, and Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin take on ""The Raven"" is rather fun, but even good poetry readings are no way to resuscitate a moribund album like this, and as a result, they wind up as just another aspect to unmercifully elongate the record. Worse still is the way Reed profoundly misunderstands what he's doing: Rather than delve into the cobwebs and shadows of Poe's psyche-- as one might expect-- he presents a glossy, good-natured encomium to a Great Artist, and from his tone, it's impossible to tell whether he's saluting Poe or Norman Rockwell. When he touches upon Poe's themes, he does so superficially, or obscurely. On ""Change"", he sings, ""Your ass starts to sag, your balls shrivel up, your cock swallowed up in its sack/ The only thing constantly changing is change, and it's always for the worse."" That might have some relation to Poe, but it has none to poetry, and Reed should know better. He should also be wiser than to try to slip his own work next to Poe's, but he makes that mistake as well. Two reworked songs, Berlin's ""The Bed"" and Transformer's ""Perfect Day"" make unjustified appearances, and while guest vocalist Antony salvages the latter, the former illustrates much of what's wrong with The Raven. The original remains one of the more haunting songs in rock history, featuring Reed singing about suicide with a narcotic detachment, somehow screaming just beneath the surface. Here, he sings with the self-consciousness of someone who knows he's written something great. A mumbled aside about ""poetry and stuff"" becomes ""Poetry and Stuff"", and the song simply dies. Reed's biggest problem has always been not realizing what he does best and, consequently, what he does worst. He can't write a decent love song to save his life, but he's tried so many times since sobering up, you'd think he was Diane Warren. With The Raven, he tries to write a gigantic love song to Edgar Allan Poe that's no more sophisticated than a MASH note to a grade-school crush. Reed is in a perfect position to draw out the rugged humanity that kept both Poe and his Velvet self tethered as they stared into the abyss, but he instead makes a much cheaper analogy between the two: He says you could dress up for Halloween as either Poe or the Rock 'n' Roll Animal because both are scary, and both are great artists. The Raven, for all its talk of tribute, is a sneakily narcissistic pose-- one that deserves a full-throated response of ""Nevermore.""","When the dust finally settles on rock and roll, Lou Reed will be placed in its frontline of geniuses.

Toktok vs. Soffy O,Toktok vs. Soffy O,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7d25e6ef95969321081/1:1/w_160/1ee154bf.gif,2003-02-05 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8096-toktok-vs-soffy-o/,Toktok,"When I was young, I taped a copy of Disintegration over the only cassette that was handy at the moment, which happened to be an exercise routine of my mother's. I don't know if it was because of the tape or the deck, but the original sound didn't get entirely replaced: When I was done I had a copy of Disintegration with vague traces of aerobic instruction underneath, so that way back in the mix on ""Last Dance"" you could just make out the odd ""and three and four"" or ""keep those arms up."" Over the ensuing years, music's made me want to do a lot of things with my body, but this Toktok vs. Soffy O album is the first recording since that Robert Smith/Jane Fonda mashup that's made me want to Jazzercise, neon-hued Lycra and all. As I am not a particularly active person and look terrible in shorts, this is basically my way of saying that this record is really good. But first the obligatory history. Toktok itself is two guys from the Berlin techno/electro scene who started off releasing singles on Ellen Allien's Bpitch Control label. Those recordings are a pretty interesting mix of playful techno and sample pastiche, but where everything goes near-magically right is the part where they're lucky enough to team up with a singer named Sophia: The combined Toktok vs. Soffy O endeavor is a step beyond, a big concoction of Hi-NRG techno beats, sunny minimalist synths, and great big strutting pop songs with Sophia twirling and chanting all over them. It's a blend that'll get called techno, or electro, but it strikes me more as a great dance-pop sound that only techno and electro fans have properly appreciated thus far-- and even that's ceasing to be true, as it appears that the group's last single has actually broken the German charts. When you're done with the Hasselhoff jokes consider this: I'm not surprised in the least. When these three are on, the effect is like watching pyrotechnics spray all over a bedroom while a particularly cool teenager does hairbrush Karaoke in front of the mirror. There's ""Missy Queen's Gonna Die"", which managed to use just stiff beats, electro's simplest bassline, and Soffy O's bratty, metallic vocal performance to leap onto what seemed like a half-dozen big compilations. Contending on those German charts is ""Day of Mine (Ludicrous Idiots)"", which fleshes out the group's sound to a surprisingly buttery sheen, replete with string samples and baritone sax. And sadly mislabeled as ""Neighbor"" is my personal favorite, ""Jean"", a big Hi-NRG workout that's both a heavy banger and incredibly fun, all minimal swing and big squishy disco loops. Which is the surprise with their best work: It's amazingly fun and playful. These days it's clear that the 80s fetish in a lot of northern-European dance music has conveniently bypassed the pastel good humor of the real-life decade; on the other end of the spectrum, the outright playfulness of stuff like French house (or, closer to home, DMX Krew) sometimes seems to be doing a little too much winking, nudging, and semi-ironic mugging. Aside from making some stellar pop tracks that can really be danced to, the genius of Toktok vs. Soffy O is their ability to cut a line between those two things in a way that makes them difficult to compare to anyone else: They're playful, sure, but they're also dead serious, which is why Soffy O can sing and chant everything from recriminations and dismissals to heart-on-sleeve songs about aging. It would be a stretch to say the sound is without precedent, but damned if it doesn't seem like it while the record's playing. And it certainly doesn't hurt that Soffy O's vocal presence is as striking and convincing as Madonna's on ""Into the Groove"". Here's the big apology: This album is not, at present, out on CD in the U.S., though I'd like to think it might be soon. It's fairly solid even apart from those killer singles, with the double 12-inch format organizing things nicely: The first two sides collect the singles and four other tracks on a general par with them; the next 12-inch sports the ""Day of Mine"" companion ""The Lookalikes"", while the other cuts drift gradually back toward those earlier Toktok releases, with the sound less and less focused and Soffy O less and less incorporated. This can look like either a big drop-off or just a final-cuts detour back into Bpitch territory, which means less pop immediacy and more sonic twists: The slinky tweaks of ""Talkative"" are like a more-fun/less-prissy counterpart to Ellen Allien's own stuff, while the jerky ""rock"" beats and guitar tomfoolery of ""A Pointless Life"" serve as the goofed-up throwaway every good record needs. In other words: Not perfect, but look out, because when they're on, they're really quite on.","When I was young, I taped a copy of Disintegration over the only cassette that was handy at the moment ...

Anti,T. Raumschmiere,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2179d034d5c69bf2af4/1:1/w_160/91bc7e5b.jpg,2003-02-04 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6695-anti/,Hefty,"Berlin's Marco Haas has a perfectly interesting birthname and yet he records as T. Raumschmiere. He's released material for venerated Cologne imprint Kompakt and on his own label Shitkatapult (brilliant name, that), and with Anti, he makes his American debut on John Hughes III's Hefty label. Don't let the Kompakt affiliation fool you into thinking that T. Raumschmiere has a fondness for warmth or accessibility. Anti's minimal techno is cold and precise, the aural equivalent of a brushed chrome examining table in a Bauhaus-style hospital. Like the furniture in our examination room, Anti is so ordered and clinical that any detritus is thrown into sharp relief. In this glitchy musical age, we celebrate dirt instead of cleaning it up: The detritus becomes ""melody."" And there's a fair amount of dirty melody on Anti. The record starts off with a track called ""Random Noize Musick"" that's about as random as an atomic clock, all tightly sequenced beats, static hits every other bar, and, it must be said, some pretty interesting sounds bobbing around in the murk. It's dark, a bit menacing sounding, and pretty addictive at high volumes. ""Substrom"" sounds a lot like Pan Sonic as it brings a bit more funk in the form of a bouncier near-house beat and a slowly bubbling bass synth. ""Leichtes Kratzen"" is slow, verging on sensual, with a late-night organ-ish synth pad and absurd, butterfly-kiss electronic handclaps. On ""Eroslung Durch Strom"", Raumschmiere explores explores the claustrophobia that comes with complete blackness in a manner similar to Plastikman's Consumed, with a murky kickdrum that seems to come from inside your head somewhere and an ominous, repeating melody. Darker still is ""Dual Kanal,"" which processes and then loops a frantic passage of clustered strings, stretching them thinly between electronic handclaps that this time seem like a slap. There is some variety here despite the intentionally anemic nature of the production, and Raumschmiere demonstrates a range of darkly shaded moods. But despite its obvious strengths, I'm hard-pressed to identify anything particularly unique about Anti, something that might make you pluck this particular record from the swollen ranks of minimal techno releases. One almost wishes Raumschmiere had brought the noise just a bit more, so that the discord might provide the textural raw material that could be shaped into something that stands out. I'm reminded of the name of Andy Warhol's cable television show: Nothing Special.","Berlin's Marco Haas has a perfectly interesting birthname and yet he records as T. Raumschmiere.

It's a Lonely Planet,Photon Band,by: Kyle Reiter,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a065c0084474cd0bfb77/1:1/w_160/901a8b0e.jpg,2003-02-04 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6279-its-a-lonely-planet/,Darla,"Philadelphia's Photon Band stand with each foot firmly planted in two camps of revivalism. Their catalog is exceedingly effects-laden, perhaps too experimental for pop purists, but much too tuneful for diehard psychedelic torch-bearers. Still, their method of creating lo-fi, Nuggets rock has just the right amount of each attribute to keep it convincingly fresh, a trend that continues on their latest full-length, It's a Lonely Planet. Like their last two albums, and countless singles, It's a Lonely Planet is full of lazy slide guitar, backwards hi-hats, shimmering hooks, and plenty of quarter-inch tape hiss. Frontman Art Difuria (ex-Lilys) strains breathily from the bottom of a shallow well; the music sounds as though someone slipped powdered glass into a wad of Elephant 6 bubble-gum. Anyone looking for the revved up intensity of Oh, The Sweet, Sweet Changes or the crunch of ""747 (Don't Worry)"" might be disappointed: It's A Lonely Planet floats out of the speakers, much more conducive to a late night come-down than a cross country drive. Most songs are retiring ballads, the kind pulled out at the end of the night to send fans out the door in each other's arms. This isn't necessarily a bad thing-- the music is compelling enough to pull it off without getting boring-- but those initially drawn to The Photon Band for their propulsive Who sound are in for a sobering change of pace. The album begins with a collage of cut-up little girl laughter, before launching into the title track, which includes rockist poetry like, ""I was talking to Jesus/ He had a lot to say/ I was talking to T. Rex, too/ And he made me feel O.K."" It's a Lonely Planet only hits its stride halfway through: ""Paper Plane"" suggests what Guided By Voices might sound like if Bob Pollard were obsessed with Sell Out instead of the arena anthems on Who's Next, while the acoustic stroll of ""If It's A Beautiful Day"" is enough to make McCartney's first solo album jealous. ""Closer"" lifts the The Zodiacs' ""Stay"", but thankfully, the Photon Band ditch the grating falsetto delivery Jackson Browne employed on his version, setting the melody in a dime-store My Bloody Valentine landscape, whirling with tremolo and multiple backwards tracks of guitar. Overall, The Photon Band don't seem the least bit embarrassed about copying the sound of a bygone era, and as the end result is first-rate, I hope they don't second-guess themselves anytime soon. Without schtick or tired irony, they survey the 70s ballad format that's been in vogue over the past year, infusing a variety of moves from their previously disparate shoegaze past to create a fine bridge, between their more raucous early efforts and a possibly mellow, golden future.","Philadelphia's Photon Band stand with each foot firmly planted in two camps of revivalism.

Phase One: Celebrity Take Down,Gorillaz,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf75c0084474cd0c3036/1:1/w_160/ee7c4d82.gif,2003-02-04 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3525-phase-one-celebrity-take-down/,Virgin,"Okay, so interactivity ain't all it's cracked up to be. Here I was, all excited to take my reviewing skills into THE THIRD DIMENSION. But rather than getting the musical equivalent of a novel, I was about to dig into a Choose Your Own Adventure, baby, controlling my destiny like a true red-blooded American. If there's any musical entity fitting for this open-ended treatment, it's Gorillaz, an act that doesn't physically exist beyond binary code. Nominally some kind of oblique statement about the artificiality of today's pop stars, there were about a million ways this cartoon group could've been Jem 2000, quickly filed in the novelty-music dustbin of history. But saved by an actually pretty decent album of spooky, vaguely hip-hop-flavored solo material from Blur's Damon Albarn and a gaggle of other hipsters and bold-edged lewd anime from Tank Girl creator Jamie Hewlett, Gorillaz beat out many flesh groups to become the rare act with success on both sides of the Atlantic. Chalk up a big chunk of that success to the video for ""Clint Eastwood"", a Leone-inspired (Sergio, not Dominique) video featuring, amongst other things, a gigantic static ghost voiced by Del tha Funkee Homosapien and zombie monkeys recreating the choreography from Thriller. Like a rebel yell, it made me want more, more, more, and so the idea of a Gorillaz video collection was quite delectable. That's basically what Phase One: Celebrity Take Down is, as it collects ""Clint Eastwood"" and the band's four other videos, with a whole bunch of extra stuff (some interesting, some useless) thrown in for padding. All of this material is arranged into an environment very similar to the renowned Gorillaz website, with all the features spread out over the band members' rooms and other nooks and crannies of their house. This arrangement allows Hewlett to cram the DVD full of interesting clutter and detail, as well as some nifty 3-D CGI, but also makes it practically impossible to get to what you want to see quickly-- no labels anywhere, unless there's a booklet not included in my promo copy's slipcase that helps point the viewer towards his goal. The fancy interface can't cover up a dearth of material, however; there's not much beyond the videos, and the ones that aren't ""Clint Eastwood"" are only marginally more interesting than screensavers, the bizarre Road Rally of ""19-2000"" excepted. For the 2% of the world that cares, they also include extensive kinematics and sketches for all the videos, so you can enjoy the animation in stationary, pencil form. Visuals from the Gorillaz live show are also provided, using even more recycled footage than the videos, and there are two award show performances where one can use the angle button to view different computer animations created for the event. This feat of technology is easily overshadowed by the guest rappers filling for Del on the Chinese award show performance of ""Clint Eastwood"", two earnest fellas that nonetheless prove that the Mandarin incarnation of The Streets is gonna be a whole lot harder to swallow. Further strewn about are a few thirty-second clips featuring the band members (Gorilla Bites), segments which prove that 1) the group possesses a very distinctively British wit (one clip revolves around how to kill an eel for culinary purposes), and 2) a lot more could have been done to add depth to these drawerings. The message I took away from the DVD is that, surprisingly, the conceptual part of Gorillaz lags far behind the music; despite all the detail, there's not much character to the characters (they're even outperformed by Hewlett and Albarn's Cuckoo's Nest impressions in the mockumentary Charts of Darkness). The Gorillaz's feature film currently in the works might remedy this failing (and just might be the best movie featuring fictional musicians since Glitter), but in terms of this release, the wasted potential of the gimmick and relative weakness of the features makes it little more than a take-home version of the website for the DSL-impaired.",,5.6,
Minority of One,Dag Nasty,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8829d034d5c69bf3a74/1:1/w_160/744b6c27.gif,2003-02-03 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2140-minority-of-one/,Revelation,"Who cares about the synth and metal vogues-- the real 80s genre we want to see revived is skate-rock, right? Right? Where'd everybody go? Deke? Trey? Oh, yeah, skate-rock never went away. It somehow got inside the malls whose parking lots it used to corrupt after hours. It became emo, or diluted post-Green-Day distortion-pop, or Warped-Tour-core. Memory lane's a bitch, all grown over with bramble and pocked with billboards. But each of us can coo at recalling the day we broke our right arms in two places when we hit that chain link fence trying to perform a trick on a stolen Guerrero. What could be sweeter than when we passed out in shock a little while later in that hot dog line? Remember how unconsciousness looked like TV static? Dag Nasty was there, soundtracking it all, part of our (now that I think of it, very un-punk) slavish loyalty to Dischord Records in the virginal anarchic days before Tony Hawk performed in Police Academy 4: Citizens on Patrol and Urban Dance Squad lip-synched in a poolful of pro boarders. And skating deserved a music; you've got to love a mode of transportation that incorporates the human appetite for slapstick. Yeah, Minor Threat were famously tight, but they were like a boiler threatening to blow; Dag Nasty never sounded as borderline unhinged or ""hardcore."" So the tameness of this one-off reunion (marking the ten-year anniversary since their last reunion on 1992's limp Four on the Floor) comes as no shock. 1987's Wig Out at Denko's exemplified the most powerful chronicle of their self-help speed metal, though the kids swear by Can I Say, probably out of that peculiar punk affinity for firsts. Those folks will be happy to find that the retro-D.C. Minority of One is helmed by Can I Say vocalist Dave Smalley, also of All and Down by Law renown. This album's fun, though, for what it is: An old-school muscle-flex. As my visiting cousin noted, the guitars go ""rernt-ra-rernt"" and the drums go ""doom-papa-doom-pap."" Blood kin ain't lying; Brian Baker, also the guitarist for Bad Religion, can't not sound like himself, though he's allowed to loom larger in the mix and drop more stopwatchably athletic solos on this outing (the occasional Caucasiana of those barbershop backing vocals further suggest the Bad Religion sound), and Colin Shears is kind of bound to that one beat as a result. Then there's Smalley, sing-speaking about ""standing for things,"" being careful to balance his frustration with positivity as he hurls abstractions at his listeners. I'm surprised that after Built to Spill's spoof of this genre at the end of There's Nothing Wrong with Love, its mouthpieces still pen lines like, ""I don't know how to feel inside."" Smalley's always well-meaning (""There's got to be more to life than doing what we're told"") but Dag Nasty 2002 is trapped in this strange vein of rock that's transparent in its emotions and its didacticism, resulting in art that doesn't draw people closer-- you can garner it just fine through the gallery window. Smalley even delivers some early-day-MacKaye style sermons while the band ""hushes."" Now and again, ""in life"" is used to contextualize a line (""everywhere you go there's another wall in life""), which begs the question, where else other than, uh, in life? I'll admit that this album came in handy after a traffic cop searched me this week, facilitating a brief hate-the-state high that had me hunting for my old hoodie and comparing prices on spray paint. But when I calmed down, I realized that Dag Nasty's simplified approach could only be profound or liberating to someone caught in puberty's sweet torrent back in the day. If anything's changed since then, it's technology, since puberty is now officially installed by corporations, and we walk in the shadow of President Reagantron. Which might be why this aging rage sounds a little canned. The harmless riffage here was so controlled, so palatable, that it inhibited this reviewer's ability to riff on it.","Who cares about the synth and metal vogues-- the real 80s genre we want to see revived is skate-rock, right ...

Whether it was the extensive photographic portraiture and videos of snowboarding bros shredding around the world, or the ceiling-high murals from the Destroy All Monsters collective rendering the mug-ugly visages of The Stooges, The Nuge, Sun Ra, and Grand Funk Railroad for all the art world to see, there was a palpable masculine presence as their hobbies somehow became high art. The weirdest room of all, though, belonged to the Forcefield collective. In a darkened enclave stood legions of dummy robots, unholy and menacing crossbreeds of Chewbacca high priests and Jawa fag-hags with tasers. Randomly they would spaz or flash red-lit eyes, emitting high-pitched squeals or other analog squelches. The effect was much like that of a G.G. Allin show at Alice Tully Hall, as blowhard art patrons were literally pinned to the back wall, afraid that at any moment one of the orange-haired mannequins might make a charge at them with a clawful of shit. Forcefield had turned the Whitney into a paint-huffing haunted house for at least one room, and it was hilariously terrifying. Without the showroom dummies in conical hand-knits and Cousin It wigs, it's hard to attain the same effect with just this plastic wafer of sound effects and pre-programmed loops, buttressed by live recordings of the ever-mysterious Patootie Lobe, Meerk Puffy, Gorgon Radeo, and Le Geef-- but it'll have to do. Snatches of tiger-stripe patterns and Moog patches only begin to touch upon what kind of weirdness and odd-colored light is emitted from Forcefield's compound in Providence, RI, which serves as a primordial omphalos of sorts that led to offspring such as Lightning Bolt and Black Dice. While these groups are busy embodying ""rock,"" Forcefield is operating on a sub-sub-conscious level of scrambled UHF signals and stoned-brain alpha waves, reveling in the mental damage that maxi-thins and public access shows can really do when given a chance to melt together. Amoebic and amorphous, they absorb synthesized sounds both scathing and cheesy. ""Hoedown"" is drum-machine cowboys and crow meat for twenty seconds, while the slightly longer ""3rd Annual Roggabogga Motion Picture Soundtrack"" is some of Sun Ra's primitive spacefarts under a fuzzy-rug waterfall with Battlestar Galactica reruns in the background. ""Inverse/Interior Plane of 3rd Annual Roggabogga (Behind the Scenes)"" is nigh on fifteen minutes of droid sighs (replete with Warhol white-wig and golden-shag tapeworm), and Technicolor ripples from deep within the Ituri forest, their Atari 2600 plastics firmly melded with their engorged frontal lobes. More ethnic illness is in the ""Radio Puebla Metallica"" bits, as tablas loop ad nauseam before the acid-house of ""Assassins Rmx 'Assassabogga'"" salivates over the diva-skulls still dressed in floor-length jack o'lantern argyle gowns. ""Field Recording of 3rd Annual Roggabogga"" is another quarter-hour of robot jungle juice live from the Whitney, or some other such lost continental ceremony, and the ""2nd Annual Roggabogga"" is similarly sustained damage, making the end of the disc a bit too mind-numbing to crawl through completely. Beta-era digital collage and grade-Z cultural clutter are what powers Forcefield best, and while the glossy pics add another element to the puzzle, it remains impossible to fully assess their work through this release alone. The parameters of early Boredoms meta-lingua and art school-era Devo's synthesized jocko-lobotomies are firmly in place, as are each band's outlandish dress codes, but there's so much more going on up at the compound (video art, installation, comics and other newsprint publications, etc.) that this can be but a Roswell-like fragment of their obscured Tommyknocker craft.","Dudes straight took over the last Whitney Biennial.

Televise,Calla,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4e9b1335d7bf1698a95/1:1/w_160/d6bcc66a.jpg,2003-02-03 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1251-televise/,Arena Rock,"2001's Scavengers marked Calla's departure from the amorphous reaches of their debut, and they've been driving steadily songward ever since. Once the sublimation of their old tendencies toward hiss manipulation and feedback resulted in such a startling transformation as ""Fear of Fireflies"", there was no turning back, and why should there have been? Scavengers was a clear demonstration that their talents lay elsewhere: In the crafting of radiant slow-motion scenes, miniature dramas playing out behind rain-slicked windowpanes. Televise carries them even farther down the same lonely streets, under the same gray skies; they rarely deviate from form, keeping closer to traditional song structures than ever before. It's often a beautiful ride, but it's also a long one. You might want to bring something to read, just in case. The record peaks early, with the unrivaled rush of ""Strangler"", infusing their delicate slowcore antics with a compelling hint of aggression. Caustic bass and guitar interplay seethes at its heart, only barely restrained by the muddled resignation of Aurelio Valle's whispers. Despite the underlying tension, it doesn't stray far from Calla's comfortably faded aesthetic, and even brings to mind some of the simple glory of Scavengers' ""Fireflies"". As with their previous album, they score big on the opener, but the beginning is somewhat misleading; the tension subsides before long, leaving hollow subtlety in its stead. Televise settles down almost immediately after ""Strangler""; ""Monument"" still shows traces of the first track's unresolved anger, but by ""Astral"", it has dissipated entirely. A numbing chill sets in as the gloomy, weathered beauty of this album begins to come to the fore. Valle's voice chokes and cracks breathlessly just above the mix; cymbal washes slowly tranquilize the listener. This is undeniably what Calla does best, but to a certain extent, the neural anesthesia becomes stultifying. From a certain vantage this isn't a problem-- each track is dutifully calming, a simple matter of getting lost in the fog-- but these lush arrangements seem content to simply drift by, never truly engaging the listener, and making it difficult to fully appreciate the album if you aren't in the mood to be put under. They do eventually call it quits on the hypnotist act, late in the album. The sly grooves of ""Televised"" break stride as aggressive drum patterns keep pace with a stutter-stepping bassline. It recaptures some of the frustration embodied in the opener, undercut by a single, desperate guitar refrain rattling around somewhere in the depths. The disc then closes with ""Surface Scratch"", a gloriously shaky bit of piano minimalism that owes more than a nod to Howe Gelb's finer empty-air desert wanderings. Together, these unique pieces are an impressive reward after clearing the cobwebs and surfacing from the recesses of the album's languorous middle works. It's truly a grand finale, but Televise could have used a mild shot in the arm a bit sooner.","2001's Scavengers marked Calla's departure from the amorphous reaches of their debut, and they've been driving steadily ...

Propaganda,Awol One & Fat Jack,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1625e6ef9596932018f/1:1/w_160/d237eedd.jpg,2003-02-03 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/390-propaganda/,Mass Men,"Underground hip-hop is quickly becoming clogged with depressives. From Atmosphere to Sole-- and even Eminem in his totalitarian, sensitive dickhead guise-- rappers of late seem desperate to let the world know that, ""Hey, I'm a fucked-up piece of shit, too!"" And the extent of self-loathing in hip-hop is only spiraling deeper in oppression; even though it's a universal sentiment (everybody hates themselves sometimes), you just wanna point to Tony Soprano and recommend some therapy, 'cause clearly, help is no longer considered socially emasculating. Awol One, thankfully, doesn't suffer from this affliction to the point where it becomes the sole message of his music-- though he certainly whips up a vast mire of his own insecurity on Propaganda. Sure, he spits some self-hate through his phlegmy rasp, and even a little reflective self-pity, which actually finds a comfortable residence in his morose, boggy half-singing. But mostly, Awol solves his own problems before he begs for sympathy. When he asks, ""Why do I always destroy all the good things in my life?"" he answers his own question: ""Self-destructive behavior."" Atmosphere, listen and learn. Of course, Propaganda does have its share of self-destructive behavior. There's plenty of it-- including self-abuse. But Awol gets most specific when he's reflective, when he finds solace in a rhyme. Acting not so much as a mirror as a barometer, he observes, ""Music is just like a heartbeat. Watch the world, and I gotta take notes,"" and simply, ""Music makes me feel alive."" He presents himself as a scribe, representing for those that beat themselves down, empathizing with their plight, sometimes calling them (himself?) out: ""You look so sad in your self-centered, lonely life."" Propaganda is pregnant with these kinds of conversationally paced cadences and Awol's perpetually gritty vocal timbre, which conveys a certain raw fragility. Like just about everything these days, it's so goddamn meta. Honestly, though, it sometimes hurts to listen to this, which means he's doing his job. Because the record is, for the most part, art as therapy, the nerve Awol hits is sometimes too raw in its brutal emotional honesty (""Sometimes I don't mind being a loser. But I'm not a beginner""). Not to mention Fat Jack's beats-- low-key and spacious, almost minimal, and about as funky as a funeral procession. There's no escapism in Awol's inner dialogue, no effort to paint himself as fucked-up-crazy and therefore cool; there is beauty, however, in the knowledge he's spoon-feeding you the cold, hard truth.

C64 Massive SIDplay Party Mix CD,Lesser,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bce9c0084474cd0c2bb1/1:1/w_160/44f423b6.gif,2003-02-02 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4754-c64-massive-sidplay-party-mix-cd/,Tigerbeat6,"For the sake of full disclosure, let me say this upfront: I'm an Atari man. My pops dropped a 2600 on me on my sixth birthday, and from there on out it was Joust and Adventure and that goddamn impossible E.T. In recent years I've been geeky with my time and money and tracked down other old Atari models, like the Atari 400 computer and the last re-working of the Atari console system, the 7800. I've come across countless Commodores in these searches, but never have I been tempted to buy one. Maybe it's a Coke/Pepsi-type of thing. Some kids dug Go-Bots and Legos, some went in for Transformers and Construx. So as far as nostalgia goes, Lesser's C64 Massive SIDplay Mix didn't have me reaching for the photo album and tissues. Give me River Raid any day. Being a PC noodler and composer, however, has exposed me to the sounds and possibilities of the SID chip, the source of the Commodore's grainy, chunky, Vietnam-vet-beat-boxing-with-a-vocoder musical palette. While it actually utilizes less tone generators than the Atari's POKEY synth chip (three channels to the POKEY's four), and exists in two different models (MOS 6581, used here, and MOS 8580), the SID chip has seemingly found the widest post-heyday audience: There are websites that list scores of C64-exclusive composers. And now, there's also this latest effort from Matmos VIP J. Lesser. An indulgent celebration of one fan's devotion to the legacy of Bob Yannes, C64 Massive SIDplay is a continuous mix of (supposedly) pre-existing SID-crafted loops and dot-matrix grooves that stands as both a tribute and an exercise in pushing the chip's dated abilities to the maximum. It's a showcase. Oh yeah, and a chance to completely fuck with Paula Abdul. Abdul's silly-bitch single ""Straight Up"" gets an 8bit enema here, and arena heroes Van Halen are represented by a decayed, malfunctioning interpretation of ""Jump""; these and a few other covers in the mix, while entertaining, come off as cute and gimmicky, and don't develop into anything more than novelties (I've already heard that terrible Canadian dance version of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit""-- do we need to trivialize this song again?). Only Salt 'N' Pepa's ""Push It"" benefits from the tinkering, rising from the album's closing minutes like a ready-made cyborg street soldier with infinite ammo and nine lives left. These cuts find themselves mixed up with straight-ahead techno potboilers a la the Mortal Kombat theme, fractured drum breaks, SID rave whistles, and gabber basslines, all spliced together by Lesser, who is obviously enjoying himself under his street pimp alias DJ Brotha P-Touch. But nostalgia only gets so many miles per gallon, and as a continuous mix, Massive SIDplay breaks down pretty fast; not from a lack of love or skill on Lesser's part, but from the simple fact that unadulterated video game music gets old after a while. The SID chip tones become nondescript, the rhythms repetitive and predictable (although the slash-and burn explosion around the 48-minute mark shakes things up, composition-wise), and as one track links up with the next you find yourself wondering: Do I really need to hear an hour of this? Alec Empire's Nintendo Teenage Robots ran into similar trouble with the Nintendo sound chip, finding that the limitations of the source device led to an increasing lack of modern musical possibilities and a heap of discarded work. Lesser would be wise to listen to the 8-bit Construction Set's ""Atari vs. Commodore"" 12-inch, one side of which features SID-composed locked grooves for DJs, as well as the ingenious ""Dollars"", which puts the nostalgia aside and finds the Detroit grime in the SID's silicon soul. For those among you weaned on a Commodore in the rec rooms and dens of American youth, Massive SIDplay could be the soundtrack of your life: An indelible, comforting stroll through a gamer's childhood, assuming your childhood took place above a Tokyo discoth√®que circa 1983. For the rest of us, Lesser's mix is an interesting document of the SID chip's capabilities and charms. It's prime mixing material and a clever musical oddity, but not the party-starter it hopes to be.","For the sake of full disclosure, let me say this upfront: I'm an Atari man. My pops dropped a ...

Moth,Mick Turner,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a83513d19756521395ca/1:1/w_160/e3064860.jpg,2003-02-02 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8193-moth/,Drag City,"Say what you will about Pavement's noncommittal live performances; they always brought great opening acts with them. Before Malky's alkies semi-rocked the joint, concertgoers were treated to such stimuli as Rollerskate Skinny, Shudder to Think, David Kilgour, David Lowery's oompah outfit FSK, and-- prior to the release of the Australian band's debut-- Dirty Three. Warren Ellis would saw at his violin, gazing into his amp as if it were a mirror he was trying to smash with telekinesis. Jim White's drums served as a texture rather than a timekeeper, swishy and shimmying one minute, then pronouncing an on-guard pomp the next. I've watched the man drop a stick and continue unfazed, staring ahead like a piece of David Lynchian atmosphurniture listed in the end-credits as Weird Glaring Man. Guitarist Mick Turner, a beanstalky James Dean who appeared to be petting his hollow-bodied Gretsch, conveyed the band's blue cool. After Dirty Three's raw outpouring, Pavement's profile was reduced to that of the smirking DJs they once were. Over several albums Dirty Three perfected their style, which was to lilt a bit, only to erupt into violent √ºber-crescendos that called to mind an Itzhak Perlman score for Spielberg's holocaust vigilante epic Schindler's Pissed. Members of the band became a kind of Funk Brothers for indie rock's dark horsepeople, backing such nihiluminaries as Nick Cave, Cat Power, Will Oldham and (Smog). On Dirty Three records, Ellis was always the madman scampering around Turner's garden. When that garden is undisturbed, though, it's a beautiful thing, as Turner has proven on releases with White as Tren Brothers, with Oldham (reciting excerpts from Rabindranath Tagore's Gitanjali) as Marquis de Tren, with an all-star cast as Boxhead Ensemble, and on three solo full-lengths, the newest of which is Moth. If Moth's nineteen untitled parts comprise a sequel to Marlan Rosa, that album's cresting ship is marooned somewhere, and its captain has carved himself out a domicile; barking dogs on ""Part 1"" help to ground the album. Rosa's violins and drums must have never washed ashore, but the island's other inhabitant, multi-instrumentalist (and Simon Joyner/Edith Frost/Pinetop Seven sideman) Mike Krassner, more than makes up for their absence with plaintive piano tones that would melt even David Grubbs' icy fingers. And how to describe Turner's playing? I don't know, ""heroin-flamenco?"" He strikes chords with a kind of rolling, prophetic brush. He plucks strings as if he's confidently repairing or cleaning them with nervous tools. Yet there's something ""organic"" about his leapfrogging tranquilly up the fretboard's stream. His arpeggios sound like they're stumbling home from ex-lovers' porches. Middle Eastern influences are detectable, but clouded with purposeful imprecisions. Here and there the songs seem composed, but Turner's apparently reading from Polaroids instead of sheet music. The pieces' only flaw is that they're often abbreviated, as if Turner fliply stopped the tape (though the same technique wasn't so problematic on Turner's more wholly fragmented solo debut Tren Phantasma). Moth is meditative, in a trance sense-- you can't concentrate to it, since its odd timing sidesteps willfulness, and its organs may leave you humming along like some guru's brain-spanked disciple. (Turner's word ""Tren"" might even be a shorthand for Zen trance, since ""Zance"" sounds stupid.) This album's baroque implosions prefigure what would happen if someone let the hot air out of Sigur R√≥s, and its dilapidated majesty suggests that it'd have made a fine soundtrack for the earthier moments in that popular, unflinchingly homoerotic trilogy about the gay wizard and the elves fighting to keep jewelry out of the penis-towers. (One of the Latin words for ""ring,"" after all, is rectum.) The listener won't mind Moth's retreads of other Turner progressions. The listener will be treated to un-pedaled acoustic pieces as well as backward loops and dubs as fragile as a tapestry of overlaid spiderwebs. The listener will envision Nick Drake warming up for ""Black Eyed Dog."" The listener will feel like the dentist's assistant just adjusted the sweet nitrous knob. The listener will think a bunch of abstract hokum-- gag, I seriously wrote in my notes that ""Part 12 traces the savage architecture of the snot-trails generated by a weeping deadbeat dad."" The listener will forget how funny it is that web searches for Mick Turner result in lists of sites that reference Mick Jagger and Tina Turner (and that Bill ""Smog"" Callahan's web-presence is outsized by that of Bill Callahan the Oakland Raiders coach). The listener will be reminded, even by Moth's nineteen exhalations, of how Dirty Three flies in the face of all the instrumental trignometrists: Their emotiveness makes them a rock band.","Say what you will about Pavement's noncommittal live performances; they always brought great opening acts\n\ with them.

Writers Without Homes,Piano Magic,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a06713d1975652138396/1:1/w_160/cf58692c.jpg,2003-02-02 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6281-writers-without-homes/,4AD,"Piano Magic occupies an odd space in the indie music landscape. They've released around a half-dozen full-lengths of various kinds, including at least one near-masterpiece (1999's Low Birth Weight), an excellent ambient release as part of Darla's Bliss Out series (A Trick of the Sea, from 1998), and a concept album about the first World War (2000's Artists Rifles), yet their profile in America remains remarkably low. Partly because they're difficult to track (the personnel in the band changes constantly, and they release and re-release music in every format available), even dedicated music press consumers come across Piano Magic only occasionally. You could almost say that their coverage and fan murmurings mirror the actual music; rather than being shouted from the rooftops, Piano Magic hype spreads via intimate whispers. The word on the street about Writers Without Homes since its release in late 2002 has been almost uniformly negative. Few Piano Magic fans hear it as anything but a disappointment. Listening to it a couple months after most observers have had their say, it occurs to me expectations for this band are high, and this record has been graded on a curve. It's a good thing to expect a lot of a band, and Piano Magic, brilliant as they've been on occasion, is expected to turn out something great. This album certainly never approaches that high plateau, but it still has its pleasures. But one thing is for sure: Writers Without Homes is definitely as moody and beautifully recorded as any Piano Magic I've heard. Glen Johnson has a tremendous grasp of how to convey feeling through sound, particularly with the guitar. The high, rapid arpeggios that follow the booming drums into the void on ""(Music Won't Save You from Anything But) Silence"" are tense and harsh, like a thick rope cinched around your chest. The plucked acoustic on the lovely one-minute folk tune ""It's the Same Dream That Lasts All Night"" is so rich and powerful you forget that it provides the only music behind Suzy Mangion's heavily reverbed voice. And the positively Frippertronic whine of James Topham's electrified viola that winds its way through ""Already Ghosts"" is by far the best thing about the track. And there's the rub: For all the album's lovely sounds, the bulk of the actual songs on Writers Without Homes are not particularly memorable. The quietly spoken lyric atop the gurgling bed of wistfulness is a Piano Magic staple, but the tracks using this technique here are remarkably flat. While something like ""Snow Drums"" from Low Birth Weight was packed with remarkable lyric detail to make the words come to life, tracks here like ""Certainty"" and ""Dutch Housing"" just kind of lay there without depth like a pretty doily. The only unarguably great song is ""The Season is Long"", which features John Grant of The Czars harmonizing with himself on the chorus, ""Don't you ever think that you might love me?"" It makes me think of one of Kurt Cobain's best lines: ""I miss the comfort in being sad."" Once you have someone in your life who does love you, you get a bit melancholy about how deeply a song like ""The Season is Long"" could cut you when you were alone. That track aside, however, Writers Without Homes is ultimately a nice sounding record without the emotional weight that makes Piano Magic special.","Piano Magic occupies an odd space in the indie music landscape.

You Forgot It in People,Broken Social Scene,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3ac9d034d5c69bf2ea3/1:1/w_160/44da3695.jpg,2003-02-02 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/952-you-forgot-it-in-people/,Arts & CraftsPaper Bag,"It's a bit late to be talking about New Year's Resolutions, but mine was to dig through the boxes upon boxes of promos that arrive at the Pitchfork mailbox each month, and listen intently to hundreds of them in one sitting, in an attempt to discover those rare, impossibly great bands that would otherwise slip through the cracks. It's been an absolute bitch so far, and awfully disheartening, but I've hit paydirt a couple of times, and in those moments of glory, it's been worth wading through every cut-up Cuban big beat record, every generic Midwestern rock record, every bar band, every swing band. See, the problem is, it's impossible to know what's what; you have to just dive in and hope for the best, because sometimes the bands with the worst names and most hideous packaging are just great musicians who would make terrible image consultants. Case in point: Broken Social Scene. No one wants to admit that they like a band that goes around calling themselves this-- a band who, judging from their artwork, stands around all day looking pensive, crouching, and feeling the music in dramatic grayscale, a band that finds its home on Arts & Crafts/Paper Bag Records, who puts the message ""break all codes"" above their own barcode, and who dedicates their album to their ""families, friends and loves."" I already had them pegged! How could they not be the most unimaginative, bleak, whiny emo bastards in the whole pile? I don't know. But this disc is nothing like you'd imagine. Not even almost. I've been over it again and again looking for some cause, some reason, anything, that would compel a band with this much unfiltered creativity and kinetic energy-- a band without even the slightest suggestion of tear-stained poetry or bedroom catharsis-- to fall victim to the worst possible Vagrant Records clich√©s. I can't find it. All I know is that when I press play, and this disc whirrs to life, it inexplicably sheds its crybaby fa√ßade and becomes... sort of infinite. I've been listening to this disc for months on repeat-- sometimes just this disc for days-- but it wasn't until I began doing research for this review that it began to make sense how a band like this could materialize from out of nowhere with such a powerful and affecting album. I knew from the liners that the group has ten members (fifteen if you include guests); what I didn't know was that all of them have been wandering from band to band within the wildly experimental Toronto music scene for years, or that they all came together from groups like Stars, Do Make Say Think, Treble Charger, A Silver Mt. Zion, and Mascott with the unified goal of making, of all things, pop music. One of its members told a Toronto weekly that ""we'd already made our art-house albums... the whole ideology of trying to write an actual four-minute pop song was completely new to so many of us."" Who could have imagined it would come so easily? You Forgot It in People explodes with song after song of endlessly replayable, perfect pop. For proof, pick virtually any track: the sound barrier-bursting anthem ""Almost Crimes"", the subdued, gossamer ""Looks Just like the Sun"", the Dinosaur Jr.-tinted ""Cause = Time"", or the shimmering, Jeff Buckley-esque ""Lover's Spit"". And there's plenty more where that came from. How about the chugging guitar-pop of ""Stars and Sons"", which spins a distant, churning keyboard drone beneath the best moments of Spoon's Girls Can Tell and punctuates it with a barrage of percussive handclaps. Or ""Anthems for a Seventeen Year Old Girl"" which showcases Emily Haines' melting alto caught in a beautiful, cyclical refrain and intensely modified by vocal effects while violins float atop subtle banjo plucking and cascading toms. Or ""KC Accidental"", which blasts searing, super-melodic guitar, a drumkit alternately galloping and relentlessly beaten, and an impenetrable wall of accelerating orchestration, before crash-landing into a deliquescent pop lullaby. The band's aforementioned art-house pedigree goes a long way toward making You Forgot It In People more than just another fantastic pop record: One of its foremost traits is its airy spaciousness. On many of its tracks, the sounds seem to resonate indefinitely, as if played at top volume on a Greenland hillside and recorded miles away. Simultaneously, the album is dense with the baroque instrumentation of all fifteen players, each part beautifully arranged, and all of them bleeding together in perfect harmonic unison. Chalk one up for heretofore unknown producer David Newfeld, who isolates the song's key instruments upfront in the mix, and captures all others as delicate nuances-- an expansive, pillowy bed of ethereal violins, muted trumpets and flutes to softly support the traditional guitars, bass and drums. Rock critic Michael Goldberg recently speculated that what makes music fanatics thirst for the obscure is the desire to discover music that is ""uncontaminated by the commerce machine."" This, he says, is the reason we cling to the abstract and unmarketable, the outlandish and abrasive. And yet, this is also the guy whose favorite album of last year was the painfully vacuous adult-contempo masterflop by Beth Gibbons & Rustin Man. Granted, not all of us share Goldberg's taste for sub-folk cheddar, but there's something like that record in each of our collections. So, how can there be room for both challenging, forward-thinking music and straight-up accessibility? Well, we're not total fucking assholes, right? We can kick back with Ekkehard Ehlers or Electric Light Orchestra-- there's inherent greatness in both. But the holy grail for people like us is the record that combines outright experimentation and strong hooks, something that engages us mentally while appealing to the instincts that draw us toward pop immediacy. Some of the best records ever have been ones that put these two seemingly disparate elements together-- and you can go as recent as The Notwist's Neon Golden or as far back as Sgt. Pepper's (and probably farther, if you want). This kind of music shouldn't be hard to come by; it's just that not many artists are able to perfect that balance. Broken Social Scene have, and even made it seem effortless. I wish I could convey to you just how perfectly this record pulls off that balancing act, how incredibly catchy and hummable these songs are, despite their refusal to resort to pandering or oversimplicity. I wish I could convey how they've made just exactly the kind of pop record that stands the test of time, and how its ill-advised packaging and shudder-inducing bandname seem so infinitesimal after immersing yourself in the music. And I hate to end this saying, ""You just have to hear it for yourself."" But oh my god, you do. You just really, really do.","It's a bit late to be talking about New Year's Resolutions, but mine was to dig through the ...

Fed,Plush,by: Kyle Reiter,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0b5ea9e61561daa4612/1:1/w_160/b01a868e.jpg,2003-01-30 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6357-fed/,After Hours,"To mangle Mark Twain: Reports of Fed's genius are greatly exaggerated. The proper follow-up to 1998's More You Becomes You is, at times, a rewarding listen, but often feels like Liam Hayes (Plush's sole member) is trying far too hard to emulate the post-production pop brilliance of the past instead of focusing on the songs themselves. What made More You Becomes You such a great listen was the intimacy and sparseness of the solo piano-and-vocal recording. Any subtlety from those sessions has now evaporated, as Fed takes on a ""more is more"" attitude that only works about half the time. Recorded over two years with five different engineers (including both Steve Albini and John McEntire), you can almost hear Hayes over-thinking all aspects of the album. After Drag City pulled out, fearing the impending enormity of his recording bill, Hayes reportedly paid six figures out of his own pocket to finish the album, which seems a misguided choice when you consider it has yet to find domestic distribution (though it has been released on the Japanese After Hours label, with a $25.99 list price here in the U.S.). Fortunately for the listener, however, Hayes tends to be a better songwriter than he is an accountant. At least, sometimes. Certainly, pop music has used orchestration to its fullest potential, but let's not forget that under every Brian Wilson arrangement or George Martin score lurked a great song, only enhanced by the studio. Hayes has enlisted legendary R&B;/soul arranger Tom Tom MMLXXXIV to orchestrate the album, but the score tries to serve as the centerpiece of Fed, and unfortunately, many of the string parts are as pointless as Tom Tom's ridiculous surname. Ultimately, the album fails when weaker songs buckle under the weight of the strings and horns. When Fed works, it works well, and the finer moments sit alongside the brilliance of Randy Newman's 12 Songs or Harry Nilsson's Nilsson Schmilsson, but large chunks of the album quickly become stale due to Hayes' constant efforts to outsmart the listener. Armed with a piano full of deceptive cadences, Fed rarely lets the ears up for air. Flexing a little intellectual musical muscle now and again is what separates true songwriters from those who merely write songs, but after fifty minutes without a hint of humor and few natural resolutions in the music, listening to Fed can be tiring; Plush seems determined to bludgeon anyone within earshot into pretentious submission, and trying to fake out the audience can bore as easily as if you hadn't any tricks to begin with. Plush can write 70s AM Gold with the best of them; ""Greyhound Bus Station"" is easily as good as Looking Glass' ""Brandy"" or Nick Drake's ""Hazy Jane II"", and what makes it easily the standout track is how it proves Hayes can craft a three-minute gem without dressing it up to the point of distraction. Equally compelling is the beautiful ""No Education"", a slow number that begins, ""Never read a book in my life/ But I feel just fine."" It's post-rock ballad heaven from there on out. The title track is a perfect example of how Fed meanders: Clocking in at almost seven minutes, it starts with a soulful mid-tempo stroll, augmented by a droning hum and punctuating strings. But halfway through the track, Plush turns it into a falsetto ballad that bears no resemblance to the introduction. Which is fine-- schizophrenia sometimes serves well-- but with no musical glue holding the parts together, the song turns from epic ballad to aimlessness. ""Fed"" sums up Fed nicely: A good idea gives the illusion of being flushed when really, it's just overdeveloped. Plush's vision was obviously reaching beyond his abilities when making this album, and though that's commendable-- better to try and fail than not try at all-- sometimes you acheive less on the road to greatness. I have no doubt Plush is on that road, but it'll be a while before he gets there.","To mangle Mark Twain: Reports of Fed's genius are greatly exaggerated. The proper follow-up to 1998's More You ...

Live at Maxwell's,Imperial Teen,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b957ea9e61561daa6f8a/1:1/w_160/51f44bc0.jpg,2003-01-30 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4083-live-at-maxwells/,DCN,"I've spent the last few weeks trying to work out whether not enough people listen to Imperial Teen or whether they do and I just don't know about it: The band spent some time opening for The Breeders last year, so it seems as if plenty of you will at least have heard their name. Most of the time I'm solidly convinced that they're a fantastic band, and sometimes I imagine they should be as widely enjoyed as The Strokes. It is, after all, my personal theory that The Strokes are the most successful band in this ""new rock revolution"" business because they're really more of a pop band: No matter what people say, they come off more like Blondie or The Romantics than The Velvet Underground. The same could be said of Imperial Teen, only they're about ten times more interesting. They're from San Francisco; they're two women and two men, one of whom used to be in Faith No More and the other of whom is like a pissier, more hyperactive Pat Smear; and some of them-- if I'm not mistaken-- are gay, a fact that fuels some of the odd gender-play in their lyrics: This is a band whose first single's big hook went, ""Take it like a man, boy,"" and who later made a rhetorical argument out of, ""Why you gotta be so proud?/ I'm the one with lipstick on."" Also they're sly and bratty and tight: Their songs are all crunchy new-wave guitars, minimalist Pixies-style pop riffs, and cute, sneery harmonies. The point is defiantly not revolution: it's personality, and bite, and the way their melodies repeat and gather sort of hypnotically. They're just deliciously bratty: Those of you who understand what a landmark the Violent Femmes' debut was in the history of Perfect Records for Snotty Mopey Teenagers may be interested to know that Seasick, Imperial Teen's debut, seemed worth putting on the same shelf, only without the baggage of everyone finding ""Blister in the Sun"" so damned cute. It's no accident that whatever A&R; guy thought Imperial Teen could be huge got them a spot on the soundtrack of the Heathers knock-off Jawbreaker-- the new-wavy teen neurosis surrounding these four is just palpable. So they're a special little band-- I get a bit weepy when I see Seasick in bargain bins-- and with this disc, they've become a special little band with a pretty run-of-mill live album under their belts. I've wound up seeing them live a couple times, and both shows were fantastic: Their crunch was big and warm and enveloping, their stage presence massive. Live at Maxwell's doesn't really capture that-- even when they sound completely on-- which makes the release more effective as a simple re-cap for the fans. To that end, the band plays a great-hits collection of material culled pretty evenly from their three full-lengths: Seasick, What is Not to Love?, and On. By that last one, their range was expanding-- more ambitious songwriting, some keyboards-- but they play the older material straight, drawing those little opening-riff cheers from an audience waiting for its favorites. That means kicking off with the swinging-Pixies snot-fest ""The Beginning"" (""You're fucking movie stars?/ Well, I'm fucking congressmen""), then jumping into the coy, driving repetition of ""Ivanka"". ""Lipstick"" cracks its way up to a jangling peak; ""Butch"", the heart and soul of Seasick, gets taken care of; ""Yoo-Hoo"" gets an extra helping of sarcasm. Most promisingly, those more complex new cuts-- choppy go-go on ""Baby"", 60s pop on ""City Song""-- sound good as well. So it's one of those relatively standard live albums that no one really needs, but it's served its purpose: It's given me a chance to humbly ask you, maybe as a personal favor to me, to check out a few proper Imperial Teen album tracks. Only if you have a little spare time-- no pressure. Plenty of their songs sound like The Strokes' best singles, only coming from a better world where pop music is made mostly by angstful geeks with gender-identity issues. Their albums might not even be that expensive, since I'm pretty sure people aren't paying enough attention to them-- and I'm sure you can figure out a way to sample ""Lipstick"" or ""Ivanka"" or ""The Beginning"" if you try hard enough.","I've spent the last few weeks trying to work out whether not enough people listen to Imperial Teen or ...

"Mary, Star of the Sea",Zwan,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab2713d1975652139b6a/1:1/w_160/7009d1cc.jpg,2003-01-30 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8920-mary-star-of-the-sea/,Reprise,"Truly, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the great alternative rock bands of the 90s. With their characteristic blend of angst, distortion squalls and delicate-- whoa, whoa, hold on a minute. Is that ""Live at the L.A. Coliseum"" flyer really the cover? Look at that thing! Is that Billy's First Photoshop?! Well, now I've completely lost my train of thought. But in a way, that cover concisely sums up my anticipation of Zwan, an enterprise so gleefully out-of-step with the present, so misguidedly earnest, so just plain wrong. Questionable artwork aside, fans have high hopes for Mary, Star of the Sea, for a number of reasons. Last summer, Zwan's lineup was revealed to include two of indie rock's finest guitarists-- Slint's Dave Pajo and Matt Sweeney of Chavez-- alongside A Perfect Circle bassist Paz Lenchantin and Pumpkins powerhouse Jimmy Chamberlin on drums. Soon after, barely audible bootleg MP3s began to pop up on file-trading networks. Through the tape hiss and crowd noise, traces of actual jangly guitar were audible, and the tone of their promising advance single ""Honestly"" confirmed this, suggesting a sort of alternate-dimension Smashing Pumpkins where Corgan interpreted the success of ""1979"" not as a mandate from the people to ""go gothic"", but to continue flogging the guitar-crunch cheer of ""Today"". But this was just an advance single, and as singles have misled us in the past, the question remains: Has Billy really discarded the goth-rock fantasies and digital overprocessing of MACHINA and reverted to the glorious mid-90s anthems he built his name on? He has, indeed. His black mumu is back in the attic where it belongs, indicating that, if nothing else, he's on the right track. But Corgan is not a man to half-ass anything, and Zwan being his Fresh Start, he's gone about it with a keen sense of calculation. Corgan's ego won't be sated simply by mainstream success: With Zwan, he aims to reclaim the ground he's been steadily losing since the release of Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness. Platinum-selling records, critical acclaim and long-standing credibility are clearly at the fore. What he's won himself by reconfiguring his lineup to include icons of indie rock and goth-metal was another shot with each of those audiences. Unfortunately, this seems to have been his wisest move with Zwan. So where did Billy go wrong? Zwan's sound, thanks to Corgan's distinctive guitar tone and Jimmy Chamberlin's He-Man drumming, feels right out of Butch Vig's board circa 1993, so you can't really fault that. And since the album's balance between loud rockers and delicate ballads is virtually identical to the first two Smashing Pumpkins albums, it can't be blamed on a lack of cohesion, either. The problem lies with the songs themselves, which simply lack outstanding or memorable hooks: Most are content to meander behind a curtain of big rock guitars and bigger rock cliches, infinitely repeating themselves or, in some cases, never saying much of anything at all. Others are just clouded by bad judgment: ""Desire"" desperately courts the MOR contingent with a homogenous pillaging of the Goo Goo Dolls' back catalog, while the signature 14-minute suite, disasterously titled ""Jesus, I"", grates where past epics surged. This, by the way, is coming from a guy who thinks ""For Martha"" is one of Adore's best tracks. How fare Sirs Pajo and Sweeney? Not terribly well, but not necessarily through any fault of their own. Despite their distinctive styles, pinpointing their contributions to Mary, Star of the Sea is exceedingly difficult, indicating that they've met a similar fate to that of poor old D'arcy and James Iha, who rarely escaped overdubbing on Pumpkins albums. Sweeney is, in fact, nowhere to be found, though I swear I can hear Pajo's textured noodling a couple times, when the fray lets up. Yet, before he even has a chance to step up and prove himself, his soloing is abruptly blown out of the mix by Corgan's guitar histrionics. Chamberlin, meanwhile, proves that being a skilled drummer doesn't make you a multi-dimensional one-- where he once served as the massive backbone that forced the band's posture into confident uprightness, he fails to display even a modicum of that invention here, relying on the occasional fancy fills and flourishes to embellish his standard metronomic timekeeping. And Paz Lenchantin seems to have been drafted solely for the occasional harmony vocal, yet remains stationed in the mix about 300 feet below Corgan's pinched larynx. Which is all but infallible proof that this new ""band"" is but another elaborate solo project on which Corgan is backed by what amounts only to glamorized session musicians. But how bad is Mary, Star of the Sea, really? The catch is, it's not bad at all; just overwhelmingly mediocre. Obviously, there'll be people-- devout Corganites, nine-to-fivers craving synapse triggers for their high school years, impressionable 13-year-olds-- that eat this album up, if only for moments like the big-big build-up in ""Declarations of Faith"" or the bells-fortified ""Endless Summer"". But despite the anticipation with which I approached it, despite my affinity for Corgan-rock from Gish through The Aeroplane Flies High, and despite that weathered Siamese Dream t-shirt sharing closet space with my old flannels and shredded jeans, I am, to my great disappointment, not one of them. Don't cry for me; this record marks a particularly sad moment for Corgan himself. Here he is, so uncomfortable amidst the feedback therapy of his old sound, longing to return to that one great moment that's forever passed. At this point, he'd re-grow the sandy blonde curls in a heartbeat if given the means-- judging from the ""Honestly"" video, he tried and it just came out his lip. The fact remains that Corgan's ambitions have only become loftier and more unattainable with the passage of time, and you can't make a grand artistic statement like Mellon Collie without the attention and respect of the public. To its credit, Mary, Star of the Sea is a great deal less bombastic and pretentious a statement than MACHINA, but it is a statement nonetheless-- one that begs, ""Don't bury me, I'm not dead.""","Truly, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the great alternative rock bands of the 90s.

Walking in Jerusalem,Various Artists,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2109d034d5c69bf2aed/1:1/w_160/a58213f7.jpg,2003-01-30 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6689-walking-in-jerusalem/,Mille Plateaux,"Could anything in music be more inevitable than a glitch backlash? When a technique with an extremely specific application gets transformed into a ""movement"" it's bound to eventually lead to some seriously boring records and an indifferent audience. On the evidence of its most recent * Clicks & Cuts * compilation, Mille Plateaux seems to sense that academic glitch-for-glitch's sake may have run its course, and it set its sights on more pop-friendly waters. Still, the techniques in glitch * can * be used in service of amazing music when the artist has an understanding of context and a commitment to holistic design. Case in point: * Walking in Jerusalem by Random_Inc. * * Walking in Jerusalem * is a concept album, as sure as anything Rick Wakeman ever dreamed up. It's about the city of its title, a beautiful place with a long history, a fragmented place brimming with tension. Some of these tracks are sourced from field recordings Sebastian Meissner (who works as Random_Inc) made inside the city; about half the tracks are named for her neighborhoods, which are revealed in detail on the map of the city painted onto the CD itself. The sounds of Jerusalem, both real and imagined, form the backbone of this record. In addition to the field recordings, traditional Middle Eastern instruments are sampled and manipulated, giving * Walking in Jerusalem * the kind of ancient-world-meets-postmodernism-dynamic that Muslimgauze perfected. To convey the tradition, splendor, distortion and confusion that are Jerusalem, Meissner utilizes some of the familiar glitch processes (lots of static, musical fragments chopped to bits and reassembled, and so on) to serve the larger idea. The application to this subject couldn't be more appropriate, and the result is one great record. The bulk of the proper tracks are remix collaborations, while 11 interludes consist mostly of field recordings. Guests include Electric Birds, Tim Hecker, Ultra-Red and Dub Taylor. The meetings between Meissner and his collaborators on the figurative streets of city (tracks titles are named using the dub tradition, i.e., ""Random_Inc Meets the Rip Off Artist in Har Hazofim"") lend diversity to the record, which remains singular through its concept and the consistent sound palette. The track in collaboration with Tim Hecker, for example, finds the seam of tension inside the fabric of glowing static in much the same manner as the finest moments of Hecker's * Haunt Me, Haunt Me, Do It Again * . ""Random_Inc Meets Electric Birds in Mamillah"", not surprisingly, uses a more subtle approach, as a curtain of noise sways lazily in the distance to the pulsating sound of synth pads that seemed derived from some sort of Middle Eastern instrument. Meissner's solo pieces reflect the work of a skilled electronic composer. ""Random_Inc Entering Jerusalem (Coming from the West)"" is almost unbearably tense, as a looped double-bass riff juts up against metallic percussion and random sounds from the street, signaling the approach of menace. ""Random Inc Entering Jerusalem (Coming from the East)"" delivers on that threat, with a dense, atonal web of sampled classical that takes the sound of a string quartet and reassembles them completely wrong, a wheezing contraption that sounds like it's going to hurt somebody. The vinyl version of ""Walking in Jerusalem"" is apparently a completely different album, one geared toward the dancefloor using the microhouse techniques on display here on ""Random_Inc Meets Dub Taylor in Mahane Yehuda @ 4:30 p.m. (On April 12, 2002)"". It's amazing how well this appropriately stripped-down and clubbed-out track works in the context of this abstract record-- a nod, perhaps, to our collective imagination of Israeli nightlife. No matter what * kind * of track Meissner has in mind, it works as a piece in this larger puzzle, a testament to his thoughtful design. * Walking in Jerusalem * should be listened to closely, preferably in one sitting. The uncanny sense of movement and immersion as one track slides seamlessly into the next gives the record the feel of that thing that has been such a clich√©, the ""aural film,"" the movie without pictures. As long as the techniques can be applied to moving art such as this, I say Long Live Glitch.","Could anything in music be more inevitable than a glitch\n\ backlash?

Mad Hueman Disease,Droop Capone,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a51c13d1975652138e86/1:1/w_160/b5ec869b.gif,2003-01-30 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1299-mad-hueman-disease/,Black Love Music,"""I'm not a dopehead, I'm a herbal sewer/ Blow smoke out my teeth/ Then pass like Heath Schuler."" This lyric pretty much sums up how Droop Capone-- better known as L.A. emcee Dr.Oop-- devised such alter egos as Droopy Drawls, Chief Big Hat, Mr. Verbal Sunshine, and Dread Kaczinski. He's the ""ganja guru."" He's ""burning nugs the size of Miss Piggy, the color of Kermit."" And, as a warning to anyone planning to shake it down with him: he burns ""sometimes before sex, after, or during."" Watch your chochas, ladies! The sheer volume of these 20 semi-focused tracks makes the fact that he's such a big-time stoner the unifying theme on Mad Hueman Disease. When Dr.Oop is on, he's on; his forte is rhyming in a no-frills, earnest style about his life. ""One Life"", a nostalgic ""jazz funeral"" track, has a slippery, laidback feel, and ""9 to 5"" describes the struggle of looking for work: ""I've been denied jobs 'cause of my hair configuration."" But when certain songs get lost in the mix due to messy or forgettable production, the fact that he's the ""mary-jane-iac"" who ""smokes the green that Jah provided for me"" is the only idea that's really sticky. Much of Mad Hueman Disease's edutainment vibe comes off as distinctly 1998. Surprisingly, one of the freshest cuts sounds straight out of '88, and not just cause he namedrops the ill-fated single mom-edy Kate & Allie. ""Pre-Dawn"" is a simple, almost arrhythmic a cappella freestyle placed blearily atop midtempo beatboxing; Dr.Oop sounds summertime-careless as he raps, ""Talkin' shit from New York to L.A./ Kickin' like Pele/ When he's playin' socca/ Drinkin' vodka/ With ism in my locka."" Despite Mad Hueman's scattered concept, Dr.Oop's good-hearted, frank style can be very endearing. At other points, his honesty verges on TMI. From ""Punan Puffessa"": ""My patients give me feedback about examinations/ One said she liked the way the scalpel stuck her."" Eww. ""6 Months"", a song extolling the virtues of safe sex, feels like a public service announcement; the beats are a Nickelodeon-spunky m√©lange of bright percussion and a conservatively funky bassline, and like... he's preaching about using a jimmy. A noble cause, I do not deny this, but the problem is, after establishing the moralistic-dad vibe, the next song on the record, ""Toke and Poke"", illustrates how Dr.Oop likes to smoke a little of the cheeba before he freaks it with his woman, and it comes off vaguely creepy. Dr.Oop's lyrics are tight, but nobody likes it when Dad talks about doin' the nasty with his ""Pookie Bear"".","""I'm not a dopehead, I'm a herbal sewer/ Blow smoke out my teeth/ Then pass like Heath Schuler ...

American Supreme,Suicide,by: Kim Shannon,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a59f13d1975652138fce/1:1/w_160/0b67c439.jpg,2003-01-29 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7557-american-supreme/,Mute,"It took me three years to understand Sonic Youth. The music itself made sense to me, as I'd come to the Youth through the avant-garde, through people like John Zorn, Morton Feldman, and Iannis Xenakis. What I didn't understand were the lyrics and their inflection. I had a background in the Beats, I liked lots of pop music, but there was something that came across as goofy and insincere in the lyrics. But I was younger then; I didn't realize that music could be both tongue-in-cheek and completely honest. By the time I went back and looked into Patti Smith and some of the other recommended SY materials (especially Richard Kern's films), it started to make much more sense. It was so brutally and unabashedly direct, so highly prone to personality and personal flaws, proclivities, and romanticism-- the reason I didn't understand it earlier was because I'd never been exposed to much academic music without the looming figure of a larger-than-life Grand Artist having been responsible for its creation. Either that, or that a lot of the music I was listening to didn't really say very much orally, anyway, and up until Washing Machine, you couldn't accuse SY of focusing solely on the musical aspect of their work. So, while I was digging around 1970s New York, I eventually ran into Suicide. Those doo-wop elements that defined Patti Smith, the New York-themed lyrical topics, that romantic love of decadence and sleaze all made their way into Suicide's equation. There was a fundamental difference, though... those fucking synthesizers. See, since I was an angry young person who grew up a bit later than SY, I heard stuff like The Minutemen and the Dead Kennedys before I heard The Ramones or Richard Hell. What I was expecting from all of the hype regarding ""early punk"" and what it actually sounded like were two very different things. All of that brutality and dirt was there, but it wasn't as apparent to me immediately. It just sounded like good 70s rock music at first. Suicide, however, were coming from somewhere different, and they caught me off guard. It's difficult to describe the work of Martin Rev and Alan Vega. The indie press seems to deem them the harmonious combination between Phil Glass and Elvis. Vega uses lots of reverb on his voice, there's some of that rockabilly sleaze in the lyrics and execution, but Elvis he's not. As for Martin Rev, well, the repetitive synthesizer figures do have basis in academic music, but the application in Suicide makes those sorts of comparisons immaterial. It's essentially some bizarre mutation, built from the same strange spores of New York as their peers, yet abstracted through the instrumentation. American Supreme is the first new Suicide album in over a decade. At its best, it's the equivalent of mainlining those god-awful HBO late-night b-movies. The lyrics still have that embarrassingly sincere, yet caricatured tone, and they're still terminally obsessed with topics of decadence, creepy America, bohemian lifestyles, and violence-- all things that Sonic Youth finally left behind on Murray Street. Musically, however, Suicide has started to build something a little more suitable. Rev and Vega's stated intention has always been to reflect their culture and environment, and rather than return to their still potent and compelling formula from 30 years ago, Suicide have opted to remain focused on their goal. What results is a collection of bastardized house and hip-hop beats, interspersed by the occasionally indulgent necessary noise, not even remotely resembling the golden-age bubblegum aspirations of their first two albums. The song structure, however, is the same. Rev has an idea or two, loops it for a five-minute duration, Vega sets into action his trademarked ravings, the song ends. This is probably the least effective end of Suicide's objectives. To convey that empty, vapid wasteland of Pop, it seems fitting that the songs would drag out, emphasize the same ideas over and over again, and leave an unpleasant taste in the listener's mouth. American Supreme, even at its most unlistenable and monotonous, still makes its point. Suicide have updated their formula since their most-lauded work. When you listen to their Ocasek-produced second album, you can hardly imagine such enjoyable music inciting riots and heckling. With all of those synthesizers and blaring house presets mimicking the most commercial aspects of life, this album will not get many repeated listens. Yet, American Supreme takes chances, falls on its face and spits in yours, sincere and ironic, waving its negative-print, nihilistic flag high.","It took me three years to understand Sonic Youth.

Danger: Rock Science!,Menthol,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c43269fc7814a47cd80c/1:1/w_160/37b3fd7d.gif,2003-01-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5229-danger-rock-science/,Hidden Agenda,"Major label woes are like STDs: Most musicians have had them at one time or another. By now, stories of the majors raping and pillaging innocent, doe-eyed artists are as commonplace as any status symbol, like bling-lights or surgical scars. Some bands even make movies about them. Nowadays, people hear tales of a Columbia A&R; guy pulling the plug on someone's grandma, or Rick Rubin butchering a random transient and storing him in his freezer, and nobody even bats an eye. Circumstances being what they are, Menthol could very easily wind up as just another name on the long list of artists screwed by their label, except for one thing: They got the shaft before it was cool. We're talking back in '99 here. Hoop skirts were the fashion of the day, authenticity was still sitting in for irony in popular media, and The Strokes were just a gleam in a prominent modeling agent's eye. After an intensive four-year correspondence program with the Thomas Dolby Revivalism Institute begun subsequent to the release of Menthol's self-titled debut in 1995, guitarist/singer Balthasar de Ley finally earned his degree in Rock Science, and Menthol returned to the studio to cut a celebratory album. The throwback record sported bouncy, synth-driven hooks, heavy-handed power chords, and was in all respects a faithful emulation of ""the music my mom did aerobics to when I was in middle school,"" according to de Ley. The resulting homage to new wave icons like Dolby, Devo, and the rest of t heir peer group was a sincere tribute, and Capitol (going through restructuring pains at the time) was having none of it. In '99, Capitol decided it was too busy selling the 70s to sell the 80s, and dropped Menthol outright, with no plans to promote the album. After failing to get the master tapes from Capitol, Menthol re-recorded the same album, finally finding a release in ought-three with Hidden Agenda. Given the eight long years of recording, re-recording, and corporate struggle, it doesn't seem like this album was worth the effort. Danger: Rock Science is, for better or worse, a whirlwind synthesis of what passed for pop during the new wave boom. Retro keyboards factor in prominently, along with the occasional stadium-class solo and blasts of crunchy power-pop, but it misses as often as it hits, creating an album that's alternately a lot of kitschy fun or simply embarrassing. For every triumph of saccharine electro-strings and mellow harmony like the almost-power ballad ""Strange Living"", or even the ridiculous pomp of the Devo-inspired title cut, there's a bitter defeat like ""Future Shock"". The song tries hard, but between absurdly vapid lyrics and some cheesy licks, it's one of a handful of tracks not worth much more than a quick laugh. There's such a thing as working too close to one's subject; by so steadfastly recreating the sound of that era, Menthol doesn't bring much of their own to the table. It's way, way too easy to discuss this album by name-dropping everyone's favorite 80s nostalgia factories: Staccato vocals a la Men Without Hats or Wall of Voodoo, synth-heavy melodies courtesy of Alphaville and a dozen other bands, and guitar flash approved by Corey Hart himself. If any of the names I've mentioned elicited a shudder or a twinge, then you get the point. Danger: Rock Science! is a fairly keen amalgam of half a decade's worth of music if little else, but Menthol's too heavy on pastiche, and weighed down by a surplus of ideas. Never forget, this wave rolled back out to sea for a reason: Not everything released in the 80s is worth reviving.","Major label woes are like STDs: Most musicians have had them at one time or another.

Enemy of Fun,Stars as Eyes,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a54cea9e61561daa50da/1:1/w_160/442a24b3.jpg,2003-01-29 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7475-enemy-of-fun/,Tigerbeat6,"Why isn't anyone sick of guitars yet? Haven't they had their day in the sun? What else can you do with them? I have seen the future of good music, and it lies not in the hand of the guitar god, but the laptop of the bedroom composer! Can rock and roll gel with the soft and the ware, creating not a dark and angry industrial beast, but a sound that draws on the less turbulent strains of the guitar's past? Of the few bands able to pull off the merger of electronic-based music with that most sacred of Satan-worshipping gadgets, dark or no, Stars as Eyes is one to check out; if not for the big comfy living room chair that is Enemy of Fun-- their second full-length on Tigerbeat 6-- then for their deft and balanced approach to the alchemy of turning wood and strings into PC rock. The sound coming out of Stars as Eyes' bedroom originates somewhere behind an old 8-track and a stack of Yes LPs, the sound of prog-rock filtered through the fingers of some dosing shoegazer and dropped into Sound Forge before filtering out into the world. A track like ""Important Youth Movement"", which drifts from a one-chord fuzzbox strum and droning textural noise into a tranquilized, orchestral slumber party, is a good indication of what this disc achieves; by burying the sensibilities of traditional rock structures deep within a computer daydream, Stars as Eyes present the guitar not as a frontman but as a muse, a central cultivation hub where songs are born, then nursed on silicon before their infant brains are wired to the mainframe. ""The French Method"", the soundtrack to some stoned beach party bonfire in the Mushroom Kingdom, is just one possible result of such a childhood. Others range from the Clinic-ish Hammond organ interlude ""I Thought You Said Something Else"" to the album's highlight, ""Our Light"", an arena-rock explosion of crying guitars and dramatic rock opera atmospherics that warrants a tailgaters' riot in the parking lot after the show. The guitar tries on different hats throughout: A spiraling riff one moment, a moaning ambient wind, or layer of atonal hum the next. What Stars as Eyes strive to avoid is an unequal distribution of attention to their influences; I don't think it's possible to put any sort of ""dance"" label on Enemy of Fun, nor would it be intuitive to put it on a kickball team with Tortoise or Buckethead's Colma. The duo manages to toe the line. It may be an inevitability, but many of the tracks here wind up taking familiar paths to their final encoding. Stars as Eyes take some approaches already practiced by many like-minded groups, and the results just can't shake the sound as previously defined. The more aggressive tracks on the record, particularly the frantic, Bionic Commando soundalike ""Falling Picture"" and the sloppy punk jazz of ""If I Could I Would Be You"" draw from the same well that nurtures Add N to (X). If Stars of the Lid had penned the mournful closer, named after a line in River's Edge (""Where Do My Children Go at Night""), I'm guessing they might have called it ""Requiem for Dying Mothers Part 1"". The guitar comes with its own set of limitations and inescapable, dogmatic implementations, and it's highly likely any overlap Stars as Eyes' experience with other musicians attempting similar feats can be linked to the finite territory of this wilderness. Solid and cohesive from start to close, and more than a little ambitious in its scope and reach, Enemy of Fun is a successful prototype for the future of artificially integrated laptop guitar music, improving on the more limited pleasures of their previous effort Freedom Rock. It manages to satisfy the traditional demands of independent rock music without leaving its 25th century cloud, making the world safe for electronic musicians to play air guitar in their bathrooms to the Liquid Tension Experiment once again. Come back, G.E. Smith. All is forgiven.","Why isn't anyone sick of guitars yet? Haven't they had their day in the sun? What else can ...

Masada Guitars,John Zorn,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab2cb1335d7bf16997cd/1:1/w_160/e591a63a.jpg,2003-01-29 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8925-masada-guitars/,Tzadik,"If you've ever seen John Zorn at a gig with his Masada quartet, you might have noticed him flipping through a thick sheath of music as he picks the next tune. That pile of paper holds the 208 compositions that he's written for the band. The tunes cross the style of the early Ornette Coleman Quartet with themes from Jewish folk music, and they can sound as slow and exotic as a nightcrawl through the desert, or whiz past with knotty themes and quick changes played at breakneck speed. That's the Masada songbook. Zorn arranged it for a band that included himself on alto, Dave Douglas on trumpet, bassist Greg Cohen, and the inimitable Joey Baron on drums. Arguably his best ensemble, he also made it one of the most recorded groups in jazz, cutting almost 20 studio and live albums in under a decade-- so many records that unless you're one of their mothers, you're unlikely to have heard them all. Zorn even farmed out some of those 200+ tunes to his chamber ensemble Bar Kokhba, and collected others on his 1998 release, The Circle Maker. And it doesn't stop. This year Zorn and his label, Tzadik ""Never Say Glut"" Records, has kicked off a new series for the 10th anniversary of Masada. It starts with Masada Guitars, which features solo recitals by three of Zorn's favorite guitarists: Marc Ribot and Bill Frisell, his main axemen of the 90s and 80s respectively, and the classically trained Tim Sparks, who has recorded for Tzadik's Radical Jewish Culture series. This disc is almost indulgently long, crammed with 21 similar pieces that get dignified, mid-tempo readings. That's a lot of samey acoustic guitar to wade through, and the fact that it's all pretty doesn't justify the length. But the upside is that Zorn knows where he's going, and he knows what he wants from these guitarists; he's just willing to give them a lot of chances to hit it. Take Tim Sparks, whose classical approach-- treating the songs like the lost works of Segovia-- is rigorous and exciting. His bright, ringing tone and refined ornamentation beautifully embellish ""Kodashim"" and ""Sippur""; and his measured exploration of ""Kedushah"" heightens the richness of its ethnic themes. By contrast, Marc Ribot is the most plain-spoken of the three. He makes no extra gestures: He thumps and strikes out the rhythms, as on the tango-like ""Kivah"", and his harsh attack tangles the melody of ""Galgalim"" in his strings. His steady, dry progression across ""Sansanah"" best demonstrates the patience and effort in his readings. This makes Bill Frisell the maverick. Instead of sticking to acoustic guitar, he unpacks his electric and all of his gizmos: On ""Katzatz"", he takes the fast melody and warps, loops and splinters it around itself, nicely invoking the Masada quartet's spastic catchiness. And yet Frisell's finest moments happen on the acoustic, in the ballads ""Abidan"" and ""Avelut"". More than most high-powered guitarists, Frisell loves to surrender to a good melody: In his hands these ballads' stately themes achieve a hushed beauty, with pauses that hang like the quiet moments of a ceremony. The only problem is Zorn's need to cram in so many of his songs. Zorn is a solid composer, but in his best music, the compositions are no more critical than his choice of performers, his skill as a band leader, and the room he leaves for improvisation. Which is all critic-speak for saying that few of these pieces hit it out of the park. But maybe the point isn't to nail any one song, and instead to interpret the spirit behind the entire Masada project. Each guitarist has brought out a different aspect: In the richness of Sparks' technique, the rigor and labor from Ribot, and the grace in Frisell's ballads, they approach the truth and purity of its themes-- ethnic, historical, and spiritual. In fact, the best parts are so great that they make me stop worrying about how this is the start of a new deluge-- that Zorn probably has another dozen Masada discs in the works, plus half a dozen ""essential"" live albums, and worst of all, the inevitable leftovers discs that'll scoop up every scrap of the songbook that hasn't been committed to plastic. What's Hebrew for ""b-sides?""","If you've ever seen John Zorn at a gig with his Masada quartet, you might have noticed him flipping ...

Red Devil Dawn,Crooked Fingers,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6a79d034d5c69bf35b7/1:1/w_160/7c4bea82.jpg,2003-01-29 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1670-red-devil-dawn/,Merge,"I heard planet Venus described on the radio this week as ""hellish"" and thought how weird it was that hell, a mythical place, had a kind of literal import, and that we earthwads imposed that myth's accepted meaning on other planets. Which, of course, led to thinking about the incredible odds of you and me and that horse and that spider over there being living matter, as insanely outnumbered as we are in this mostly dead universe. Which, of course, led to holing up with a hatchet and the Joy Division box set. Which, of course, led to reading Paul Morley's liner note about ""hell"" coming from a ""root meaning 'concealed'"" and having ""less to do with punishment than simple bleak survival in a vague netherworld."" Which, of course, led to thinking about the strange vagabondish career of Eric Bachmann, a onetime guitar hellion whose songs of late host speakers shocked into zombification. His new album begins with a tale of a town ""where nobody works and nobody plays,"" from which ""even the vultures have moved on."" The inhabitants are waiting for a messiah, not to save them, but to put them out of their misery; it's the apocalypse as euthanasia, or euthanasia as salvation. Bachmann's been a man adrift-- and redeemed-- since he euthanized the Archers of Loaf years ago, though his reputation beats him to every town he visits, no matter what name he gives the locals. A venue printed tickets to a recent Crooked Fingers show that read, ""Crooked Fingers. Featuring Eric Bachmann. Of Archers Of Loaf."" (Though to be fair, the curdling title track of the Archers' farewell White Trash Heroes could easily be considered the first Crooked Fingers song.) Bachmann's also left crumbs as Barry Black, and even under his own name-- though, curiously, that release was a film score that lacked his distinctive voice. Don't be fooled into thinking that there are Fingers the way there are Strokes; Bachmann's supporting cast is ever-changing. His third full-length, Red Devil Dawn (named after an excellent single not included here), bears closest resemblance to ""the band""'s self-titled debut in that its songs comprise an ""album"" the way certain quilts are made of disparate cloth-scraps. Both records feature all manner of tempos, arrangements, and topics, whereas Bring on the Snakes was, in form and content, a coherent atmospheric thinkpiece that, via percussive plucking and aquatic keys, staged romantic futility on an abstract plane. The vox on this outing sound as if they're consciously trying to avoid the words ""Neil"" and ""Diamond,"" words often tossed at the mellow Hyde into which Bachmann's rambunctious Jekyll morphed. Bachmann's Carolinian twang is allowed to linger longer, and intermittently he'll growl, risking a comic-villain put-on but reminding listeners of his olden guttural inflection (seeing him pull this off live is amazing: his mouth is Nicholson's Joker, his stance Woody Guthrie, and his height Vlade Divacs). Sonic departures include the amped (which for Crooked Fingers means ""not funereal"") ""You Threw a Spark"" and ""Sweet Marie"". These tracks are driven by horn parts that, rather than add Belle & Sebastian stateliness, contribute a vibe of, um... Mexican fiesta? No kidding, this pulsing Mariachi-core will tap into your Anglo-Luddite fears and have you dreaming of sombrerobots taking over the world. ""Sweet Marie"" even seems designed to bitchslap Jimmy Buffett-- Bachmann sings about ""sniffing glue"" over a total cruise-ship or resort-lounge bounce (that even cops some bits of ""I Got You, Babe""). I realize that mixing dark lyrics with bright music is the Toyota Camry of songwriting, but you've got to hear Bachmann aggravate the tourists by sneering about wanting ""soft abuse"" and promising to set his competitor (""that pussy bastard"") straight. Also new among Bachmann's standard batch of songs in which gods and the cosmos are implicated in failing love (as if quasars were fueled by sexual frustration) are songs that display his skill as a fabulist. Aside from the town-waiting-for-a-hero song, the album features the tale of ""Boy with (100) Hands"" and the awesome ""Bad Man Coming"", about the approach of an ultimate dark figure at the end of a long line of dark figures. These grim tunes are lullabies that will induce insomnia, fairy tales in which the fairy godmothers wet themselves and faint. I predict that this soundtrack- and fantasy-happy artist will team up with Tim Burton on a claymation goth-musical any day now. (Eric Bachmann Superstar, anyone?) Okay, so the album's not a step forward so much as a squirm in quicksand. And yes, Red Devil Dawn is somehow sparer than its predecessors and more interested in a staring contest than a high-five. Its characters are Icaruses flying just under the radar, with wings culled from the shores of a sea that burps black Styrofoam. But we need this emphysemic, exponentially aging paperboy to rattle us every morning by announcing, ""The news! Is not! Good!"" Bachmann has even shown a willingness to come to terms with his past: After a preview of Reservoir Songs 2 (""Long Black Veil"", ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"", ""[What's So Funny 'Bout] Peace Love and Understanding"") at a recent show-- to which he brought no merch and a band that admitted to not knowing some of the songs-- Bachmann yielded to the brats who kept screaming for Archers, playing ""Greatest of All Time"" and ""Harnessed in Slums"", making those brats' netherworld a little less bleak. You should have seem them, all guileless, pogo-ing and clapping, still a few years from feeling the pinch of Bachmann's more mature and desolate work. Songs such as this album's ""You Can Never Leave"" are going to hit them like cinderblocks.","I heard planet Venus described on the radio this week as ""hellish"" and thought how weird it was that hell ...

Can You See the Music,DJ Me DJ You,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9c2c0084474cd0c26ab/1:1/w_160/3f85f333.jpg,2003-01-28 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2369-can-you-see-the-music/,Eenie Meenie,"Besides being familiar to anyone who's ever consumed lysergic snacks and sat naked in front of their home stereo, contemplating their navel to a Pink Floyd soundtrack, the title of this latest outing by amoebic beat collective DJ Me DJ You is a tiny bit misleading. Yes, the DVD included with the record contains some hilarious lo-fi visuals in the form of found footage and bargain basement Video Toaster effects complementing the thrift-store sampling approach intrinsic to the group's composing philosophy. And yes, that marriage of image and sound delivers the cocaine disco space opera their first full-length, Rainbows and Robots, as promised, but on the audio side of things, group masterminds Craig Borrel and Ross Harris have expanded their sound to include an element that strains to find a home in the DJ Me DJ You repertoire. As well-versed as Borrel and Ross are, this new element does little more than make the album's music that much harder to pull into focus. It obstructs rather than illuminates, and the album title becomes a gun to the head rather than a prophetic vision. Can You See The Music isn't nearly as ambitious as its full-length predecessor, but its approach to instrumentation-- like Dr. Frankenstein stitching the entrails of a million slabs of wax into a dancefloor monster-- has been ported over untouched: Dialog snippets lounge in fields of Parliament/Funkadelic bass, while drum machines get down with plastic new wave synths and tinny beatbox thumps. It's all there, and at its best, it combusts into the Jackie Brown swagger of ""Salsa & Microchips"", and the jungle jazz lounge of ""Zodiac Ape"". The misstep here is the addition of something altogether basic: Vocals. Though they mean a whole new bag of tricks for DJ Me DJ You, human flesh doesn't always slide comfortably into the MPC playground. At times, larynxes succumb to the wiles of hard-disk drives and glowing motherboards, managing to add to the music rather than block the peephole with their dimpled, wasted asses, but for the most part, you just want your quarter back. The acoustic guitar that drives the opener, ""People Together"", is an omen of the singer/songwriter damage to come, and while the cribbed-from-Beck irony of its lyrics are mildly amusing-- a chorus of ""Sittin' in a sports bar/ Eatin' buffalo wings""-- they ultimately relegate the track to the desolate fields of one week's light rotation on college radio. The instrumentation itself is solid, if not a little primed for commercials: some Tijuana horns for accent, a lazy pace; a sleepy bar closer in toto. It's taking musical skill and spilling G. Love's not-so-special sauce all over it-- or, the voice doesn't do the track justice. Vocals scars the otherwise flawless blaxploitation lowrider ""Fembot"", whose Asian strings, Nintendo 1-Up blings, and ready-for-the-sack bass are marred by bad lyrical outtakes from Bob Diggi's ""Love Jones"". ""Trouble"" is drowned beneath processed voices which drone the title like a post-headtrip hallucination. When taken along with the corresponding visuals on the DVD, this hit-or-miss collection of odd breeding habits is easier to swallow. The stuttering DV footage of old women and Japanese people eating lunch that accompany the lyrical swill of ""New You"" highlight the plucked string melody of the track itself, sweetening an otherwise bitter pill. Can You See the Music is, in that respect, an important milemarker in the growth of the DJ Me DJ You entity. Machines may have more fun, but musically? Musically, this is a record you'll hope they make available in instrumental form.","Besides being familiar to anyone who's ever consumed lysergic snacks and sat naked in front of their home stereo ...

End Transmission,Snapcase,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a48cc0084474cd0c04f7/1:1/w_160/10243de6.jpg,2003-01-28 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7296-end-transmission/,Victory,"Snapcase are usually lumped in with more progressive hardcore acts, but it's not like they're Refused. Once in a while, they chooga rather than chugga, and that's somehow enough to make them ""avant"" for genre purists. The emo buff and metal shine they for the most part effectively apply also works wonders on non-scenesters, with Snapcase patches occupying the same backpack-space as decidedly cuddlier bands. For years, they've been inching closer toward commercial breakthrough. When Dennis Lyxz√©n of Refused made a similarly inexplicable leap toward convention by ditching hardcore completely for The (International) Noise Conspiracy's umlaut-laden garage, he at least took with him whatever respectability that band's nebulous roots provided, going from something genuinely new and different to something genuinely old and familiar (situationist ranting intact). The new Snapcase, however, is as unconvincing and plastic as a band of straightedge Furbies. Once in a while, I think I hear the old Snapcase peeking out from within the glossy shell of End Transmission, twisting like the groovy people-within-people paintings that once graced the band's album covers, now sadly-- but appropriately-- replaced by slick, blandly futuristic schematics. But before nostalgia can set in, the ravening demons of production swoop in, snatching Snapcase in their filthy jaws: Daryl Trabeski's reedy yowl is swallowed up in multi-tracking or effects, and guitars that threaten to rip are all but absorbed in a dense, featureless wall of sound. Not that the production ruins End Transmission; on the contrary, the gimmicks provide some of the most memorable moments-- the stereo-tremolo effect that kicks off ""Believe, Revolt""-- on a album without solid enough songwriting to justify the time spent in the studio. Snapcase still brandishes an impressive portfolio of riffs for a hardcore band, but where they once shoved them in your face in turn, they now seem content to let one or two soak in over the course of a five-minute song, like vacation pictures at the guitarist's family slideshow. The band has also ""matured"", if maturity is measured in glum piano interludes; I might be all for a quieter, gentler Snapcase if each sparse, drifting tune didn't end up exploding in the exact same way. Even when unpredictable, End Transmission is off-putting: The shock of hearing Trabeski scream out the refrain from Modest Mouse's ""Tiny Cities Made of Ashes"" (on the coda of ""New Kata"") is quickly replaced by images of a throttled Isaac Brock, and a puzzled effort to remember the point at which rote repetition became an acceptable way around writer's block. None of this is to suggest Snapcase have ""sold out""; they're still, as always, on Victory, and if anything, their message is even more blunt and extreme. Did I mention this is a concept album? It's a concept album: ""The year is twenty seventy-one!/ One drum by law has just begun-- to beat!"" While not a reprehensible or calculated stab at crossing over to MTV audiences, End Transmission plays as if Snapcase were at least seduced, if not by money or fame, by the security and increased utility of bland, clich√©d music. You can't blame them; look how Filter made out on those Hummer ads.","Snapcase are usually lumped in with more progressive hardcore acts, but it's not\n\ like they're Refused. Once ...

Phrenology,The Roots,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2a8ea9e61561daa4ace/1:1/w_160/8d0356db.jpg,2003-01-28 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6832-phrenology/,MCAOkayplayer,"When they first stepped out in the mid-90s, The Roots were regarded by many as an interesting but quaint novelty act. Although other hip-hop groups had used live instrumentation, The Roots were the first well-publicized, full-fledged hip-hop band, thus providing fans with a comeback when our culturally obtuse friends or relatives would say ""rap isn't music."" The Roots were also one of the first acts to speak out against the hip-hop tendency toward hyper-capitalism, a criticism which reached its zenith in the hilarious video for ""What They Do"". But, to paraphrase Biggie, things done changed in the hip-hop game. Now live musical accompaniment is becoming increasingly prevalent-- The Neptunes donned a backing band for NER*D-- and while political consciousness is still an important component of hip-hop, it's hardly unique, and no longer en vogue in an increasingly conservative cultural climate. So what are the pioneers to do when they find that their style has been played to the extreme by half-assed imitators? What any true artists would: Submerge themselves in the lab for three years and come out with a new, airtight sound, awash with challenging-- but not too challenging-- deviations from their formula. For Phrenology, The Roots supplement their trademark loose and light jazz palate with harder, more aggressive tones, eschewing their ""organic"" sound and using the studio as an instrument. On ""Rock You"", The Roots open with a snarl, as a jagged and spare arrangement backs Black Thought's aggressive flow. As with many songs on Phrenology, ""Rock You"" is accented by decidedly inorganic electro flourishes, with a noticeable absence of the smooth jazz keys that made hippie hip-hop headz cream their collective jeans back in the mid-to-late-90s. Unfortunately, the track contains album's weakest hook, with Black Thought screaming, ""We will rock you/ Rock You!/ ROCK YOU!"" Which is exactly what they do on the acerbic, 24-second Bad Brains knock-off ""!!!!!!"", a straight-up, raw-as-fuck punk track which I respect for its sheer boldness, even if that it had me covering my ears. In sharp contrast, ""Water"" clocks in at well over ten minutes, and is perhaps the first clear cut example of mainstream prog-hop. For hip-hop purists, it's easy to dismiss this song-- which deals with former band member Malik B's struggle with addiction-- as needlessly bloated, but given its personal subject matter, it's understandable why ?uest and crew indulged themselves in a dark, expressionistic foray into the mindset of a drug addict. We can only hope that Malik gets the message. But despite these two extremes, Phrenology can't be boiled down simply to superfluous experimentalism or a complete abjuration of their previous work. It manages to incorporate all the elements that have characterized The Roots' sound; they revisit the old-skool hip-hop template on the ""apache""-laced ""Thought @ Work"", where Black Thought approximates the rapid-fire cadence of Kool G. Rap (one of many examples on Phrenology that have Thought switching up his flow to compensate for the loss of Malik B). For ""WAOK (Ay) Rollcall"", The Roots once again enlist Ursula Rucker to give a brief spoken word piece, in which she namechecks the architects of hip-hop culture. However, there's also the overtly political number, ""Pussy Galore"", which may be one of the most vapid, boring examples of political consciousness ever recorded by a major hip-hop group, and the weakest spot on the album by a long shot. Hopefully, it won't become another source of ammunition in Coca-Cola's campaign to represent/co-opt ""real"" hip-hop. Structurally, there's the now-expected spoken word bit at the end (this time performed by the esteemed and controversial poet Amiri Baraka), and a hidden track featuring Talib Kweli. It's preceded by two red herrings, twenty-second-long tracks of silence, and followed by a brief techno burn that's sure to have fans scratching their heads. Like ""What They Do"" from Illadelph Halflife and ""You Got Me"" from Things Fall Apart, the current single, ""Break You Off"", is an obligatory three-word R&B; crossover number, replete with guest vocalist Musiq's nu-soul crooning, four cellists, a noir concept video, and a $300,000 budget. Despite the obvious radio pandering, it's a beautifully smooth and melodic song, featuring some of their warmest production ever. To The Roots' credit, they utilize their guest appearances better than on any of their other previous efforts. ""Seed (2.0)"", a cover of a track from L.A. crooner Cody Chesnutt's recent Headphone Masterpiece, is the most immediately satisfying track on the album-- which is surprising, since it's an orgiastic garage funk number with a blazing guitar riff that feels lifted from Sticky Fingers-era Stones. Regardless of how you feel about The Roots' aesthetic-- I tend to gravitate toward the traditional two turntables and a microphone hip-hop paradigm-- you have to give these guys credit for making an album that so successfully combines ambition and experimentation with accessibility. Phrenology completely realizes The Roots' talents and potential, maintaining its cohesiveness despite its many disparate elements. It's a stark rebuke to those who say hip-hop artists can't turn out solid full-lengths: For its few negligible missteps, Phrenology has more than enough momentum to sustain an uninterrupted listen.","When they first stepped out in the mid-90s, The Roots were regarded by many as an interesting but quaint novelty ...

Revolution,Area,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0fbea9e61561daa46ad/1:1/w_160/711e0a75.jpg,2003-01-28 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/284-revolution/,Akarma,"What do we want? I remember growing up with mom's 8-tracks-- James Taylor, Dan Fogelberg, Linda Ronstadt-- knowing there must be more to life than soft-rock and the groovy afterthoughts of a million baby boomers. I heard rumblings of a better tomorrow via friends on the outside: Zach had M√∂tley Cr√ºe and Michael Jackson, Jacob's brother had Def Leppard and the Ghostbusters soundtrack. These weren't things I had much access to, though. A change was required: I had to get out. Over the last couple of decades, I've been remedying the musical destitution of my youth. What do I want? What do we want? We want freedom. We want music! Enter Area, Italy's self-proclaimed ""International Popular Group."" I would've hated this stuff when I was a kid, but now it's obvious that music and freedom were their specialties. In the early 70s, a young sextet from Milano with predominantly jazz backgrounds decided enough was enough, and had a go at playing music for the people, but decidedly not for the powers that were. The band would play rock because that was most important to young people, but it was hardly the sound of Chuck Berry or the Stones. In fact, Area would even take jabs at Led Zeppelin, such was their confidence of vision. Truthfully, the band was as bombastic, excessive and indulgent as any classic rock or prog gorilla. But it wasn't the music-- an explosive mixture of fusion-era Miles, avant-garde pianist Cecil Taylor, proto-Merzbow noise and even Mediterranean folk dances-- that earned Area initial headlines, and kept them in the Italian spotlight throughout the 70s. Greek vocalist Demetrio Stratos (who later worked with John Cage), was possessed of a radically expressive tenor, while Gianni Sassi penned words detailing the hypocrisy of the press he considered little more than a tool of a fascist Italian government, advocated anarchy, sympathy for the PLO, public protest and the struggle against capitalism. Press reports from the time speak of violent outbreaks approaching riots at their concerts, and derail the ""banners, gestures and words that reeked of fake slogans, just to pass their noisy sounds."" Fittingly, over ten pages of the box liner notes are devoted to the political atrocities of Area's time. They weren't punk a band in the slightest, but they had the persona down pat. Revolution is a newly released box set collecting the first three Area studio releases and one live LP. For fans (you know who you are), it's a treat to hear these 24-bit remasters (though I can definitely hear a few vinyl transfer cracks in there), and newcomers couldn't ask for a better way to become overnight fanatics. My caveats: If you go in expecting a full on skronk-fest you're going to be disappointed; Area had chops, and restraint wasn't their strongest point. Conversely, if you go in expecting straight fusion or prog, Stratos' sometimes primal guttural-isms might scare you away, as might any of a number of synth lobotomies. Arbeit Macht Frei (1973), named for the infamous Nazi labor camp motto, was Area's debut, and established their already mastered fusion of, well, fusion, and various strains of the avant-garde. ""Luglio, Agosto, Settembre (Nero)"" would seem to be something of a war protest song (though all the words are in Italian), bringing to the fore Stratos' Greek heritage alongside its furious odd-meter folk-dance figures. Typically, the band mixes in about a dozen ideas into one riff, strutting the stuff of keyboardist Patrizio Fariselli and drummer Giulio Capiozzo in the process, while Stratos' booming voice, even when he tries to whisper, threatens to turn each song into rock opera, even during free jazz implosions in the middle. The title track crosses free jazz, minimalism and hard rock all in the name of rampant disestablishmentarianism. If the lengthy solo breaks are too much to handle in one sitting, stay tuned. 1974's Caution Radiation Area, with a disturbing/hilarious back cover depicting guerilla fighters leaping over an image of the album's cover, trims the fat and leaves only the most radical elements of the group's sound intact. It is arguably the band's best album: ""Cometa Rossa"" is sharp refinement of Area's Mediterranean prog hybrid, and its middle section is seems to be straight Greek folk-chant; ""ZYG (Crescita Zero)"" introduces some very spacy synth bombs and Stratos' alien proclamations, only to erupt with a jam on par with the Mahavishnu Orchestra's best moments. However, the most striking piece on the record is the grating closer, ""Lobotomia"". Featuring high-pitched, screaming sine-wave tones, it defies close listening and easy pigeonholing. 1975's Crac! toned down the experimental bend and upped the hard jam a bit, but was no less intense for the change. ""L'Elefante Bianco"" is possibly their best dance jam (and Ares Tavolazzi's hyper-elastic bass hits are ace), while ""Le Mela di Odessa"" makes the argument that Italian bands can indeed get funky, over and over again, while playing ""Taps"" and ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"" at totally inappropriate times. Yeah, shut up, it's great. That same year, the group released the live Are(A)zione. Like most of the great fusion bands, these guys tore it up live: Most of the tunes sound better here than they did on the studio albums. However, Area's political leanings dominate the proceedings on the their rather irreverent take on ""L'Internazionale"" (the anthem of the Socialist International), replete with free bass solo and raucous group improv, preceded by a whopping fifteen minute group session that should clue you in on where their focus actually is. The crowd loves it, of course, and the press doubtlessly reported the entire deviant event. All of these records are available as single discs, and if I had to choose one as a starter before diving into the box it would be Caution Radiation Area. Still, if you're into this kind of thing, it's hard to imagine not wanting all of it. Along with Magma and the Soft Machine, Area played some of the most exciting and adventurous avant-rock in the 70s. Music and freedom make dangerous partners, and you don't need to understand the political implications of the Che Guevara portrait on the cover of Revolution, or even understand Italian, to hear the appeal of this stuff.","What do we want?

Equilibrium,Matthew Shipp,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d6c0084474cd0c0364/1:1/w_160/46b20405.jpg,2003-01-27 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7118-equilibrium/,Thirsty Ear,"Last year, pianist Matthew Shipp stomped across the college charts with the funked up Nu-Bop, a jazz album augmented with beats and synths. He's not the only top-drawer jazzbo making serious use of electronica; more and more bands are mixing the acoustic with the electric and the improvised with the processed, from labelmates Spring Heel Jack to the glitched-up fusion of Norway's Jaga Jazzist. Shipp may not be the first or most adventurous, but he made a tasteful, logical album that still boasted fat bass and catchy riffs. His latest disc, Equilibrium, also uses the synth work and production of FLAM (Chris Flam). But instead of pushing the electronics and making a funkier, nastier successor to his hit, this new disc feels like nothing so much as the Modern Jazz Quartet. FLAM's additions are more subtle, and instead of a horn player, the rotating sideman this time is Khan Jamal, whose stately, ringing vibraphone perfectly complements Shipp's pensive lines. Shipp has explained that this is the ""synthesis"" of the directions he's been taking lately; free-floating, hot, straight, electrified: It's a chance to double back and get everything right. For Shipp, that means this may be his most carefully perfected album, which in this guy's case is not a dismissal. While Shipp can sprawl vivaciously next to the right partner-- like fire-breathing tenor giant David S. Ware-- his own work often veers towards the cerebral and angular. His tunes sound like they're composed on graph paper, and although the titles have a sci-fi vibe, they don't conjure up the Funkadelic Mothership as much as 1950s Arthur C. Clarke: names like ""Nebula Theory"", ""Cohesion"" and ""World of Blue Glass"" imply scientists floating past abandoned spaceships and gigantic blocks of ice. The cool veneer can distract from the variety on this disc. The nine compositions each take a different mood and strategy, as the band jumps from the ballad ""World of Blue Glass"" to Jamal's fiery showcase ""Vamp to Vibe"", then to the beats and distorted horn samples that funk up ""The Root"". Yet they're as concise and blocked off as tanks at an aquarium: Each one makes its point in around five minutes, and none lasts a second too long. Shipp brings along the same rhythm section as his last few dates, with bassist William Parker and Gerald Cleaver on drums. Much has been written about Parker, one of Shipp's longest-running and most compatible partners, but it's Cleaver who intrigues me more than ever before when he matches FLAM's beats with a mechanical crispness, or plays a subtle but erratic rhythm under the otherwise tranquil title track. Jamal is the newest performer to this group, and the most welcome surprise: A sorely under-recorded talent who has played since the 60s, he has worked with Billy Bang, Sunny Murray and the Ronald Shannon Jackson Decoding Society. On this date, he's an impeccable soloist-- for example, the straight-but-shimmering blues of ""The Key""-- and also a stellar improviser, whose vibes help color the abstract sections. Yet this record is defined by the production as much as the improvisation, and it's FLAM who turns out to be the most insidious component. You can hear what he's done to ""Nu Matrix"", as Jamal's sustained tones are stretched into an aurora borealis, while Shipp is dropped deep into the sea; the samples on ""The Root"" further echo his contributions to Nu-Bop. But like Shipp, he's more restrained this time: In fact, his work can be so subtle that it plays tricks on you. Did he engineer the brief fade-outs on ""Vamp to Vibe"", or the start of ""The Root"", or is it just the band? Even on ""World of Blue Glass"", when a high note from the piano sparks a sudden bright sound, you almost wonder if FLAM added (or exaggerated) it. With this guy lurking around, no detail on the record seems accidental. With Equilibrium, Shipp has created a puzzle box, full of nuanced performances and cryptic details. It's not his most passionate work, but it's the closest to perfect, so precisely constructed that every note invites attention. With his next big step a month away-- his much-anticipated face-off against the hip-hop act Anti-Pop Consortium-- an album like Equilibrium could look careful, like a retreat.

Hate,The Delgados,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a901ea9e61561daa5962/1:1/w_160/31551d07.jpg,2003-01-27 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2266-hate/,MantraBeggars,"Producer Dave Fridmann has built his name on highly successful, invigorating experiments in pop classicism which revel in the same swooning orchestration that rock music all but abandoned after the 1970s. But it seems every year, he's got another up his sleeve, never much different than the last, and with repeated exposure to these kinds of grandiose epics, the newness has worn off, leaving many of his productions to join their cousins Wilco and Elliott Smith in a genre I describe as, well, indie adult-contemporary. Don't take offense yet-- I think indie adult-contemporary is a fine idea, and I've loved far too many of these records to get snobby about it. It's just a fact: This is the music that may eventually prompt your preteen kids to roll their eyes and make unenthusiastic noises when you force them to listen during long car trips. Jeff Tweedy may become your Sting, Wayne Coyne your Peter Gabriel, Mercury Rev your Steely Dan-- and there's no reason any of this will be any less wonderful than the Carole King LPs in your parents basements. But at some point, I realized my shelves were filling up with this stuff, and even though I knew I'd find every new release of it perfectly lovely, it seemed more rewarding to look into something else. I mention this not to pick on anyone's favorite albums, but because the great flaw in my personal No More Indie Adult-Contemporary plan turned out to be The Delgados. The Delgados' secret weapon, from their early noise-pop days to their big breakthrough with The Great Eastern, has always been a peculiarly Scottish penchant for resigned, anthemic melodies: Suffice it to say that if ""Auld Lang Syne"" had not existed, this band probably would have written it and then made it kick, hard. The tracks on The Great Eastern started off with either Alun Woodward or Emma Pollock doing gorgeous mumbly sing-songs, but most of them quickly burst open to the two of them singing in big, wistful, drunken mug-waving unison. Better yet, that was the album's focus, with the swoony schmaltz-experiments Fridmann usually abets providing only the thinnest layer of icing. And I mention all of that to say this: It's a testament to the general greatness of The Delgados that I'm as captivated as I am by Hate, despite its suffering under the weight of a much more prevalent layer of faux-classicism-- by which I mean loads of gratuitous pokes at the ""swoon"" button. It also leans a bit obviously into those slow-building anthems, which you can take either as a glorious celebration of the band's strengths or a sort of grating repetition: Here's the one that starts with just piano then builds to a big stormy climax, and here's the one that starts with just guitar and builds to a big stormy climax, and so on. All of which winds up being beside the point, because Hate is a different thing. Hate is a spiteful, disappointed, hoping-to-be-hopeful record, wherein even the most Delgados-by-numbers builds run up not into glowing chants but into desperate, wounded crooning. And then they do it again, and again, but each time, there's something about the big beating heart underneath that makes those hooks sink in, and deep. Of course, the biggest successes here are the moments when the band still surprises you, and most stunning is ""Coming in from the Cold"", which drops the epic orchestration in favor of a detour through the pop-anthem territory where you'd usually find Travis or Coldplay. The differences, in this case, are that (a) this song contains a hook I can't imagine anyone not falling for, and that (b) Emma, who gets to deliver it, does a great job of supporting my argument that she's one of the best and most affecting vocalists going. The other big surprise comes in the form of a deeply cynical Beatles pastiche-- on ""All You Need is Hate"", which starts out sprightly like ""She's Leaving Home"" and then launches into a fascinating Delgados version of the Beatles' R&B; strut. Following that is ""The Child Killers""-- I told you this was wounded and bleak-- one of the least hopeful piano ballads you're likely to hear this side of Rufus Wainwright. Do some of the more standard-issue runs seem a bit labored? They do: ""Never Look at the Sun"" has a climax that sounds great but never really catches; ""Coalman"" fails to compensate for its pointlessly over-orchestrated interludes, even with its closing Stereolab impersonation; ""All Rise"" is just a vague variation on The Great Eastern's ""Aye Today"". But the emotion buzzing out of these songs keeps a great number of them stunning, like indie-friendly versions of scores from period epics or superhero movies: ""If This is a Plan"" starts off like the mellow end of OK Computer and then erupts into a string-drenched gale so stirring that even Alun's two-ton melody has to claw its way in, and ""The Drowning Years"" aspires to Creed-like levels of bombast and actually succeeds. And that's the redeeming attribute of Hate, the extra-musical one: Some great dramatic reckoning of hope and despair is going on between its lines, and that's what's important. I could write a thousand more words on how disappointed I am with The Delgados for verging on making Just Another Indie Adult-Contemporary Record, but hey-- if more people in that genre were making music that seemed to be grasping at emotions as important as this, I might not have sworn off of it in the first place.","Producer Dave Fridmann has built his name on highly successful, invigorating experiments in pop classicism which revel in the same ...

Lucid Interval,Cephalic Carnage,by: Isaiah Violante,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a571b1335d7bf1698bd4/1:1/w_160/ff8fa3dd.jpg,2003-01-27 06:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1380-lucid-interval/,Relapse,"I've got a steamy little nugget of truth for all of you dedicated Pitchfork readers: heavy metal is the counter-culture's answer to chain-smoking. This is absolute gospel truth. Try as we might, and directly in the face of myriad warnings telling us to stray from the ills of cigarette smoke and those fire-branding demons of metal, there are still thousands upon thousands of us sucking down butts and banging our heads like morons every single day. With Surgeon General's warning labels, The Insider, iron lungs, and television commercials featuring skinny hipster kids on street corners trying to convince us that Philip Morris is still pulling the wool over the eyes of a few muddle-headed sheep, we've got ample incentive to avoid those delightful little cylinders of tar like the plague. But every once in a while, something comes along to rekindle the flame. Whether it's a fantastic metal album or a found carton of Chesterfields, we'll take the opportunity to heave the largest cloud of nicotine right in your faces, because we know it prays upon your puritanical self-hatred, and in plain black and white, we know you hate it. Fortunately for those who enjoy blowing smoke in the faces of their friends and family, an ultra-carcinogen called Lucid Interval was created this past August, by gore-metal Ubermensches Cephalic Carnage. Mutating equal parts grind, fusion jazz, prog, and hardcore might seem ludicrous-- it's bombastic, loud, and impulsive-- but this is one of the most brutal, technically sophisticated, and unabashed Metal records I've heard in a very long time. Stretching death metal to its absolute limit has always been the primary interest of Colorado's Cephalic Carnage. Previous releases Conforming to Abnormality and Exploiting Dysfunction laid the groundwork for this genesis to absurdity, combining the gory brutality of their peers in Cock and Ball Torture, the death metal comedic ethos of Cannibal Corpse, and the sweeping chaos of Exhumed. Lucid Interval finds Cephalic Carnage pushing its earlier dynamic to the fullest extreme, with mind-blowing results. From the opening seconds of ""Scolopendra Cingulata"", it's painfully apparent this album is an aneurysm waiting to happen. Introducing high frequency trepanation in the vein of Whitehouse, a meticulous grind and seismic bass slowly give way to the horrifying growls of vocalists Lenzig (lead vocals) and Jawash (also on bass) during the album's second track, ""Fortuitous Oddity"". Lenzig has the ability to move between the guttural growls of grindcore-- the kind of stuff that sounds like a herd of pigs slaughtering Farmer Bill and his wife-- and the high-pitched screams of noisecore, while the band follows every vocal nuance apace. With violent death metal riffs degenerating into mock blues, then back to blistering hammerbeat in a matter of seconds, Cephalic Carnage have taken a fairly conventional New York death metal aesthetic and twisted it into a sound so much more advanced and sinewy than that of their contemporaries. Drummer John (who oddly enough bears a passing resemblance to Moby) blasts through double-kick and syncopated jazz licks with mathematical precision and power, while guitarists Zak and Steve race up and down the fretboard inexhaustibly. There's nothing close to a missed note here, no indication of timidity or restraint: Lucid Interval is simply a brutal, a furious, abrasive forty-five minutes of the very best experimental grindcore. This is an album of faux starts and stops, limitless innovation, and full-on cranial overload. ""Pseudo"" is their foray into avant-garde jazz territory, replete with sounds pulled right out of the Mego catalog; the humorously titled ""Black Metal Sabbath"" combines that genre's shrieks with the stoner drone of labelmates High on Fire. The title track features Swedish metal crescendos in the style of Marduk and Bathory, while ""Arsonist Savior"" utilizes gore-grind electronics-- a la Catasexual Urge Motivation-- and the power chord harmonics of Incantation. Hell, there's even a fifty second mariachi interlude called ""Cannibism"". For all you metalheads and smokers out there, sit back, light up, and enjoy this masterpiece from Cephalic Carnage. Lucid Interval displays the band's full panoply of disparate styles and influences with deft originality and quality, sans any indication of softening its brutal exoskeleton. In case anyone around you starts to cough, wheeze, or gasp for breath, remember the immortal words of Bill Hicks: ""non-smokers die every single day.""","I've got a steamy little nugget of truth for all of you dedicated Pitchfork readers: heavy metal is the ...

Monster Zero,Voyager One,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a97a9d034d5c69bf3c69/1:1/w_160/5b42d0b1.jpg,2003-01-27 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8501-monster-zero/,Loveless,"Monster Zero was one seriously badass monster. Seriously, man, we're talking three vicious heads spewing radioactive gas and a wingspan that would cover most of a suburban housing development; it took both Godzilla and Rodan an entire movie to take this thing on. Also known as Ghidrah, he held unlimited sway over Planet Zero (or Planet X, depending on which translation you're watching), a mysterious world found hiding behind Jupiter, where he terrorized the alien residents into retreating underground. Needless to say, respect is due, and you had better bring something to the table when you're naming your record after this thing. I don't want to hear any demure soft rock or whiny emo band tossing the name around like it doesn't mean anything; Monster Zero could scorch the very earth you walk on with his breath, and your music has to be able to match his legacy to legitimately carry his name. And where many would fail, Voyager One ultimately succeed, crafting an album with a sound just prickly and bombastic enough to do old Ghidrah justice. Guitars with a half-life of about 10,000 years soar and strafe, while Tony Zuniga's drums flatten the landscape. The whole record sounds like it was recorded in an immense cavern, with a dense mix slathered in huge reverb. For most of the album, Voyager One comprises five people generating as much sound as possible, employing loops, keyboards, guitars, samples, voices, horns, cello, and truckloads of drums. You'd never guess this racket was churned up in Seattle; it sounds in every way more like something you'd expect from Oxford or Manchester, right down to the vocals, which have a distinctly British inflection, if not an outright accent. In fact, vocalist Peter Marchese at times seems to consciously avoid a British accent, as though his voice wants to affect one, but he holds back with all his willpower. It's easy to see why that accent would be tempting, as the British have held a near-total monopoly on this kind of music for nigh on a decade now, and Marchese's head is likely full of Swervedriver, Slowdive, Ride, and My Bloody Valentine melodies. Monster Zero opens and closes floating in space, beginning with the gauzy textures of ""Out in the Marketplace"" and ending in a dead drift out past the solar system's furthest reaches, through asteroids and tiny proto-planets on the guitar haze of ""Praise the Lowered"" and ""Tokyoidaho"". In between, things are much meatier, with stomping extraterrestrial anthems like ""Wires"" and ""Ready. Reset."" layering heavy guitar effects over insistent bass lines and pounding Bonham-isms. Voyager One delivers a space-rock outing that brings just as much rock as space to your speakers, a balance that's not often achieved. Furthermore, it slaughters their 2000 debut From The New Nation Of Long Shadows, which was already pretty good to begin with. Monster Zero may have been defeated in the end, but he was mighty, and this album is an honorable tribute.","Monster Zero was one seriously badass monster.

The Cassettes,The Cassettes,by: Brian James,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5469d034d5c69bf327e/1:1/w_160/236b0f2f.jpg,2003-01-27 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1340-the-cassettes/,Lovitt,"There's a lot about Washington D.C.'s The Cassettes that you can discern from the incidental details of their second, self-titled album. Two items in particular stand out: The whimsical, childlike art, and the liner notation that indicates the lyrics to ""Ghost in a Lost World"" were penned by Sandra Davis in 1968, when she was a scant nine years old. As much appeal as these unabashedly sunny touches have in the era of Joe Millionaire, they land the band in a void between effortless success and simply trying too hard. For a good example of the band's soul, look no further than the aforementioned ""Ghost in a Lost World"". Though neither the best nor worst track on the record, it manages to bring together all the tendencies that sneak into the other songs in less obvious ways. The lyrics-- again, by prepubescent poet Davis-- are full of haunted little kid images that were Stephen King clich√©s long before they were rehashed in The Ring. Lines like, ""The people are strange creatures/ They do not smile,"" and, ""The place they live is just like a blank space on a piece of paper,"" are mildly spooky, but only when they come from the mouths of single-digit babes. Hearing head Cassette Shelby Cinqa sing them is about like watching a forty-year old porn actress try to pass herself off as barely legal, and it lacks that scenario's tarnished payoff. With vapid acoustic strumming that gets jiggy with nothing, and singing that contains all the passion of a recipe for bran muffins, Cinqa turns this presumably heartfelt gesture bathetic faster than you can turn off your roommate's copy of August and Everything After. The Cassettes give the impression of being swell people, and they're at least competent, but it's difficult to cheer for them as much as one might like, due to their fetish for the generic. Cinqa-- sounding eerily like Spin Doctors frontman Chris Barron-- is nowhere near as exceptional as he needs to be to lead a band. He's constructed a warm, lazy sound, lacquering his guitar with a healthy dose of distortion and flange, but his parts are so flavorless that, beneath the wash of effects, it's hard to hear what rhythm he's playing, or even when he's changing chords. The ensuing wall of fuzz is only slightly more compelling than radio static, and since everyone can get that for free, it's natural to wonder what segment of the market the Cassettes thought they might capture. The Cassettes sounds like it's trying to establish a trademark sound rather than explore the limits of artistic expression, which is a wasted effort leading only toward easy and dismissive pegging. On a few aberrant cuts-- most notably the jazzy ""Alright with the Days""-- they show real inspiration and craftsmanship. It's discouraging how ghettoized they are, but at the very least, some bright moments show the group doesn't have to lift all their ideas from nine-year-olds.","There's a lot about Washington D.C.'s The Cassettes that you can discern from the incidental details\n ...

It's as if Ikara Colt ran down a checklist from the back of the NME on how to be a British punk band: They met at art school, they dress sharp, and they sound glum. They crib from the best post-punk and noise-rock, and every track on their debut gets a perfect score for pop songform and speedy hook delivery. They're a hit in Britain, and if they become chic enough, one of them might land a date with Kelly Osbourne. So what's wrong with them, aside from the fact I could pack up their album in a single paragraph? Ikara Colt are the latest straight-up decent punk act to get shipped across the pond, and they're a genuine example of ""authentic rock"": Distorted guitars, curt lyrics and a pummeling rhythm section, funneled into concise, riffy singles. Even the recording sounds just as it should, lo-fi but clear, raw but just short of spastic. Chat and Business is undeniably solid, but we don't give high scores for just doing the job, and the album has shortcomings. At the top of the list, it doesn't have much personality. You'll have to forgive me; I've never seen the band live, watched them on a talk show or read about their sex lives in a British newspaper. For all I know, they could be a font of charisma back where they come from. I only have the album to work with, and it's dangerously familiar. It's derivative, and too easily defined by the ""recommended if you like"" list it invites. Vocalist Paul Resende is both a strength and a shortcoming. You'll recognize his style from the work of Mark E. Smith and many others, and he has the chops to get the job done; he has a masculine scream, and the right voice for shout-singing. But the conviction sounds calculated: When he spits out the lyric ""chat and business,"" he drips contempt, but I don't sense that he hates chat or business any more than most people. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if he has a buddy who really despises chat and business, and Resende's just falling in line. The music also falls in line, between Sonic Youth and The Fall, but at least they do it well. If nothing else, the band is tight and energetic. Jon Ball's basslines throb and flail, and guitarist Claire Ingram has both the riffs and the noise. The opener, ""One Note"", rages harder and sprays more saliva than anything that follows; Ingram engrossingly circles around slower, drone-inflected tracks like ""City of Glass"", but the short blast-off chorus on ""Sink Venice"" makes it the stand-out track. For some variety, Ikara Colt plug a drum machine into a couple of tracks, but this is purely cosmetic. They've used electronic sounds more boldly elsewhere-- for example, the seedy remake of this album's ""May B 1 Day"" on their Basic Instruction EP-- but on Chat and Business they tip-toe around them without taking any risks. The novelty's welcome, but this is still a guitar band: Ikara Colt are strongest when Ingram's in charge. Chat and Business won't bring you down, nor will it kick your ass. It's the kind of album that's never better than its last single, but my complaints will sound like stodgy nit-picking if you go nuts for the guitars. This album has everything you could want from a modern art-punk band: Next time, they should give us even more.","They're perfect-- maybe too perfect.

Usually that kinda info I could keep to myself, changing in the locker room when everyone else was out to lunch and whatnot. The more astute boys soon noticed, though, and while I was gently heckled about it, they did their best to help, setting me up on blind dates with their cousins, sisters, and exes. But to no avail. Then our glorious editor hisself greased my palms with this disc of lost singles and found reel-tapes from Gary Wilson, saying, ""Beck name-checked him, dude, he's like the white Prince. Pure Game."" He also slipped me some Horny Goat Weed and said, ""You can thank me later, Oz-style."" With my hair dippity-dooed, my jeans pressed, and my shirt tucked in, I was ready for a night out, with Forgotten Lovers, a collection of various Wilson recordings dating from 1973-1982, just waiting on the hi-fi for my return. Bringing that groovy chick Cindy home, I cued up ""Dream(s)"", turning my little room into something right out of a Kojak love scene. The shag carpet was growing right out of my floorboards while Wilson got to sputtering such choice advice as ""girls are cool for kissin' when the hour strikes twelve."" Oh yes. I took him at his word and made my smooth move as his backing band, The Blind Dates, jerked a fuzzy sort of funk rhythm that somehow turned everything slightly prog. She wasn't really digging on the Steely Dan scene, but I said, ""It's cool, baby,"" as that fat synth bass straddling the line between Curtis Mayfield's superfly porn and cheesy Atari blips came back around, and I knew that I was home free. But then, ""Chrome Lover"". The timbales had the vibe going, but the scene got interrupted by Wilson's snotty come-on: ""Hey, why don't you just drop dead, huh?"" The remark was followed by some strangulated ""make out"" commands, followed by piercing free jazz cries, completely off-the-hook phone operators, and the sound of a main-vein draining. This schizophrenic shit completely salted my game! I got slapped a good one as she left, too, leaving me alone to enjoy the odd hiccups of ""Sick Trip"", which came off like Michael Stipe doing a Charlie Feathers impression before segueing into a straight piano jazz ballad with a stand-up bass. ""I Wanna Take You on a Sea Cruise"" was like Sun Ra leering in cocktail lounge at a 17-year old, and veering very close to Wilson's classic ""6.4 = Make Out"" in the process. I was filled with longing when the perverse tape-slurred whispers of, ""You are my girlfriend-- that entitles me to one kiss,"" crept up at the end of the album. Maybe I could call Cindy later and leave that part on her answering machine? Gary Wilson successfully jumped between new wave synth spasms, soundtrack jazz and skronk, James Brown pep, noise collage, pre-Prince strut, and the Jonathan Richman School of Painfully Geeky Lyricism way back in the mid-70s, as evidenced here. Then again, so did You Think You Really Know Me, and a lot of the finest moments here are executed on that record in a slightly more deranged manner. I can't say if there's room enough for two Gary Wilson records in the bachelor pad, but as I sit here now with this steak on my eye, I wonder if the boys at the Pitchfork office weren't just trying to put me on a sick trip or something.","My first week at the Pitchfork office, it became not only painfully apparent that it's a total boys' club ...

Loose Fur,Loose Fur,by: Will Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd53ea9e61561daa76ab/1:1/w_160/97b1eefc.jpg,2003-01-26 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4853-loose-fur/,Drag City,"Considering the pedigree of Loose Fur (sire, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot; dam, Insignificance), one might expect a self-assured thoroughbred with Wilco's inventive savvy and Jim O'Rourke's art-school raffishness. Recorded during downtime on Foxtrot and refined in the two years since, however, this experiment mostly serves to reinforce what we're already well aware of: Jeff Tweedy's formidable strength as a songwriter, the pervasive nuance of O'Rourke's by-now trademark production, and Glenn Kotche's unconventional, sometimes overly ambitious approach to percussion. Oddly, the most predictable elements of Loose Fur are its most ""arty"" and ""experimental""-- songs that either follow the laws of entropy and dissolve in a rising swell of dissonance (opener ""Laminated Cat"") or defy them entirely, allowing melodies to emerge gradually from the sonic clutter (""So Long""). Despite its relative brevity (six cuts over forty minutes), Loose Fur establishes a familiar pattern early on, and it's actually the more conventional music-- exhibiting Tweedy and O'Rourke's common soft spot for classic rock-- that leaves a more lasting impression. ""Laminated Cat"" will be instantly recognizable to Wilco archivists as a more sedate reading of the Foxtrot castoff ""Not for the Season"". In its original incarnation the song was a somewhat generic rocker grafted with an unfortunate sub-Brian Wilson arrangement; here it's a functional scene-setter drawn by loops of distorted guitar and gently evocative laptopery into an improbable seven-minute jam. Tweedy's lyrics are mostly incidental to the tidal pull of the rhythm and O'Rourke's otherworldly fuzz-- a stoner's recognition of time passing exponentially faster, years spent accumulating piles of books ""not worth reading."" Kotche's percolating thumps grow progressively (and predictably) louder as the tune ambles self-consciously towards the imploding plastic inevitable. Close, but no Andy Warhol-lithographed banana. The Tweedy-helmed ""You Were Wrong"" fares much better, pitching squalls of dissonant harmonics over a relatively simple guitar/bass/drums groove, a piano stumbling drunkenly in the distance. The melody seems to hover uncertainly, then lurch forward in the clutches of some unseen gravity. Tweedy and O'Rourke are collaboratively at their best here, with O'Rourke's guitar chiming color commentary between the acerbic lyrics. ""You were wrong to believe in me,"" Tweedy's dejected protagonist insists in a clever variation on the Pet Sounds chestnut. Tweedy punctuates the enigmatic imagery of the verses with heart-on-sleeve frankness in the choruses, an exorcism of the ghosts that stubbornly linger after a dead relationship: ""When you leave, you're not gone."" Unfortunately, Loose Fur's chemistry is not quite as strong with the shoe on the other foot: Tweedy swaps cheeky non-sequiturs like, ""You don't know where that phone's been,"" and, ""Back in the saddle again,"" with O'Rourke on the latter's ""Elegant Transaction"", a hyperkinetic pastiche of guitar, bells, and off-kilter percussion. Perhaps it's unfair to compare O'Rourke's cut-and-paste songwriting with Tweedy's urban-troubadour approach, but the incongruity between the two can be jarring-- the pitched earnestness of O'Rourke's voice sounds as thin as Dan Fogelberg next to Tweedy's. O'Rourke's ""So Long"" buries its rather lovely guitar figure behind a virtually impregnable barricade of randomly crashing and clicking percussion-- glass shaken in boxes, tambourines chattering, alarm clocks being wound, an unschooled guitar improvising ugly discordant figures in the extreme foreground. In direct contrast to the rest of the album, the melody insinuates itself gradually through repetition, overcoming the blatant wankery of the avant-jazz setup and succumbing to a chorus of lite-rock ""da-da-da""'s right out of Stereolab and 1975. ""Say so long to yourself,"" O'Rourke implores in the choruses, ""it's so wrong to go on."" And yet, go on it does-- for nine minutes, in fact, as O'Rourke laboriously pulls the song into focus. ""Liquidation Totale"" follows, a pleasantly engaging instrumental juxtaposing rushes of acoustic guitar with an urgent electric riff and pleasant detours on banjo and electric guitar. The song, however, does little but preface closer ""Chinese Apple"", again ending in a not-entirely-unexpected clusterfuck of noise. ""Chinese Apple"" is Loose Fur's strongest offering-- by far, Tweedy and O'Rourke's most successful merger of art and accessibility. It even nicks a few lines from ""Heavy Metal Drummer"", recasting Foxtrot's Magnetic Poetry nonchalance in a pastoral twilight rarely seen from Tweedy since the rural melodramas of Uncle Tupelo. The track builds on a repeating guitar figure reminiscent of Nick Drake's ""Which Will"", Tweedy's uncommonly warm voice buoyed by the propulsive current of melody beneath. Suddenly, the music becomes much darker, and the sleepy-eyed flow of Tweedy's prose careens into an epiphany of impressionistic flashes: ""Between the branches, flowering chance/ Fence lights rattling, fingers pushing through/ Slowly brushing past a fast glimpse of you."" Acoustic guitars swell and accelerate; spectral percussion crashes distantly in the gathering storm. The heartbeat of the kickdrum keeps the vessel on course with its persistent lighthouse thump, and eventually the original guitar figure returns unscathed-- brighter, actually, more assertive. The song devolves gradually, with a descending keyboard figure reminiscent of Foxtrot's ""Poor Places"" and the ambient rattle of Kotche's brushes swishing like an outgoing tide. Fans of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot will no doubt find Loose Fur an indispensable companion piece, as much of the music found here occupies roughly the same static-frosted moonscape as ""Radio Cure"". Despite its deliberate obliqueness, Loose Fur illustrates with clarity just what Tweedy and O'Rourke were up to in those wee hours when Tweedy could no longer face the chaos of Foxtrot and Jay Bennett's endless embellishments. Given the option of editing together the best of a dozen-plus guitar takes for ""Kamera"" and horsing around with music as lovely as ""Chinese Apple"" or ""You Were Wrong"" with O'Rourke and Kotche, which would you choose? Ah, distance has a way of making love understandable.","Considering the pedigree of Loose Fur (sire, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot; dam, Insignificance), one might expect a self-assured thoroughbred with Wilco ...

I might've missed those years with Shrimp Boat-- hey, I was young, what can I tell you?-- but along with Tortoise, The Sea and Cake was there to help me feel like I was down with the city whose suburbs I haunted during my formative years. Tortoise was the post-rock figurehead, of course, but I always felt a bit more affinity for The Sea and Cake. Even though the two bands only shared one member, The Sea and Cake always seemed like Tortoise's pop spin-off, and, pop fan that I am, I dug it. The Sea and Cake has since become a downright staple of indie rock, spreading six albums out over a ten-year career. Things seemed to be getting better, too: 2001's Oui was the band's most consistent album, the fullest realization of their deceptively creative, soft-rock sound. Sam Prekop's Voice has been growing in confidence the whole time, appearing higher and higher in the mix, embracing a unique sort of breathy rasp that nicely complemented Oui's winter-by-the-Lake ambience. The Sea and Cake's sixth record is a good one, showing the band isn't running willy-nilly from the sinking post-rock ship, instead subtly incorporating the electronic dance-beats that have inched back into the indie vocabulary. One Bedroom launches with a thick instrumental jam (""Four Corners"") that proves the band remain technically sharp as knives; Eric Claridge's tuneful bass leads the charge over percussive guitars and John McEntire's constantly shape-shifting drums. Yet, I turn now to face Sam Prekop's Voice, and realize that it must be said: ""I don't know, SPV, I think you might've gone too far on One Bedroom. Voice, my friend, when you come in mixed higher than ever, after three minutes of solid white-boy groove, it's a lot for a man to take. I'm not sure where that windy timbre comes from-- sucking Camels, monoxide, Sharpies-- and I'll grant you it's distinctive, but it's also terribly limiting, with a range so narrow, anyone with more than a couple Sea and Cake records has already heard all that you can do. On ""Four Corners"", even the music seems disappointed with you, each element of the jam slowly peeling off under your whisper-croon, and when you return at its close, you're defeated, subdued. ""It's sad that you've become such an obstacle, SPV, since on One Bedroom the band occasionally pumps out some of its best music yet. Like Richard Pryor in Superman 3, recent Tortoise tracks (i.e. ""CTA"", off Chocolate Industries' Urban Renewal comp) had McEntire's rhythms pumped in the studio, and he brings that increased machinery to this album. ""Hotel Tell"" hinges on a throbbing bass drum and some decorative handclaps, and they augment the beat in ""Shoulder Length"" with a toy-box full of buzzes and clicks. Keyboards abound like never before on a Sea and Cake record, de-emphasizing the signature hard-rhythm guitar and-- miraculously-- deposing the vibraphone. My word, has Chicago finally put away the mallets? ""It wouldn't be entirely fair to lay all the blame at your, um, feet, Sam Prekop's Voice. One Bedroom also signals a return to the half-on/half-off inconsistency that marred all Sea and Cake albums except Nassau and Oui, as a handful of misfires trip up the flow. Songs like ""Try Nothing"", ""Le Baron"" and ""Interiors"" can't distract from the vocals, and fall over the lite-rock cliff, string, synths and all. ""It says something that the record's closer, a dolled-up cover of David Bowie's ""Sound and Vision"", is the most exciting track here. It's also the one that most covers up your limitations, SPV. Going all the way with those soft-rock keyboards, completely buying into the electronic drums, ""Sound and Vision"" also mixes in singing from the Aluminum Group's Navin Brothers. The result is a reasonable facsimile of what The Human League might've done with the song; it barely skirts the elevator music issue, ending up a sublime work of EZ-Indie. ""I mean, I feel like kind of an ass being this hard on you, to your face no less. A man can't help the way he sings, but you didn't always sound like this; I dug out the back catalog to make sure. Hey, look at trusty old Archer Prewitt over there, he's a damn fine singer in his own right. Calm down, SPV, all I'm saying is consider scaling it back a bit. It might be just the push The Sea and Cake need to evolve as a band, before you become water-treading caricature. C'mon, suck in that lower lip, let's get a pizza; I'm buying. You like pepperoni, right?""","Sam Prekop's Voice and I are hanging out at the Lincoln Park Zoo, watching the penguins, for they are ...

Riffin',Cherry Valence,by: Brian James,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a59e13d1975652138fc9/1:1/w_160/8691a68f.jpg,2003-01-21 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1424-riffin/,Estrus,"The Cherry Valence, a group of hard rawkers from Raleigh, NC, seem like the types that would keep running lists in their heads of who is and who is not ""real rock and roll."" The owners of such mindsets usually place themselves in the center of this imagined real rock circle, and damn those who venture beyond its perimeter. In the case of this band, the prerequisites for a cherry-scented stamp of approval are riffs, riffs, and more riffs, as one might expect from the telling title of their second album, Riffin'. It's very hard to be objective when it comes down to riffs. After all, who can say which riffs are good and which aren't? By keeping things as basic as they do, the Valence make it difficult to apply any kind of logic to the proceedings. Either this music grabs you or it doesn't, and while Riffin' will probably rake up a modest pile of followers, it seems certain that the majority of ears it strikes will have been struck more effectively by other like-minded bands and/or be completely indifferent. Guitarists Jamie Williams and Cheetie Kumar riff it up with all due aplomb, doling out a tasty riff morsel per song, but with little else to offer, Riffin' grows surprisingly tiring during the course of its 33-minute runtime. The shame of it all is that each song, and the album as a whole, could be made leagues better if only the band weren't committed to a good-on-paper philosophy of being full volume all the time. Even Led Zeppelin, no friends of subtlety themselves, knew the value of contrast and dynamics. This lesson appears to have gone unimparted on The Cherry Valence, and it's easy to imagine them giving their audiences migraines at the exact moment the band expects a group orgasm. None of these shortcomings would be a death blow on their own, and even taken together, they don't disqualify The Cherry Valence as an enjoyable band. Similar charges could just as easily be leveled at The Stooges, The MC5, The Sonics, Sex Pistols, etc., but what the Cherry Valence lacks is an Iggy, a Rob Tyner, a Gerry Roslie, a Johnny Rotten, etc. Brian Quast and Nick Whitley, sharing lead vocal duties, thankfully sidestep any attempts to add a Robert Plant wail to the guitar bombast behind them, and they wind up sounding much more human and real for it. But they also sound generic and utterly devoid of charisma, filling the position without offering much that's compelling. The same goes for the band. They're ultimately a group that you can go see when you can't afford AC/DC tickets, and since CDs cost the same regardless of their worth, you might as well skip Riffin' and buy Back in Black instead.","The Cherry Valence, a group of hard rawkers from Raleigh, NC, seem like the types that would keep running lists ...

Satan's Kickin' Yr Dick In,Racebannon,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1d35e6ef9596932029e/1:1/w_160/ad238741.gif,2003-01-21 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6632-satans-kickin-yr-dick-in/,Secretly Canadian,"Nothing smells so arrogant as a rock opera. Back in the day, only the biggest, most self-absorbed arena rockers could turn their meandering, ridiculous ""deaf/dumb/blind pinball star"" concepts into hit albums. The punk revolution tried but failed to wipe these dinosaurs from history, so it's a gutsy move that a hardcore act-- even one as twisted and avant-literate as Racebannon-- would follow in the footsteps of The Who and Pink Floyd, without even smirking about it. Satan's Kickin' Yr Dick In is indeed a rock opera, yet there isn't one note of empty bombast: loud, vicious, and vulgar, it's their tightest, most ambitious record yet. Admittedly a little closer to Zappa's Joe's Garage than Tommy, it's the story of Rodney, a musician whose material is piss-poor and can't draw a crowd. In desperation, he makes a deal with Satan, who turns him into a gorgeous chanteuse named Rhonda Delight, as whom he wins fame, riches, and decadence-- everything his heart desires-- until his inevitable fall, when celebrity takes its toll, and Satan returns to drag him to hell. The joke is, you can't make out this story without the liner notes, because Michael Anderson's vocals are completely indecipherable, thanks to his giddy delivery and the record's liberal use of noise. A few signifiers of the high life (""it's so glorious..."", ""heroin is so lower-class..."", ""John F. Kennedy, Jr."") make it through, but deciphering the rest is like watching an Italian opera: you have to infer the drama from how much and how loudly they shriek. Anderson, who wrote this libretto, revitalizes the hoary, clich√©d story by elaborating with gawking, carnal imagery, from Rodney's graphic violation by Satan to the celebrated Rhonda's vivid, naked beauty. And nobody could express our hero's inner state like Anderson, whose excited gibbering sounds like a cartoon character with its head spinning around. The album title is a good indicator of his diction and tasteful vulgarity, as is the way he scrunches certain words (like ""yr"") before they leave his mouth. Racebannon embeds the vocals in dense, grinding sheets of cacophony. Monstrous drums and guitar stomp through the songs, from chords like waves smashing beach houses to the whip-like tune of ""Part IV"", bouncing like some demon is grabbing at its kneecaps, before wrenching into Rhonda's decline. The core music is surrounded by a nightmarish din, with multi-tracked vocals, and a little of what a preacher might call the ""steel wheels of Lucifer"": records played either backwards or slowed to a warped pitch like the voice of the dark master. The band has released the five parts in installments, with ""IV"" and ""V"" just out on a split album with Songs of Zarathustra, but this is the epic's first full release, and it features a new, more polished recording. It's easily their best album, as much as I liked last year's In the Grips of the Light: the band sounds better on a shorter record with no breaks between tracks, and the non-stop throttling is actually more listenable. The sterling production makes it less raw, but much stronger: Racebannon sticks your head right into the noise, just as their words pull you through the bowels of fame, lust and desire.","Nothing smells so arrogant as a rock opera.

The Wonderman Years,Lee ‚ÄúScratch‚Äù Perry,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a041ea9e61561daa4515/1:1/w_160/a6c8b25a.jpg,2003-01-21 06:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6244-the-wonderman-years/,Trojan,"In the early 90s, it was almost impossible to score good reggae. Flipping through chests of used UB40 and Steel Pulse records, I never found any treasure, and the Trustafarians at school had all but ruined Bob for me. To top it off, most Jamaican records I could find were so aesthetically off-putting as to warrant hesitation. As it turns out, whether encased in hand-drawn covers featuring dreadlocked lions in military gear smoking joints, poorly photocopied text, severely warped, pock-marked pressings, or cheesy back covers with the wrong titles, times, or musicians, these records were Acapulco Gold. As dub reggae-- and Lee Perry, in particular-- enjoyed a renaissance in the middle of the decade (courtesy of Tortoise and the Beastie Boys), that all changed, and like rain after a drought, it soon became a deluge. There were suddenly so many damned Lee Perry records to be had-- some legitimate, some shady-- that one wouldn't know where to begin, and still may not, even today. These two discs cull his turns as producer from 1971-1973, after his important early work with Bob Marley & The Wailers and before founding his infamous Black Ark Studio. Slim though these two years may be, they're a crucial segment of Perry's career to investigate. The early 70s were a heady time for Jamaican popular music, as it began to segue from the shuffling dance of rocksteady and American R&B; influence into its own homegrown sound, and the harder rhythmic edges of skank. The gaps between those beats, which the flipside of the singles (called ""dubs"") explored more thoroughly, would soon lift off into the atmosphere as their own musical form, metamorphosing the normal sounds of studio instruments into abstracted space dust within a three-minute side. Also of growing interest was the development of ""roots reggae"", which embraced Afrocentric thought and Rastafarianism, a religion that had a profound effect on the music of the time. It would transform soft-core lothario Max Romeo into a Marxist of the roughest sort, and make already-excellent singer Marley an international superstar. Lee Perry was there through all of these phases, instigating trends, and developing from others a sound wholly his own. Disc one begins with Marley & The Wailers doing an Impressions track, which is then turned around by future toasting great Big Youth, who shouts until the song is his very own beast. Already socially conscious by way of a Curtis Mayfield cover, you can see the growing influence Afrocentric thought had on Perry in the studio. There's Junior Byles' classic ""Beat Down Babylon"", which was such a huge hit that police were reported singing the lyrics on their beat. At least four versions of the Marcus Garvey-inspired ""Place Called Africa"" are compiled here, each resonating with the theme as pertains to its interpreter, be it by Byles, Dennis Alcapone, or Winston Cool (aka Dr. Alimantado, the best-dressed chicken in town). In another four-cut span, the same basic track is run through the gamut of all possible island styles, illustrating in microcosm what Lee Perry was capable of with the barest of elements, and how much his music changed in two short years. It begins with the Stingers' ""Give Me Power"", rendered as a soulful group sound; ""Give Me Power No.2"" continues the beat, but replaces the ensemble with a bellowing toast from King Iwah, waxing more biblical than the previous version. ""Sunshine Showdown"" is that riddim once again, but this time it's made ridiculous by Perry himself. You can hear ringside cheering as he steps to the mic, musing and mumbling about ""Smokey Joe Frazier Razor"" and other inane observations about the sweet science. By round four, ""Scratch"" has totally deconstructed ""Give Me Power"" to its essence: the mix is disconcerted with sirens, brassy baritone croaks, and backwards tape chirps, with just the slightest trace of the original vocals left as ghosts. These last two takes lead the way for the more innovative breakthroughs (and breakdowns) that would take place inside the Black Ark by 1974. By stripping down certain sounds and tightening up the drums and bass, reggae could liberally take from American radio hits and make them into tougher tracks. The Chi-Lites' ""(For God's Sake) Give More Power to the People"" is absorbed by the Upsetters, while Byles infuses Little Willie John's standard ""Fever"" with his own brand of madness, leading to even further permutations by the legendary Augustus Pablo and toaster Jah T. On the latter half of the second disc, ""Jungle Lion"" smokes some sticky Al Green and brings in that Hi Records organ brightness; it sounds deliriously whacked-out as Perry growls into the echoplex. Sequenced right before the move into Black Ark, the skanks and sonics at the end of the set define what people generally imagine when they think of Lee Perry. His odd sense of humor is most evident on ""Bathroom Skank"", which provides an excellent ""towel""/""bowel"" rhyme, and would lead to further scatological fixations in the future. Most prophetic are the echoed intonations that introduce the more skewed studio elements in instrumentals like ""IPA Skank"", ""Freakout Skank"", ""Bucky Skank"" and ""Cow Thief Skank"". Not only are these some of Perry's best early works (aside from the curiously absent ""Clint Eastwood"" instrumentals), they point the way into the future of the genre, and remixing in general, insofar as all the sounds are fair game for tweaking. This set, while not as uniformly tight as Soul Jazz's excellent Studio One overviews, or the compilations of legendary producers Leslie Kong, Sonia Pottinger, and King Tubby, has a little bit of everything to compensate, from a young Marley, to early toasting, with dashes of hard skank, proto-dub instrumentals, and oddball covers thrown in for good measure. As for compiling ""Scratch"", it remains an unsatisfactory effort; his cosmic joker legacy will forever elude capture, and these are all too brief glimpses of that genius at play.","In the early 90s, it was almost impossible to score good reggae.

Behind the Music,Soundtrack of Our Lives,by: Kyle Reiter,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4e45e6ef95969320995/1:1/w_160/9d9a94da.jpg,2003-01-20 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7376-behind-the-music/,InterscopeRepublic,"Last summer, a friend of mine kept saying things like, ""Have you ever heard of the Soundtrack of Our Lives? Apparently, that's what all the English kids are listening to!"" and, ""Man, I keep hearing that the Soundtrack of Our Lives is fucking awesome!"" In hindsight, my friend was either overzealous or a covert street-team shill, but at the time I was curious, and why not? It was supposed to be great! After an exhaustive search-- during which I discovered that Soundtrack of Our Lives are not English, but Swedish (and who isn't these days?)-- I stumbled upon a $40 import of Behind the Music at my local record store. There was no way in hell I was dropping that kind of money on an unknown record, but I gladly gave it a listen. First impression: baffled at how under-whelming it all was. I thought that either a) my friend was wrong, b) the English still fall for any band that sounds like Oasis, or c) I might need to listen to the album more than once to let it sink in. Republic/Universal brought the Soundtrack of Our Lives' Behind the Music (their third LP) to America in September 2002, significantly paring its price tag, but from what I'd heard of the album, $15 still felt steep. Hedge as I might, somebody up there wanted me to hear this record, and via Pitchfork, a free promotional copy arrived at my doorstep some weeks later. I didn't pay a dime for this, and I still I feel ripped off. I spent a week with this album, and kept telling myself, ""Hey, Kyle, don't judge this against hype; take the music for what it is."" I tried-- I listened without prejudice-- but realized the first two of my initial hypotheses were correct. Behind the Music is derivative and bland, and though the former quality isn't always a bad thing, the Soundtrack of Our Lives are in large part a classic rock cover band; their derivation is tedium. Take the greatest bands of all time, and excise any quality that could scare listeners off. Take the Rolling Stones, remove their sexual power and soul, and you have Behind the Music's ""Sister Surround"". Dispatch Pink Floyd's mystique and experimental bend, and you'd be listening to ""Broken Imaginary Time"". For all the kids who lied when they said they understood Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts' Club Band, listening in mental stasis as it drifted over their heads, may I present the Soundtrack of Your Lives. Noel Gallagher proclaimed Behind the Music ""the best album to come out in the last six years."" Unless Noel's figured out the secret reason Be Here Now is worth owning, we'll assume he's dating from OK Computer. But of course he isn't-- which is just Noel's idiocy-- but yes, if you wake up every morning craving a slice of ""Magic Pie"", he's right: consider yourself a potential Soundtrack of Our Lives fan. Not to crucify these mostly harmless Swedes, but it's high fucking time people stand up to over-hyped exports. I'm not going to tell you I change the station every time Coldplay comes on, but if I ever hear the Soundtrack of Our Lives' ""Tonight"" accosting me in a store, I'm walking out. There's nothing behind this music, and at the end of my days with it, my only impulse was to crank Exile on Main Street for the millionth time. I'm not asking for comparable heroes, but Christ, throw me a bone, Sweden!","Last summer, a friend of mine kept saying things like, ""Have you ever heard of the Soundtrack of Our Lives ...

Everything Is Good Here/Please Come Home,The Angels of Light,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a09a13d1975652138415/1:1/w_160/fc5619dd.jpg,2003-01-20 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/187-everything-is-good-hereplease-come-home/,Young God,"To a certain extent, most of us are still living sheltered lives, insofar as we rarely confront our spirituality, reject our families, or cross our internal lines of social decency. Beliefs and codes vary from person to person like wardrobes, but very few people are willful, foolish or terminally self-aware enough to defy their own. Cultural expectations-- ""absurd and malignant"" or otherwise-- have sway, and the precious, indecent few who manage to outrun them are usually viewed as outcasts or criminals (though sometimes as prophets). Aside from whatever laws they break, criminals rob us of our conventions: Through acts of violence and upheaval, they force us to confront our boundaries. For some, ignoring the tenuous line between right and wrong is an easy feat, but for others, personal demons are as controlling as any backlog of cultural norms. From the sound of Everything Is Good Here/Please Come Home, Angels of Light frontman Michael Gira may yet have demons to master and boundaries to set. Gira broached straightforward indecency long ago, via his most infamous and acclaimed project, Swans. In the mid-80s, when even the most ruthlessly earnest punks were only beginning to come to terms with a ""responsible"" definition of anarchy, Gira and then-partner Jarboe were speaking, sometimes literally, of masochistic torture and humiliating, brutal sex, over drastically compressed drones and industrial propulsion. When the decade closed in an alternative rock flourish, Swans thrust forward by leaps and bounds: Love of Life, The Great Annihilator and especially Soundtracks for the Blind predicted Godspeed You Black Emperor! and all manner of dark-ambient music, though thematically, Swans still seemed to equate God with a dominatrix. Gira's post-Swans (read: post-Jarboe) folk collective, The Angels of Light, matches his previous band's penchant for mythic grandeur with more muted dynamics, if not sentiment. Everything Is Good Here/Please Come Home is their third release, and it is both disturbing and wonderful. According to Gira, the album is a response to various personal, historical and political disasters. In some ways, that cryptic declaration takes the edge off the songs, as without pretense there's vast room for interpretation in his lyrics. Where ""Palisades"" might read as a particularly bitter response to suicide (""Reasons won't come/ And no one will regret that you're gone""), it could as easily lament claustrophobic personal terror: ""Do you see how they ruined your mind?/ Do you see how they ruined your life?"" Gira's smoke-stained baritone barely carries the words over acoustic guitar and delicate bell-tones, though later, he verges on overtaking a serene arrangement of church bells and a children's choir. The altogether peaceful ""Kosinsky"", with its deft, gently strummed electric guitar and bright fiddle motif, initially reads as a tender love song; Gira's description of hair like ""translucent, liquid light"" and ""the rhythm of your breathing"" seem poignant, though he again blurs boundaries by admitting he looks on his love with ""the eyes of an animal."" The textural range of Everything Is Good Here lends an epic, almost timeless quality that goes a long way toward fleshing out Gira's often-mythological way with words. ""All Souls' Rising"" features impressions of pagan ritual, and self-purification via ""the cull of foreign bone"" and forcing ""the blue smoke in... [to] fill the sac of skin."" The relentless hammer of drums and murky stew of bass, organ and guitar-- not to mention Gira's own droning war cries-- conjure scenes of violent sacrifice and the chaotic laws of a still-dominant Earth. Contrarily, the midtempo, Beatlesque ""Sunset Park"" reveals little in its single repeated line, ""She brings some/ She'll bring one,"" but betrays a brilliant optimism in Gira's simple, dignified melody and wall of shimmering guitars. Later, on ""Wedding"", an extended, gently strummed introduction is offset by ominous brass tones and the dissonant children's choir, giving way to Gira's rugged moan. The choir caps each phrase with angelic harmonies, quite removed from the intentionally grotesque sound of Swans, or even scattered moments on this album. As a whole, Everything Is Good Here is at once breathtaking and, like many Gira releases, simply too much. The overwhelming impression is one of acceptance and redemption, despite repeatedly bleak (or at best, mysterious) narration from Gira. The production helps, but digging deeper into its lyrics, it seems that, rather than prolong an inner struggle, The Angels of Light seek salvation. ""What Will Come"" openly requests that God ""save us... from what will come,"" though it's difficult to reconcile Gira's leap of faith after an album's worth of explicitly self-empowering, judgmental narrative, clouded by contradiction. Nevertheless, music that resonates with as much emotional weight and vital abandon is rare, and though I'm less inclined to look for answers in the mix than revel in its chaos, Everything Is Good Here/Please Come Home is a commendable, heady experience.","To a certain extent, most of us are still living sheltered lives, insofar as we rarely confront our spirituality, reject ...

Gold Chains EP,Gold Chains,by: Matthew Wellins,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf58abf31b7dc71562cc/1:1/w_160/66121abb.jpg,2003-01-20 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3498-gold-chains-ep/,PIAS,"Gold Chains' first EP, just reissued by PIAS, contains nearly thirty minutes of electronic hip-hop in lagging, five minute tracks, all full of exuberant raps regarding the joys of partying and sex. Though at times it approaches cleverness, Gold Chains is inflexible in its ceaseless coverage of the tired, mindless subject matter. Topher LaFata revels in rhetoric. Here's a hip-hop record by a guy who writes software-- the polar opposite of knocking boots-- and tries to get away with a Stereolab sample, excusing himself with a bandwagon appeal: Busta Rhymes did it, too. LaFata delivers quick jabs about gear over abrasive, crunching digital beats, but for his obvious aim to court backpackers, Gold Chains is entirely in line with hip-hop LaFata probably considers himself more intelligent than. He's smugly aware of the built-in novelty of homemade hip-hop since it became his culture's predominant popular music: the most brazen, ironist critics and numbed, partially deaf mainstream listeners all drive to their day jobs with the same Missy Elliott album slowly fraying the wires on their CD player-to-cassette-deck connection. LaFata takes this much for granted. Gold Chains could be taking the same approach as Kool Moe Dee, using hedonism, self-promotion, and ""I-know-he's-just-kidding-he-is-just-kidding-right?"" misogyny to confront either the innate obscurity of his genre, or his own daily frustrations. Unlike Kool Moe Dee, Erik B., or whatever pantheon artist Topher LaFata dreams of becoming, his style is a constructed pose, paying careful attention to the themes and execution of his influences, but completely lacking their significance. LaFata may have adopted the same willfully challenging approach a slew of underground hip-hop artists have in the past decade-- Bomb Hip-Hop, or the consistently lauded Def Jux-- but if that's his intent, the differences are even clearer. Take El-P, who grew up involved with hip-hop, and tailored it to meet his artistic and personal needs, close-minded public be damned. Then take Gold Chains, who began his career outside the traditional hip-hop family, as part of a marginalized group of Kit Clayton record-buyers and computer programmers who strove to fit in. LaFata's drive for inclusion and gratification isn't damning in and of itself, but to gain entry to the wisecracking hip-hop underground he envies, he goes to great lengths to alienate people, in hopes of artistic and ""street"" credibility. Yet, like that other inflammatory underground rapper, Cex, Gold Chains' grooves have implications beyond the noble intent to get a party started. There's a pervading sense that he's reacting to the lack of vitality in homemade music, especially homemade electronica. Chains' self-titled EP is partially a call to arms against a genre few people take seriously in the first place, the only genre that could support Gold Chains and the sheer kitsch value of a single like ""I Come From San Francisco"". His record is polemically opposed to the self-indulgent introspection of indie hip-hop and bedroom electronica; as in rap's origins, the backing music is drawn from a relevant, immediate genre, positioning the emcee as a social critic. In his book An Emotional Memoir of Martha Quinn, Alan Licht suggests the main problem with the last decade of music is a lack of competition. He succinctly asks, ""Who does Belle and Sebastian want to be better than?"" While there's an immediate value to music that gets a room of people excited, dancing or at least interacting with each other, Gold Chains doesn't have any competition: he's one of scant few successful hip-hop artists informed by artsy, suburban backgrounds and predominantly white electronica. Sans any real enemies, his playful fantasy of inter-genre conflict is, for its brazenness and a few comedic highlights, ultimately impertinent.","Gold Chains' first EP, just reissued by PIAS, contains nearly thirty minutes of electronic hip-hop in lagging, five minute tracks ...

Introspection,Windy & Carl,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa46ea9e61561daa5b85/1:1/w_160/d60d9132.gif,2003-01-20 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8697-introspection/,Blue Flea,"I had a good jump on Windy & Carl's full-length output, but during a recent visit to their website, I was amazed to see how many stray compilations and single tracks I'd never heard. As record shop owners (someday I'll make a pilgrimage to Dearborn, Michigan's Stormy Records) and diehard fans of independent music, it's no surprise to find Windy & Carl drawn to lovingly packaged limited editions; the duo have never shied from sending a lone piece of music to a friendly-- if isolated-- home on a fellow fanatic's compilation. With their steady production rate over the last ten years, they've amassed a significant catalog of odds-and-ends, many of which are collected for this three-disc set. The first disc is subtitled ""Singles and EPs"". Now, I have the split seven-inch they did with the Silver Apples, but the idea of Windy & Carl putting out singles has always struck me as a little odd; my favorite album of theirs is still the deep, dense Antarctica, which has only three tracks and runs 40 minutes. Windy & Carl's drones take a while to get going; you need to spend enough time inside their sound to become immersed, and for a moment forget any other sounds ever existed. Accordingly, the singles material on the first disc, which also happens to be of an earlier vintage, is to my ears the weakest of the three. Windy & Carl deserve the best possible fidelity, and the older, home-recorded material is understandably a bit crude. Occasionally these limitations are an advantage, as on the odd ""Christmas Song"" (not the Mel Torme number), where gurgling feedback takes on an even warmer cast with lo-fi distortion, but in other places, the sound gets a big murky, and vague. The best part about disc one is its variety: perhaps in an effort to honor the tradition of the format, the singles tend to have more song-oriented structures, with lots of strummed guitars, and not so much in the way of drone. ""Watersong"" and ""Dragonfly""-- released as the duo's first seven-inch in 1993-- are two dark tracks with vocals possessed of a little Galaxie 500 innocence, sounding almost like Movietone. Despite the voice being so up front, both are a bit light on melody. Things pick up considerably on disc two, subtitled ""Compilations"". Most of these songs date from 1996 and 1997, when Windy & Carl hit their stride, and developed an understanding of their strengths. The processed feedback in ""Beyond Asleep"", which begins the second disc, suggest that Windy & Carl learned great lessons from Fripp & Eno, and transformed that knowledge to create something even more placid and inviting. The lovely ""Marble Dream"" shows how adept they became at inserting vocal tracks since their awkward beginnings; Windy's singing is miles better than that first single, and they've found the right technique for mixing it with Carl's shimmering drones. Two live tracks-- ""Live at Go Sound"" and ""Live Song from Transmissions""-- offer an interesting portrait of the noisier, more unsettling corner of Windy & Carl's world. Disc three (""Live + Unreleased"") is just as good; though one would imagine their layered, careful music to be a studio proposition, Windy & Carl pull it off quite well live, managing to fill all that space with just a couple of guitars and effects pedals. Disc three also has live versions of tracks from Depths back to back (""Undercurrent"" and ""Set Adrift""), which made me remember what a great record that is. The simplicity of ""Set Adrift"" in particular is stunning: hearing it performed in the studio at WDET, I notice for the first time that it's little more than a duet between an acoustic and electric guitar, but such complex feelings are contained in its simply plucked, two-chord riff. As a compilation, Introspection is naturally Windy & Carl's most varied release, in terms of both style and quality. Listening to it, I realized I still think of these two as an album band-- particularly as they've taken a turn toward thematically uniform material like Depths and Consciousness-- but Introspection recollects key chapters of the band's very compelling story, and at just $20 for three discs and detailed, track-by-track liner notes, you can't miss.","I had a good jump on Windy & Carl's full-length output, but during a recent visit to their website, I ...

Mount Eerie,The Microphones,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c45cea9e61561daa8125/1:1/w_160/a18dd5e4.jpg,2003-01-20 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5267-mount-eerie/,K,"Growing up in the shadow of Mt. Erie, the lone peak stretching above Phil Elvrum's hometown of Fidalgo Island, Washington, it was probably easy to imagine it as the highest point in the world, the place where Earth met sky. Mt. Erie is a mere 1,448 ft. at its peak, barely a foothill to Everest, and yet to a child, its summit is stupefying. But in the end, the weight of years pierces the exaggerated perception of youth; there's often a cruel disparity between the remnants of distorted childhood imagery and the onset of adulthood. I don't know what, if anything, a young Elvrum might have imagined in Erie's wilderness, but I'm guessing those memories cast a long shadow. After his three prior Microphones releases turned out, quite subconsciously, to be about Air, Water, and Fire-- respectively and chronologically-- Mount Eerie is, in Elvrum's words, an album ""more consciously about mountains and earth, though it turned out to be more about space."" Its nominal peak is naturally at its heart, but only as a caricature plucked from the mind of an over-imaginative young poet, twisted and ominously stretching upward as a bridge to the heavens. Above and below, the album's drama is unveiled as a five-act play in words and music, profound and surreal, made all the more so with its awesome, childlike simplicity. It's a grim myth of revelation, death, and rebirth, but written in crayon, ensuring with its bright colors that all will work out in the end. Each track serves as a piece in Mount Eerie's continuous, linear story, and many of Elvrum's friends assume roles as the primary cast of characters: Kyle Field (of Little Wings) is Death; Karl Blau represents the birds that pick apart Elvrum's body, and K founder Calvin Johnson gives voice to The Universe itself. Mirah Zeitlyn, Khaela Maricich, Adam Forkner, and Anna Oxygen also make appearances. It's ambitious to say the least, but the contributors are up to the task, executing these whimsically bizarre roles with remarkable sincerity. Music is too often described as ""cinematic,"" but Mount Eerie evokes that exact quality; it's almost possible to envision the sets-- a handcrafted, celestial night sky, a sparse, faux-knoll for Eerie's grassy zenith-- and though crude, they're careful and cared for. The stark sincerity of the performance lends it all a gorgeous, unrefined artistry. The story begins with ""The Sun"", where the influence of classical form on this album is immediately apparent; beyond the traditional five-act arc, the music is allegorical. Like Verdi attempting to summon spring with a violin, Elvrum tackles things that are much, much larger than a simple tom, snare, or human voice. ""The Sun"" opens with the heart-like pulse that concluded The Glow, Pt. 2, gradually and subtly mutating to a more complex rhythm. Soon, a wash of drums fades across the channels, evoking either the rising and setting of our star, or the revolution of Earth. It builds to climax before Elvrum, in touching a capella, relates the story of his birth, whereupon he sights Death on a black ship and flees for the peak of Mt. Eerie. At 17 minutes, the track finally supernovas with a deafening drone and crash of cymbals, before the story advances. As he scales the mountainside to a delicate acoustic strum, Elvrum ""reminisces about a girl gracefully juggling [him as] a planet,"" and somewhere, distantly, she thinks of him. But as he climbs, day is fading: creepy tympani patterns call forth our timeless fear of night, and a Greek chorus gives voice to these feelings of isolation and worry. It's the voice of the cosmos, staring down at Phil, alone on the mountain peak. The hazy-sweet hum of the night sky is at once reassuring, beautiful, and disturbing, but it all gives way as he glimpses his Death approaching, and resigns himself to his fate: ""Soon a big black cloud will come/ Soon a big black cloud will come/ And press you to the ground/ The air will leave your chest/ And you'll fade from where you're found."" The clarity of his apprehension is breathtaking, voiced by those who've shaped the story up to the moment before Death arrives with its primal, percussive bloodlust. Phil dies, and carrion birds leave the peak ""empty and windy again."" After the cawing, and the hiss of wind has subsided, a second mountain reveals itself, stretching further up into ""The Universe""; what once seemed infinite and unknowable to mortal perception-- as abstract as a flat plane of light and darkness-- now deepens into a vast, definite expanse. ""But Universe, I see your face/ Looks just like mine/ And we are open wide,"" Phil sings into space, which echoes his words back to him with a ghostly chorus. A titanic bass drum bellows in the distant reaches, and after his life and death, Phil finds his resting place, at home in the arms of the Universe. I gave away the ending, but this epic is no mystery; the portents are clear from the beginning, and the listener's job is to take it all in. Excepting the heart-wrenching sight of Death in its title track, Mount Eerie never quite achieves the transcendent, lo-fi glory of The Glow, Pt. 2, but it's no less incredible a spectacle. This is a massive artistic statement from The Microphones, and though it may be cryptic-- even overwhelming at times-- it remains warm and open, thanks to the stunning intimacy that has consistently been the group's hallmark. As the truth and meaning of the universe become manifest, Mount Eerie comforts, illustrating that comprehension isn't as important as acceptance.","Growing up in the shadow of Mt.

Each One Teach One,Oneida,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9d7eb335119a49ec8a4/1:1/w_160/74d9df52.jpg,2003-01-16 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5996-each-one-teach-one/,Jagjaguwar,"Stockholm Syndrome-- that peculiar condition in which a captive grows to love and respect his captor-- is real, and if you're skeptical, you can experience it yourself with Oneida's Each One Teach One. A band with one the greatest, hokiest stage names in rock ties you up, stares you down, and works you over like Lennox Lewis pounding the heavy bag. After thirty minutes of tunneling, psychedelic 70s sludge (only the first of two discs), Oneida spits in your face, daring you to love them. Each One Teach One goes right for the throat: the numbing, rusty buzz of ""Sheets of Easter"" is one of the least enticing ways I can imagine opening a record, yet somehow, after absorbing the full impact of this 14-minute onslaught, I realized I'd enjoyed myself. It's hard to recommend a relentlessly hypnotic slab of skull-crushing repetition, but ""Sheets of Easter"" is exactly the sort of ballsy move that makes so many love and respect Oneida. Churning guitars cycle a heart-stopping riff ad nauseam, but the effect is so mesmerizing, it's hard to fault the band for stealing a quarter-hour of my life away. During ""Antibiotics"", the second and final track on disc one, Oneida sets the brain-blender from frappe to puree. It begins with a slick organ line courtesy of Fat Bobby, and seems to tout another sixteen minutes of intoxicating drone, but that catchy melody gives way, mutating in fractal order and deviating further and further from its set course. Guitars flare up, slightly off-cue, effects kick in unexpectedly, and the keyboard riff itself slithers into a different skin. From deep within the ever-changing swirl-- and just past the ten-minute mark-- an actual song emerges, but naturally, the shit hits the fan. What became solid for a moment soon collapses. There are no survivors. The first disc is startlingly entertaining, given its repetitive nature, but its only real purpose is preparation-- an overblown effort to numb the listener's senses-- as without its tirades as contrast, disc two is terribly dull. Oneida has until now thrived on full-tilt sonic pandemonium, songs like ""All Arounder"", ""Pure Light Invasion"", and the hilarious, brilliant ""Fat Bobby's Black Thumb"", but somewhere between Anthem of the Moon and their latest, their signature aural riot has dispersed. Guitarist Papa Crazy and bassist Hanoi Jane have improved considerably, but that hurts more than it helps: they seem content to reproduce the pummeling assault of disc one, yet in their increased technical assurance, they lose the primal fury of old. Disc two does hide a pair of choice cuts-- ""Black Chamber"" and ""No Label""-- which benefit from Fat Bobby's swank organ and a killer bass roll. On the downside, they're stranded at the end of an otherwise monotonous set, and neither plays to the band's frantic strength. A handful of similarly decent tracks would have eliminated the need for a first disc of will-snapping indoctrination; Each One Teach One leads with a sucker-punch, and Oneida spend the rest of the album praying the superintendent breaks things up before everyone realizes they've forgotten how to fight.","Stockholm Syndrome-- that peculiar condition in which a captive grows to love and respect his captor-- is real, and if ...

Master and Everyone,Bonnie ‚ÄúPrince‚Äù Billy,by: Brent S. Sirota,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2a39d034d5c69bf2c49/1:1/w_160/d1977526.jpg,2003-01-16 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/698-master-and-everyone/,PalaceDrag City,"In recent years, the nonsensical notion of the non-sequential album follow-up has gained a thoughtless acceptance seldom found outside totalitarianism. Most memorably, Beck's crystalline Mutations was relegated to busywork status while the distinction of follow-up to Odelay was reserved for the vastly inferior Midnite Vultures. Record industry muckety-mucks had miraculously succeeded where scientists had failed: in splitting the Beck, yielding one salaciously marketable flavor-hijacker, one dour, lovelorn folkie, and one 10-kiloton explosion of inconceivable destructive power (though the latter has yet to see the inside of a Sam Goody). But if the music industry is not bound by the ordinary laws of time and logic, then certainly neither is Pitchfork. And thus, I can state without fear of contradiction or absurdity that I have been waiting for the track that follows ""Raining in Darling""-- the final tune on Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's I See a Darkness-- since 1999. Now, even by a conservative estimate, I can count some fifty Will Oldham tracks between the conclusion of I See a Darkness and the release of Master and Everyone, without even including his collaborations with the Boxhead Ensemble, Rian Murphy, Johnny Cash or Dave Pajo. But nothing on the rare gems compilation Guarapero: Lost Blues 2; nor his experimental collaboration with Mick Turner and a book of old Rabindranath Tagore poems, Get on Jolly; nor the minimalist Ode Music soundtrack; nor his amped-up covers EP, More Revery; nor the disturbingly smooth adult-contempo album, Ease Down the Road have even come close to the sonorous danse macabre of I See a Darkness. Oldham's relentless prolificity aside, the skullfaced Darkness still awaits its true successor. Master and Everyone is probably not it. Not that Master and Everyone isn't a fine record-- it is. But like much of Oldham's recent output, it never achieves the black solemnity of I See a Darkness, or even the ramshackle eroticism of Viva Last Blues-- arguably, Oldham's best works. It's sparse without being immediate, ruminative without being particularly profound, and somewhat sadly, confessional without sounding at all redemptive. In a world where chronology serves marketing and music criticism, Master and Everyone is Oldham's follow-up to Arise, Therefore. Master and Everyone has a stark whiteness about it: bare branches and gathering dark. ""Winter comes and snow/ I can't marry you, you know,"" opens the first track, ""The Way""; even the gently swelling strings under the chorus, ""Love me the way I love you,"" hardly warm the song at all. Though seemingly intimate, Oldham still sounds like he's singing in a cavern. The song is so bleakly quiet you can hear the icicles dripping. The deadening duet, ""Ain't You Wealthy, Ain't You Wise?"", is even more withdrawn; the refrain, ""There's no pain to lament/ And no dream undreamt,"" seems to mock optimism as cruelly as the presence of female accompanist Marty Slayton mocks companionship. The sparse title track lies little more than a plaintive guitar strum beneath what amounts to a post-breakup resolution: ""I am now free/ A master and everyone/ Servant of all and servant to none."" Oddly enough, this struck me as something straight out of Martin Luther; his 1520 tract, The Freedom of Christian, reads: ""A Christian is a perfectly free master of all, subject to none. A Christian is a perfectly dutiful servant of all, subject to all."" Weird. This would be (and may indeed be) a stretch were the album not utterly suffused with a deeply confessional Christianity. To be sure, the language and imagery of religion has always been an integral part of Oldham's songwriting, but always rather ambivalently-- as repressive and hypocritical, as well as authentic and redemptive. The boy in the Palace Brothers' stunning early tune, ""Riding"", summed it up best when he retorted, ""God is what I make of him."" On Master and Everyone, however, Oldham seems to flirt with downright evangelism. In ""Maundering"", Oldham proclaims that he is ""going to find something true,"" singing, ""Evil is as evil do/ God is always showing this to you/ I'm going to glorify everything good/ And put right what is wrong as I should."" Later, over the ringing acoustic pluck of ""Lessons from What's Poor"", Oldham lapses almost into psalm: And if I hunger see that I do
Bring me water; bring me food
Fill me up with things that are true
And very good...
I take my lessons from what's poor
That's what God has put me for
Wealth is death; of that I'm sure
Farewell. But this rather grating homiletics seems to come and go (with the presence of the chirpy and no less grating Slayton). The supremely stripped down ""Even If Love"" recalls the post-Slint, Pajo-inflected angularity of Joya, opening with the wonderful lyric, ""Once again in the world of 1200 feelings/ All in electric lights/ We see what we can,"" amidst a low, snaky guitar line. Above all, the fiercely elegant ""Wolf Among Wolves"" remains Master and Everyone's incomparable highlight, fusing skeletal acoustics with deep and subtle electronic noise underfoot, and punctuated with sharp falsetto howls. ""Why can't I be loved as what I am?"" Oldham sings, ""A wolf among wolves/ And not as a man among men."" ""Wolves"" is really the only track on Master and Everyone that eschews two-dimensional desolation or ham-fisted sanctification to accomplish something truly and believably introspective. Time passes, but it's a fiction to clock the years by great albums. Master and Everyone is a solid collection of rather thin songs that never quite sound intimate; songs that meant something profound to someone-- but always, it seems, someone else. It is not a great album by any means, but it is a timely one. Unnaturally cold, and weak like January sun. Perhaps we can do what we want with chronology, but the seasons run of their own accord. And right now, like the rest of America, it is winter in Louisville.","In recent years, the nonsensical notion of the non-sequential album follow-up has gained a thoughtless acceptance seldom found outside totalitarianism ...

The War of The Bruces,Bruces,by: Brian James,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3c313d1975652138b6e/1:1/w_160/c2c5bfae.jpg,2003-01-16 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/977-the-war-of-the-bruces/,Misra,"Despite the plural name and a short list of session players, The Bruces begin and end with one Alex McManus, a seasoned veteran of the indie scene who has played with Empire State, Lambchop, Vic Chesnutt, and Bright Eyes. The War of the Bruces isn't his debut, but it might as well be: several years ago, he pressed a mere 500 copies of his first record, Hialeah Pink. He's shown ironclad reluctance to put out his own music, preferring the side of someone else's stage to his own spotlight, so it comes as a welcome surprise to his tiny coterie of fans to find that he's released an album one can own without a prerequisite pilgrimage to Atlanta's used record shops. Anyone who hears The War of the Bruces is more than likely hearing The Bruces for the first time, and it's a fine introduction. Though he dips deep into the well of American roots music for inspiration, McManus does more than simply rehash folk and blues tunes with a rock 'n' roll beat. These songs are rarely louder than Robert Johnson, and always softer than Howlin' Wolf, which is a refreshing change from the pickpockets who believe the blues can't be played or sung too hard. That said, The War of the Bruces isn't really a roots record; McManus re-envisions his source material like a less theatrical Tom Waits, replacing standard twelve-bar structures with an unpredictable-- and fascinating-- sense of drift, allowing for almost inexhaustible possibilities. Instruments don't come in at a designated times, instead floating in and out unceremoniously. In the other hand, this might come off as irritating freeform, the musings of a jam band, even while McManus' overarching ideals nudge songs forward surely as Mark Twain guided Huck and Jim down the Mississippi. Furthering this analogy, The War of the Bruces is a taut, spontaneous adventure, rather than some labored, self-conscious contrivance. Nowhere is this better represented than its final stretch, where each song flows unnoticed into the next, with ominous noise rising up to threaten the strained tranquility of a seamless suite. Even without his other accomplishments, this is exhilarating stuff, a promising younger brother of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Yet, alluring as it may be, The War of the Bruces certainly won't attain the dizzying critical popularity of Wilco's recent triumph, for a few regrettable reasons. First, McManus' voice sometimes borders on a warble, wavering too much for popular tastes. His lyrics are also spotty, and occasionally-- but very noticeably-- transpose vulgarity and sincerity. Lastly-- and this is an injustice-- the album's sparse, unstructured feel will turn off listeners who demand overt song structures. The running order raises that hurdle higher, sequencing the album's least effective experiments before its last-lap sprint to glory. Still, for those with an open mind and a modicum of patience, there's much to love about this mysterious record.","Despite the plural name and a short list of session players, The Bruces begin and end with one Alex McManus ...

Wild Why,Wobbly,by: Matthew Wellins,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa605e6ef95969321595/1:1/w_160/980b4127.jpg,2003-01-16 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8723-wild-why/,Tigerbeat6,"The practice of reassembling existing media (often popular) to create new material (often dense and experimental) has recently fallen under the catch-all name ""Plunderphonics."" Let's say, for the sake of argument, that Plunderphonics is an American art form. This is not to denigrate the incredible contributions of Canadian John Oswald, who not only coined the term, but whose music is the most lucid regarding fair-use and pop culture. Nor would I intend to belittle the French Musique Concrete innovators, who, in the beginning of the 1950s, took a critical look at both recording technology and the value of everyday sounds. The issue is that North American culture, and its popular music, is unique in its homogenization of a wide array of different cultures. Take a piece like Charles Ives' ""Central Park in the Dark"", a perfect example. Composed between 1898 and 1907, it not only borrows from the popular songs and idioms of the time, it distorts, twists, and overlaps recognizable themes. The ensuing dissonance arising from an almost lulling string ostinato comes as a shock. Ives' goal, however, was a bit nobler than merely jarring his listeners; he just wanted to convey the sounds of a specific location, and that popular music was simply in the air. John Oswald later picked up on this notion, and with a sharp ear. Then there's Carl Stalling, responsible for the soundtracks to Warner Brothers' golden age cartoons. Stalling's work was a jumble of classical themes-- often Wagner and Debussy-- showtunes, and popular standards (he favored the work of the consistently inventive Raymond Scott). Perhaps due to its delicate connection to the cartoons themselves, Stalling's work became a token example in any discussion of the connection between the visual and the aural. Composer/improviser/label-owner John Zorn has noted this plenty of times, and Stalling's influence on his approach to the interplay between genre, personal relationships and recorded music is consistently apparent in his work, with examples dating back to the late 70s. Also from the late 70s, The Residents' Third Reich and Roll is a full album of popular hits from the 60s and 70s mangled into... whatever kind of sound The Residents manage to make: Plunderphonic gurus Negativland once nicely summed The Residents' contribution to their Escape from Noise album as ""hoots and clanks."" Their intentions are clear from the start: to emphasize just how analogous fascism is to autonomous, icon-laden popular music. To arrive at this slant, The Residents-- who have yet to disclose their identities-- had to have placed an enormous amount of value on folk culture and its traditions. Folk culture somehow mutated into popular culture, which is possibly the most identifying aspect of America. Popular music as we know it has become all encompassing, not just a reaction to the aforementioned issues, but also one of them. We have self-martyring artistes retaliating against censorship, against intangible, intellectual freedoms. Even by the time Plunderphonics' John Oswald came along, content was no longer an issue; what was relevant was the fact that you couldn't escape popular culture, even if you wanted to. Sound overflows in every aspect of our lives, containing advertisement and indoctrination: invisible, inaudible, and inescapable radio waves are constantly buzzing around our heads, all waiting to be channeled. Oswald's personality isn't absent from the work, but he seems to take a degree of pleasure trying to remove his ego, by focusing so fixedly on other people's material. Wobbly, on the other hand, is attempting to put himself into the world, and watch it work around him: Wild Why is an album made up completely of hip-hop radio broadcasts. It is still, at a fundamental level, about being inundated with popular culture, but rather than feeling claustrophobic or upset by it, Wobbly embraces and aestheticizes it. Wild Why's occasional exercises in rhythm, use of accessible, modern day hip-hop delineates him from Oswald's released work to this point, but perhaps not as much from his labelmates at Illegal Art, like Girl Talk or Steev Hise, or those at Tigerbeat6, like the much-praised Kid606. Given the deconstructive history of Plunderphonics, aestheticization is a seemingly bizarre phenomenon, and Wild Why is in many ways a critical statement. Yes, it covers the strange way certain ideas and phrases saturate a musical culture with the collage of seventy or so ""yo's"" that greet the listener on the second track, but what's more striking is how Wobbly is simultaneously a product of this culture. The Tigerbeat6 website describes Wild Why as having ""the structural rigor of New Music from the academy and the sue-me bravado of labelmate Kid606."" This is pure hype; Wobbly's album strives for that personal attention, and that's something John Oswald, The Residents, and Negativland-- in the early part of their career-- went to great lengths to eschew. Perhaps copyright laws have relaxed over the past ten years, but Wobbly seems to be making a plea for the spotlight. Wobbly's a young, suburban kid, obviously keenly aware of his influences, and still insists on confronting copyright issues that, thanks to his predecessors, are already moot points. The content has clear precedent in John Oswald's work: Wild Why has some of the scope of a piece like ""Plexure"" (Oswald's dissection of the first decade of digital music), but with larger sample fragments, from a decidedly more recent gene pool. Also of note is the fact that Wobbly presents its work in a semi-accessible setting. It is rhythmic, divided into tracks that develop without complacent reliance on grating juxtapositions, and overall prove funny as shit. Aside from its function as passing entertainment, Wobbly's album lacks the strength of the more theoretical thinkers that preceded him, and it seems obvious he wants to contend with that sphere. Emphasizing American culture's unconscious repetition and recycling of ideas is no longer poignant; that practice has been thoroughly appropriated by the culture it spoofs (look at the MTV Video Music Awards). The blatant sexuality, and issues of race and violence in hip-hop music have been duly noted, from within the genre itself. Though the painstaking time and effort that went into this release are truly commendable, at a fundamental level, Wild Why only asks that quintessential American question, ""Can I be famous?"" Perhaps, as far as Tigerbeat6 goes, Wobbly just wants to be famous on the collegekid circuit, but what kind of cultural statement is that?","The practice of reassembling existing media (often popular) to create new material (often dense and experimental) has recently fallen under ...

Machine Says Yes,FC/Kahuna,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd6cc0084474cd0c2cc9/1:1/w_160/562b7985.jpg,2003-01-15 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3020-machine-says-yes/,Ministry of Sound,"Before we get into this, let me make something clear: I'm wary of revivals. Garage rock, new wave, electroclash; it all sounds suspect to me. When I hear that two major players from a scene that's but a fart on the current musical radar are setting their sights on the flatulent du jour, I approach with caution. Like Blue Pepsi and MTV's The Real World, it's all about creating the next big thing and milking that motherfucker bone dry. Many moments on the long-delayed Machine Says Yes indicate the album is a labor of love. Just listen to ""Fear of Guitars"", featuring the downed vocals of Super Furry Animal Gruff Rhys and a devastating second half, or the Mr. Oizo gangsta limp of ""Bleep Freak""; even the title track's easy hook proves there's some soul backing Kahuna brothers Daniel Ormondroyd and Jon Nowell. But for every infectious spark of danceable funk glitter, there's the rotting smell of formula. With repeated exposure, you build up an immunity to this kind of thing, and if you were alive in 1994, chances are, you've already been vaccinated. The bulk of Machine Says Yes draws heavily on the rhythms and studio techniques of FC Kahuna's big beat roots, and garnishes them vigorously with the robotic female vocals and canned electro beats of Ladytron or Peaches; it gets old faster than Wesley Willis. Their technique works on the title track, whose fat, grainy bassline is well complimented by the darker Tiga remix, but every other attempt seems to fall all over itself: the stomping Oizo ripoff ""Nothing Is Wrong"" is saddled with vocals that approximate ""Short Dick Man"", and the irrational dunce tune behind ""North Pole Transmission""-- who doesn't own Dig Your Own Hole?-- are just begging for the skip button. Kahuna's icy, lazy Portishead imitation-- the much-hyped ""Hayling"", which features Gusgus member Hafdis Huld on vocals-- hides no mystery. Beneath its surface, ""Hayling"" is tailor-made for an Ultimate Chill compilation. As empty-headed as it can be, big beat can get some asses shakin', and tracks like ""Glitterball"" and ""Microcuts"", the latter featuring filtered hats and a prickly synth line, are a lock on any party's stereo. Yet, while FC Kahuna can be catchy, they're never solid: too much calculation has gone into Machine Says Yes. The record smacks of market research, not the craven, late-night interplay that communicates real soul. The Kahunas claim some of this material has been on their hard drives since the late-90s, which, while a possible explanation for the album's jarring fluctuations in sonic clarity, fails to explicate the supernatural force that drives nice men like Daniel and John to treat music like a family-sized bandwagon stuffed with bales of cash. How many 2003 car commercials will feature FC Kahuna backbeats? Place your bets, folks.","Before we get into this, let me make something clear: I'm wary of revivals.

There's a case for the old German guard provoking the vaguely druggy, pseudo lo-fi curtain which clouds this recording, but then, any number of scenes (or drugs) could've been responsible for that. For all we know, it could've been an entirely isolated idea to obscure the small details of these tunes in analog haze, and Circle win points for their bizarre audience manipulations. The lasting effect is not one of aural namedropping, but truly out-there exploration; it's also definitely a rock album, as opposed to some acid trip with drums. Sure, things get a little out of hand in places, and Circle's sort of dank, medieval trance isn't the first thing I'd recommend to my sister, but everyone needs a scare now and then, right? Circle's first EPs (Silver, DNA, Point) were too rare-- and possibly a few years early for the post-rock boom-- to make much of a splash outside of early-90s Finland. The band began as noisy proponents of the Krautrock groove (I'd say they were more Amon D√º√ºl II than Neu!), but could as often erupt into no-wave tantrums as hard, sweeping beat sagas. Furthermore, bassist Jussi Lehtisalo's old black-magic-via-Judas Priest vocals introduced a decidedly non-Kraut sense of dread into the mix, placing Circle nearer the lineage of mystical (bordering on mythological) prog, more akin to the darkest Magma. They've refined their sound a tad over the past few years, becoming either a great post-rock band, or one of the worst metal acts going. For the most part, Circle play it cool on Raunio. Except for the chaotic drone of ""Potto"" (a possible Acid Mothers homage), the mean noise level is fairly low, and the dynamics are so extended as to hide any spikes. The most interesting moments occur during the markedly calm instances, especially on the title ""suite."" ""Raunio IV"" is the most serene of the bunch, featuring spoken word narration over a soft, humming noise-cycle, a synth chord, and the distant sound of someone flipping electrical switches (well, either that or dripping water, but the sounds are abstracted to such an extent that it's pointless to attempt a guess at what's actually happening). ""IV"" leads to the bonus track ""Raubonmix"", a tune that ups the lo-fi factor, churning out an otherworldly, dream-state stupor. The soaking wet Rhodes keyboard, which might otherwise suggest any number of hip (read: moronic) 70s soul-jazz throwbacks, lends an angelic timbre to an already light-footed trip. Some of the music here does stretch out a bit too much, though. The aforementioned ""Potto"" is truly an affront to the senses, but after a time, you become numb. Likewise, the metallic motorik of ""Lokki"" is almost thrilling-- as thrilling as oppressive trance-rock gets-- for the first six minutes, but eventually I lose track of time, and wonder why this tune couldn't have taken the same route as ""Dedofiktion"" (from 2000's Prospekt), which substituted relentless propulsion for this bland, epic goth. Excepting the sometimes-cloudy sound (which actually adds an appreciated mystique), this is a decent album for any newcomer to Circle's work. 1996's compilation of their early EPs (Kollekt) and the aforementioned Prospekt are where I'd head next, though it'll probably take some time to digest the murky stew of Raunio. Circle's popularity may never fall in line with fellow droners Tortoise, GY!BE or Mogwai-- especially since post-rock is on life-support anyway-- but freaks on the outer rim will know what's up.","The legacy of Krautrock isn't so much in the heavy, repetitive strains of\n\ ""Lokki"" or the spaced-out ambience ...

Sean-N√≥s Nua,Sin√©ad O'Connor,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b99fea9e61561daa701e/1:1/w_160/a265f45c.gif,2003-01-15 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5942-sean-nos-nua/,Vanguard,"Sinead O'Connor hit the scene as a total fucking original; I'll never forget seeing a photograph of her singing at the 1989 Grammys, clad in a sleeveless top and torn jeans, mouth open wide, six inches from the microphone, with Public Enemy's logo painted on the side of her beautiful bald head. She was singing ""Mandinka"", and the PE logo was in protest of the event's poor representation of hip-hop. When she was nominated for four awards the next year, she told the Recording Academy to shove it. In those days, Sinead was always provocative. She was all heart and no head, a poor makeup for a mass media figure, and she also happened to be out of step with a straight-laced America that hadn't quite shaken off a twelve-year Republican hangover. Her public gaffes and meltdowns during the early 90s are the stuff of legend. Fucking MC Hammer offered her money to leave the country, and she took him up on it-- this girl was practically the Eminem of her day. She's chilled out since, of course. In recent years, she's studied opera, had bit parts in films, birthed another baby, made the occasionally stupid remark in interviews, and issued some records; some I liked (the Gospel Oak EP), some I didn't (Faith and Courage). Now she returns with a record she's always wanted to make, an album of traditional Irish folk songs. I pulled out The Lion and the Cobra for the first time in a couple years after hearing Sean-N√≥s Nua, and it's amazing how much O'Connor's presence has changed. The character of her voice is pretty much the same, but her approach to the songs couldn't be more different. The Lion and the Cobra is, in my opinion, among the better debuts of the last 15 years, and definitely one of the most confident. On Sean-N√≥s Nua, in contrast, O'Connor sounds very relaxed, and ultimately humbled by the ancient material. She resists the temptation to use her vocal tics and affectations; for the most part, she sings the words with a straightforward clarity and reverence. As a listener living in America, in this post-Riverdance world, I feel a bit handicapped by the production choices on Sean-N√≥s Nua. Overly lush Celtic music turns up in all sorts of unwelcome places these days, and the distinct sounds of its tradition-- the pennywhistles, fiddles, and accordions-- are all over Sean-N√≥s Nua, presented in pretty much the same pedestrian way I usually encounter them. Occasionally, I can get past it: ""Peggy Gordon"", mostly just voice and acoustic guitar, is absolutely gorgeous, and Sinead's delivery of ""Lord Franklin"" is almost as pretty. ""√ìr√≥ S√© Do Bheatha 'Bhaile"", a protest song with a reggae lilt (which happens to be the only song here I know well), is handled expertly. But as much as I hate to admit it, it's odd hearing Sinead singing songs that seem removed from her direct experience. When Shane McGowan sings an Irish ballad about struggle, it's easy for me to get lost in the theatricality of his presentation-- perhaps because his grizzled voice has such strong everyman connotations-- but Sinead is always Sinead; despite her considerable vocal talents, she was born to sing her own words.","Sinead O'Connor hit the scene as a total fucking original; I'll never forget\n\ seeing a photograph of ...

S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D.,Out Hud,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba18eb335119a49ec94f/1:1/w_160/87eed9f1.jpg,2003-01-15 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6059-street-dad/,Kranky,"Language is for suckers, but due to the limitations of the human mind's other cognitive communicative skills, we're stuck with it for the foreseeable future. We valiantly try to communicate and create shared understanding, to define and relate, to create certainty in the world around us, all through the use of language, but in the end, if my idea of chair isn't exactly the same as your idea of a chair (which it's not), then what's the point? Sometimes it seems like language causes as many problems as it solves, and maybe we'd all be better off shutting up and looking for a better method. In that case, it's like my mom always said: ""If you don't have anything nice to say, release a staggering debut CD of wordless, transportive beauty."" I never put much stock in it, but Out Hud certainly paid attention, and here comes S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D., their answer to the brain's imperfect linguistic domineering. Out Hud can express more in one elegant passage than a week's worth of Derrida, and all without saying a word. Okay, fine-- Out Hud versus the human brain? Clearly, that's going a bit far, but S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D. is similarly difficult to dissect. Although its darkly evocative compositions are filled with unspoken imagery and emotion, and each track feels like so much more than the sum of its instruments, Out Hud can't be so easily reduced to a simple genre classifier. What sets them apart is the populist edge of these heady tracks; their overtly cerebral complexity is perfectly suffused with dynamic, vibrant rhythm. Frequently, music that traffics in composition as complex as Out Hud's is so dense or rigid as to be entirely indecipherable, suited more toward turtlenecked discussion and heavy-duty beard-stroking than any sort of visceral enjoyment. Instead of simply confounding its listeners, however, Out Hud enfolds them deep within its vast sonic spaces, thanks largely to a potent assortment of industrial-strength dub beats and neo-disco laid down alternately by Tyler Pope's drum programming and actual drummer Phyllis Forbes. Out Hud's sprawling works short-circuit traditional neural pathways, wire the brain directly to the feet, and actively stimulate both. Even the most inert among you should be compelled to move when confronted with such an irresistible force. Fluid tempo changes create a true sense of drama within a few short minutes; tracks rise and fall, build and collapse. Call it a fusion of the practical and the fanciful; intellectual depth combined with instant accessibility. The effect is dizzying, but totally inviting, and before you realize it, the virulent drum patterns and percussive effects have taken their toll. The once-elusive arrangements that might have remained forever out of reach now surround you. But these guys are just getting warmed up; a tangle of tonic moods and atmospheres carries you down familiar, but implacable, rain-slicked streets. You sit in on late-night dealings and seamy, emotional back-room confessions. Long, low drones create a palpable sense of tension behind it all, and distant echoes hint at danger just out of sight, but an optimistic guitar refrain indicates that there may be light at the end of tunnel after all. Whole albums often fail to deliver music this poetic, and Out Hud manages it all in a single track, the aptly named ""The Story of the Whole Thing"". Out Hud excel at creating atmospheres, allowing the listener to read into the music, and it's this subtle ambiguity of intention that makes S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D.'s mystique so intriguing. For forty minutes, this band weaves together a mystifying array of audio noir; there's an almost imperceptible threat to the music, but time and again, it proves too compelling to turn away from. Out Hud also back up their flash with remarkable substance, setting their music apart from anything as one-dimensional as standard club offerings or moody trance cuts. In many ways, S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D. can stand toe to toe with some of the best of the IDM genre, which is no mean feat for music so heavily rooted in organic sounds. Of course, the drumming has a lot to do with that, but no more so than the band's other instrumentation. Nic Offer's bass seamlessly syncs with the beat to form a slow, soulful underpinning on these songs, and Tyler Pope wrings every manner of noise out of his six strings. In particular, the guitar theatrics are jaw-dropping; it echoes across the channels in time with the rhythm while simultaneously shattering the calm with a jangling blast of noise on ""Dad, There's a Little Phrase Called 'Too Much Information'"", as just one example of Pope's invention. Offer runs his keyboard through every possible role, from driving the melody to vicious crescendos of noise, and along with Molly Schnick's versatile cello as a percussive and melodic force, it's hard to imagine fully exploring the near-unfathomable reaches of Out Hud's tunes. After a handful of vinyl-only releases, Out Hud's first CD made me briefly reconsider the merits of the vinyl medium, if only as a means of obtaining their other works. Fortunately, there's enough material here to keep me busy with Out Hud for a long time. Of course, attempting to describe the effect with words is a little silly, but the album's strong enough that I had to try. You're better off just listening.","Language is for suckers, but due to the limitations of the human mind's other cognitive communicative skills, we're ...

Accumulation: None,Smog,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a482b1335d7bf16989a1/1:1/w_160/aec63646.jpg,2003-01-14 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7285-accumulation-none/,Drag City,"I'd bet you my syringe-shaped locket that Bill ""(Smog)"" Callahan read Camus' The Stranger at an impressionable age. Dozens of his songs begin with lines as piercingly disinterested as that book's laconic kickoff, ""Mom died today. Or maybe it was yesterday."" In aligning his leftovers for Accumulation: None, Callahan even seems to have aped the why-bother ethic of The Stranger's casually murderous hero, who fired five of six bullets, then figured there's no point in committing to the foggy notion of comprehensiveness. Why is Smog trudging into the random-comp-that-offers-one-new-song territory of Bon Jovi and U2? What the hell is the organizing principle of this collection? It stumbles all around its eleven-year trajectory like a tranquilized unicorn. Callahan's logic in assembling this disc eludes me-- even though he scrounged up four ditties (a b-side, two BBC sessions, and the aforementioned freshmaker) not included on Pitchfork News' long list of probable contenders. And even that list leaves out the acoustic demo of ""Held"", as well as Callahan's two songs released as The Sundowners. I have it on good authority that Smog concerts honor the refrain from Silver Jew David Berman's poem ""Cassette County"": ""anti-showmanship, anti-showmanship, anti-showmanship."" Not that I'd know. I'm sore about how Callahan-in-the-flesh has been running interference on me: the first time he toured the deep south, my then-squeeze and I missed out thanks to a fight straight out of one of Smog's songs, evaluating each other in terms of what we hated about our brothers and sisters. (We holed up in separate floors of the same hotel.) The second time, my wallet disappeared at a gas station, only to later resurface via a phonecall from a ""Mr. Lovelady"" who said he'd found it in the middle of some street. (He returned the wallet to me with magazine cutouts of women's faces taped over my pictures on three IDs.) So let me pretend to not be a frustrated Smog-huffer and examine Accumulation: None for what it is: a scabrous chronicle of Callahan's anhedonia that will bring any party down and which is guaranteed to unnerve those fatless freaks on the swim team. The cover art's blurry schooner behind shattered glass sets the tone, and brings to mind the bleak, horizonless sea-and-ship scene that adorns 1996's The Doctor Came at Dawn, whose ""All Your Women Things"" is akin to this comp's quasi-fetishistic duo ""Real Live Dress"" and ""Little Girl Shoes"". ""Real Live Dress"" allows for further cross-referencing, since it blends the nightmare pluck of The Doctor's ""Four Hearts in a Can"" with the dissonant backgrounds that leaven 2001's Rain on Lens and the anti-pop irony of ""Summer Song"", the B-side to the ""Sundowners"" seven-inch that's a simplistic drum-machine spoof of the booty fad-tunes that end up rocking seasonless roller-rinks. And even my advance warning cannot prepare you for how the last verse of ""Real Live Dress"" is copped from a certain knight who mixed a lot: Callahan croons, ""My Anaconda don't want none unless it's got buns, hon/ Baby got back/ I like big butts."" Accumulation: None draws from the lo-fi, teenage Smog, who sounded-- let's face it-- like a schizophrenic Lou Barlow lost in some deleted scene from Eraserhead (""Astronaut"", ""Floating"", ""Hole in the Heart""), the mid-90s Smog, nearly eclipsed by Oldham-ness (""Spanish Moss"", country-rock revisitations of 1993's ""Chosen One"" and 1994's ""I Break Horses"", featuring Oldham-accompanist Colin Gagon), and finally, the contemporary how-am-I-doing-on-time Smog, who displays a proclivity toward fragmented narratives, and whose steadily yelping guitars could be undergoing genital mutilation. ""Chosen One"" and ""I Break Horses"" are especially noteworthy, as Callahan, drenched in BBC reverb, comes the closest he has yet to belting his lyrics, which adds a layer of passion not present in the sneering, resigned originals. Though tame compared to Smog's many songs about infidelity, familial sexual tension, physical abuse, masturbation and death, ""I Break Horses"" is often cited as prime evidence of misogyny, as he won't ""feed,"" ""ride"" or ""tend to"" the beasts of burden, identified as female. ""Tonight I'm swimming to my favorite island/ And I don't want to see you swimming behind,"" he yells, as the piano and drums churn; perhaps he'll soften in his golden years, and turn that island into a prison-themed daycare center. Elsewhere, we're treated to the limp licks of the hilarious ""A Hit"", whose sludgy rhythm guitar suggests a pitch-shifted buzzsaw; Callahan expresses his fear of ending up ""a Gary Numan,"" since he'll ""never be a Bowie"" or ""an Eno."" A dark new song titled ""White Ribbon"" involves a ready-bride ""with my coat buttoned up to her throat,"" whose balcony vanishings insinuate a double-suicide, or at least murder. But it's ""Came Blue"" that rules this mopey potpourri, and yes, it's actually about an indigo orgasm. Fittingly, Callahan's backed by a lone organ as he sings-- and sweetly for a Smog song-- ""There's a hunger in my hands/ I try to rub it into your body/ But I don't believe in this."" Despite how I'd craved a box set, I'll admit that this smattering of non-album tracks works well; these twelve languishing, solitary songs are more powerful in this group context than they were on their scattershot own. The record clearly shows that Smog has come quite some distance from his scritch-scratch tape-core beginnings, but furthermore, that Bill Callahan is The Stranger. He'd give you a knuckle instead of the finger. He'd report for battle with a bent bayonet. The cops outside his house don't know if he wants a standoff or surrender. His tombstone will read, ""You Hardly Knew Me."" His favorite subject: emptyhandedness, emptyhandedness, emptyhandedness.","I'd bet you my syringe-shaped locket that Bill ""(Smog)"" Callahan read Camus' The Stranger at an impressionable age.

Out of Key Harmony,Sinking Ships,by: Brian James,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a41ec0084474cd0c0412/1:1/w_160/da09e3ba.jpg,2003-01-14 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7187-out-of-key-harmony/,Darla,"If infernal indie snobs ever create the fascist regime they seem itching for, and you find yourself death-marched through repeated listenings of Trout Mask Replica, you'll probably start fantasizing-- right around the 17th time through ""Pena""-- about the days when you were free to listen to bands like The Sinking Ships. Apres-garde though they may be, this California quartet has an assured knack for winning pop songs, performing them with all due gracefulness, as they demonstrate on this would-be contraband, Out of Key Harmony. The Sinking Ships add little to the basics of power-pop kept alive by the loving disciples of Big Star, but originality has never been a defining aspect of this genre. As Alex Chilton and Chris Bell watched prog-rock flower with jaundiced eyes, so, too, do the Ships turn away from a purportedly progressive world that tags a homophobic misogynist like Eminem the wave of the future. And why not; their wall-to-wall guitar jangle still sounds fresh and exciting, even after years of moderate-to-heavy usage. Vocalist Katie Conley (ex-Holiday Flyer) shows why great singing will never go out of style, anti-commercial diktats notwithstanding; the sonic melange centers around her, and for good reason. Though her tone may be too pure for those enraptured by sweat and strain, she has an aching, lovely voice with superb control, and loads of coy sexiness. Conley fares well among the dense textures featured here, but in two moments during ""Complicate Everything"", when the accompaniment is stripped almost entirely away, she reveals nuances that are regrettably buried on the rest of the album. Even during the record's busiest moments, she still commands much attention, sounding equally impressive at her fieriest as in gentler passages. The rest of the band-- and Out of Key Harmony as a whole-- is decent, but tend to promise more than deliver. Their first handicap is an awkward mix, which suffocates everything that should be loud, and at crucial moments. Also, Matt Levine may be a fine rhythm guitarist, but his leads lack bite, a problem only intensified by the indiscriminately glossy production. The band could use some stinging ballast to balance their sugary tendencies, the way that Robert Quine and Richard Lloyd provided counterpoint to Matthew Sweet for his best work. Failing that, they could further pursue the subdued punk leanings that pop out joyfully in ""You Can't Push Me Away"" and ""Laughable"". Like Neil Young after Harvest, The Sinking Ships could head for the ditch and make things very interesting along the way, but as it stands, the band is only breezy at their worst, and thoroughly inviting at their best.","If infernal indie snobs ever create the fascist regime they seem itching for, and you find yourself death-marched through repeated ...

The Headphone Masterpiece,Cody ChesnuTT,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5a09d034d5c69bf333e/1:1/w_160/47902cc6.jpg,2003-01-14 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1426-the-headphone-masterpiece/,Ready Set Go,"There are things I just downright hate about Cody ChesnuTT and his Headphone Masterpiece. For one, what the fuck is up with the double-capitalized T's at the end of his name? I hereby refuse to do it for the rest of the review (and if it still appears, it's all on Ott). Secondly, two discs? Nearly two hours of music? This hasn't even worked out for the best of them-- ask Billy Corgan and Jay-Z. There's actually a great album buried in here, but the key word is buried, and Cody, I have to say it, you are one misogynistic piece of shit. I get the feeling it's just a big joke to you, but I'd be lax in my liberal guilt if I didn't say something about it. Grow up. And yet, there's something about The Headphone Masterpiece I just can't help but love. Sure, the double-disc thing is complete overkill, but you've gotta respect the fucking gall it takes to dump something this overly ambitious on an unsuspecting public as your debut. Chesnutt's also stumbled upon an absolutely killer gimmick, running soul/funk/what-have-you through a GBV filter of tape hiss and fragmented arrangements. It's a recipe designed to kill with indie rockers looking to branch out, and it sure as hell slew me. With all these journalistic jumping points at play, it's clear why Chesnutt's got the hype-o-meter needle rapidly on the rise-- it was just given a significant boost by his eye-raising appearance on The Roots' cover of his own ""The Seed"". But Chesnutt is simply a damned interesting guy; one could easily imagine him stepping into the role The Streets' Mike Skinner currently holds, that of hyper-profiled basement visionary and loner suddenly thrust into the limelight. Cody even has his own ""Weak Become Heroes"", an anthemic celebration of his cultural sect called ""Serve This Royalty"", which concerns the ephemeral neo-soul genre rather than raver transcendence. Of course, Original Pirate Material has less of the self-indulgence, lack of focus, and unbridled sonic and lyrical crudity that make The Headphone Masterpiece so frustrating, yet compelling. Chesnutt wastes no time letting his listeners know what they're in for, leading with a thirty-second Rhodes and vocal snippet that's followed by a lengthy bit of simplistic drum machination under guest-star spoken word poetry that-- I'm pretty sure-- contains the phrase ""hymen gauze."" But just as you're ready to file the album under Project/Vanity, Chesnutt brings the goods: ""Upstairs in a Blowout"", a punchy two-minute slice of percussive guitar, remedial drums, and in-the-ballpark-of-on-key vocals. The track indicates Chesnutt knows what he's doing with this lack of fidelity; done slick, the song could very easily pass for a Lenny Kravitz single, but loose and hissy, it has the raw immediacy lacking in modern-day waiting-room soul. And while the superior ""realness"" of lo-fi music is a troublesome indie contention-- and I have no clue whether the four-track was chosen out of aesthetic or financial considerations-- The Headphone Masterpiece's finest moments hearken back to the sepia-toned days of Stax/Volt grittiness, when the number of tracks available for recording was a technological rather than conscious limitation. Chesnutt is no nostalgia act, thank God, but would it be wrong of me to think he's trying to link up with those simpler days, circumventing the last three decades of glossy soul crooning? Theoretically exciting stuff, sure, but that's what makes it so tragic when the rest of disc one degenerates into catastrophe. Promising beats are saddled with snippets of studio chatter rather than vocals (""Setting the System"", ""Batman v. Blackman""), embarrassingly juvenile, sexist pseudo-raps (""Bitch, I'm Broke"", ""War Between the Sexes""), and clich√©d Soul 101 romances that fail to seduce (""Can We Teach Each Other"", ""Smoke and Love""). The highlights-- Chesnutt's hypersexual egotism takes on a tone of evolutionary bravado in ""The Seed"" and the Latin folk/laser-snare contrast of ""Michelle""-- are far too occasional; the amount of filler in these twenty-three tracks far exceeds regulations. When disc two started with a great piano loop squandered beneath a five-minute conversation between Chesnutt and his cousin, I prepared myself for further exasperation, but what followed was, astonishingly, Chesnutt living up to about 90% of his potential, minus the in-jokes, offensiveness, and undercooked ideas. Were the two discs of The Headphone Masterpiece released separately, this would serve as the payoff to disc one's flawed declaration of potential. Many of the tracks benefit from reductionist arrangements, like the simple strum and short harmonica puffs of ""My Women, My Guitars"", the nearly a capella ""Somebody's Parent"", and the electric piano monologue ""5 on a Joyride"". Purified to the basics, Chesnutt shows himself both skilled in melody and capable of holding your attention with the minimum trappings, though this is due in no small part to the off-putting, lo-fi intimacy. Nowhere else on the album does Chesnutt's Tascam talent shine through like it does on ""If We Don't Disagree"", which capitalizes not on simplicity, but on that most exhilarating of lo-fi moments: when a clearly epic song pushes up against the sonic limitations of the equipment, producing an exquisite tension I'll refer to as ""Pollardism."" ""6 Seconds"" and ""Look Good in Leather"" show similar mastery and comfort with his own sound, the former inhabiting classic soul without spilling over into retro, and the latter wrapping his boasts in a funky strut that-- just barely-- makes his ego palatable. Naturally, disc two has its own dead weight, like the atmospherically dull ""Juicin' the Dark"" and the goo-goo ga-ga's of ""Daddy's Baby"". Trade ""Upstairs in a Blowout"" and ""The Seed"" for these duds, and a single-disc Headphone Masterpiece might've warranted a 9+ rating, a character profile that's as good as it is intriguing. As it stands, a surplus of uniqueness overshadows a respectable aptitude, and whether or not it announces an Exciting New Talent, The Headphone Masterpiece is an album I want to like a lot more than I actually do.","There are things I just downright hate about Cody ChesnuTT and his Headphone Masterpiece.

Muscular men donning their extravehicular spacesuits, spinning, floating, training, all to the ominous coalescence of warm, human melody and cold, amoral machine, simultaneously comforting the listener and foreshadowing the impending havoc built into its very design! This completely prosaic theme is now so thoroughly exhausted it can hardly be seen as anything but parody. For whatever reason, this hasn't stopped Casino Versus Japan from exploring the possibilities one more time. Without frills, surprises, or even any particularly enjoyable music, Whole Numbers Play the Basics barely has the capacity to exemplify the exhausted notion of ""futuristic pop music"" it posits. By the time you reach ""Summer Clip"", there's no doubt Eric Kowalski (aka Casino Versus Japan) is trying to unload the exact same song for the sixth time. What's striking-- more than the severely lacking theme-- is the monochromatic way Kowalski approaches his work. Modal Casio passages, heavy echo effects, and distorted, ham-fisted beats carry out a drudging procession of thoughtless electronic wank. The album grinds away at your patience with its insular and self-perpetuating pseudo-nostalgia, all artless calisthenics. So, obviously, lack of thematic originality and simple narrow-mindedness factor in, but I'd be doing the listener a great disservice to ignore the possibility that Casino Versus Japan is also blatantly plagiaristic. Take a listen to the much-revered Tomita's body of work, or compare Casino Versus Japan's ""Koma Sign-Off"" with the second track from Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works II, and you'll start to get the picture. It's baffling how far one can stretch such derivative notions. But what's more baffling is the fact that many people will hear this albums and enjoy it. Whole Numbers Play the Basics makes sense as background music on your college radio station, as filler for a mixtape, as the soundtrack to your iMovie; it's genrified wallpaper, as instantly recognizable as surf-rock or Sinatra, and an obvious calling card for any advertising exec seeking low-budget electronica with which to sucker his target market.","Oh, the boundless possibilities of marrying outer space themes to electronic music!

The band came into the world over a decade ago as a purely nocturnal entity, seething with the dark tension of a savage hatred between the two main songwriters, and their music reflected this harrowing, if turgid melodrama. Brett Anderson seemed to be living the sleazy rock lifestyle he sang about without ever glamorizing it: Suede's first two albums brim with violence, paranoia, sexuality and sinister energy. Then guitarist and co-songwriter Bernard Butler left the band, a couple of kids joined up to fill his shoes, and everything changed. That it took two people to replace Butler is indication of what a force he was in the band; after his departure, Suede began to sound decidedly less dangerous, and almost overbearingly glib. Suddenly, Anderson's lyrics struck not so much like those of a man living the seedy clubbing lifestyle as a man who'd read about it in Vogue. And Suede have never since returned to the shadows whence they came. I've accepted this reality. As much as I love those first two Suede records, I'm not one to begrudge a band the right to change. Besides, the band's most recent material can be infectious, if not particularly meaningful-- I've even thought lightweight singles like ""The Beautiful Ones"" and ""Electricity"" oddly pleasing at times, and found the band's last attempt at sonic broadening, 1999's Head Music, fairly promising. So you can imagine my disappointment to find that A New Morning backs away from even that. Thankfully, producer John Leckie has kept the low end from that prior album intact, avoiding a return to the tinny sound of Coming Up, which now strikes as seriously dated. The bass throb rears itself most effectively on the more charged songs, like leadoff single ""Obsessions"" and the chunky rocker ""Streetlife"". ""Obsessions"", with its harmonica refrain courtesy of new keyboardist Alex Lee, sounds curiously similar to The The circa 1993. Not that you'd ever mistake Brett Anderson for Matt Johnson. And speaking of Anderson, his voice has suffered the ravages of an entire Connecticut Valley tobacco field worth of cigarettes over the past ten years, and it's begun to show here and there. He's not exactly croaking as per Tom Waits-- not yet, anyway-- but his smooth croon of old is certainly beginning to sound more lived-in. He's still an impressive and distinctive vocalist, though, and aside from the sandpaper wear-and-tear, he's in good form for most of A New Morning. Unfortunately, he's also still a distinctive lyricist, as well, and by that I mean distinctively awful. Since Coming Up, he's struggled to widen his vocabulary beyond ""concrete,"" ""gasoline,"" and ""It's the way you ________,"" and he continues to tread water here. On ""Lonely Girls"", he skirts substantive examination of his subjects, instead opting to rattle off a series of brief anecdotes about each one's condition (sample: ""Maxine mixes alcohol with polythene and paint""). And in fact, he's actually written this song before, except then it was about men, and it was called ""The Bentswood Boys."" (This being a family website, we won't even discuss the horrors of ""Astral Girl."") It's difficult to overcome consistently lame, often meaningless lyrics-- especially with Suede's classic rock focus on singer and melody-- but they cope. Bassist Matt Osman is always good for a snappy hook and a tight countermelody, while guitarist Richard Oakes-- but a wee teen when he joined Suede eight years ago-- continues to improve, absorbing everything from 70s glam-rock to George Harrison and spinning it back with aplomb. He's also pulling out the acoustic more often these days, which helps the band to overcome the sometimes overly synthetic quality of their last two albums. Where you stand on A New Morning hinges largely on where you already stand on Suede's other recent releases. If you're strictly old-school, waiting for them to produce another Dog Man Star, don't bother, and while you're at it, stop waiting-- this band is obviously not interested in revisiting their past. If, however, you loved the bounce of Coming Up, you'll likely be pleased with this offering, and particularly if you thought Head Music was a letdown. As for me, I'm getting a bit bored with Suede's perpetual morning. Is a little darkness too much to ask?","Oh, if the sun would only set on Suede again. The band came into the world over a decade ago ...

God's Son,Nas,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3a0c0084474cd0c34f5/1:1/w_160/436b04da.jpg,2003-01-13 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5710-gods-son/,ColumbiaIll Will,"Unlike other MCs who rose to prominence in the early 90s, Nasir Jones (aka Nas) had the artistic misfortune to survive that decade. It may be a grotesque thing to say, but if Nas had fallen after releasing a slew of classic singles and his startling debut Illmatic, he'd be every bit as revered as Biggie, 2Pac, Big Pun and Big L. Instead, Nas has broken our hearts with a series of decent-to-mediocre albums that belittle both his considerable talent and the sheer brilliance of Illmatic. Between 1996 and late 2001, Nas morphed into a studio gangsta, and seemingly turned his back on the audience that initially supported him. When his now-infamous feud with Jay-Z began, Nas was nursing a faltering career and had virtually no street cred; he found himself at the mercy of an adversary with half his talent but twice his hunger. But rather than submit to a Jay-Z deathblow, Nas stepped back to the mic and began to revisit the lyrical mastery that characterized his early work. If his rivalry with Jay fueled a partial comeback on Stillmatic, God's Son amasses him even more tumultuous ammunition. Not a bad recovery for a year and a half's work. Nas has been marginalized by the hip-hop community (or has marginalized himself, depending on which magazines you buy), endured the revelation that his child's mother had an affair with Jay-Z, and most tragically, dealt with the loss of his own mother. The shadows of these ghosts can be found throughout God's Son: he mentions the affair in no less than three songs, and on the ""Last Real Nigger Alive"", details his various beefs with Wu-Tang, Biggie, and Jay. If nothing else, the track is a revealing, semi-objective look at the long-rumored beef between the Wu's Raekwon, Nas, and Biggie, which, according to Nas, involved Raekwon and Biggie stealing his slang. Nas ends the song with one last diss for Jay-Z, ""The Gift and Curse? Fuck that shit! The first shall be last... I was Scarface, Jay was Manolo."" Damn... The beauty of this album, of course, lies not in gossip, but in the emotional range and lyrical complexity Nas injects. While he does give nods to the street on the grimy ""Get Down"", reminiscent of Illmatic's ""New York State of Mind"", Nas also acknowledges that life isn't as straightforward as it once was; on the Eminem-produced ""The Cross"", Nas references his mother's death, then raps, ""And I don't need much but a Dutch, a bitch to fuck/ A six, a truck, some guns to bust/ I wish it was that simple."" The pain of loss saturates the album, manifesting in various spots as a source of strength, sorrow, and regret. It makes its presence known on the excellent ""Warrior Song"": ""Earlier this year I buried my queen in a gold casket/ Your mother's the closest thing to God that you ever have, kid/ I'm askin', what would you do at your own mom's funeral?/ Wanna pick her up out of it, this can't be real/ Tellin' my daughter grandma's gone, but I can't keep still."" The self-examination that inevitably accompanies the death of a loved one has also provoked a renewed sense of socio-political consciousness in Nas. While he's always acknowledged that there's more to life than bustin' caps and smokin' blunts, Nas pushes these themes to the forefront on much of God's Son. ""I Can"" may be one of his most commercially viable tracks to date; it jacks its melody from Beethoven's ""Fur Elise"", features a children's choir on its chorus, and in the first two verses, warns of drug abuse and the sexual exploitation of minors. It's a nice enough sentiment, but it's also one we've been inundated with ad nauseam since first grade. Still, as you're about to skip forward to the next track, Nas drops his finest example of radical black politics yet. The verse bears repeating in full: ""Before we came to this country
We were kings and queens, never porch monkeys.
It was empires in Africa called Kush,
Timbuktu, where every race came to get books,
To learn from black teachers who taught Greeks and Romans,
Asian Arabs and gave them gold, when
Gold was converted to money it all changed.
Money then became empowerment for Europeans,
The Persian military invaded,
They heard about the gold, the teachings
and everything sacred.
Africa was almost robbed naked.
Slavery was money, so they began making slave ships.
Egypt was the place that Alexander the Great went.
He wasn't shocked at the mountains with black faces
Shot up they nose to impose what basically
Still goes on today, you see?
If the truth is told, the youth can grow
They learn to survive until they gain control."" In many ways, God's Son is lyrically superior to Illmatic. Nas has created an album that is at once mournful and resilient, street-savvy and academic. As an MC, he's technically stunning. His arsenal of flows would make even Jay jealous (and likely does after ""Guns N' Roses""), and manages to be both rhythmically versatile and intellectually astute. Illmatic was an incredibly sick album-- one of the sickest ever-- and its influence still hangs over rap, but God's Son may ultimately have more emotional depth, something far too few critics give hip-hop credit for. This is the kind of album I'd have hoped that Biggie, Pac or Big L would've written had they survived. What separates Illmatic from God's Son, though, and what ultimately robs this album of a 10.0, is the lukewarm production, some throwaway lines, and a slew of disposable hooks. The musical mediocrity of ""Mastermind"" and the commercial disposability of ""Hey Nas"" could be overlooked but for the sheer garbled trash of ""Zone Out"", which kicks the rating down at least a full point. Still, in this Age of the Producer, when most critics privilege form over content, regarding vocals as little more than musical instruments and preferring the safety of nonsensical lyrics, it's important that we remember the role of the MC in hip-hop, that of the innercity griot who captures all the stories, struggles, and secret language that slip through the media's cracks; the seer, who with one ear to the pavement and the other on his heart provokes and inspires. On God's Son, Nas does all these things, effectively taking a bat to his ""one hot album every ten year average.""","Unlike other MCs who rose to prominence in the early 90s, Nasir Jones (aka Nas) had the artistic misfortune to ...

Patchwork: 1971-2002,Faust,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd6813d197565213b52a/1:1/w_160/e8b2c9a2.jpg,2003-01-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3015-patchwork-1971-2002/,Staubgold,"Just as The Faust Tapes was a massive sampler for the band's W√ºmme period, Patchwork takes bits and pieces of Faust's music and stitches together a typically disorientating program. However, rather than focus on a particular period, the CD gathers sound from Faust's entire career (1971-2002), perhaps with the intention that, if enough stuff goes in the kettle, nothing recognizable will come out. Because of the sheer oddness of most of the source music, people who've heard anything by the group will have no trouble picking out phrases and textures here and there. In fact, the idea of throwing together all these disparate snippets is familiar enough for fans (see the aforementioned Tapes), so there's more than a little potential for d√©j√† vu. Where the band excels, however, is in their ability to make even the most basic elements of rock (and their own music, whatever you want to call that) seem alien. Uwe Nettlebeck once said of Faust's music that it was supposed to sound like bootlegs, as if a passerby had tried to record all of their jams, and later faced down the daunting task of editing together all of the recorded fragments. Patchwork follows this idea, particularly in the way Hans Joachim Irmler and Staubgold head Markus Detmer have applied a messy, almost muted mix to everything: fragments from the 1990s sound as if they might have been recorded twenty years prior, and vice versa. In a way, this unifies the music, though for me, it's still difficult to pull the old songs out of their original context. Perhaps this might've been more effective as a collage/remix of unreleased material; who knows. The damning German exposition by Walter Adler, in which he curses the wasted time and money afforded Faust after their first record, opens Patchwork, but leads without pause-- and it turns out there are no pauses on this album-- into ""Stretch Over All Times"". This tune manages to fit sound from their entire lifespan into just over two minutes, though the most obvious sample comes from ""It's a Rainyday Sunshine Girl"". Similarly, ""A Seventies Event"" takes ""Krautrock"" and condenses it into a two-minute express mix. Elsewhere, ""Psalter (Slow Version)"" lives up to its title, and ""Stretch Out"" offers its classic Faust Tapes bit in what sounds like Panoramic Subway Corridor Sound. Patchwork sounds best when either the editing completely deconstructs the source, or the music itself is new. ""Ayi Ayi"" begins with an unintelligible, slowed-down vocal, gets stuck in a reverb cycle, and eventually fades out on driving motorbike distortion-- it would have fit beautifully on their first record. ""Nervous"" is an incredible, uptempo proto-punk (or retro MC5) tune, featuring a sneering monotone vocal to make Lou Reed proud, and a viscous wah-wah solo. ""Zerr:aus"" is an unreleased track from the W√ºmme sessions that's apparently Faust's version of exotic mood music, replete with wildly distorted trumpet and primal toms (of course). The downside of collections like this is in how they emphasize just how great a band used to be. Faust's releases in the 90s were intermittently great, but often unsettlingly monolithic for a band that made a practice of exposing-- and putting a little flange on-- its many-colored warts. Patchwork argues the band hasn't lost a shred of those idiosyncrasies, but still suffers in light of its classic precedents. Though that's hardly a crime, it is a little disappointing in Faust's case. In truth, most bands couldn't get away with throwing a bunch of their old stuff into a hat and remixing it, so it's to their credit that the set is, for the most part, interesting. Patchwork makes a fine appendix for those well versed in Faust lore, but newcomers will likely suffocate under its weighty premise.","Just as The Faust Tapes was a massive sampler for the band's W\xFCmme\n\ period, Patchwork takes bits ...

Purely Evil,The Rogers Sisters,by: Brian James,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a29b9d034d5c69bf2c35/1:1/w_160/9cc8f927.jpg,2003-01-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6819-purely-evil/,Troubleman Unlimited,"After enduring years of post-Nirvana malaise, it seems as if rock critics once again know what to get uniformly excited about-- the high-energy, no-frills rock spilling out of New York City. Seeing as how the press is unable to focus on more than one entity per fad, the receptacles of all that is supposedly great about the Big Apple scene is The Strokes, who have thus far produced a lone album of exciting yet hardly fulfilling music. And obscured amidst this mushroom cloud of hype is The Rogers Sisters, a Brooklyn band that has now matched The Strokes' output with their debut, Purely Evil. Media wonderment aside, the New York sound is nothing terribly new. The recycling of late-70s CBGBs has been chugging along since there was anything to recycle, which might explain the discouraging familiarity of The Rogers Sisters. Purely Evil sounds as if it should be fresh and daring, yet disappoints to the considerable degree that it settles for copping what was fresh and daring a quarter-century ago. The record plays like a warmed-over Blank Generation, an album of a type that tends to give more light than heat to its many imitators. Though they can't be faulted for their pedigree, The Rogers Sisters are certainly camping out in the canyon between good influences and good results, offering few real reasons for their record's existence. This shortcoming stems from more than just a lack of originality. Rather, the Sisters deplete the good will they build up through their meaty sound and magnificent production flourishes with a countervailing immaturity that largely overshadows whatever else they accomplish. Anyone expecting credit for decrying the easy targets The Rogers Sisters take on with their cover art (SUVs, Martha Stewart, and that king of standby punching bags, George W. Bush) should be required to take a vow of silence, at least until a Democrat reassumes the presidency. Music trumps any issues of style, of course, but in this case, the latter proves to be a faithful indicator of the former. While the Sisters thankfully avoid any smarmy anti-Dubya rants in their songs, they seem as if they're making music more for how it looks on paper than how well it slides into the ear. Their minimalist aesthetic, embodied most fully by their simplistic and recurring lyrics, just doesn't work out here. It sounds as though they were attempting to either mock the repetitiousness of pop music or push it through to some kind of minimalist trance, but they succeed at nothing so much as irritation. Lastly, no one in the band appears to be a skilled enough songwriter to consummate the teasing potential of their jagged, metallic sound. There are fine elements in Purely Evil, but no one should hold their breath waiting for them to come together.","After enduring years of post-Nirvana malaise, it seems as if rock critics once again know what to get uniformly excited ...

The Execution of All Things,Rilo Kiley,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a278b1335d7bf16984da/1:1/w_160/8efecfb6.jpg,2003-01-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6788-the-execution-of-all-things/,Saddle Creek,"It's always great to hear a band known for their so-so records suddenly make one where everything clicks. Rilo Kiley's self-titled debut was catchy and smart, but erratic; the follow-up, last year's Take Offs and Landings, came off as languid and lazily paced, with undistinguished writing. Now the L.A. quartet has recorded an album for Omaha, Nebraska's Saddle Creek-- home to Bright Eyes and The Faint, among countless others-- and it surpasses all of their earlier work: it's a dynamic album with intriguing lyrics, a country/folk shimmer, and explosive pop moments. Jenny Lewis and Blake Sennett-- singers, guitarists, and incidentally, both grown-up child actors-- front the band and write the material. They're joined by Pierre de Reeder and Jason Boesel on bass and drums, and some eclectic guest musicians (some pedal steel, but also accordion, strings, and even a little vibraphone for color). Almost all of this stuff is used tastefully on the diverse material, and though this is their most complicated production so far, it stays loose enough for sudden explosions and guitar solo outbursts. Lewis, singing lead on almost every song, is more restrained but more effective than on the earlier albums. She switches between two styles: at times she's blunt and plain-spoken, taking no shit and saying ""fuck"" a lot, which gets her compared to Liz Phair, everyone's favorite empowered indie rocker; at others, she takes on a quieter, melodic voice, marked by a bit of twang and a twinge of something doubtful-- an emotional edge that can be interpreted a dozen ways; it could hint that she doesn't believe herself, but more likely, that she doesn't think you believe her. This edge enriches her bitter lyrics and helps the ecstatic ones soar. The words here are descriptive and articulate, but gracefully rendered. Perfect images and phrases litter the verses, some of them upbeat but more of them conflicted, like the scattered confrontations in ""Paint's Peeling"". Lewis also gets autobiographical in her almost stilted poetry on ""And That's How I Choose to Remember It"", a calliope-sounding song about her parents that's been cut in three pieces and (somewhat obtrusively) slipped between the main tracks. Around these frequently bleak lyrics, Lewis and Sennett wrote catchy and energetic music, with perfect hooks and choruses that knock down the walls. ""Paint's Peeling"" and the title track have both entered ""repeat"" mode on my disc player, and the lilting strings on ""Capturing Moods"" are plain addictive. Blake Sennett's turn on the loping ""So Long"" and the anthemic ""Three Hopeful Thoughts"" are effective, as well; he isn't a striking singer or, let's face it, as charismatic as Lewis, but he's genuine enough to sell lines like, ""I hope that I drive tonight/ Into the last of the great sunrises."" You could call The Execution of All Things a feel-good album, but there's enough going on that it rarely sounds like froth. Aside from a couple of twee missteps-- like the hyper-bouncy keyboards on ""My Slumbering Heart""-- the band almost always hits the right tone: they do Americana without the alt-country cliches and cowpoke pacing, and the undercurrent of environmental concern is rich rather than blunt. So when they reach the last track, ""Spectacular Views"", they've earned a giddily big, vibrant California pop anthem, on which they completely let go and allow Lewis to take in the coast and the stars, screaming, ""It's so fucking beautiful!"" Who's gonna argue?","It's always great to hear a band known for their so-so records suddenly make one where everything clicks. Rilo ...

Legends Bleed,Marky RamoneThe Speedkings,by: Isaiah Violante,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a20513d1975652138784/1:1/w_160/e369d278.gif,2003-01-09 06:01:40,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6679-legends-bleed-with-the-speedkings/,Thirsty Ear,"Punk rock has always relied more upon aesthetic than talent. From the moment Malcom McLaren first sat down at his drawing board to draft that unstoppable cash cow, built to exploit the burgeoning disestablishmentarianism of British youth, the working class sensibility of mid-70s British and New York punks saw their image diluted by commercial interests until it was no longer recognizable. A mere 25 years later, the same insidious motives fuel the corporate world: the safety pins, tattered jean jackets, and hatred for the C of E embodied by punk poster boy Johnny Rotten have been replaced, by soulless So-Cal frat boys with Hot Topic endorsement deals and multimillion dollar recording studios. As the former street punk scenes of early 80s London and New York rested in a state of suspended animation, MTV and its minions subjugated not only the once vibrant scene, but also its singular aesthetic. Punk's innocence and misfit angst has been supplanted by phony social consciousness and political correctness; it's grown increasingly difficult to even remember-- much less appreciate-- the Herculean efforts of the genre's founding fathers, like Stiff Little Fingers, Buzzcocks, The Sex Pistols, The Clash and The Ramones. Bringing a fiery wave of three-chord rock played at breakneck speed to an audience dissatisfied with the excesses of glam rock, and recently numbed by the lingering afterburn of disco, The Ramones stand alone as the first legitimate punk rock band. Shattering the conventions and stricture of mainstream rock, The Ramones established the blueprint for minimalist street-kid rock, long before style entered the picture. To their credit, The Ramones have carried the torch for the New York Punk movement ever since its inception, remaining true to its rage and irrepressibility for as long as any of us can remember. Prior to the passing of both Joey and Dee Dee Ramone in the last two years, the band was actively touring, and boasted numerous solo projects. Unfortunately for The Ramones, maturity didn't yield adaptability, and these late-fortysomethings were clinging steadfast to the same brand of anti-culture twenty years after its initial impact. As his recent collaboration with punk revivalists The Speedkings illustrates, former drummer Marky Ramone is no exception. Hooking up with the latest project of Nick Cooper, former leader of the Buckweeds, Marky Ramone handled drumming duties on Legends Bleed, forty minutes' worth of predictable schlock-punk whose disposability is surpassed only by its irrelevance. Despite bearing the moniker Marky Ramone & The Speedkings, Ramone's efforts on this album are relegated to percussion, with guitarist/vocalist Cooper providing the songwriting and marginal creative impetus. Ramone's drumming is as solid and feverish as ever, displaying his talent for banging out pinpoint hardcore and punk tempos without rest in all 16 of the album's original tracks. While there's certainly no dearth of verve present, this album really boils down to the same tired party culture nonsense of yesteryear, preaching an eternal love of fast cars, beer, apathy, and promiscuous young girls. ""You're all I want, you're all I need/ You drive me crazy baby, I just can't breathe/ Roll the dice, spin the wheel/ Buckle up, honey, I'll show you how it feels."" So goes the haplessly antiquated Mot√∂rhead of ""Hot Rods-R-Us"", a song dealing with a young man's anthropomorphic relationship with his car. When they're not addressing culturally irrelevant hot points like carburetors and double clutches, The Speedkings explore mindless teenage ire, on tracks like ""Fuck Shit Up"", ""I Don't Care Anymore"", and ""R'n'R Asshole"", with puerile prose like, ""Oh my gawd, you really suck/ I'm gonna tear you another asshole/ Always shit out of luck,"" and, ""Time has come for some change/ Motherfuckin' scumfuck so deranged/ I don't give a shit what you think of me/ Punch your lights out, then you'll see/ I don't give a fuck, I do what I do."" Tracks like ""Sex Phone Girls"", ""Weenie Hair"", and ""Beaver on my Mind"" are so laden with obsolete male impulses and schoolyard puns, I'm virtually positive the late Joey Ramone is cringing in his grave. Legends Bleed is a benign party record, plain and simple. If you can get past the tracklist, lyric sheet, and band members' birth certificates, you'll have a blast. Anyone in search of the perfect soundtrack for a DUI or suffering from a Peter Pan complex will be delighted by this group of aging hipsters still trying to milk a dead aesthetic for all it's worth. Ironically, the gratuitous inclusion of four abysmal Ramones covers recorded live in Germany are all songs Joey & Co. recorded before Marky even joined the band. Undoubtedly, missing out on The Ramones' seminal work left Marky struggling for his own niche, but his work with The Speedkings, and his previous solo efforts (with The Intruders) echo his utter lack of interest in relevance and taste. For as much as punk rock as been bastardized and assimilated by pop culture looking to prey upon angry kids with questionable fashion sense, nonsensical parody like Legends Bleed keeps better, modern day punk mired in prehistoric stereotypes propounded by men in their early fifties.",,3.4,
Clicks & Cuts 3 / Digtal Disco,Various Artists,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a34eb1335d7bf16986d5/1:1/w_160/ee0f7113.jpg,2003-01-09 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1933-clicks-cuts-3-and-digital-disco/,Mille Plateaux,"Force Inc. Music Works is without question one of the most important and influential organizations in post-rave electronic music. This parent company, founded in the early 90s in Frankfurt, has under its umbrella labels including Force Tracks, Force Lab, Mille Plateaux and Ritornell. A staggering amount of quality electronic music has been released under these imprints, from the experimental and abstract to the danceable and club-friendly. If one could magically slice away the music released under the auspices of Force Inc., the current electronic music scene would be impossible to recognize. In line with European intellectual trends, Force Inc. has never shied away from engagement on a theoretical level. Not content to merely document happenings, Force Inc., particularly with Mille Plateaux, has consistently sought to shape the discourse on electronic music directly, by collecting and presenting compilations that seek to define cultural trends, and offering accompanying booklets with manifestos dense with post-structuralist theory, particularly the ideas of Gilles Deluze (the label took its name from a book he wrote with Felix Guattari). Mille Plateaux's Clicks & Cuts series, which first appeared in 2000, has been particularly successful in this respect, essentially defining the aggregation of electronic music created from material usually discarded as error, the now-ubiquitous ""glitch."" Meanwhile, over on Force Tracks, an influential compilation from 2001 showed another movement afoot. Hypercity, a label sampler selected and mixed by Andrew Weatherall, offered a fascinating glimpse at what had been going on in the world writer Phillip Sherburne termed ""microhouse."" Artists like Luomo and MRI had incorporated some of the techniques of the clicks & cuts producers, such as a focus on sonic detritus and the amplification of the typically microscopic details, and applied the tool set to functional, danceable house music. Though microhouse, like most electronic genres, has proven somewhat difficult to define, its profile has grown steadily (I thought it was wildly overrated, but witness the many 2002 year-end lists that included Akufen's My Way) and does not seem to have peaked. Listening to the third installment of Clicks & Cuts and Force Tracks' Digital Disco, two compilations released within a few weeks of each other late last year, it sounds like a serious convergence is underway beneath the Force Inc. Music Works tent, and it's happening much further down the pop end of the spectrum. Clicks & Cuts 3 is by far the most accessible and groove-oriented of the three collections so far (though it should be said that this series has always had beat-friendly leanings), and Digital Disco, true to its title, discards the conceptual baggage entirely in favor of a relentlessly listenable dance party that, at points, would be at home on Billboard's Hot 100. It's telling that several artists appear on both compilations, and the selected tracks are both in line with the artist's styles. The venerable Luomo, who has appeared on Clicks & Cuts compilations past under his old IDM guise Vladislav Delay, offers ""Melt"" to Clicks & Cuts 3 and ""The Present Lover"" to Digital Disco. Both tracks incorporate his signature blend of warm synths, sensuous drum programming, and cut-up vocals. ""Melt"" is a bit more jerky and less house than ""The Present Lover"" and contains heavier vocal processing, but both are pure Luomo. Berlin's MRI gives the gothic electro ""Painkiller"" to Clicks & Cuts and kicks off Digital Disco with the buoyant and clubby ""Disco Discovery"", two more vocal tracks that let the experimental take a backseat to pop. Throughout Digital Disco, in fact, just about everything takes a backseat to pop thrills. Virtually every track features vocals, and most are delivered straight. This is the sound of the Force Inc. Music Works empire dancing around a textbook-fueled bonfire. I can't say exactly what inspired Sylk 130 to record a sleek, polished cover of Nu Shooz' 80s dance pop classic ""I Can't Wait"", but it sure doesn't sound like a cultural critique. Whatever the motive, it's bound to trigger nostalgia in every child of the 80s and send the throng down to the dance floor. Even more sugary is Astrobal's ""Magic Lady (1040 Mix)"", which blends squelchy electro sequencing, swooping strings and the best chorus hook I've heard in some time into a slice of late disco heaven that conjures that loving spirit of the Paradise Garage. Other highlights on Digital Disco include Metro Area's ""Miura"", which has been making the compilation rounds, Swayzak's ""Husky Bitch"", which has a hypnotic low-end riff, and Herbert's ""Stop Like This"" mix of Akufen's ""Deck the House"", which improves on the original in my opinion by more skillfully manipulating the vocal samples (although it does lose a touch in groove). Next to the unabashedly joyful Digital Disco set, Clicks & Cuts seems a bit muddled. While it's true that this is the most accessible set in the Clicks & Cuts series, many of the tracks seem to want to have their theoretical cake and eat it, too. There's some weird no-man's land that drifts into view here and there, where dance beats are given a half-hearted nod but other conventions of pop music are avoided. One gets that sense that Clicks & Cuts sought to gather tracks that could be viewed in the experimental Mille Plateaux tradition while hinting towards the world of song structure, but the result is none too special. I think snd typifies this dual approach, where the experimental meets the pop and the balance seems a little off. Their ""Palo Alto"", which leads off the compilation's first disc, is very much in line with their 2002 release Tender Love, in that it isolates the two-step beat in an arid glitch environment. Elsewhere, Robin Judge's ""Rhizome"" is like a microscopic version of an R&B; slow jam with some dub overtones, but doesn't particularly reward careful listening. Frank Bretschneider's ""Risk"" incorporates some 70s funk elements but pales in comparison to something like Soul Center, which it closely resembles. Funny that the three best tracks with pronounced beats come from Digital Disco contributors. In addition to the fine Luomo and MRI tracks, Swayzak's ""Don't Quit Please"", is another good winner. This housey number only has the bare minimum of sounds, basically a few clicks and buzzes, including the essential killer bassline. In the latter part of Clicks & Cuts' second disc, Tim Hecker and Ekkehard Ehlers represent for the old-school Mille Plateaux style, with Hecker's ""Brownwedding"" wafting in from the same ominous plane as his Haunt Me, Haunt Me, Do It Again and Ehlers' ""The Bakes in the Wood"" squeezes melody out of a series of seemingly random organ chords. Records like the latest by these two and Random Inc.'s Walking in Jerusalem demonstrate that there is still a lot of life left in experimental glitch, but you won't find much of interest in this vein on this Clicks & Cuts compilation. One senses that this third volume finds the series at a crossroads and unsure where to go next, though personally, I expect we'll hear plenty of fascinating music in Mille Plateaux's future. And from the evidence here, Force Tracks will continue to hum along on the strength of that endless house beat.",,7.2,
Jun Ray Song Chang,Asa-Chang & Junray,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a114ea9e61561daa46f4/1:1/w_160/05644ab3.jpg,2003-01-08 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/307-jun-ray-song-chang/,Leaf,"Melody, harmony and rhythm: at one point, these were three very different (and equally necessary) elements needed to construct music. In the Western World, you'd have to go back a ways to outrun this holy trinity, and even then-- when Chant and minstrels were all the rage-- it was only harmony that lacked the sophistication to warrant equal billing on the musical marquee. Several centuries later, the tables appear to have tilted slightly, as melody and rhythm conspire to overthrow harmony. Some might say we're experiencing a musical revolution. And we are, sort of. Truthfully, the marriage of rhythm and melody is an illusion: every melody features rhythm anyway, and always has. In the last 50 years or so, however, music with those ""crazy"" rhythms has been wreaking havoc on our youth in a way no motet or chanson ever did. I could even show all my cards here, and just jump into hip-hop, where melody and rhythm have been in cahoots so long that, from a distance, it's hard to tell which is even running the show. It's not that either one of these elements is more dominant than the other, but that in the age of beats, riffs and rhymes, it's often unclear what role a particular element is playing. Confused? Asa-Chang (originally Koichi Asakura) & Junray (Japanese for ""pilgrimage"") cut my muddy thesis to the chase: their ""Hana"" features a clear, hopelessly melancholy string arrangement-- very much like what Bj√∂rk should have been opting for over Hollywood orchestras-- but the most distinctive part of the song is its drastically straightforward marriage of melody and rhythm. Asa-Chang's Indonesian bongo (which sounds remarkably like an Indian tabla) plays in unison to a male/female duet, effectively destroying any expectation for ""groove"", yet forming what would be an off-kilter ballad into a futuristic, exotic percussion piece, thanks especially to the band's secret weapons: soft, ascending sine tones. Although technically speaking, all the old building blocks are intact, the harmony is in tune with nothing, the melody has no notes, and the rhythm is present in name only, happy to exist as a melody-by-proxy. Asa-Chang & Junray have been performing since 1998, and Jun Ray Song Chang is their first release outside of Japan. It's a compilation of their first two Japanese releases, and is fortunately interesting on more than just technical grounds. The sounds here are unexpectedly diverse (with a band featuring only two percussionists and a programmer, that's a major feat), especially given that each song appears to have been an exercise in making due with only the barest necessities. As mentioned, the melodies tend to be married to the percussion, and while the ""Junreitronics"" (their very own processing device) apply a small amount of electronic fuckery to the mix, most of this stuff sounds like a natural hybrid of exotic percussion and faux-trad jungle folk, by way of Jakarta, India and Japan. Their sound isn't easily pigeonholed. Junray makes use of member U-Zhaan's Calcutta tabla studies on ""Nigatsu"", as again, melody and rhythm are mirror images of each other. The opening song-speak soliloquy by Asa-Chang is actually accompanied by a distant rainstorm, and the simple, looped guitar figure acts more as a rhythmic base than as a harmonic center. Asa-Chang runs through several variations on a single rhythm, and when the tabla enters, the entire piece is transformed into a treatise on the roles of rhythm in modern popular music. Yet, in a way, like much of the music on this CD, the arrangements are so sparse that it seems barely there at all. ""Kutsu #2"" features only a light electronic tapping and simple clarinet duo over its one-minute duration, while the comparatively epic ""Jippun"" offers little more to flesh out its subliminally addictive strains. This song cuts flute lines, rising sine waves, jumpy synth beeps and rapid-fire tabla to simulate a minimalist, thoroughly modern raga. But Asa-Chang & Junray's way of casting ancient instruments in new lights is probably the coolest thing about their music. Where something like ""Jippun"" or the Chinese festival music of ""Goo-Gung-Gung"" (apparently, titles get the same minimal treatment) might sound academic-- or worse, smugly conservative-- coming from some Society of Indigenous Music Preservation, here they sound as vital as any modern electronic music, and in many cases, more so. Some of this is indeed due to the way they play with the basic elements in their music, though ultimately, rhythm is at the heart of everything on the album. Beyond theoretical questions, Jun Ray Song Chang poses more pressing ones: if creating new electronic music can sound this fun, why doesn't everyone do it?","Melody, harmony and rhythm: at one point, these were three very different (and equally necessary) elements\n\ needed to construct ...

Machine EP,Yeah Yeah Yeahs,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab0e5e6ef959693216ba/1:1/w_160/d8211cff.jpg,2003-01-08 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8887-machine-ep/,Touch and Go,"I challenged myself to write this review in the time it took to play through this latest offering from the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, but all I could come up with was this little haiku: Nothing like first disc
Awful sound offends the ear
Seven crap minutes Allow me, for a moment, to speak candidly about economics, from one consumer to another. Seven minutes is not a lot of music, and the suggested retail price of this EP, with tax, is about seven dollars. I can brush my teeth for more than seven minutes, and I don't even get paid for that. Granted, a price tag may be no reason to pan a disc-- especially with technology being what it is nowadays-- but it's sure as hell a reason not to buy one, and so I caution you, gentle readers, pay not for this album. From an economics perspective, it's trash. But before you YYY's fans put on your letter-writing hats and cry, ""Capitalism made me do it!"", know this: Machine disappoints on an almost unprecedented number of levels, and its unfortunate length is the least of its problems. On Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Karen O and her bad boys from Brooklyn combined just a guitar, drums, and a few teasy-sleazy pouts to create a sprawling, stomping, hook-spewing monster. It was a mixed bag overall, but one that yielded a few kernels of decency and left many, myself included, anxious for more. As a follow-up, however, Machine seems designed to wrong all rights; there's barely a whiff of the old swagger, Nick Zinner's once-massive guitar hooks are nearly inaudible, and ""Art Star"" alone has more songwriting creativity in its middle finger than all of these tracks put together. In fact, when you take into account the abysmal production, overexposed vocals, and everything else that takes this EP one giant step backward from the promise of this band's debut, it's for the best that it ends quickly. Between Zinner and convicted drum abuser Brian Chase lies a potential guitar/rhythm interplay mighty enough to take on Godzilla, pay off the national debt, and cure a little cancer, all at once. The proof of this lies in the YYY's soul-demolishing live assault, which, to a certain extent, was reproduced on the debut; Machine's production buries them squarely at the bottom of the Grand Fucking Canyon. Aside from the crack-like, nu-surf refrain showcased on the opener and some stellar percussion on ""Graveyard"", these two are almost nowhere to be found. Under no circumstances should a sound so colossal have to struggle to be heard. And it might not even be so difficult to pluck them out of the mix were Karen O not apparently singing through a megaphone for most of the EP. To its credit, the title track manages to miraculously downplay these baffling production decisions, salvaging what little is left of this EP's silver lining, but that's the best I can say about it. A racing drone explodes into a chorus that speaks oddly of longing and malaise, and then picks up the pieces and starts again with redoubled effort. The pattern repeats as necessary. ""Machine"" (as in ""sex machine""-- wink wink, nudge nudge) is a slightly obtuse swipe at some of the YYY's forced sexual tension, but at least it's decent fun. The secret shame, however, is that it sounds a little predictable from them at this point, and when your band hasn't even released ten songs, that's cause for concern. Unfortunately, neither of the other two cuts even fares that well. ""Graveyard"" sounds as messy and incomplete as a two-minute garage improv on broken instruments, minus any sort of spontaneity or real energy, and Karen O's voice is soaked with enough piercing reverb to lance white-hot needles of pain through your cochlea. And then, as quickly as it began, the disc closes out with ""Pin (Remix)"", a track which has the distinction of being the most interesting YYY's song I've heard yet-- and not in a good way. The spacy, almost hypnotic drive of this song, which has been a live staple for a while now (obviously in unremixed form) is here reduced to little more than a low-volume hum-- so low as to be almost totally inaudible compared to the rest of the album. If everything didn't end up echoing into a single, gooey mass, it might work as a drone experiment, but it still proves to be obvious filler. The YYY's have the essential elements of a fine rock outfit lying around their apartment, somewhere, but those elements are clearly not seeing much use lately, if this EP is any indication. Its anemic attempts at bluster wouldn't last ten seconds against anything off the debut. What I'm saying is, there are limitless ways to blow seven dollars, but none could be more wasteful than buying this EP. It's a fucking joke.","I challenged myself to write this review in the time it took to play through this latest offering from the ...

Sacred System: Book of Exit: Dub Chamber 4,Bill Laswell,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcb1abf31b7dc7155d9d/1:1/w_160/d4e22b54.jpg,2003-01-08 06:00:01,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4697-sacred-system-book-of-exit-dub-chamber-4/,ROIR,"It's difficult to think of a musician more prolific than Bill Laswell. Every year, this guy's name comes on the spine of three to seven albums, not to mention being buried in the credits of probably a dozen more. His brilliance isn't really up for debate-- the sheer consistency of his releases guarantees that-- but after a while, consistency can get a bit numbing. Laswell is excellent at what he does, but truly definitive statements, like the amazing Invisible Design, are rare in his catalogue; his best work is spread out over too many discs to count, instead of being concentrated in one place. This is where Laswell's latest project, the preposterously named Sacred System: Book of Exit; Dub Chamber 4, comes in. Over the years, Laswell has released a veritable pantsload of dub-themed releases, and this new one follows in the much the same vein: deep bass, slow tempos, cavernous echo, and a nebulous sense of composition. As dub releases goes, it's fairly minimal; while there aren't piles of freaky samples-- in fact, there's really no clutter at all to speak of-- it's nothing Laswell hasn't explored many times before. The album's six tracks are split evenly between Laswell-composed tests of a dub autopilot machine he's apparently been working on, and three songs he wrote with Ethiopian singer Ejigayehu ""GiGi"" Shibabaw. While Laswell's chilled-out dub instrumentals aren't bad by any means, they don't hold a candle to the vocal tracks; I'm not sure what language GiGi is singing in when she leaves English behind (Ethiopia has six major languages-- the principle being Amharic-- and several more minor ones), but in the context of the music, it's beside the point, as her mellifluous delivery is ultimately what cuts through the dubby haze. Beyond GiGi herself, there's a certain drive to the three tracks she sings on that seems missing from the others. Percussionists Karsh Kale and Aiyb Dieng are consummate craftsmen, but on the dub tracks they're limited to a small window, making it difficult for them to break things up with the virtuosity they're known for. They're given a freer hand on the vocal tunes, though, which invariably results in a much more palpable sense of urgency and fire. Ultimately, it's most interesting to think of what could come of a full-scale collaboration between GiGi and Laswell: as it stands, half of this album is electrifying, the other merely passable. Under usual circumstances I might recommend this, but if you don't already own Laswell's essential releases like Psychonavigation, Invisible Design, or the various and excellent records by his other projects Praxis, Tabla Beat Science, Material, and Massacre, Sacred System can easily wait. If you're reasonably well versed in Bill's oeuvre, proceed as you wish, but know what to expect: Laswell dub by-the-numbers.","It's difficult to think of a musician more prolific than Bill Laswell.

Twoism,Boards of Canada,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a32b5e6ef959693205ae/1:1/w_160/dbc2fb68.jpg,2003-01-08 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/833-twoism/,Music70Music70,"Although the religious right might have you think otherwise, their heralded Jewish Carpenter wasn't the only virgin birth in history; unusually pure progeny that grow into full-blown saviors abound in every culture. Even stranger are the myths of those that emerge into the world fully formed, sans incubation, with neither childhood nor adolescence to tether them. In Greek mythology alone there's Athena, the splitting-headache of Zeus, bursting forth as an adult clad in armor, and Aphrodite, who was curvaceously at the age of consent when she surfed in on the half-shell. Add to this list of babes the more Apollonian duo Boards of Canada, for their seemingly nascent cries and lullabies are mature as far back as the eyes and ears go, as evidenced on their seven year-old stone tablet, Twoism. Often considered the Holy Grail of IDM (and not too long ago trading for a cool grand on eBay), ownership of one of the original 100 pressed-wax Twoism EPs guaranteed entrance into the upper echelon of electronica. And now, Warp Records have brought it back for all the proles, even though it feels more like a forced disinterring brought on by cultists, demanding some of that old-time religion whether or not the idols are ready with new scripture. The numerology that's brought the glow-stick generation to dig on the Golden Ratio-- to pay attention in Geometry class-- is here. So is the Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom keyboard, which checks in on ""Sixtyniner"". Falling somewhere before ""Sixtyten"" or ""1969"", and after ""Infinite Lines of Colorful Sevens"" (from the cassette-only Play by Numbers), it can only further confuse fans trying to decode their apocalyptic sequences. The prescient, beanie-nodding beats are present, too, hammering home a surprisingly sweet subliminal message about that infinite moment, the kiss. The Boards' cassette-only sonic limitations are the most telltale sign of the times that produced Twoism. While ""Directine"" showcases the particular sense of disembodiment the duo induces, with synths floating and kicks to give it that sense of propulsion, the individual, isolated hits are distorted and fuzzy, muddying the overall effect. The formulaic gurgling on ""Iced Cooly"" is largely forgettable, evoking Gerber's mashed peas more than the childlike phantoms that arise elsewhere in their discography. As convoluted as Autechre were at the time, ""Basefree"" stands as one of the most rhythmically complex Boards tracks, with a surging bass throb that pushes and stutters through a far-off siren as slurred roars escape like gas from the pounding pistons. It has an intense hyper-beat that was scarcely touched on in Music Has the Right to Children, and which made only a slight return on Geodaddi's ""Gyroscope"". But once again, the compounds seem to mush all the frequencies together, and the details, so crisp in the near-future, are hazy. The title track is blurred, as well, taking the edge off both the strange ecstasy of the vocals and the melancholy of the hovering monosynth. As zealots attempt to piece back together the dead sea scrolls Maxima, Acid Memories and Hooper Bay, so, too, have Marcus Eoin and Michael Sandison reconfigured their own past to bestow more cohesive statements to the present. As Maxima dispersed three tracks each to Hi Scores and Music Has the Right to Children, a similar recycling occurs here: ""Seeya Later"" appeared a year later on Hi Scores, and the closer here, ""Smokes Quantity"", also closed out Music Has the Right to Children. D√©j√† vu is not necessarily a bad thing, and Twoism contains signs of refinement beyond its place as Stonehenge simplicity to underscore the Paul Lafoley complexity Boards reached by the time of Geogaddi. For those that contend the latter didn't travel far beyond the elysian fields of their major label emergence, Twoism will spur further critique, as in a sense, these thirty-six minutes show that the duo has basically been stuck in neutral since 1995. As our own Mark Richardson put it, ""If you'd perfected a sonic playground like this, you'd probably want to explore it a while longer, too,"" but perhaps at their age, Boards of Canada shouldn't be hanging around playgrounds.","Although the religious right might have you think otherwise, their heralded\n\ Jewish Carpenter wasn't the only virgin birth ...

Caught in Unknowing,From Quagmire,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be3e5e6ef95969323206/1:1/w_160/88eb9cad.gif,2003-01-07 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3217-caught-in-unknowing/,VHF,"This record requires concentration and quiet, so the musicians can creak into view, and Dorothy Geller's first couple words can fall like the year's first drops of rain. The trio From Quagmire, classified as a ""chamber"" ensemble, play a kind of Appalachian Zen that sits in a void: the familiar sounds of the violin and nylon-stringed guitar are cast in an charged atmosphere, and they tolerate so much silence that each sound bears significance. It's not unlike last year's album by Nina Nastasia in its down-home-tinged creepiness, but Caught in Unknowing is more introspective, more improvisational, and even sparer; the cross between Geller's restrained playing and her bandmates' noisy wanderings makes this a fascinating listen. Geller wrote and sings the songs, and it's her methodically plucked acoustic guitar that plays the frail backbones of the melodies: every theme is simple and deliberate, and there are echoes of Bill Frisell's Where in the World? Admittedly, her playing occasionally gets monotonous, but at best her themes are hushed and portentous. She only uses a handful of lyrics, singing them in a voice that's so small and quiet, yet the exceptional recording and spaciousness of the music allow you to train on it. But these songs are just a guidepost for the other two members of From Quagmire, who provide exotic improvisation around the melodies. James Wolf plays violin (along with Geller, he was a member of Laconic Chamber), and the third member, percussionist and this session's engineer Vincent Van Go-Gogh hails from the Washington, DC ""freakazoid ensemble"" Rake. Van Go-Gogh and Wolf both veer from quiet to sonic extremes, but always at an unchanging, drawn-out pace, sustaining each high pitch to suggest the feeling they're rubbing their hearts against a knife. The opener, ""Viennese II"", sets the stage effectively for both musicians' ""solos"": Wolf's violin has a country-gone-wrong twinge to its sawing, then erupts in buzzing lines and piercing skitters; Van Go-Gogh can attack his drums with a dry, rapid thud, like wings beating wood, but at other times he slows down with rumbles, a gong, or what sound like bowed cymbals. These solo pieces color the subtle mood swings that differentiate the songs; for example, the twelve-minute ""Victims and Second Viennese"" plays the most with the dynamics: the central bridge tightens intensely, and Geller's guitar gets a little more emphatic. A little. Geller's writing may shape the band, but it's Wolf's and Van Go-Gogh's unfailing inventiveness that make this so engaging, with none of the plodding repetition that's too common in similar chamber bands. Instead of an easy flow, it's uneasily static. From Quagmire's wandering drops away during the closer, ""Stalemate"", and though they sound like they're back where they started, within this space they've dug up a wealth of detail.","This record requires concentration and quiet, so the musicians can creak into view, and Dorothy Geller's first couple words ...

Legend of the Liquid Sword,GZA,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfde5e6ef95969323486/1:1/w_160/bfa06f0e.jpg,2003-01-07 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3619-legend-of-the-liquid-sword/,MCA,"GZA's 1995 debut, Liquid Swords, is arguably Wu-Tang's finest hour; the lyrical force GZA unleashed on that album sucked the listener through a black hole beneath the subways of NYC into a grimy hip-hop Twilight Zone inhabited by Shaolin monks, microphone magicians, and linguistic architects. While GZA was busy creating mystical spheres with his rhymes, RZA laid down his most stark, violent production to date, and the collision of these two elements laid the hip-hop world on its back, feeling like we'd been camp-fucked by a gang of freestyle samurais. Although the power of that record was enough to damper the lukewarm reception of his hit-or-miss follow-up, Beneath the Surface (think of it as his Jackie Brown), heads had few doubts that GZA was one of the most creative MCs in the game. On Legend of the Liquid Swords, RZA's warped, claustrophobic production is supplemented with a more rounded, organic sound, not unlike Jay's original Blueprint. And while GZA still builds seedy narratives with slang spills and a crunchy flow, he too seems to have peered out of hip-hop's esoteric dungeon for a clarifying breath of fresh air. The result is a record less mysterious and mercurial, a more personal and direct statement. GZA-- now well into his mid-30s and the oldest member of the Wu Clan-- seems more intent on explaining the Wu mythology than he once was in creating it; this mindset is evident on the record cover, on which he hunches over his 11 year-old son, deeply immersed in the large Wu tome. The kid even appears on the album's first track, a brief intro to ""Auto Bio."" In the first verse of ""Auto Bio"", GZA recreates the early days of the Wu, where he and cousin RZA traveled from Staten Island (aka The Shaolin Land) to the Bronx, and witnessed the birth of hip-hop. Family and Wu loyalty are still central in GZA's thematic palette, and although RZA only produces one track (the pimp-strut-inspiring ""Rough Cuts""), he lends his illustrious vocal styling to the excellent ""Fam (Members Only)"", declaring, ""If you think you can fuck with the Wu Clan, get ya nose swollen' up like Toucan [pause] Sam, and we don't give a damn."" Elsewhere, the always-sublime Ghostface drops by for ""Silent"", and Inspectah Deck trades licks with GZA on ""Sparring Minds"". Clearly, GZA has not betrayed his Wu allegiance, and the tight-nit, us-vs-them vibe adds a romantic immediacy to Legend of the Liquid Swords. GZA still has a passion for wordplay. He twists his line breaks, inserts internal rhymes, pops off harrowing imagery, and displays more control of language than an entire army of cloned John Ashberrys. On the brilliant ""Animal Kingdom"", he engages in a bit of anthropomorphism, drawing parallels between the laws of the jungle and the code of the streets. The beat is sweaty and slow, as GZA creates an overgrown ghetto where a rat squeals, a zebra ""comorflouges his bets"", and ""the scorpion sets up a sting for sly foxes"". He also reprises Grandmaster Flash's classic line, ""It's like a jungle sometimes,"" and though it's easily the most predictable move on the album, it also works. The previously circulated ""Fame"" is in much the same vein as ""Animal Kingdom"", as GZA distorts celebrities' names in order to further his narrative. ""Dempsey Russeled him down, got his jaw wide/ In an instant, Brooke Shields him from the gunfire."" And on ""Fame"", the English language is just GZA's bitch, yielding to his iron will. Legend of the Liquid Swords may lack some of the furious brutality of its '95 progenitor, but that's due mainly to its adequate, rarely astounding production. GZA lyrical skills, however, have hardly diminished: if anything he's picked up steam and served us one of the best hip-hop albums in recent memory. In 2002, the game was still with the Wu.","GZA's 1995 debut, Liquid Swords, is arguably Wu-Tang's finest hour; the lyrical force GZA unleashed on that album ...

Peddling a similar popcorn ball of early 80s new-wave influences, a similar haircut-impaired fashion statement, and a similar tendency to trip into over-overt Strokes aping, Koufax have every right to wonder why HHH is getting all the press while they've remained rather low-profile. Perhaps it's a conspiracy of label prejudice-- after all, Social Life sports the Vagrant rectangle, which likely throws it directly to the bottom of most critics' review stacks. To do so, however, would be a disservice, and this is a diehard Vagrant basher on a steadfastly Vagrant-harassing site talking here. It's clear right off that Koufax aspires to much more than the woe-folk and punk-by-numbers of the rest of the label's ranks, setting their sights instead on keyboard-centric pop with just a touch of snarl and orchestral ambition. There's still a healthy helping of self-pity in the transcript, but toned down and set atop an agreeably lush backdrop, it's not so grating. And from the opening two shots, ""Let Us Know"" and ""Break It Off"", Koufax seem to have all the right ingredients in place: crisp songwriting, charismatic swagger vocals, punchy rhythm, horn-embellished riffs. Nobody's gonna hand them any originality awards, but the quartet is confident enough to list their most obvious heroes right on the cover-- I'd already called Joe Jackson and Elvis Costello before squinting through the fine print; I'm still mystified by Eddie Money (does he have some indie-hip period pre- or post-""Two Tickets to Paradise?""). If Koufax is consistently coming out behind Hot Hot Heat on final scorecards, however, it's due to poor showings in the categories of energy and consistency. Singer Robert Suchan might have the same Dexy's timbre down, but he fails to let his voice fly completely off the hinges like consensus-splitter Steve Bays. Following suit, the band's arrangements tend to sound considerably more polite than those of their peers, perhaps due to the piano focus on the majority, or perhaps resulting from a too-strict adherence to their forefathers' work (band members in ties on cover = bad sign). Witness the synthy beginnings to songs like ""So Put On"", promising some serious arm-flail action, but settling all too quickly into a mellow, wineglass-in-hand strut. Koufax also can't quite keep up to the standards set by the album's first eight minutes, with the material taking a distinct southward turn somewhere around the Glenn Frey saxophone squawk of the title track (or maybe that's where the Eddie Money lovin' comes into play). This unfortunate 80s relic, as well as the pointless marching-band coda to ""So Long to Good Times"", is a sign that Koufax doesn't always quite have the grasp on when to throw in supra-band orchestration, too often using horns and strings as crutches to hide limp melodies. Then there's ""Saturday Alone"", with a mistaken vocal turn by croaking drummer Dave Shettler, or ""Simply Passing Time"", a quirky theme marred by some of the most uncomfortable sex lyrics I've heard in my critical career. The group pulls together for a few more standouts in the back end-- ""Bright Side"" and ""Younger Body"" are pleasant candy-shelf pop (though the latter is shameless Stroking) and ""Adultery"" brings to mind the unfairly neglected pre-Pornographers Zumpano. Too bad it's not quite enough to separate them from the 80s-mining pack, or to earn more than a condescending ""ya got potential, kids"" pat on the back from Rob Mitchum: Maker/Breaker of Careers, but it's probably enough for me to risk keeping a spine emblazoned with the Vagrant logo amongst my other CDs.","I'm thinking Koufax is more than a little bit jealous of those boys in Hot Hot Heat right about ...

Sometimes when those people die (or go crazy, or possibly hire Phil Spector to clean up their mix even though they know full well nobody is going to be able to do anything with the syrup like ""The Long and Winding Road""), record labels and estates get together to bring us What Might Have Been. Peaking a glimpse at the fake future can be very empowering, but is ultimately a bittersweet experience at best. XTC figurehead Andy Partridge fits somewhere in the middle of the dead/crazy/lazy triangle. He's still alive, so I guess that puts him closer to the hallowed crazy/lazy paradox brought to you by the Kevin Shields Center for Non-Performing Arts. Yet, Partridge is hardly that reclusive: Fuzzy Warbles is a project largely the result of XTC's strike against Virgin Records. He'd written so many tunes during XTC's downtime that the band simply couldn't fit (or even rehearse) all of them for official release. The first two volumes of his demo series contain unfinished songs from throughout XTC's career, and what a silo of mixed four-track treasure they are. As a caveat, I should mention that these will probably only appeal to the society of underground Anglophiles known as XTC fans. In a just world, Partridge's remarkable ability to form a tune might be more widely lauded, but as it stands, a collection of his demos fits most snugly in a niche market. In fact, XTC bassist Colin Moulding felt the project too risky to invest his time and money. Hence, we have (yet again) Partridge going against all commercial and political odds to bring his unborn children into the world. Luckily for him (and us), he generally outsmarts his own passive-aggressive exhibitionist tendencies via sheer songcraft. In typical Partridge fashion, the best stuff on these CDs is the most frustrating-- mostly due to the question of how XTC managed not to include so many great songs on their records over time. The forgotten A-list includes the spectacular ""Wonder Annual"" (sentimental in the best possible way, and even Partridge laments this one never being released), ""Ship Trapped in the Ice"" (a virtual one-man rewrite of Magical Mystery Tour), ""Everything"" (a powerfully emotional ballad), ""I Don't Want to Be Here"" (had it been recorded, might have been the best song on Wasp Star) and the phantasmagoric avant-slop of ""MOGO"" and ""GOOM"", both of which prove you don't have to be hyped up on balls of any kind to be out there. And yes, there are some tunes that might just as well have remained hidden. At one point, Partridge had been in the running to pen songs for Disney's James and the Giant Peach (Randy Newman ultimately got the gig). Though he'd never admit it, it's probably fortunate for Partridge that the soccer moms of America didn't get their first taste of his music via this movie, as all of his submissions fall far short of his usual standard. ""Don't Let Us Bug Ya"" (it's about bugs, hyuck) repeatedly attempts to make a song out of one lame joke, while ""Everything Will Be Alright"" may be the worst song he wrote in the 90s (""All I Dream of Is a Friend"" from the same project, though not included on these volumes, came close). The problem for Partridge is that he appears to equate appealing to the masses with dumbing down his material. And the less said about his sub-Stan Freberg reggae answering machine gag, the better. Furthermore, I would argue that these sets should've been limited to strictly unreleased compositions, omitting the demos for already familiar XTC songs. Most of these songs (""Then She Appeared"", ""Merely a Man"", ""That Wave"") don't shed much new light on the previously released versions (though The Cure, Smiths and Dylan impersonations in a rough version of ""That Wave"" are spot-on classic), and more importantly, this angle has already been covered on 2002's Coat of Many Cupboards box. When an artist starts repeating himself via leftovers, I question what the future holds. There are rumors that Partridge may expand the Fuzzy Warbles series to ten volumes (he swears he's got the backlog to fund it), and I guess that's going to mean a few more transactions for die-hard XTC fans. Hopefully, there are as many cherries in those trees as there are here-- which is to say, at least enough to justify the notion of Partridge making his drafts available while delivering an album of actual rehearsed and recorded stuff is put on the shelf much later this year. I'll play along for now (in a case of co-dependency at its worst), but will cry foul if ""Grocery List in E-minor"" ever appears on a tracklist.","Demos: fools' gold of rock, diaries of the unsigned and unprepared alike.

No P. or D.,Ms. John Soda,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3fb69fc7814a47cd79b/1:1/w_160/b50b6c23.jpg,2003-01-06 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5485-no-p-or-d/,Morr,"Like food that includes the word ""food"" in its name, anything calling itself a ""project"" sets off alarms. ""Here, try some of this genetically modified beef-- it's a little project of mine."" Alarms. ""Hey! You haven't met my new wife yet? She's downstairs... it's sort of a project I've been working on."" And the word seldom bodes well for music: Alan Parsons Project, anyone? So I was naturally taken aback at finding the self-described part-time ""pop project"" of Couch keyboardist Stefanie Bohm and Notwist bassist Micha Acher to be better than most bands' ""full-time"" work; No P. or D. greeted me with serene vocals, rich, deep melodies, and nary an alarm in earshot. The aim here is deceptively simple: a blessed union of the classic and the modern gives birth to blissful pop. Glitches and clicks lie beneath calmly plucked strings, while a lone piano quietly navigates a sea of hisses and hums; the organic and inorganic pieces flow together in crests and troughs, but the whole is never less than seamless. The concept is nothing new-- The Notwist, Lali Puna, and Dntel have also worked wonders with this dynamic-- but comparisons only obfuscate the purpose of No P. or D.. This project is no experiment; it's a fantastically accessible pop outing flaunting IDM lingerie. The joy and deception of this album lies beneath a mild, melodic veneer. Like most great pop works, No P. or D. can be enjoyed with as much or as little of the brain as desired. The thought-averse among you will be lulled into glorious insulin shock, allowing the girls' crisp, phonetic vocals and soothing tones to cascade and break over you, but the intricacy lying in wait cannot be ignored. The detail and subtlety slowly, inexorably worms its way into the mind, no matter how passively the album is approached. To dissect these melodies is not a complicated procedure, but neither is it a quick one, as each song builds slowly and deliberately, layering elements atop one another, and leisurely anti-climaxing before pausing to restructure again and again. Even as the pacing of the album varies across fairly vast emotional terrain, No P. or D. develops as though it had all the time in the world. There's a practiced, almost Taoist ease throughout-- depth without being Deep, simplicity without being Simple-- and it's hard not to walk away from the album without a sense of well-being. By way of example, ""Solid Ground"" is effortlessly grand: a slight piano refrain and angelic vocals leave no mystery as to the song's sentiment. Its heart is on its sleeve, but such immediate accessibility doesn't begin to foretell the comparative depth of the multi-layered beep sequences floating underneath. It's not by any means an intellectual overload, but again, it offers itself up to any attentive listener like a gift. Incredibly, though, ""Solid Ground"" is merely first among equals. Every track on No P. or D. reveals itself with breathtaking assuredness. For one song to be so striking is worthy of acclaim; that the majority of the album can be similarly described is a testament to its wonder in no uncertain terms.","Duo composed of Notwist bassist Micha Acher, and keyboardist Stefanie Bohm of German post-rockers Couch.

Sadisfaction,Mantler,by: Brian James,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3a1eb335119a49ed764/1:1/w_160/f45470a9.jpeg,2003-01-06 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5093-sadisfaction/,Tomlab,"With a half-century of rock and roll under our belts, we should have learned long ago that the quality of a band's name does not necessarily have a direct relation to the quality of the music they make. After all, The Beatles and The Who both banked on groan-inducing wordplay in their monikers, and they were no worse off for it. With a name like Mantler, however, it's hard not to be at least a little suspicious. Mantastic would have been funnier. Manimal could have passed for wry social commentary. But Mantler? That's just wrong. Anyone able to get past Mantler's odd sobriquet and play Sadisfaction, however, will learn anew that the skills for making good music and thinking up good names are stored in separate compartments of the human mind. Mantler (who, in real life, is just one guy, Chris Cummings) shows himself to be a deft musician, one who handles ProTools like most people handle buttering their muffins. Throughout Sadisfaction, he displays his easy mastery of electronic fireworks, and while that surely elicits nerdish appreciation from fellow laptop jockeys, what really impresses about Cummings is his sophisticated, coherent approach to composition. By juxtaposing opposing elements-- such as his defiantly tinny drum machine with some ultra-naturalistic cool jazz trumpet in ""Hoped-For Chance"", or the alternating lush and stark moments in ""You Were Free""-- Cummings develops a fascinating tension that keeps the record inflated. And since he only explores a small range of moods with despair on one extreme and resignation on the other, he gets some needed mileage out of this ambiguity. Subtle variations, though, will only go so far, and Sadisfaction proves that they don't go far enough. The album's unrelieved gloom may work well as a soundtrack to self-pity, but as an artistic statement, its impact is decidedly limited. As Beck recently reminded the world, nonstop sad records can still be redeeming and ultimately life-affirming listens, but Sadisfaction gradually slips off from the precarious perch of saturnine sensitivity into the oppressive pit of solipsism. Cummings is an excellent songwriter with a finely honed sense of when to introduce new material, but listening to this very solid chunk of his work in one sitting is far more grueling than it should be. The set of songs contained here may be a perfectly accurate representation of Cummings' inner life, and some would certainly defend such work on the basis of authenticity, but even if authenticity in art were not a meretricious obsession best relegated to far lower levels of concern, it's difficult to feel much sympathy for someone who spends forty minutes thoroughly exhausting the possibilities for expressing a brand of angst that most people have no use for after high school. If Cummings is using his personal minutiae as the sole source for his art (a likely situation, by the sound of it), then the best we can hope for in the future is that he simply cheers up.","With a half-century of rock and roll under our belts, we should have learned long ago that the quality of ...

Whip It On!,The Raveonettes,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2199d034d5c69bf2afb/1:1/w_160/5f7656fd.jpg,2003-01-06 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6697-whip-it-on/,Crunchy Frog,"Holy shit, I think my gimmick lobe just ruptured. Like the digital readout from Windows Hypemaster 7.0, The Raveonettes come to the land of the free not only as Scandinavians (they're from Denmark, which I'm pretty sure is part of Scandinavia), but as a male/female duo with an ambiguous relationship. I hear they play that rock music that ""Good Morning America"" told me is back! The record industry's PR drones were speaking in tongues when this little package landed in their stereo. To be fair, I'm sure The Raveonettes aren't a calculated amalgamation of all the currently profitable garage-rock storylines, though if they were to reveal that they're actually from Denmark, Nebraska, I wouldn't be too shocked. Authenticity or no, the fact remains that Sune Rose Wagner and Sharin Foo are practically the embodiment of SPIN's ""Return of the Rock"" issue, right down to their loose, trashy sound, detached vocals, and penchant for paint-by-numbers garage-rock titles like ""Beat City"" and ""Cops on Our Tail"". Whip It On! follows the in-vogue S.O.P. for buzz generation, a quick shot of eight songs over a brisk twenty-one minutes, infuriating space-minded burner jockeys everywhere. Wagner's guitar provides buzz of a different kind, kicking up a clanging racket to fill in all the empty spaces left by this two-piece. Like the overdrive-filled tantrums of, say, Yo La Tengo's Ira Kaplan, Wagner can play pretty much any simple, surf-inflected riff and make it sound like a choir loft of TVs tuned to static. It's the kind of guitar sound that obviously took a long time to master; certainly a lot more time than The Raveonettes appear to have spent on their songs. Here's a play-by-play window into my listening: Tracks 1-3: ""Okay, noisy garage with creepy boy/girl unison vocals, fair enough."" Track 4: ""Did I sit on the 'Repeat 1' button by accident?"" Tracks 5-8: ""Are these slight tempo changes supposed to keep me from realizing this is still the same damn song?"" Not even an eight-song mini-album can hide that The Raveonettes are no Bruce Hornsby when it comes to playing with range. ""Attack of the Ghost Riders"" has all the crunch and hard rhythm one would expect from a comic book title, and when Wagner utters ""it goes something like this"" and coaxes out a one-chord maelstrom-- notice I'm keeping it Scandinavian-real here-- it sounds like the band's really got their finger on the pulse of the G-word. ""Veronica Fever"" and ""Do You Believe Her"" keep hype hope alive, the former a quieter kind of fuzzed-out, early-90s drone, the latter a monster truck blowtorch with the unavoidable Man or Astroman? surf-beat stomp (surprisingly, supplied by a drum machine). From there, the enjoyment curve takes a steep turn downwards, starting with ""Cops on Our Tail"", which sounds exactly like ""Do You Believe Her"" played at half-speed. The rest of the album follows suit, beset by the Xeroxed nature of Wagner and Foo's not-quite-harmonious vocals; their sleepy singing sounds like it's hiding behind the amps. One starts to wonder if all the Jesus & Mary Chain comparisons flying around The Raveonettes aren't due to their J&MC-like; tendency to write the same song over and over again, as well as their ability to kick up a right good wall of white noise. Maybe it's my weak spot for Scandinavians, but I'm not ready to start praying for the humiliating failure of The Raveonettes. It's more than possible that Whip It On! is just a glorified promo-mix to start an NYC feeding frenzy, but if so, that's a goal it accomplished admirably (eh, Mr. Fricke?). While their limitations seem to preclude the chances of next year's promised full-length being much of a Powerball jackpot, interviews indicate their hearts are in the right place, promising a 60s girl-group influence that doesn't quite rise to the top on this octet of tunes. It's certainly going take a lot to shake the cynicism their back-story currently provokes; we'll have to wait and see if these Danes are up to the challenge.","Holy shit, I think my gimmick lobe just ruptured.

Make Me Hard,Tujiko Noriko,by: Matthew Wellins,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c42669fc7814a47cd7f5/1:1/w_160/49517909.gif,2003-01-05 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5834-make-me-hard/,Mego,"I remember being particularly excited to hear Tujiko Noriko when Shojo Toshi was released a year and a half ago. At first, there was a certain novelty in knowing that the somewhat unclassifiable Austrian Mego label, often responsible for a blend of heavy noise processing with a sweet undercurrent, would be introducing a wholehearted pop album. ""100% nerdy glitch-boy free,"" read the press release. Upon finally hearing the album, the novelty was completely irrelevant. Shojo Toshi seemed to shed the antisocial shield and intrinsic self-aware cynicism of our rich lineage of electronic music. A welcome contrast to tongue-in-cheek hip-hop references (obsessively aiming at a mundane form of subversion), those who think the vibraphone is the end-all and be-all of exciting music, and the token group of run-of-the-mill noisemongers. Aesthetically moving and impervious to inane musical politics, Tujiko Noriko had the potential to appeal to more than just elitist art snobs. The collage cover of Shojo Toshi, designed by Noriko's visual art team, SlideLab, explains the music better than I can. On the left side, a soldier sits atop a skyscraper, further down a businessman talks on a cellphone, and on the right, Noriko hides under a mushroom, shooting a baguette in their direction. The images are comical, inviting, and full of pathos, but perhaps what's most striking is SlideLab's restraint. A good portion of the cover is left to a monochromatic cream tint, allowing plenty of space for the drama to unfold within. Noriko's music is achingly similar, a singular, monochromatic chord progression or beat is spread over the length of each song, often pushing around six minutes, and is punctuated by masterful arrangements of sound borrowed from the surrounding world, be it a businessman on a cellphone or a tape-recorded orchestra. Make Me Hard is a refinement of these ideas. The interjections of found melodies, concrete noise, affecting sense of disparate elements matched together, and the real selling point, Noriko's extremely emotive voice, are all placed in the expansive background of repetition. Noriko seems to narrate the surreal environment of her album, and the encompassing sense of autobiography adds to the unique allure of the work. The songs seem colossal in duration, even more sonically dense than before, and yet somehow restricted in scope. There are many different textural, cultural, and personal ideas at play on Make Me Hard, and Noriko has built what seems like a much-too rigid form for their display. The songs, while often achieving breathtaking eloquence, occasionally rely too heavily on Noriko's well-explored ethereal and repetitive modes. The strengths and weaknesses of the album fit clearly into this design. If Noriko's work didn't expand small fragments of life into broad, encompassing, and passionate epics, it would lose much of its charm, yet the music, in its far-reaching and complex toggling through thousands of pieces of aural detritus, throbs for a next step. There is a sense that this album might've been better served as either an epic, single piece, with attention paid to an overall sense of unity, or shortened by about 20 minutes, tightening the ends of the songs as they stand. Yet, this in no way undermines the great strides Noriko has taken with Make Me Hard. Despite comparisons to Phew, Haco, and even Bj√∂rk, Noriko's style and personality seem without obvious precedent. Make Me Hard, while imperfect, is full of color and obsessed with the joy of observation. And, oh yeah, it's all in Japanese. Good luck.","I remember being particularly excited to hear Tujiko Noriko when Shojo Toshi was released a year\n\ and a half ...

Riot Act,Pearl Jam,by: Kyle Reiter,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a01cea9e61561daa44c5/1:1/w_160/0efe7a0d.jpg,2003-01-05 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6206-riot-act/,Epic,"Every few years or so, as Pearl Jam prepare for the grand unveiling of their latest opus, everyone gets re-inundated with PR promises of the old grunge gods breaking free from their self-imposed confines for a grand ""return to form,"" and told that, ""No, really, this time they've proven themselves as something more than a just the band that launched a thousand Candleboxes."" Yet, while Pearl Jam have outlasted virtually all of their grunge contemporaries, they've hardly ever strayed from the classicist approach that brought them into the rock world back in '91. Riot Act, their seventh and most recent album, perpetuates the notion that Pearl Jam is a tremendous rock band, despite their catalog's evidence to the contrary. Like communism, Pearl Jam is as good as it gets in theory, but it never quite seems to work out in practice: They're a hard working and talented group who use their fame to champion causes that are dear to them-- even when that means alienating fans and fighting unwinnable wars against corporate giants-- and they take full advantage of their major label status (and dollars) by circumventing traditional ways of thinking about the band/fan relationship. Through fan-club-only Christmas seven-inches and that entire tour's worth of live releases, Pearl Jam have attempted to prove that recording for the majors doesn't have to be synonymous with MTV pandering. If only their music brimmed with the creativity of their business practices. Since 1998's Yield, Pearl Jam have relied on an unchanging musical formula, consistently declining the opportunity to innovate or improve their sound, even while hinting that they could if they could be assured it wouldn't completely tank. Since the genre-defining Ten, the band has given us occasional glimpses at something more unique-- most notably on Vitalogy, a wonderful, reactionary mess of an album, and then with the diverse No Code, and even Yield's Eastern-tinged bonus track-- but mostly, they've settled for traditional rock riffs and general coasting. Riot Act sadly exemplifies this, bringing them ever closer to homogenous bar-band territory. The record peaks early on the opener ""Can't Keep"", a three-guitar gallop that immediately strikes as fresh in contrast to the band's other recent work. Eddie Vedder seldom pens a melody this original, and the song's gloomy, atmospheric production compensates for the bored musicianship. From there, however, Riot Act meanders from one song to the next with an overwhelming insipidness. The devastated lyrics of ""Love Boat Captain"", which mourns the tragic deaths of nine fans at the June 2000 Roskilde Festival, are affecting, but the song itself is a standard rocker, which seems an odd choice to accompany Vedder's poetic remorse. Riot Act does momentarily pick up as it nears its end. ""Greendisease"" is the closest to new wave Pearl Jam has ever come, and the Jeff Ament-penned ""Help Help"" passes on the simple fact that it sounds at least somewhat different from the band's archetypal rock'n'roll sound, and breaks the monotony of an otherwise barren collection of songs. Of course, what'll likely stick with you after the disc stops spinning is the unbearable lows. The mechanical, pulsating guitar arpeggios of ""You Are"" almost seem to cop from Trans-era Neil Young until you realize that it'd set a nice ambiance for a semi-truck barreling down a highway in Stallone's Over the Top. Worse still is ""Bushleaguer"", a near-rap about D.C.'s current policy makers. Vedder's intentions here are admirable, but it's difficult to imagine the execution failing any more miserably. His delivery is painfully snide, served up with snotty, ain't-I-witty attitude, and the lyrics, which clearly aim for a grittier mentality than typical Pearl Jam fare (""Swingin' for the fence/ Got lucky with a strike/ Drilling for fear makes the job simple/ Born on third, thinks he got a triple"") come off more Springsteen than Fugazi. Everywhere else on Riot Act, Pearl Jam sound like they're supposed to, with their usual distortion-powered riffs and stadium drums banging alongside Vedder's emotionally damaged mumbling. And though it's hard, even now, not to root for them, this album has sadly not upped their relistenability.","Every few years or so, as Pearl Jam prepare for the grand unveiling of their latest opus, everyone gets re-inundated ...

If your camp counselor were telling a ghost story and this guy jumped out at you at the end, there is no doubt that you would wet yourself. If you were eight. The new album from the Bay Area's Dead and Gone, The Beautician, is the first release since Baker quit and rejoined the band. While he was gone the other members formed a separate group, Creeps on Candy, and it's easy to see-- especially from their work-- that Baker is what makes this outfit, putting a face to the horrorshow mood and pulp-like lyrics. And this is pulp in the best sense of the word: the imagery is wittily imaginative, so much so that I didn't even need to be told that ""Towers on Fire"" wasn't a mockery of the Twin Towers disaster (""See the flames through the windows... And we are the walking dead""); I already guessed that they chose such gruesome lyrics just because they sound cool. In fact, the lyrics are littered with cartoonish horrors-- ""Rats as Big as Rats"" is particularly notable for the lines, ""Drinking all my liquor like a pack of politicians/ RATS RATS RATS RATS!"" The album's best track is another reflexively titled song, ""Leave the Dead to Bury the Dead"". Baker's stay in a crummy hotel room, abandoned by a girl, becomes an epic dirge. He turns the squalid imagery into a vision of hell, sinking from ""there's nothing on TV"" to ""you're allergic to your own skin/ She won't call back,"" before he hits rock bottom: ""And dust is dust/ And Christ just keeps on dying."" Depending on how you read it, this could be the best song about post-hotel-masturbation guilt ever written. All thirteen songs are solid-- so solid, in fact, that few of them stand up and make a difference, melding into a half hour of steady dirgecore. But there's enough invention on the fringes to keep the momentum (the interlude-like ""Ultimate Remote Control Toy"", for instance, has a great burst of synths) and guitarist Rockey Crane plays grinding chords and arch lines with restrained but perfect color. On tracks like ""Towers on Fire"", he bashes the ground and then slices through with a high staccato melody; when he slows down, his lines chime through the doom. The rhythm section (bassist Brian Stern and drummer Joey Perales) is reliably heavy, too. The Beautician is Dead and Gone's third album, following two that were produced by Green Day's Billie Joe Armstrong. I conveniently left that fact to the end, so that any of you who are too indie-hip to get near a Green Day-related hardcore band could give this one a fair hearing: the anti-commercial, rough-edged production, perfectly controlled mood and terrific lyrics make the music entertaining beyond the mosh pits.

But just as calling The Clash ""punk"" belittles how their sound had evolved by the movement's curtain call, it would be unfairly dismissive to brand The Libertines Clash knock-offs. You'd have to throw in a line or two about singer Pete Doherty sounding uncannily like an English Julian Casablancas to be more dismissive. British Strokes for British folks, as they say. All cards on the table, though: Up the Bracket does emulate, thanks in no small part to production care of ex-Clash founder Mick Jones, but it never truly imitates. Like The Clash before them, The Libertines draw primarily from decades of rock tradition-- blues, dub, a healthy whiff of the English countryside, and a few gorgeous rock riffs straight from the brainstem of Chuck Berry-- and fuse them into an unruly and triumphant monster of an album. The band burns through a range of emotions with fearless abandon, and just when one track seems about to split into pieces, they pull it all together only to threaten glorious collapse again on the next song. From their plaintive anthems to fuck-all barnburners, this is some of the most fun I've had with a CD in ages. Rarely does a band approach such a wide array of attitudes with equal proficiency. ""Boys in the Band"" traverses miles of territory in four short minutes; funk-fused riffs lend a dangerous swagger to Doherty's ultra-confident vocals before, curiously, the whole thing pulls a 180 into barbershop-style harmonies. It's not as crazy as it sounds, but it's twice as fun. Later, the band find themselves in the throes of a token heartfelt ballad-- even one that delivers unexpected quaintness and delicate folk sensibilities-- as old-time cymbal washes make such an obvious track better than it has any right to be. But before the glow fades, they take us right back to hook-laden rock with the title song, recalling The Clash's finest moments, complete with vocals lifted from Joe Strummer's back pocket. There's an almost indescribable wealth of rock lurking on Up the Bracket, and rarely is it less than blissfully entertaining. In just thirty-odd minutes, The Libertines pretty much do it all. Call it calculated, call it derivative-- hell, there's so much to this album, you can call it just about anything you like and probably not be too far from the truth-- but if you don't hear it, you'll be the one missing out.","And so it's come to pass: the great wheel of revivalism spins, dredging up the next phase of music ...

Blige-style vocals and happy, singalong, jam-on-the-beach melodies. Okay, that was just to fool the speed readers in the audience. Let's get down to business. A Viennese avant-garde multi-instrumentalist named Werner Dafeldecker (formerly of Polwechsel) and his associate, Klaus Lang, pick up a double bass and a pipe organ and record an album of somber, droning minimalism in an Austrian church, naming their tracks in binary code. But wait, these guys do have a sense of humor. What else could be responsible for separating these irreparable and seemingly barely altered nasalizing mediations into separate pieces? Everyone will freely admit there's barely a less pretentious way to spend your evening this side of funding an absinthe-serving caf√© bookstore dedicated to Flat-Art and Superrealism. The back of the album tells me Dafeldecker plays acoustic guitar on this, but I doubt anyone except a forensics scientist would be able to track down where that comes in. With barely any digital effects (some small radio work at the beginning), Dafeldecker and Lang have essentially gotten rid of the defining characteristics of each instrument. The entire first half is a chilling, imperceptibly moving hum, occasionally merging into a tone or two almost accidentally, as if the music an instrument makes has absolutely no relation to the instrument itself. My familiarity with the attributes of a pipe organ are rather deficient at the moment, but, purely speculating, it doesn't seem it was intended for manufacturing the glazed, frigid winds that flail throughout the session, bereft of any tone. They also seem bereft of any composition or agency on the part of the player. It's the sound of a pipe organ when no one's listening to it. Dafeldecker's bass is generally used for bizarre, phantasmal brushing and skimming that I might call percussive, though it's barely even that. The only word that can approximate it is, for better or worse, silence. As can be easily imagined, the resulting music is a group of low, laggard frequencies that are more about the process these sounds come from than the sound itself, particularly as the sound is nearly inaudible in some places. There are long passages, say five to ten minutes, of either nothingness or subtle gradations of wind. The experience is not dissimilar to sitting in a slightly turbulent plane: inherently disconcerting, but not particularly pernicious. If you think it would be impossible to produce a solo bass/pipe organ album without resorting to clich√©d new age, this album would not disprove your theory. One could easily fall asleep from the jetlag, but nevertheless there's a high-pitched whistle that would make any repose fairly uncomfortable. Compared to the first fifteen minutes, the few mischievously pathetic tones that emerge on the third track feel like the dawn of civilization or a fifty-piece orchestra. Dafeldecker eventually makes his bass sound like a brass instrument (which I find analogous to making a sink sound like an answering machine). On track four, he similarly turns it into a woodwind. There are two slight discontinuities: the beginning of the fifth track, a simply creepy siphoning of translucent gases into the celestial sphere, a church run on pistons and tremolos, and the last track where three microtones sort of form a melody if the listener's a dog. If you solely like ""music"" or albums that don't involve the mastery of German pronunciation, you'll loathe these pieces with a passion. If you like some of Polwechsel's or Dafeldecker's earlier work, or even hyper-minimalism in general (think Alvin Lucier or Keith Rowe's more boring works), this ""sound"" might not bear too many repeated hearings, but it's undeniably fascinating. As that's essentially the point of good experimental music (besides the intellectual value of impressing your friends with words like Dafeldecker), this will provide some slight discomfort to those familiar with this kind of music and calamitous anger to those who think albums always need to be making some sort of noise.","This jubilant record is a piquant mixture of jazzy rhythms and luscious funk grooves, filled with haunting\n\ Mary J ...

If the Twenty-First Century Didn't Exist It Would Be Necessary to Invent It,Various Artists,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7589d034d5c69bf3789/1:1/w_160/e46d13ee.gif,2002-12-17 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1838-if-the-twenty-first-century-didnt-exist-it-would-be-necessary-to-invent-it/,Kill Rock Stars5RC,"The latest compilation from Kill Rock Stars' experimental indie rock subsidiary 5RC is ambitiously titled If the Twenty-First Century Didn't Exist It Would Be Necessary to Invent It. Fair enough. The label itself has, in its four-year existence, proven itself nothing if not innovative, and earned a rep for issuing some of the most challenging and forward-thinking bands going right now-- from Xiu Xiu and Young People to Deerhoof and Get Hustle. And this, its first commercially available compilation (not including last year's Charm soundtrack), collects a slew of material from 24 bands of every non-genre you can dream up (twee avant-pop, groaning electronic music, gutbucket balladry), plus several tracks content to simply put a new spin on rocking your ass off. That said, it's also a difficult compilation. Much of the music is abrasive and the sound quality is lo-fi and grey, like it was mastered by the equivalent of a library Xerox machine. But a more serious issue is that some of the most interesting bands here can hardly be represented by a single track: it's difficult to grasp, from just one song, exactly where they're coming from, what attitude they take to their music, and what guides their decisions. Compare this setlist to the legendary and not dissimilar No New York, which took just four bands and gave them four songs apiece; The Twenty-First Century is more of a starting point for further research than a complete picture of whatever scene encapsulates these bands. And the music is all over the map. For example, you've got your drama queens, writing ballads in the exaggerated vein of black box theater. Young People's ""Rich Bitch"" mixes harrowing guitars and plaintive plain-spoken vocals behind a song that's brief but wrenching. And THETEETHE's cover of the Beach Boys' ""Don't Talk (Put Your Head on My Shoulder)"", with guitars as spare as balsa wood, is nicely persuasive, despite that their singer's vocals are so whinily emotive it sounds like he's putting you on. By contrast, the clumsily na√Øve lyrics of Dilute's country-tinged ""Home Is Where You're Happy"" are probably ironic, but the song still comes off as lightweight. Xiu Xiu also make an appearance, offering a track called ""Sad Cory-o-Grapher"". The song is a subdued ballad that lacks the band's usual fan-pleasing percussion assault, but succeeds on its merits nonetheless. Jamie Stewart sings in a stiffly uncomfortable voice, quite like someone's inflating a balloon in his ass, if I may be so frank, but the melody's sweet, and the startling sci-fi synth figure makes the song a clear standout here. The few electronic tracks stretch my familiarity with the genre, and I can't fairly judge if Semiautomatic and Girls in Trouble are as monotonous and unpleasant as they sound here-- with their low-tech synths and robotic vocals, they make a grim, asexual sort of zombie dance music. The excellent and wildly prolific Wolf Eyes, however, hand in ""Cut the Dog"" which is far more extreme, with abrasive industrial beats, spritz-wire noises, and weirdest of all, a bell, covering muffled, distant vocals. It sounds not unlike a zamboni plowing through mud, but it's engrossingly intense. Elsewhere, Quintron's ""9-4-9"" resembles Prince singing sub-Jon Spencer Blues Explosion material, though it shows off the band's homemade ""drum buddy"" drum machine; the track is catchy, but I'd have to hear more of this to gauge how it's different from any other act with wacky lyrics and fat analog beats. When all of this gets too heavy, 5RC breaks up the mood with fantastic avant-pop. Deerhoof's ""Sweet Knight Brugmansia"" displays the band's zaniest, kids'-album loopy-pop, with Satomi Matsuzaki's little girl sing-song (""flow-er, flow-er, flow-ooh-ah!"") lilting over the calliope-like pace of the guitar crunch and scattershot drums. The Seconds' ""Mommy Mommy Mommy"" has jittery guitars and a verse that echoes James Chance and the Contortion's ""Flip Your Face"", though it's about a tenth as feverish. Another nostalgic and crowd-pleasing track, the Sick Lipstick's ""Teenage Robot"", is probably the easiest sell on the entire record: it takes the surefire formula of a youngish-sounding girl chanting sci-fi nonsense (""We are the teenage robots.../ Can't stop us/ Mission's to destroy!"") and smears hot pink strawberry frosting all over it in the form of catchy guitar and organs. For the quickest music fix, of course, you can skip right to the rock, which comes from a series of phenomenal instrumental power-duos. Hella, a guitar and drum duo, contribute a live recording that sports tight choreography and rapid but melodic, Dick Dale-like twists and hydroplaning. Orthrelm and Osric, meanwhile, are somewhat akin to Hella but play ten times faster: both feature guitarist Mick Barr, a speed metal monster who takes the sweatiest on-his-knees peak of a Yngwie Malmsteen concert solo and plays at nothing but that speed. In Orthrelm he's paired with drummer Josh Blair, who follows him unerringly; in Osric, he uses a drum machine, which simplifies the compositions and actually gives him a longer leash for fiercer shredding. Some fans have called him ""the best guitarist in the world."" That's probably a bit like saying that some guy who wins the 300 meter sprint is the world's best athlete, but in the narrow space of what Barr does, he's incredible to behold. The Twenty-First Century doesn't kick off the new millennium. It doesn't even flush away the 20th century (though I would pay handsomely to see someone do that). But it does highlight an important difference between ""different"" and ""revolutionary."" The world is full of experimental artists and bands, despite what the Vines-clogged media suggests; it's just that those bands are more likely to cultivate an individual voice than they are to set an example for anybody else. 5RC makes a strong case by putting so many disparate bands together and finding what they have in common: they're all pushing the boundaries just enough to make space for themselves. This may not be the smoothest anthology of the year, but it is an incredible roadmap of the newest off-center voices in rock: for noise fiends and pop fans alike, there's something here to annoy everybody.","The latest compilation from Kill Rock Stars' experimental indie rock subsidiary 5RC is ambitiously titled\n\ If the Twenty-First Century ...

Let It Grow,Meligrove Band,by: Brian James,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c41dea9e61561daa8090/1:1/w_160/6b611014.jpg,2002-12-17 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5210-let-it-grow/,EndearingDuctape,"Though it wasn't a big hit in America at the time of its release, the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds was eventually recognized as one of the most admirable achievements in pop music. And since Brian Wilson ruined the incipient goodwill that he'd begun to garner when he shelved its follow-up, Smile, it seemed like Pet Sounds might never enjoy its day in the sun. Surprisingly enough, though, the 1990s elevated it to higher levels of critical and popular acclaim than it might have ever seen. This was due in no small part to the fact that that decade saw Wilson's handsome progeny coming of age. From Wilco's Summerteeth to Matthew Sweet's In Reverse, Brian Wilson's fingerprints were all over every talented pop songwriter who chose to become expansive without turning ""progressive."" Wilco and Matthew Sweet both retained their own voices even as they unabashedly displayed their influences. Such is not entirely the case with Let It Grow, the second long-player from Toronto's Meligrove Band. A trio of 23-year-olds, the Meligrove Band shifts their approach from that heard on 2000's Stars & Guitars into a much larger and more orchestrated affair. Their new style is reminiscent of vintage Beach Boys, but when they throw in some overly familiar So-Cal harmonies and trademark leaps into falsetto, they invite a comparison that they're bound to lose. Although not everything on Let It Grow is lifted straight from Pet Sounds and its brethren, it borrows heavily enough to make you wonder why you should listen to it when you could go to the source. But perhaps you've memorized Pet Sounds and find yourself frustrated by Brian Wilson's (and Mike Love's) eccentricities in the Beach Boys' later work. You're left with a hunger for more of the same, and you've got nowhere to turn. The Meligrove Band hopes you'll turn to them. And why not, if it works? Let It Grow makes it clear why originality is such an overrated quality. Sure, the band nicks too much from classic sunshine pop for their own good, but their sources are superb and their music well executed, taking them through countless surprise twists and turns. Their playing is accomplished and tasteful, as well, with guitarist Jason Nunes shining nicely whenever he gets the chance, and their fine vocals are sweet enough to melt away any objections about the freshness of their approach. So yes, Let It Grow is a nice listen, but more than anything, it offers plenty of reason to believe that better things are yet to come. The Meligrove Band sounds like a group on the verge of outgrowing their derivative tendencies, and that's certainly good news, as too often throughout this album, the elements that make up their ultimate sound are walled off from each other, as a hard-edged guitar rocker is followed by a quaintly polished chamber-pop track. Songs that feature more of a mixture, such as ""Check Your Messages"" and the epic closer, ""A Different Ship"", easily outpace the more streamlined tracks. Considering the tender ages of the band members and the unimpeachable pedigree of their influences, it seems likely enough that their next release will be even better.","Though it wasn't a big hit in America at the time of its release, the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds ...

L.I.F.E.,Transllusion,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7ffc0084474cd0c0d1f/1:1/w_160/72c51801.jpg,2002-12-17 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8142-life/,Rephlex,"""Electro"" is a slippery word. When affixed to the word ""clash,"" it's come to stand for a recent movement in electronic music that draws from the icy and removed synth-pop sound of the 80s, strips the beats down, and turns the lyrical focus to the joy and loathing in decadent sex. Because ""electroclash"" is an unwieldy word, many have taken to shortening it to just plain ""electro."" I find this abbreviation confusing, because the word ""electro"" has such specific connotations in my mind. To me, electro is an early strain of hip-hop that used the stiff machine beats of Kraftwerk as a foundation for a new, sci-fi obsessed form of funk. Time and meanings change, though, and I'm trying to set aside my semantic biases and get with the program. Still, hearing this record by Transllusion, one half of Drexciya, got me thinking about the original electro and how it developed as a vehicle for two expressions. On the one end, dating from 1982, Afrika Bambaataa's ""Planet Rock"" is without question the electro classic of the era, a party jam through and through. This sound and vibe made its way down South and played a part in what came to be called Miami Bass. ""Planet Rock"" is the future as a high-tech carnival. The other branch of electro was bound for a more desolate and isolated Northern climate. On their influential 1983 track ""Clear"", Detroit's Cybotron saw electro as a means for projecting a cold, depressing future where technology leads to alienation. ""Clear"" is clearly not celebration music, and this is the branch of electro that picked up some sounds and eventually morphed into ultra-serious Detroit techno (Juan Atkins, who was half of Cybotron, was an originator of the Detroit sound). The wintry side of the place where electro-meets-techno has been kept alive in Detroit by Drexciya, the mysterious duo comprised of the Gerald Donald and the late James Stinson (he died in September of this year). Ironically, the identities of Drexciya's members were revealed only shortly before Stinson passed away. For most of the group's life, it remained an anonymous outfit dedicated to producing paradoxically cold yet emotionally evocative music from the Detroit template. Drexciya side projects included The Other People Place and Transllusion. As electronic music goes, there's something oddly timeless about Transllusion. Certain aspects of the production sound quite current, while other bits are allude to the 80s. The synth patterns in ""Bump It"", for example, are very early videogame, but the thick bottom end seems of a more recent vintage. I have to say that of the Drexciya-related material I've heard, L.I.F.E. seems especially grim and bleak, and the repetition, while central to the project's aesthetic, is wearying. It's certainly a good record that succeeds at what it sets out to do, but I expect that I won't find myself in the mood to listen too often. I hope not, anyway. Most of the tracks follow a similar template. The midtempo drum hits are ridged as drop forge steel, never deviating even slightly for the beat, never pausing for a fill, never laying out. Moving through and around the beats are all manner of synth squiggles that give some hint of the unpredictable nature of organic life. And the thread through it all is the deep and menacing bass tones that make sure the dark cloud never goes away. The contrast between the downright oppressive repetition of the drum machine and the looser, softer synth patches make me think of these tracks as a view of a factory floor. The steel crash of the factory machines are always there, but moving between the spaces are the people, flesh just barely visible beneath helmets and through gaps in their coveralls. There's humanity in Transllusion's music, but it takes a lot of effort and compassion to find it.","""Electro"" is a slippery word.

Unholy Cult,Immolation,by: Isaiah Violante,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1bd13d197565213bc50/1:1/w_160/9811b964.jpg,2002-12-17 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4079-unholy-cult/,OlympicListenable,"I'm going to save most of the readership a lot of time and energy. If any of you are unable to distance yourselves from preconceived notions concerning the malignance of death metal, possess feelings of contempt and loathing for lyrics of a pointedly anti-Christian bent, or experience any cognitive dissonance vis-√†-vis metal-studded wristbands and shadowy lifestyle choices, this review will be of little relevance to you. For the rest of you fine, upstanding, illuminated, and enlightened young people who are able to distinguish fantasy from reality, pat yourself on the back for being one of only a dozen or so people left on this page, and devote another one hundred and twenty seconds of your life to my ramblings. Yonkers, New York's vicious death metal troupe Immolation has long been the apotheosis of consistency. Emerging from the burgeoning New York Death Metal (NYDM) scene of the late 1980s with a solid fanbase inspired by a smattering of garage quality, proto-technical demos from the band (then known as Rigor Mortis), Immolation established a raw fusion of chaotic punk and thrash built upon harmonic cacophony, blistering drums, and genuine hatred for all things Christian. Adhering steadfast to the strictures of death, destruction, and nihilism, this band has remained one of the most ""popular"" participants in underground death metal, bludgeoning its audience with four albums of the most relentless, alarming, brutal, (and yes, formulaic) death metal on record. Immolation's newest offering, Unholy Cult, continues to charter the same austere ground of their previous releases with only a modicum of artistic progression. Now encompassing unusual hybrids of heavy metal, death metal, and black metal with shifting allegorical phrasing, breakneck tempos, and trudging funeral dirges, Unholy Cult is an album that will please the band's devoted cultish fanbase without necessarily turning the heads of anyone else. In tracks like ""Sinful Nature"", a juggernaut of seething madness and brute force, the guttural vocals of singer/bassist Ross Dolan-- his style having always stood in contrast to the less refined howling of other death metal vocalists-- help erect a typically self-contemptuous landscape. While he bellows lines like, ""How can we live with ourselves/ Our jealousy, our tyranny/ The lives we make, the lives we take/ The fools we serve, the fools we are,"" drummer Alex Hernandez rips through exhausting combinations of blastbeats and double-kick licks. Meanwhile, guitarists Tom Wilkinson, Bill Taylor, and Robert Vigna create layer upon layer of absurdist riffs and hellish noise dangling on the brink of disorder. Immolation builds to these moments of pseudo-chaos effectively throughout Unholy Cult, and degenerating tidal waves of noise back to repetition and melody has always been their strong suit. The most avant-garde offering from Immolation's latest disc comes in the form of ""Rival the Eminent"", a 5\xBD-minute foray into an amalgam of speed metal's scorching pace and black metal's purified melody and rhythm. Moving through heroic pathos lyrically and instrumentally-- brought to a head by a searing solo guitar lead roughly halfway through-- ""Rival"" demonstrates all shades of Immolation without ever becoming tiresome or predictable. Sludgy bass and kickdrums are drilled into the listener's head with such abandon and persistence that it's simply impossible to ignore. This brand of repetition serves in a similar capacity to the high frequency assault of power electronics groups; tones and phrases are so unavoidable that the listener's synapses can't help but be altered by the sheer power of Immolation's attack. For much of the death metal community-- many of whom have existed in a catatonic state for the past fifteen years-- this disc will be precisely the panacea they've been looking for: a stirring indictment of Christian dogma and guilt buried within a lobotomizing wall of chromatics and dissonance. Unholy Cult is ferocious, loud, and technically and tactically precise. Alas, for those of you too undiscerning to comprehend the difference between schlock and shock, this album will probably confirm all of your worst suspicions about death metal: the racist, irreligious, and unflinchingly juvenile champion of the underground. But, because it doesn't display a significant thematic progression or a desire to pander to a wider audience, this album doesn't try so much to allay your fears as it does to prey upon them, and for that there should be some rejoicing.","I'm going to save most of the readership a lot of time and energy.

Deathsentences of the Polished and Structurally Weak,Negativland,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3c013d197565213bdd6/1:1/w_160/52737343.gif,2002-12-16 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5738-deathsentences-of-the-polished-and-structurally-weak/,Seeland,"Like many great modern satirists, Negativland are often wrongly dismissed as a gimmick, and panned for taking on easy targets. Yet, only in a society as sarcasm-infected as ours is such a claim even comprehensible. With such subtle wit at the heart of their humor, there's no ""easy""-- only targets for Negativland; just because a blind dude could take pot shots at Bono's ego from a hundred yards doesn't make U2 any less significant. The same holds for the band's 1997 release Dispepsi: relative simplicity or not, their withering antics are dead-on hilarious and corrosively incisive. But one of the few crimes of which Negativland haven't been commonly accused-- one that seems to plague similar provocateurs-- is the heinous failing of style over substance. Rarely has the collective's methods prevented them from making a point. Of course, there's a first time for everything. Despite their best efforts, nothing on Deathsentences of the Polished and Structurally Weak is even half as interesting or poignant as the CD casing itself, and musically, the decision to focus on this album's mood and textures largely falls flat. Without a semblance of direction within the album itself, Deathsentences is emptier than Negativland's refrigerators. Oh, but where to begin? See, the guys have packaged this disc inside a mock automobile owner's manual, the to-scale insert depicting numerous pieces of reclaimed wreckage, as well as written documents recovered from the wreckage, (ostensibly) pertaining to the victims of the accidents. Sometimes disturbing, sometimes touching, sometimes tragically mundane, these documents are the conceptual inspiration for the album artfully described by the band as ""the destruction of [their] studio in an automobile accident"". A concept so emotionally and atmospherically rich is far beyond simply a functional theme for an album, but it's a brilliant one, and in the hands of such expert found-sound manipulators, I expected stunning results. I dove into the album hoping for readings and retellings of the victims' tales, and sad, stirring aural vignettes to match the desolation of the scenes depicted in the booklet (if only it could all be as exquisite as Richard Lyons' segment contribution for Ira Glass' ""This American Life""). Negativland, evidently, had different intentions regarding Deathsentences, opting to allow their talents for subtlety to take the fore. There are no lyrics of any discernible sort contained on this disc, and indeed, the samples they include are so heavily glitched and echoed that they quickly become indistinct, leaving only hazy wonderings as to their origins. Done properly, such a simple approach could have served as a perfect corollary to the theme they had set for themselves, but this time, Negativland have been undone by their own vagueness. Deathsentences is really a single track partitioned into twelve bite-sized cuts, and the album shares a single, murky atmosphere throughout. Those looking to plumb the depths to search for some link, some remotely tangible tie to the concept it allegedly promotes, will be disappointed. Occasionally, rumblings of distant snippets or soundbytes bubble to the surface from out of the submarine twilight, but their significance or purpose is never clear. Even with the printed subtext for these tracks firmly in mind, the claustrophobic soundscapes are impenetrable and formless, offering no insight at all to the intent-- a shocking departure for the boys from the Bay. The only reason Deathsentences isn't a total wash is owed to the mildly interesting, but wholly generic, atmosphere of the album as a unit. A gentle air of mournfulness clings to it through the scattered, almost random sound collages. The creepy isolation produced is arguably a fulfillment of the fundamental idea-- but it's so obtuse, anyone could name a dozen bands that equally capture identical feelings of melancholy (albeit without the benefit of a flashy manual). The pervasive mood and rhythmless, glitch-driven complexity of the album make it at least somewhat enjoyable, if only as background music, but that's about the best that can be said for it. If only the album could stand up to its packaging, instead of just mysteriously implying some sense of content. After twenty years of insightful, reality-warping satire, outright mayhem, copyright infringement, and litigation, a band like Negativland is bound to run out of targets-- but even with such an immaculate concept, it seems that there's still an inadvertent butt to this non-joke. Shame that it has to be their audience.","Like many great modern satirists, Negativland are often wrongly dismissed as a gimmick, and panned for taking on easy targets ...

Jewelry Store EP,The Capitol Years,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a518ea9e61561daa505f/1:1/w_160/c3cd32c6.jpg,2002-12-16 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1295-jewelry-store-ep/,Full Frame,"Showmanship is an art lost on just about the entire indie world. Too many bands just stand there, meekly playing their songs without ever bothering to say a word to the crowd or act engaged. It's amazing how seldom something simple as telling the audience what band they're listening to crosses the mind of the people on stage, much less anything approaching stage presence. I caught the Capitol Years on a Sunday night in a nearly empty room, maybe a month ago, and they were a blast of fresh air after years spent in the hyperbaric chamber of indie rock shows. These guys might as well have been playing for a stadium full of obnoxiously screaming fans. They interacted with the skeletal crowd, played a spirited, tight set that radiated enthusiasm. A show I'd gone to solely out of curiosity and boredom actually made me move and stuck with me. What are the chances? I wasn't crazy about the first Capitol Years record, Meet Yr Acres, which was basically a solo recording by bandleader Shai Halperin (or Shai, Son of Eli, as he sometimes goes by), but after that show, I was willing to give their full-band debut a try, and to my delight, it doesn't disappoint. These guys take the all-out rock and free-flowing energy of their show and smash it onto a little plastic disc that's a blast to listen to. Jewelry Store is old-school rock'n'roll, but I want to clarify that it's clearly quite separate from the garage rock renaissance. The Capitol Years pluck their bluesy riffs and rough harmonies from the past with the same lack of pretense that makes it work for bands like Sloan, who seem to embody the spirit of their influences, as well as their sound. ""Even if you're happy, won't you let me buy you more,"" exhorts Halperin to his romantic interest on the fantastic title track, a classic rave-up built on a solid boogie progression and rock hard drumming from ""Sir"" Kyle Lloyd. ""River Raid"" (which I hope is named for my favorite Atari 2600 title) runs away on a ragged guitar and a series of feel changes, but it's the closer, ""Train Race"", that stands out as the clear winner. The hook is built around the most musically demure moment on the EP, and it's followed immediately by an onslaught of monster riffs and propulsive rhythms that serve to highlight how well crafted it is. Throughout the record, the production of Brian McTear (Burning Brides, Haywood) and Thom Monahan (Pernice Brothers, Scud Mountain Boys) keeps the VU meters hot and the sound focused. The final result is a well-realized reinvention of the Capitol Years name, and a damn good time. Their show may still be the best place to catch them, but the Jewelry Store is worth a trip.","Showmanship is an art lost on just about the entire indie world.

While the inundation initially stayed within that orbit, every record by the KLF and FFWD, every Dr Alex Patterson appearance on a Juno Reactor disc, and every Sun Electric production by Orb conspirator Thomas Fehlmann somehow sprung me further out, into the realms of Richard D James, Stockhausen, etc. Ultimately, I moved out of the house. Thomas Fehlmann seems to have moved on as well. He's forgone the fluffy carbohydrate excesses of the past to go high-protein within the calorie-burning K√∂ln microhouse scene, and tightened his skills considerably in the supposedly young man's game of dance music. ""Streets of Blah"", the opening track on his debut full-length for the exemplary Kompakt label, drops him into some sloshing, watery aerobic class with an elliptical cross-trainer underfoot. He's pumping at an even pace, but so hard that the machine is made to float, emitting little bass bubbles and slimming the sound down to its dub essence. Its energy is sustained throughout by slightly switching up the program: a four-note bass burble slips in with staccato stabbed-key jerks on ""Superbock"", while ""Rotenfaden"" steps it back up with more weights strapped to the kickdrum and hi-hat, heart pumping. Fehlmann obviously had his headphones plugged into Euro club proceedings over the years, be it Mike Ink's cardio work and the glistening rivulets of sweat on ""Du Fehlst Mir"", or the textural clicks 'n' cuts of ""Making It Whistle"". Unlike some top-heavy dance workouts, hits posited just at the beginning, Fehlmann shows not only incredible staying power, but proportionate muscle balance that strengthens the disc as it goes. ""Gratis"" takes some free-weight clangs and mixes them with a hard skank strut, hardly feeling like a stationary machine. He even feels fit enough to return to some of his classic chill-out near the disc's end. ""Boheme Rouge"" takes in deep breaths and stretches out, ending the session with a deep sense of satisfaction. Rejuvenated by such a workout, his insulin firmly under control, Fehlmann hardly belies his age or pedigree, not only as the first person to put out a house record in Britain (as Ready Made in 1986), but as a famed collaborator with Blake Baxter, Juan Atkins, Maurizio, and Erasure (to name just a few) over the past two decades.

1957,Soul-Junk,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4d55e6ef9596932096a/1:1/w_160/3e6d6c56.jpeg,2002-12-15 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7364-1957/,Sounds Familyre,"Fascinated by Christian commodities, I collect Jesusabilia. Any ""official"" spirituality seems to translate very poorly into the world of pocketable, vaguely symbolic trinkets, but there's something singularly hilarious and pitiful about supposedly Christ-haunted license plates, bookends, bumper stickers, sock darners, paperweights, ballcaps, candle holders, and breath-candy (with brand names like Testamints, even). Christian music, too, is mostly saccharine dreck: the hymns are painfully obvious to the point of being meta-songs about how the gathered singers are gathered to sing, the pop/rock stuff is a second-rate appropriation of the rote fads of already-stank pop/rock, and many a well-intentioned abomination has been born under the auspices of Christian rap. Lately, though, some indie acts who've outed themselves as Christians (among them Damien Jurado, Pedro the Lion, Starflyer 59, and Danielson Famile) have done much to mitigate the shame purveyed by Stryper, Creed. P.O.D., and Carman (whose ""street"" effort Addicted to Jesus-- referred to by those in the know as A2J-- remains a classic work of accidental comedy). With their friendly connection to the Danielsons and their elements of playful showmanship (costumes and cheerleaders), Soul-Junk are uniquely positioned to wipe smirks from the faces of those who sincerely doubt Christian rap could ever be interesting. Maybe I should distinguish this duo, Galaxalag and Slo-Ro, as ""underground"" Christian rap, fitting for a religion whose proponents had to squat in caves back in the day. This intimidatingly prolific crew (1938 was their first release, and they haven't skipped a number) has honed an unbelievably progressive sound, making huge leaps just since their last release, 1956, a church-critiquing treatise in the spirit of Kierkegaard's Attack Upon Christendom. 1957's sound vacillates between extreme states of density and sparsity (""Horse Posing as Unicorn"" even concludes with an extended jam that exposes how ramshackle it is beneath its instigative, propulsive chant). Some tracks explode with bombastic, digitized, orchestra hits that suggest a soundtrack for a hybrid of Ben-Hur and Total Recall directed by Kubrick's resentful ghost. Other points hint at a post-human updating of the more ominous moments in the Silver Apples' oeuvre. Whole tunes are underwritten by squiggling modem-barfs, and the uncanny drum patterns simulate popcorn blossoming in a microwave. Forget the Beasties for a moment; this forty-minute wedge of berserk-hop is more deserving of the ""Intergalactic"" title. At least two cuts offer detached trip-tones; but elsewhere the band is funkless, offering the ingredients of dance without the gregarious ease. This disc offers loops of dripping water, moaning horns, spastic hisses and pops, and insane harmonica. The album's sheer busyness demands a Daytime Emmy, as it's so ambitiously clamorous that it transcends its theological mission to convey a sense of secular apocalypse. These apoplectic white guys sound vital like Destroyer's Dan Bejar, as if they never get in ruts or need naps. The lyrics are amazing, but goofy. But amazing. But goofy. Robot voices rap about how we shouldn't get mad at dumb machines, and then Galaxalag slurs, ""How can parasites be so entertaining/ Debugged and debraining."" This band adds a bizarre religious element to standard hip-hop braggadocio (since they're ""down with Christ"") and to hip-hop persecution complexes (since their references to martyrdom have an epic significance). If you can handle choruses like, ""It's time to make way for the resurrectionists!"", you're set up to enjoy some music-clusters so avant-garde they make Anticon sound Neptune-smooth. Soul-Junk's carnival aesthetic suggests a dirty John the Baptist hanging out with flagellants; their tracks are spackled together or strewn like Jackson Pollack trying to use Microsoft Paintbrush on a computer built by lobotomized Fraggles. These bible-folk conjure an only occasionally wack kaleidoscopic frenzy.","Fascinated by Christian commodities, I collect Jesusabilia.

Creepy Little Noises,I Can Lick Any Sonofabitch in the House,by: Brian James,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c19aabf31b7dc7156657/1:1/w_160/db807558.gif,2002-12-15 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4042-creepy-little-noises/,In Music We Trust,"Every once in a great while, a work of art will come along that, once experienced, forever changes the lives it touches. Creepy Little Noises, the debut album from Portland, Oregon's I Can Lick Any Sonofabitch in the House, is not one of them. This album, and the group as a whole, seem destined to frustrate the few expectations they raise-- never a good sign for folks trying to catch a break. From their bandname and record title to the eerie cover art, to their proclaimed love of country-rock and the liberal use of the word ""bad-ass"" in their press releases, I Can Lick Any Sonofabitch in the House prep you for a trip they never take. Things go wrong early: the first track, ""John L. Sullivan"", named for a champion boxer whose autobiography the band named themselves after, is nothing more than the lead singer (mysteriously credited as ""The Hamms Can Full of Rice"") rasping a brief, disjointed narrative from the titular Sullivan's point of view. Sounding like Tom Waits on uppers, the track promises untold weirdness, but once its 35-second runtime has expired, ""Graveyard Song"" begins, almost instantaneously flipping the finger to anyone hungering for more oddness. The production there, and throughout the rest of the record, is surprisingly bright and full, running wholly counter to the twisted Americana aesthetic the band reaches for at the outset. And furthering this incongruity is the band's performance: they sound like studio pros with all traces of personality removed. The majority of country music's original grit was sucked out long ago; Creepy Little Noises is certainly not the record to reverse that unfortunate trend. Finesse and polish, even in country-rock, don't have to be a death sentence, but in this case, they leave nothing interesting behind. Despite their instrumental competence, I Can Lick Any Sonofabitch in the House write songs like high school students, letting them run on for far too long without introducing new ideas. The results are merely tepid on the rockers, but they positively drag on the album's many ballads, where the riffs are always played on acoustic guitars with that shriveled open-mic-night rhythm that declared itself artistically bankrupt sometime after Ani DiFranco started her own record label. The rasp of the lead singer (whatever his name is), once intriguing, begins to sound like a standard-issue affectation. The band's approach eventually bottoms out with ""Walk Across Texas"", at best a fourth-rate version of Little Feat's ""Willin'"". And in addition to intrinsic shortcomings in the ballad department, they fail to play the softies off of the rockers effectively, aiming to depict secretly tender tough guys, but instead coming across as mopes with occasional bouts of energy. Ultimately, Creepy Little Noises is too vanilla to be bad, but its oppressive slickness makes no convincing argument in its favor. In fact, the only real loss in skipping this disc is ""Saturday"", which arrives halfway through the album. A detail-heavy narrative of a young boy on one of his beloved Saturday mornings, the song shines like a beacon surrounded on either side by similar elements that never coalesced so well. If I Can Lick Any Sonofabitch in the House choose not to delve deeper into the strangeness they flirt with so onanistically, they would do well to mine the vein unearthed on ""Saturday"" until they can come up with something better.","Every once in a great while, a work of art will come along that, once experienced, forever changes the lives ...

Sheer Hellish Miasma,Kevin Drumm,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba269d034d5c69bf53c1/1:1/w_160/d9e7f77e.jpg,2002-12-15 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2465-sheer-hellish-miasma/,Mego,"When Rhino decided to reissue the entire Mego back catalog in 2022, they came across notes for alternative titles to this particular disc, Kevin Drumm's third solo release, and first for the electronic Viennese label. Some names scribbled down (and ultimately scratched out) included: Brain Scratch Avalanche, Tooth Filling Freebaser, and Demonic Wasabi Colonic. They were all in the running until the eleventh hour it seems, each brandishing the palpable sense of (dark) power coursing through them, as well as boldly proclaiming grievous bodily harm of a most agonizing sort. All of the vetoed names had their own je ne sais quoi, I'll admit. And yet the decided upon title conveyed the sensation succinctly, as the vagaries of the ""Miasma"" in the final title somehow qualified this intense listening experience. Back in the winter of 'ought-two, when I first heard this Kevin Drumm disc (he was still into Norwegian death metal in those days), a blizzard had just hit the city and snow was flurrying and thick on the ground. It was my first time ever through such weather conditions and I was crazy enough to venture out into it for a few thrills, with this music strapped to my head. While familiar with Drumm's earlier work, always the aural equivalent of a ""Fisherman's Friend"" (be it by prepared guitar or synthesizer), Drumm was blasting the sinuses clean and viciously chapping the knuckles with a clarity and enhanced eucalyptus flavor unfelt before. The opening glitches were mere forbearer of the whiteout to come. What roar I presumed to be outside in the cold was already inside my cavities, and I was well beyond the turning point before even reaching the front door. Hitting the pavement, every step was treacherous, uncertain. Thinking the storm already at its apex, it took only a minute or two before I realized it was just beginning. The snow was blowing about thick, obscuring the eyes, numbing all sense extremities, and making penetrating vision impossible beyond twenty feet. The wind was a two-by-four to the face, and it was coming from both left and right channels. I turned it up to keep my ears warm, as it had already blown off my earmuffs, and the headphones were suffering, crackling under the extreme frequencies. Vast drifts of clean, pure snow were expanding everywhere, and the white noise that flossed through the cerebellum made perfect sense, flushing out my stuffiness in a fast-acting manner. Aside from the severe nasal drainage (in public no less), there was an underlying nastiness to it all. Drumm, hiding within all that white, was not merely packing together some frozen snowballs for further assault, but opening portals of treacherous black ice underfoot. Combined with the vociferous gales, it threatened to knock me on my ass at any moment. And with the slicks all leading to vast puddles of a most heinous slush, piss-pocked and tire-gray, it took all of my balance and willpower to hold steady throughout. The meteorological climate was quickly turning into the frozen-solid core of ""The Inferno"". Nearly a twenty-five minute journey to trudge through, I shuddered at the fact that I was barely halfway home, and the conditions were only growing more ferocious. All the chained tires on the street spun like reckless turntables and cars careened into brick buildings left, right and center. The snowplows were out in full force, but they were ungrounded, buzzing and crawling ever closer, crunching rock salt and scraping towards me. It was a sound very much like the Approach of the Valkyrie's Vacuum, sucking and forever oncoming with this gritty, hairballed roar of eternal Norse vortices. I fell into it about eighteen minutes in, and it felt like certain death-metal doom. That's when the dental-drill blizzard of the world around me peaked, revealing the Metal Machine Music axe at its black, bloodied valentine heart. All its cold, coiled, single-string essence was finally laid bare. I was alive and kicking in its eye, feeling the beautifully brutal essence of the storm emanating out of my head. The rush felt like Valhalla, with Vikings hacked into steaming chunks on the frozen battlefield. It rocked! It was merely cloudy by the end, and my palpitating heart cooled out a bit, although I could still feel the blood jetting through my tweaked extremities. I hadn't been this jacked since a menthol speedball hit the streets in '99. Ever since track three of Pita's Get Out, I've been waiting for that feeling again, that of a truly brute bruit from the Mego dealers. This, gents and junkies, is it.","When Rhino decided to reissue the entire Mego back catalog in 2022, they came across notes for alternative titles to ...

Tallahassee,The Mountain Goats,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3d3eb335119a49ed7df/1:1/w_160/c70c3d58.jpg,2002-12-15 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5450-tallahassee/,4AD,"MINUTES FROM THE 2002 ANNUAL MEETING OF THE CONCEPT ALBUM SOCIETY As I'm sure you are all aware, 2002 has been a fantastic year for the concept album, quite possibly one of the best since our heyday at the turn of the 1970s. While major-label artists resisted the rock opera urge (which is perhaps for the best; let us not forget MACHINA and Chris Gaines), acts below the mainstream radar took up the slack nicely. John Vanderslice, Black Heart Procession, Pedro the Lion... hip-hop even gave us a concept record that, shockingly, was not a science fiction gimmick: Mr. Lif's I Phantom. Soon, we'll be voting on final nominees for our honorary Pete Townshend Concept Album of the Year award. But before you cast your ballot, some members have requested that we address a late entry to this year's competition: The Mountain Goats' Tallahassee. Since his full-length cassette debut in 1991, John Darnielle has threaded the sagas of flawed relationships through his albums, generally told in one-song installments. Now, for the first time in 81 albums (okay, 16... or something, it's confusing), Darnielle has expanded these tragic stories into an entire LP, set in the diamond city of Florida's panhandle. The idea is enticing: Darnielle, known for crafting two-minute biographies like ""Fall of the Star High School Running Back"" richer in detail than a 700-page novel, is given greater room to flesh out his stories. His talent for depicting the rises and falls of a relationship in singular, tiny details (fighting over the car radio, for example) makes him ideal for the task of an indie-folk Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?. The result is the pleasant musical equivalent of a slow, deliberate character study, rich with symbols like circling crows and a house in disrepair, more concerned with in-depth observation of the protagonists than with narrative movement. Unfortunately, this pace makes for a less than successful concept album, with song topics tracing an endless I Love You/I Love You Not oscillation, from the cautious happiness of the title track and ""Game Shows Touch Our Lives"" to the for-the-throat attacks of ""No Children"" or ""Have to Explode"". The music is distracted by another concept, as well-- a meta-concept, if you will, with Tallahassee touted as the first Mountain Goats release to be recorded with a full, traditionally-instrumented rock band. Darnielle spends most of the album teasing the listener with this promise, adding a bass here, some minimal drums there, perhaps a harmonica, before (gotcha!) we arrive back at a Darnielle solo arrangement. When we finally come to a song with an actual, honest-to-God rhythm section (""See America Right"") it sounds disappointingly like... Cake?! The majority of Tallahassee, recorded with Darnielle's Extra Glenns cohort Franklin Bruno, is, like the Extra Glenns' Martial Arts Weekend, typically stripped-down Goats fare with an occasional minimal embellishment. And as has been the case whenever Darnielle has chosen a studio over his trusty Panasonic boombox, the end result sounds somewhat thin-- especially considering the more delicate strum-style he's been developing of late. A few exceptions are pleasant, like the Casio-fed ""Southwood Plantation Road"" or the bright piano line that runs through ""No Children"" before the delightfully/horrifically bitter singalong chorus, but songs like ""Peacock"" and ""Idylls of the King"" are over-wispy. Johnny Goat's usual lyrical acuity also comes slightly short of his usual track record, as he unveils one of the best entries from his notebook of ""Love is like..."" similes (in this case, it's like ""the border between Greece and Albania"") only to later drop the dud, ""People say friends don't destroy one another/ What do they know about friends?"" These transgressions are somewhat forgiven, however, by ""Oceanographer's Choice"", Tallahassee's only song to truly come through with the full-band promise, and a breathtaking portrait of the usual relationship violence becoming physical. With drums and ominous organ that finally add some urgency to the story, and sad, sliding electric guitar swooping in and out like symbolic crows, the music finally measures up to the emotional intensity of Darnielle's imagery. When the band drops out, the scene freezes, and the characters fully realize the consequences of their meltdown: ""What will I do when I don't have you?"" Suffice to say, if the rest of Tallahassee lived up to the standard set by ""Oceanographer's Choice"", we'd have a surefire candidate here for Concept Album of the Year. However, Tallahassee is not even 2002's second best song cycle about disintegrating love (it's succeeded by Pedro the Lion's Control and Black Heart Procession's Amore del Tropico). While Tallahassee, as literature, is richly detailed, even stunning on occasion, Darnielle's apparent phobia for full-band arrangements prevents the music from keeping pace with the storylines. It's an admirable experiment, but not one that will likely find its way to the podium come election time.","MINUTES FROM THE 2002 ANNUAL MEETING OF THE CONCEPT ALBUM SOCIETY

Paul McCartney wrote ""Freedom"", and Neil Young penned ""Let's Roll"". Bruce Springsteen even erected a long-playing monument to the victims of September 11th. Yet still, the pain lingers on, prompting the question: has anyone tried making a pro-wrestling-themed hardcore album? The answer, thanks to Gorilla Monsoon, is now a resounding, ""Hell yeah!"" Festering in Brooklyn like some disease that should have been wiped out in the nineteenth century, Gorilla Monsoon is one of the more unusual bands making music today. Named for the late president of the World Wrestling Federation, their eponymous debut is dedicated to exploring the many facets of the pro-wrestling world in more idyllic, less terror-ridden times. In those halcyon days, the WWF had no upstart and Osama bin Laden-like competitors, and Hulk Hogan's ongoing feud with Andre the Giant was as unambiguous a representation of good-versus-evil as America and France. So what, you may ask, does Gorilla Monsoon have to say on this subject? Let's begin with song titles: ""20 Foot Snake & 20 Inch Mullet (J.S. Roberts)"", ""Thank God Donald Trump's a Hulk-a-Maniac!"", and ""Somebody in This Room Punched King Kong Bundy in the Arm"". Unfortunately, for all the gargantuan promise contained therein, they provide precious little insight into the wondrous subtleties of the WWF. The lyrics, only featured on the surefire classic ""R. Piper vs. J. Snuka"", consist solely of muddled shouts in the background which sound like nothing more than the names of the titular combatants. Now, a largely instrumental album about wrestling could still be a wonderful thing-- a soundtrack to the drama of Hulk Hogan miraculously recovering from a near-coma to whomp his opponent, perhaps-- but here, too, Gorilla Monsoon falls short of their lofty goal. Quite simply, the music on Gorilla Monsoon is unredeemed. It will not, I dare say, do for the WWF what Miles Davis' A Tribute to Jack Johnson did for boxing (i.e., avoid making it look like the stop-motion devolution it is). This album captures not so much the experience of wrestling as laying on the couch in your pajamas watching wrestling for so long that you begin to feel sick and lose the will to go on living. If this is your bag, then this, and perhaps no other record, will do. The members of Gorilla Monsoon may be funny in real life-- their song titles are at least circumstantial evidence of this-- but the fact that no personality, charm, wit, or... anything that could be called real music with a straight face was captured on this disc is enough to make you wish recording equipment weren't so easy to come by. Maybe, like Dark Side of the Moon and The Wizard of Oz, it works fantastically well played over ""Monday Night RAW"". That's a stretch, of course, but in order to be appreciated on any level, Gorilla Monsoon requires stretching; about as much as childbirth, or at least fisting.","In the last year, we as a nation have undergone great tragedy.

This went down without my realizing that Metro Area at present call the one-time ""Fourth Largest City in America"" home, but I wasn't surprised when I got back to Virginia a few days later and picked up the biographical details online. Metro Area is two guys, producers Morgan Geist and Darshan Jesrani, who've been working together since the mid-90s. Beginning in 1999, they released a string of highly sought-after and limited 12-inch singles on their own Environ label. And now we have their first full-length, which collects edited versions of six of those 12-inch sides, in addition to new material. Even in my ignorance, with nothing to go on but enthusiastic recommendations from a few people I respect, Metro Area seemed the perfect soundtrack to an afternoon stroll through the brownstones. This is city music through and through; Metro Area's musical history is one of confined spaces, close proximity, and mingled breath, a world drawn from and immersed in club culture. These sounds have no place on the front porch or in the car deck. Beginning their musical references around 1977, Metro Area combine heavy doses of disco, dollops of funk, a dash of new wave and synth-pop, and then remove just about everything but each track's most essential elements. It's no surprise that one of the best tracks here, the plucky and P-funkish ""Miura"", wound up on Force Tracks' recent Digital Disco compilation (well worth checking out, by the way). Despite the association with some of the microhouse mavens and a shared commitment to musical economy, Metro Area carries no theoretical baggage aboard this plane. These guys would never allow a glitch to sully their pristine productions. They're more interested in the warmth of the picked nylon string guitar (on the Latin shuffle ""Pi√±a""), the purity of the flute (the almost painfully funky ""Machine Vibes"") and the timeless swell of horns (""Orange Alert""). The Kelley Polar String Quartet appears on three tracks, imparting rhythmic stabs, romantic swells, and melodramatic sweeps, all hallmarks of the disco tradition. The care taken in recording and balancing the organic instruments pays off in spades and gives Metro Area an edge over the Reaktor and Cubase set. This is beautifully recorded and endlessly rhythmic music. Actually, these tracks sound so nice and draw so masterfully from a variety of dance music traditions that I can't help but wish Metro Area would incorporate some vocals into the mix. It's not that the tracks don't work well on their own-- you can certainly absorb all the delicious space and admire the rhythmic interplay better this way-- but some of these chord productions and beats are just too pop to leave the voice out entirely. It's almost scary to think how good they could be in that context. It's not hard to imagine a couple of these six-minute plus tracks, which drag just a tad by the end as they repeat themselves (forgivable when you consider many were created with DJs in mind), seeming too short with a few verses added. Still, though I dream about Metro Area paying homage to disco's vocal pop history, I really have very little to complain about.

Outside the Dream Syndicate,Tony ConradFaust,by: Brent S. Sirota,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a64813d197565213914d/1:1/w_160/583eda9f.jpg,2002-12-12 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1582-outside-the-dream-syndicate/,EGEG,"An old Zen koan comes to mind; delivered through the lesser hands of seekers and compilers, beats and Deadheads, the New Age-- but surely, I imagine, of wise and noble provenance somewhere back. A flag flapping in the gale sparks an argument between two monks on the nature of things. The first declares that the flag is surely moving. The flag is still, counters the other, it is the wind that is moving. Sure enough, where an insoluble paradox appears, the wandering master is not far behind. Which is it, ask the monks, is the flag moving or is the wind moving? Neither, replies the master; mind is moving. Fair enough. Take it, like any wisdom, with a grain of salt, but it springs to mind. Not because Tony Conrad sees still air and a flapping flag, or because Faust occupy a world of volatile weather, but just because, for a moment in Outside the Dream Syndicate, one forgets what exactly is moving and what is standing still. Here's what we know: in October 1972, at a hippie commune in W√ºmme in southwestern Hamburg, a German art-rock collective bred on the stringent drone and skag-pop of the Velvet Underground hooked up with the young composer who gave that band its name-- or rather, who handed Lou Reed the sadomasochism expos√© whence the band derived its name. Tony Conrad and the members of Faust collaborated for three days on an album that would be released the following year in England and would tank immediately thereafter. The musicians did not communicate or collaborate throughout the following two decades. Minimalism is unquestionably the wrong word; I prefer asceticism. Anyone familiar with the Zappa-like hysteria of Faust's first album or the searing kosmische of IV must imagine the sheer force of self-denial at work in implementing Conrad's vision: to have a deep base note tuned to the tonic on Conrad's violin and to have the drummer ""tuned"" to a rhythm that corresponded to the vibrations. Minimal in design, I suppose, but catastrophically huge in execution. ""From the Side of Man and Womankind"" opens in dead motorik, the usually nimble percussive battery of bass guitarist Jean-Herv√© Peron and drummer ""Zappi"" Diermaier, stalled out to a hollow thud-- like the heartbeat of a machine. Conrad's violin bleats mournfully, endlessly; rising, breathing, sighing, screaming, but without ceasing: relentless. Faust resisted. Peron's second bass note, inserted against Conrad's wishes, adds a spring and thrust to the proceedings. Zappi's odd cymbal crash shatters like punctuation in a prayer. Faust producer Uwe Nettelbeck dulled the serrated violence of Conrad's violin, somehow rendering slow murder into long caresses. ""The Side of Man and Womankind"" runs like a conveyor belt through fog: going without moving, advancing, standing still. ""From the Side of the Machine"" is oddly less mechanical than its counterpart. A half-hour in length, like ""Man and Womankind"", the ""Machine"" side ruminates with muted psychedelia: serpentine bass, ceremonial percussion, the purr and roar of Rudolf Sosna's humming synthesizer, Conrad's violin passing high above like an electrical storm in the upper air. There is a predatory quality to the ""Side of the Machine"": an encircling peril, a certain restlessness above and behind. Mind moves, as if hunted. The Thirtieth Anniversary Edition of Outside the Dream Syndicate adds a second disc of material. Two brief tracks-- both named with the young death of former Dream Syndicate comrade Angus Maclise in mind-- offer the remaining fragments of those three days at the abandoned schoolhouse studio at W√ºmme. Both the slow burning ""The Pyre of Angus was in Kathmandu"" and the tremulous ""The Death of the Composer Was in 1962"" reveal a looser agenda in the sessions. In the latter piece, Conrad abandons the impassive drone of the first disc for an almost celebratory psych-rock. The second disc is rounded out by an alternate production of ""From the Side of Man and Womankind"", lacking the overdubbed violin lines of the album version. So perhaps a little Zen, perhaps a little cataclysm. After all, as Lou Reed said, ""It's the beginning of the New Age."" And a few decades before that, a poet ended his long flirtation with Buddhism by joining the Church of England. In his conversion poem, however, he continued to pray with eastern paradoxes. ""Teach us to care and not to care,"" T.S. Eliot intoned, ""teach us to sit still."" And this album finally begins to show us how.","An old Zen koan comes to mind; delivered through the lesser hands of seekers and compilers, beats and\n\ Deadheads ...

By the same token, Resuscitation, a reformatted collection of their 12-inch singles, isn't so much an ""album"" as it is the soundtrack to an alternately beautiful and hilarious fantasy world, one where kids dressed like Central European intelligence agents congregate in dark clubs to bang heads and twitch spasmodically until they're utterly, magnificently spent. It's made half of my thoughts about little words like ""electro"" and ""punk"" cringe in its great looming shadow; it's made me bounce and shout like a ninny more than anything else I've heard in years. My personal enthusiasm for this record knows no bounds, and I can only hope that it's mildly contagious. They're from Detroit: Adam Lee Miller, who makes sequencers race and pound, and Nicola Kuperus, whose every communication with us is designed to imply convoluted intrigues surrounding it. I wrote last month that they ""think they're punks,"" but their records sweep away the concept-- the tracks on Resuscitation function as grim, stripped-bare techno, razor-sharp synth-pop, and snarling electro-punk, but most of all they just blaze effortlessly away. The drum machines are sharp and propulsive, hissing and spitting while the programming, grainy as all get-out, ping-pongs furiously around itself, building and collapsing in a light-speed flurry of hooks. (You can dance to it if you have massive amounts of frustrated energy, a strong heart, and enough room that you won't accidentally hurt anyone.) Kuperus' vocals, obsessed with communication, miscommunication, privacy, and consumption, range from a blank chant to a wounded sing-song, clipped and processed into a state that's less robotic than distant and distorted. The overall effect is like listening to a strobe light. All of this makes them sound angry and cold, which they're not: their best tracks walk the same fine line as Gary Numan's ""Cars"", offering up both slamming beats and pop hooks perfect for bemused driver's-seat posing. It's tempting to think that at least Miller has some metal in his past, because the tone is the same; his tightly arranged kicks and slams seem lighthearted, meant for entertainment and less a product of aggression than flat-out, amped-up good times. What sets Adult. apart from their peers, aside from the hyperactive blur of their songs, is the amount of attention they pay to form and detail: every measure brings new tricks, sprinting programs turning acrobatically on dimes, running circles around themselves in perfectly choreographed conversations with the vocals. These tracks come across as fierce pop songs that would make just as interesting instrumentals, which, with the pasted-together collages of vocal snippets, some of them really are. And once one can get past Resuscitation's massive dose of Loveless syndrome (e.g. a signature sound unique enough that the tracks run together somewhat), it becomes apparent just how flexible the duo's approach is. ""Skinlike"", the collection's most beautiful moment, soars like A Flock of Seagulls; ""Nausea"", its most light-hearted, stomps determinedly along while Kuperus repeatedly chews up and spits out its title, his posing and preening almost audible. The wonderfully misanthropic ""Human Wreck"" reaches heights of buzzing industrial grind-- like The Normal's bleak ""Warm Leatherette"" done over as hard techno by agit-prop guerillas-- but the surprisingly wistful ""Contagious"" has Kuperus singing her sad message over a sunny major-key lilt. That message runs like this: ""Your signal failed-- but I know you're contagious."" It's worth referencing the cover art here for Kuperus' photography, which adorns many releases on Adult.'s label, Ersatz Audio. Her striking agenda is the creation of scenes that function as stills from non-existent espionage thrillers: what convoluted plot climax could have led to the scene we see on Resuscitation's cover? Her lyrics are another grab-bag of high-tech anxieties: in ""Pressure Suit"" it's the smoke from her own flaming boots that gives her the privacy to speak, and the hook to ""Hand to Phone"", the smoothest-running single here, chants, ""She speaks to you in monotone/ Why can't I come over?"" Elsewhere, it's blank furniture in empty rooms, handbags full of money, ""lovesick minors at night,"" and, of course, all that neurotic nausea. It's terrifically conceived and even more terrifically crafted, the sort of record so perfect in its own aims that parsing out influences or agendas seems a fool's game. These tracks, this duo, this entity that is Adult.: they're a great and interesting thing, this nation's best inducers of head-banging, high-speed driving, amazed chuckles, and giddy bedroom shout- and/or pose-alongs. They really are superheroes, I swear it-- and when I'm listening to them, the bulk of everything else I've heard since I first heard them seems pointless and humorless, uptight and dull in the face of the massive amounts of fun these two seem to be having. I encourage you to join us.","Adult. isn't so much a ""band"" in the conventional sense as it is a pair of superheroes, done up ...

The Grace EPs,Jeff Buckley,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d6c0084474cd0c0362/1:1/w_160/e91de5cf.jpg,2002-12-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/994-the-grace-eps/,Columbia,"Aside from completely disastrous tribute albums and Now! compilations, I dare you to think of anything that constitutes an easier target for mockery and disgust than sub-par posthumous material. Yet, amidst the cries of shameless exploitation and legacy defilement, it's easy to lose track of the fact that more material is rarely, if ever, a bad thing-- especially from an artist whose lifetime output saw but one complete studio album. The Grace EPs, the second archival release by the late Mr Buckley to hit shelves this year, is the kind of release most likely to draw criticism from all fans of all degrees. Collectors will no doubt be shitting themselves, as out-of-print and collectible Buckley EPs see re-release here in a repackaged form that not only drives down the aura surrounding the originals, but their value as well. Casual fans will surely be miffed at the fact that this box set, which bills itself as ""over two hours of music,"" consists of various interpretations of only eleven songs, five of which appeared on Grace in alternate forms. And then there are the duplicates: ""Mojo Pin"", ""Grace"" and ""Last Goodbye"" are culled straight from the album (two are radio edits), which admittedly is sort of the idea with EPs-- but even the bonus material is duplicated once, with a live version of ""Kanga-Roo"" showing up twice in identical form. So, the statistics aren't promising. And ""Tongue"", the only track here that has never seen release at all, is essentially a studio recording of an instrumental warm-up jam. But as is usually the case with such compilations, those who simply can't get enough of Buckley's tragically narrow repertoire will enjoy having it around. The Grace EPs collects five foreign and/or promotional EPs that were released around the same time as Buckley's only finished studio album. These releases, several of which were never intended to be sold to the public, showcase Buckley's incredible talent as a live performer. In fact, the early Live at Sin-√© EP is as good a point of reference for much of this material as the post-Grace live albums Mystery White Boy and Live √† l'Olympia. In fact, the Live from the Bataclan EP, which is included here, has a very similar tracklist to the Sin-√© EP, with Buckley taking on both ""Je n'En Connais Pas le Fin"" and Van Morrison's ""The Way Young Lovers Do"". Buckley, of course, had quite a talent for cover songs, and that particular strength is well-represented here. His aforementioned rendition of Big Star's ""Kanga-Roo"" (the one that appears twice in unaltered form), was included as a live track on Mystery White Boy, but appears for the first time here as a studio outtake. The song shows Buckley tempering the desperate breakdown of the Big Star original with the melancholy of his silky voice, and the result is absolutely stunning. Buckley's cover of Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" appears in several live incarnations here, as well, and the despairing wisdom of Cohen's song brings out the most heartbreaking qualities of Buckley's vocals. And, as is always the case, Buckley's voice is the star. Buckley effortlessly produces tones that are nothing short of divine, completely free of self-conscious showmanship. When he hits a high note, it doesn't sound forced; it sounds liberating. There's a sense of freedom and directness about Buckley's voice that's absolutely intoxicating-- if you listen long enough, you almost begin to feel as if he's singing through you. In spite of its various shortcomings, this is where The Grace EPs succeeds. Immersion in Buckley's music is a powerful thing, and the live tracks and outtakes on The Grace EPs will be of immense value to those who are hell-bent on amassing every version of every song Buckley ever performed, and of lesser value to those who just can't get enough of his voice. Whatever your reason, be advised that you're going to be dropping $30 for material that was largely designed to hype the release of Grace. If you haven't fallen madly in love with the main course, it probably wouldn't be wise to bother with this admittedly overpriced repackaging.","Aside from completely disastrous tribute albums and Now! compilations, I dare you to think of anything\n\ that constitutes an ...

Earphoria,The Smashing Pumpkins,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a46b13d1975652138ce0/1:1/w_160/92f906c6.jpg,2002-12-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7263-earphoria/,Virgin,"This is the second Christmas that the Smashing Pumpkins have dragged out their leftovers and repackaged them to look wonderful under any fan's tree-- a niche gift equivalent to The Beer Drinker's Bible, The Soprano Family Cookbook or The Big Fucking Book of 'Vettes. I remember the time Santa brought me The Aeroplane Flies High, a mixed bag of a- and b-sides lovingly packaged in a cool black-and-white spiral box with a dinky plastic handle. It was so neat! And they've hooked me again, with nothing more than the first official release of some cobbled-together live material from 1994: Earphoria, the soundtrack to the reissued VHS, Vieuphoria (now, of course, on DVD). Vieuphoria came out in '94, one year after the multi-platinum Siamese Dream made the band an international household name. As grunge detonated across airwaves, and we began to see early signs of emulation as every possible ""next Nirvana"" was flung into heavy rotation, the Smashing Pumpkins became one of the only alternative rock bands that could claim to have their own unique ""look"": the near-narcoleptic James Iha on guitar, blonde, heavily face-powdered bassist D'Arcy, and midwestern everyguy Jimmy Chamberlin on drums, all serving the complete domination of psychedelic Billy, an album-rocker-at-heart decorated with skin-tight, grotesque-patterned shirts boasting earthtone rainbows, paisley brigades, and countless other designs adorned only by acid-trippers and Florida from ""Good Times"". Acting as a kind of victory lap/souvenir, Vieuphoria is packed with cheaply produced interludes and home videos-- hilariously indulgent stuff, like a clip of D'Arcy having tea with her stuffed animals. But the main attraction is the live footage from concerts and television broadcasts, featuring material from Gish, Siamese Dream, and the Lull EP. (The video predates their bloated sub-masterpiece Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.) Vieuphoria was released on home video, but Earphoria was just a limited-pressing promotional CD sent to record stores. Repeatedly bootlegged and often auctioned at ridiculous prices, it now finally sees wide release. Earphoria runs through several hits from Siamese Dream, with some major reinterpretations. ""Disarm"" loses the acoustic strumming and bells that made it the most overplayed single of '93; the more interesting and brutal version here has lurching guitars and drums, and Corgan wrenches the vocals out with pliers. The disc also includes two unplugged tracks: the simple performance of ""Mayonaise"" is refreshing after the syrupy-sweet excess of the original, but more surprising, the band's grunge-anthem, ""Cherub Rock"", sounds lean and invigorated with acoustic guitars and Chamberlin's fast brushwork. Even playing it straight, Corgan and Iha had to convert the thick, enveloping sound of the album into two keyed-up guitars. The results are more manic, like the fast and urgent ""Quiet"", and a triumphant recording of ""Today"" played for a hometown crowd in Chicago. But it's the older, Gish-era ""I Am One"" and ""Slunk"" that become wiry spasms of power chords: these are easily the album's highlights and some of the nastiest rock the Pumpkins turned out. On the other hand, the on-stage frenzy diminishes two of their headphone classics. The original versions of ""Geek U.S.A."" and ""Silverfuck"" had bold transitions, molten slowdowns and giant, prog rock-like crescendos. In concert, ""Geek U.S.A."" loses much of its subtlety: they all but blow through the quiet parts. The extended thirteen-minute ""Silverfuck"" starts strong, and the dead-quiet ""bang bang you're dead/ Hole in your head"" verse (admittedly one of the worst moments on the otherwise still-fantastic Siamese Dream) provokes a gruesome little singalong with the audience. Ah, those wacky slackers. But Corgan hams it up by singing a few lines of ""Over the Rainbow""-- either because of licensing or good taste, that part is cut from the DVD-- and then tacks on a short jam that only merits a shrug as a home listening experience. You can't see that Iha's playing his guitar with a toy laser pistol, and you can't watch as Corgan sheepishly smashes his guitar and rips up the drum kit. Not that all this excuses anything. Earphoria also tacks on twenty minutes of ephemera and interlude music from the movie. ""Why Am I So Tired?"" is a fifteen-minute casual studio jam originally played over the end credits; ""Pulseczar"" is a buzzing fragment of psychedelia, and there are a few electronic curiosities, like the e-bow guitar snippet ""Sinfony"", or the blossoming ""yeah yeah yeah yeah's"" on ""French Movie Theme"". This, of course, is just garnish around the live tracks, but like I said, this is a fan release and nothing's too trivial. Hey, did you know that ""Bugg Superstar"" is about James Iha's dog? A few great live tracks aside, I wouldn't recommend this to a new or casual Pumpkins listener. For fans, the only suggestion I'd make is that if you spend as much time near a TV as you do with your stereo, just skip this disc and get Vieuphoria (you already burned this from Napster in '99, anyway). Dig the early concert clips with Corgan's hippie hair and Chamberlin's sweaty-ass mullet! Laugh at the thinly veiled hostility that wracks the band! The crew even caught the entire ten minutes that Iha and D'Arcy spent in the studio for Siamese Dream! And the between-song interviews are total gravy-- for example, Billy Corgan on fame: ""People are always like, 'What's it like to be famous?' And when I think of 'famous,' I think of people who, like, kill people."" Rock on, Corgan! Stick that in your stocking!","This is the second Christmas that the Smashing Pumpkins have dragged out their leftovers and repackaged them to look wonderful ...

Faces Down,Sondre Lerche,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcdfea9e61561daa759e/1:1/w_160/e0e3a392.jpg,2002-12-11 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4743-faces-down/,Astralwerks,"There are many things about Sondre Lerche that are almost overwhelmingly French. What makes this inconvenient, for the purposes of critique, is that he's Norwegian. But c'mon, can you really blame me for making the mistake? Check out the vowel-ending name (no √∏'s in sight), the slightly rumpled fashion awareness on the album cover, and above all, the serious Serge Gainsbourg influence on Lerche's music. I plead clueless Americanism; wasn't pretty much all of Europe supposed to be culturally homogenous by now? Having spent a little time in the linguistically hostile and hyper self-esteemed city of Paris, I pick up a vibe from Lerche that seems French, if only in attitude. Just as Parisians seem to have an almost effortless sophistication and stylishness to their clothing and behavior, Lerche projects a deep nonchalance in his nevertheless enjoyable music-- it might be the most laidback album of lush pop I've ever heard. Rather than pulling you in with sharp, insistent hooks, Lerche's songs spool out drowsily over four or five minutes, not so much sticking in your head as massaging it. This mature approach to songwriting is even more striking given that Lerche was a mere 19 years old when this album came out, which I guess makes him the Norwegian Conor Oberst. Much of the musical inspiration here appears to be drawn from the decades before Lerche's birth: lounge strings and distant female ""do doo's"" with reverb; the jazz phrasing of ""Modern Nature"", the Charlie Brown Christmas carol piano of ""Virtue and Wine"". The only contemporary artists he falls in line with are similarly retro-focused characters: ""tropicalia""-style Beck, Stereolab's arched-eyebrow space-age material, or, more obviously, the soft-folk of fellow Astralwerks Norwegians, Kings of Convenience. The drawback of this laundry list is that Faces Down is too often predictable in its dreamy arrangements, containing few surprises to separate Lerche from the legions of gents with a predilection for chamber-pop. Strident choruses in ""Virtue and Wine"" and ""No One's Gonna Come"" cut through the haze nicely, but extended attempts to turn uptempo (""All Luck Ran Out"") fall flat. Lerche's nonchalance also tends to drag songs out longer than necessary: ""On and Off Again"" could stop right at the 3:30 mark, before the theremin-accented freakout, and remain just as good if not stronger, while ""Things You Call Fate"" needlessly cycles a repetitive jam past the nine-minute mark. Nevertheless, Faces Down will likely please anyone who's into this kind of EZ-indie, as Lechre proves adept at orchestrating large-ensemble set pieces like ""Dead Passengers"", conversational duets like ""Modern Nature"", or solo croons like ""Side Two"". Lerche's slightly Beck tone (sprinkled with a hefty dose of Bowie) allows me to file this record next to the similarly imitative Schneider TM, as another 2002 album I wish the actual Beck had made instead of that bland Jackson Browne woe, Sea Change. Both singer/songwriters like to look at themselves in the mirror and pretend they're the reincarnation of preeminent French scamp Gainsbourg, but in 2002, only Lerche is pulling it off.","There are many things about Sondre Lerche that are almost overwhelmingly French.

Lost Valley EP,Black Dice,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2d3b1335d7bf169859d/1:1/w_160/adf0a47f.gif,2002-12-11 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/745-lost-valley-ep/,Tigerbeat6,"Daily noise, like any other distraction, has a way of infiltrating more deeply into my life than I'd like to admit. All the second-hand conversation, radio static and traffic roar should amount to almost nothing in the grand scheme of existence, but over the course of a lifetime, it adds up to the lion share of the sounds I hear. This won't be news to any marketer, of course, as age-old strategies of subliminal messaging via media have been wreaking havoc on my sensibilities for years. However, subversive noise isn't always such a bad (or at least annoying) thing. Some musicians have found ways of manipulating their signals to suit our inner cravings in ways both clever and strange. Think of the churning earth-rumble of Boredoms; My Bloody Valentine's wall of distorted bliss; go back even to Coltrane's sheets of sound. Black Dice's latest release taps into the notion of alluring noise, if not quite as beautifully as did their most recent full-length, Beaches and Canyons. Before this year, the Brooklyn-based band had earned a reputation for very short, wildly abrasive live shows reminiscent of the intentionally off-putting commotion of Merzbow or early Swans. Their debut full-length (2000's self-titled) was a document of just how far hardcore had come (not far? too far?) since 1982, but it also examined how disturbing the dissection of hardcore might be, the band spitting out shards of it into explosive, 30-second shells. Beaches and Canyons was the result of two years' gradual transition into a much more subtle (if not nearly so intense) beast, and Lost Valley is a minor reflection on that change. The title track begins with distant, percolating percussion and soon adds high-pitched bongos with mild, simmering guitar beneath the layer of drums. My first thought was that this is supposed to sound ""primal"", yet Black Dice actually end up sounding a lot more like moderns on a communal bent. The band uses the familiar elements of caveman trance to evoke images not of the Stone Age, but of sterile, apocalyptic landscapes and metallic ruins. Their use of electronics later in the piece contributes to this feeling, but the most telling ingredient is their stubborn refusal to ever settle into an easy groove. Even when the beat becomes steadier, spikes still jut outward, placing this music firmly outside the easy pigeonhole of your everyday psychedelic jungle music. The song becomes progressively detached from drum-circle fare as blips and screams take over near the end, only to stop on a fizzle of synth. ""Head Like a Door"" begins with a held unison note that sounds suspiciously like some of Gyorgy Ligeti's choral music used in 2001-- intentional or not, it certainly adds a touch of tension and suspense to the drone, yet again suggesting that Black Dice aren't in this for tuning in and turning out. Nevertheless, the blast of feedback and cymbals just over four minutes in is just disorientating enough to remind me where these guys came from. In some ways, it seems a waste to use such a promising drone only to destroy it so hastily, but then I'm sure fluffing my groove pillows wasn't the order of the session. This mini-CD isn't essential, but is (alongside Beaches and Canyons) yet another example of how easily noise is transformed into ear candy. Maybe it shouldn't be surprising to hear would-be no-wave bands becoming would-be no-trance bands-- even Merzbow plays laptop gigs-- but it is refreshing to see it produce such interesting results. Hit the full-lengths on either side of this first, and then come back to Lost Valley for an epilogue.","Daily noise, like any other distraction, has a way of infiltrating more deeply into my life than I'd like ...

Happy You Near,Noise for Pretend,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c41ec0084474cd0c3607/1:1/w_160/8ac0fe29.gif,2002-12-10 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5826-happy-you-near/,Hush,"Thank you, Noise for Pretend, you came by just in time. After another boring day spent rifling through corporate America's filing cabinets for wages, I emerged into 28-degree half light, shivered my way to my ice-encrusted automobile, and headed home exhausted. When I got there, Noise for Pretend were waiting for me. They stuck a martini in my hand, tossed a lei around my neck, and gave me a much-needed break from the cold and conformity that's surrounded my life for the past couple of weeks. From the moment it touches down-- the streamlined pop noir of ""The Song Formerly Known as Whatever We Used to Call It""-- Noise for Pretend's grammatically challenged debut album is as refreshing as limon Jarritos over ice. Sonically, it's about the equivalent of a spy film set in Trinidad, falling between Cancer and Capricorn, but with a healthy, tempering dose of style and cool. The trio has many weapons, but their most devastating is lead vocalist Esperanza Spalding, who also does time in Hush label head Chad Crouch's Blanket Music project, and plucks a mean double bass. She often sings with a trip-hop detachment that belies the richness of her voice, but either way you slice it, she's got quite a set of pipes (and reportedly, she's only 17). Nearly as essential to the band's sound: Ben Workman's guitar work, which is uniformly exquisite. His electric drips with reverb, recalling the off-handed freedom of The Verve's Nick McCabe, while his acoustic playing is full of Spanish flourishes and precise strumming. Not to be forgotten is drummer Christian Cochran, whose playing rarely resorts to beats taken from books, and often has a seductive sway to it, such as on the undulating ""Pants with His Halfway Down"", a Latin slink Mancini would probably find to his liking. He deconstructs the beat on ""Most Red Wagons Aren't Very Long"" to the point of negation, but it never bogs the song down. In general, the band coalesces incredibly for one so young, and recently formed. Rarely is this better evidenced than on the swaying Latin spy waltz ""Due to Lamplooking"". Spalding's bass lies down a jazzy ostinato the other members immediately latch onto, but it's the seamless transition into a funky bridge and back again that's most impressive; Noise for Pretend fashion 3\xBD minutes into something of a miniature epic. They follow it with ""Go Figure, Another Warm Day in Paradise"" (hands down my favorite song title of the year), which rides a simple beat straight at you, with some subtle, catchy guitar work from Workman. All told, Happy You Near is an estimable debut that should put Noise for Pretend on the map-- probably just east of Cuba. At the very least, it's a great big warm spot in my temporarily cold world; I'll be thinking of them while I trim the goatee of icicles from my Toyota's front license plate before work tomorrow.","Thank you, Noise for Pretend, you came by just in time.

Peotone EP,Afflictions,by: Brian James,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0205e6ef9596931fea1/1:1/w_160/af66f968.gif,2002-12-10 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/68-peotone-ep/,Captain Spazz,"The Afflictions, a Chicago band that fit comfortably within the constraints of the current ""garage"" milieu, run through six songs in fourteen minutes on Peotone, their debut EP. This is about ten minutes too many; though they mix things up a bit with the addition of saxophone and the absence of a bassist, the Afflictions bring on board the same strengths and weaknesses of most garage acts. Their high energy and simplicity make them easy to absorb and enjoy, but also bring them to the brink of monotony. The eternal struggle continues-- how do you keep rock and roll basic without it becoming boring? Over the course of Peotone, The Afflictions bounce between ideas, between success and failure, and the direction they choose to pursue in the future will likely make or break the group. They're blessed with a strong frontman in Jeremiah McIntyre, and a knack for coming up with agreeable hooks, but the presentation here undercuts more than a few good moments. It's a low-fidelity affair, and though I imagine the band is dedicated to this aesthetic, their songwriting style leads to cluttered compositions, a problem only exacerbated by muddy sound. At the risk of making a wildly misleading comparison, The Afflictions, like Sly and the Family Stone during the Whole New Thing era, are trying to pack in as much exciting material as possible without recognizing the point of negative returns. And another stumbling block: the band have difficulty embracing their music wholeheartedly, instead hiding behind ironic detachment in an effort to ensure that the audience knows they're more intelligent than their na√Øve predecessors. Dumb/funny song titles like ""You're Nice to Look At"" and ""Let's Make a Mess"" provide a couple of good chuckles, but overall leave the disconcerting impression that the music they're making is deeply inauthentic, or at least conflicted. However, the two best songs on Peotone suggest that The Afflictions are capable of becoming an impressive band. Sequenced fourth and fifth respectively, ""Janet Style"" and ""Am I Dreaming or Am I Dead"" pare down the sound to the essentials, and easily outperform their peers. With a clearer sense of purpose, these two cuts prove the band doesn't need to reach quite so far to maintain a high level of excitement, especially since their tunes tend to clock in well under three minutes. If they want to stand out from the many other bands shooting for similar targets-- and they very well could-- they should build upon this pair's strengths instead of meandering toward the realms of the snarky intellectual interlopers poisoning the very music the band's trying to play.","The Afflictions, a Chicago band that fit comfortably within the constraints of the current ""garage"" milieu,\n\ run through six ...

Quality,Talib Kweli,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc14abf31b7dc7155c30/1:1/w_160/83bfc61a.jpg,2002-12-10 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4549-quality/,MCARawkus,"When word hit that Talib Kweli had dropped longtime producer and Reflection Eternal bandmate DJ Hi-Tek for his upcoming release in favor of a more commercially viable roster of producers, you could almost hear a collective sigh rise up from the hip-hop community. Tek's quirky, jazz-informed productions provided an ideal sound platform for Talib's literate meditations on growing up in a marginalized culture. Underground classics like ""2000 Seasons"", ""Fortified Live"", and ""Some Kind of Wonderful"" radiated an emotionally immediacy and political awareness that was largely absent from mid-to-late-90s hip-hop. While Talib's new beatmakers (which include Kayne West and DJ Quik) are amongst the hottest and most creatively viable in the game, the fear was that their slicker and generally more aggressive styles would somehow taint the honesty and intimacy that has been key to Talib's success. While Quality may lack the basement charms of Tek's finest, it more than compensates by employing a funkier and more upbeat sound palate to further draw out the nuances of what is already one of the most rounded and complete rap personas in the game. What makes this record one of the best hip-hop albums of the year is its combination of maturity and joy, two emotions the genre rarely explores, much less simultaneously. Although these qualities have been evident in all of Talib's work, the infusion of new blood (particularly that of Kayne West) accentuates and revitalizes the message. Whether expressing the bliss of childbirth with Mos Def on ""Joy"" or stating the simple pleasures of everyday life on ""Shock Body"", Talib has got ""rhymes so bright that the sunshine beams through it."" Even Talib's elation here strikes as sophisticated, distinguishing itself from the materialistic acquisitions, drug binges and sexual conquests that pass for contentment on many hip-hop albums, with a spiritual center attained through an on-record intellectual honesty and emotional transparency that's still rare in a culture that feeds off inflated stereotypes of machismo posturing and stands on the political platform of fatalism and resignation. In fact, Kweli's unabashed positivity and emotional vulnerability feel almost transgressive to these ears. Even when he confronts the ills of society, as he does on the wrenching ""Where Do We Go"" and ""Stand to the Side"", there's a certain optimism and belief that by illuminating the darkness through hip-hop, we can hope to transcend the pain. ""I wanna write a way/ I want it right here/ I want to write brave words to fight fear.../ My words apply the pressure to make the bleeding stop,"" Talib raps on ""Stand to the Side"". Cynics may label social-change-via-music as a na√Øve proposition and focus solely on the music's form rather than its content, privileging MC's with buttery flows but with nothing to say. I still believe in the power of hip-hop music and culture to affect social change, and the genre's new generation has no greater prophet than Talib.","When word hit that Talib Kweli had dropped longtime producer and Reflection Eternal bandmate DJ\n\ Hi-Tek for his upcoming ...

And yes, for what it's worth, Anderson sounds a little like a sober version of the Captain; Wolf Colonel also tends to cop the lo-res aesthetic of early GBV when they don't have any better ideas (which is often). Unfortunately, they both get panned for not sounding as earthshaking as one of the greatest independent rock acts of all time. It's enough to reduce more beneficent, egalitarian folks to tears. Because, you know, ""It's all just indie rock!"" as Anderson yelps with a despicably self-referential wink on ""Jet Ski Accidents."" Apparently, that's supposed to excuse an album's worth of knowingly awkward, slightly offbeat chord progressions, lyrics that practically wet their pants to be described as ""quirky"", and some of the grainiest bedroom recording that money can't buy. Screw holding Something/Everything up to the GBV measuring stick-- it can barely justify its own tired sound. The market on this brand of noise was cornered by its giants years ago, and to break in, it's going to take something truly special. Without staggering invention, craftsmanship, or anything particularly unique to it at all, Something/Everything is a lot more like a simpleminded retrospective of the ""indie sound"" and a lot less like an album to jockey for a position with dinner and a movie (and maybe an invitation back to your place). It isn't like this is an aural gum scraping; it's more of a painful duty, and sometimes it's not even that painful. Quality songwriting doesn't necessarily need to break any molds, and Something/Everything can occasionally make its presence felt with even-handed simplicity, as on ""Astronaut, Astronaut"" or the delightful, shaky cacophony of ""Break the News"". The synthetic, beat-driven ""Citizen's Arrest"" bears mention, simply because in context, it sounds genuine and original (the rhythms provoke some comparison to Radiohead's ""Idioteque"", but even on a bad day, that's a good thing). In fact, the sugary drone of ""Citizen's Arrest"" is one of the album's finest moments, and there even are some close runners-up. However, once (and only once) does Wolf Colonel really transcend the limitations of this sound, and that ""once"" comes with ""The Sophomore"". As one sterling counterpoint to refute anyone who claims there's no possibility of expanding lo-fidelity sound, ""The Sophomore"" makes a joke of most everything Wolf Colonel has done to date. It positively thunders from the speakers, rising to a towering, epic crescendo of hissing guitar and soaring choruses. It brilliantly illustrates the simultaneous intimacy and fuzzy grandeur that made this sound so classic. Why is the rest of Something/Everything content to remain average with this kind of potential going largely unrealized? The fruits of this stale guitar/drums formula are dubious, as is Anderson's forced lyrical quaintness and his best attempt at Pollard's raspy delivery. Yet, although it houses some enjoyable moments and one brush with greatness, the majority of Something/Everything is simply decent, unremarkable music coupled with god-awful lyrics. To wit: ""The moon was up there/ Just hangin' in the sky/ Floating pretty high/ No one quite knows why/ I let out a sigh."" Me too, Jason. Me too.

Sustain,Mat ManeriJoe McPhee,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c388ea9e61561daa7f43/1:1/w_160/15a04c80.gif,2002-12-10 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5068-sustain/,Thirsty Ear,"The first time I saw violinist Mat Maneri was at the Willow Jazz Cafe, a small bar in a suburb outside Boston. He was playing in a trio with guitarist Joe Morris and, more notably, his father Joe Maneri, the great saxophonist and devout free improviser. They played an abstract, completely improvised set, with lines that could rise to flurries or insinuate themselves as lightly as paper cuts. It was an engrossing and, on the father-son side of the trio, intimate performance: even the Van Halen on the jukebox next door couldn't break the audience's total concentration. Maneri's father may be his biggest influence. Both men explore a microtonal scale that Joe invented, which takes the twelve notes of the regular octave and slivers them into seventy-two. For the listener, this means the two musicians veer into nuances of pitch but hit them with a mapmaker's precision: the subtleties are decisive and codified. This makes the music demandingly cerebral; but a more important trait they share-- and the one that makes their music more engrossing than academic-- is the absolute passion that guides their technique. In his father's case, it's the boisterous tone that burbles through his saxophone and clarinet; for Mat, it's an intensity that can be searing. He plays with the deliberateness of a cigarette burning itself out. Maneri had already appeared on some of the finest European art music labels-- ECM, Leo, and HatHut-- when he released Blue Decco for the Thirsty Ear Blue Series. That release put him on the tiny roster of America's most vital jazz imprint, and it was also his most accessible album to date, a joyful, trad-sounding jazz album that kicked off with a swinging rendition of ""Hush Little Baby"", before closing with a cover of Duke Ellington's ""I Got It Bad"", where Maneri pulled his notes so beautifully thin, he almost bled them dry. Two years later he's released his second disc on the Blue Series, and it takes a far different approach. For Sustain, he wrote abstract compositions so stretched out and/or skeletal that they almost sound formless. As on Blue Decco, Maneri works with a quartet that includes some of downtown New York's finest: Gerald Cleaver on drums, Craig Taborn on keyboards, and William Parker on bass. On soprano sax, he adds featured guest Joe McPhee, the avant-jazz legend whose career is so crucial that the HatHut label was founded specifically to document his work. This is a stellar group of improvisers, but where Blue Decco hewed close to traditional jazz forms, Sustain emphasizes seamless group interplay: the band makes slow but unyielding progress, and each track smolders. ""Sustain"" and ""In Peace"" float like clouds, while ""Divine"" moves in drawn-out shudders. Taborn mainly sticks to keyboards, and instead of adding blunt synth washes, he comps in subtle colors (as well as his patented deep-sea sonar pings). He melds with Maneri's electric viola, and as soloists, both men drift in and out of the spotlight: McPhee, more freewheeling, steps up assertively but doesn't disrupt the backdrop. The rhythm section only implies the beat, as Cleaver and Parker confidently circle the edges of the music. But then there's ""Nerve"", which resembles Miles Davis' electric fusion. Not so much fast as blaring, it features Maneri and Taborn jamming with heavy distortion; Maneri employs what might be a wah-wah pedal to make his viola sound like a guitar. McPhee plays a funky solo through the clamor, and with Cleaver and Parker crashing inwards, the piece bottlenecks like a slow car crash. Maneri separates the group tracks with five solo pieces (one per musician) that emphasize the raw sounds of each instrument. These blend into the program surprisingly well: the Maneri solo that opens the disc is engrossingly slow; Cleaver's, the most hypnotic, sounds like he's dragging a chain around his cymbal. McPhee falls short of playing actual notes, instead honing us in on the sound of his breath in his mouthpiece. Taborn's piano solo is more conventional but he lays on the sustain pedals to keep the notes hanging around him, and Parker plays an arco solo where his bowing is so deep it acquires physical girth, though his whistling overtones could etch glass. It goes without saying that capturing improvisation like this in the studio is difficult, and although none of Maneri's discs has been less than solid, his two releases on the Blue Series stand out as the tightest, most exciting, and most accessible. Of course, his recordings with his dad are also essential-- their duo Blessed on ECM is a great Father's Day gift for dads who dig free improv-- but the Blue Series deserves credit for releasing the definitive documents of a rising talent.",,8.4,
The Hands of Caravaggio,MIMEOJohn Tilbury,by: Matt Wellins,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c53513d197565213bf71/1:1/w_160/19017fcd.gif,2002-12-10 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5292-the-hands-of-caravaggio/,Erstwhile,"The very name MIMEO (abbreviated from the somewhat pretentious moniker Music In Movement Electronic Orchestra) makes it clear technology is on this collective's mind. After all, it's relatively universal, and unlike other social and political topics (or even atrocities), the forcefulness and violence of impending technology isn't something we have the luxury of ignoring. MIMEO's specific intent is the integration of acoustic and digital music, not necessarily as a comfortable cohesion, but more in hopes of defining a collective fixedly engaged in musical dialogue. Examples range from a 24-hour length performance given last year, to Electric Chair + Table, a double-disc recording of improvisations with the final say on each disc given to Rafael Toral and Marcus Schmickler, respectively. The Hands of Caravaggio is the sound of thirteen incredibly adept and inspired musicians thinking about the speed, memory, and ready accessibility of technology, and its application. It would be a tragedy to reduce this album to a simple 49-minute exercise in academic rhetoric-- there was clearly so much thought given to issues like digital interchange, the art of Caravaggio, and the concerto form that I'm conflicted whether or not to discuss the more theoretical side at all, or just ignore it in favor of the absolutely glorious, usurping clamor the group are capable of producing. Composed by AMM founding member Keith Rowe-- a man with three decades of constantly challenging and deeply thoughtful music-- The Hands of Caravaggio is a graphic score based on a recently rediscovered Caravaggio painting. To Rowe, the painting seems to embody the spontaneous but deliberate gestures that have preoccupied him for most of his career. Further connections are more or less left up to the listener, but there is no doubt that a central ingredient of constantly shifting, careful progress is responsible for a recording of such enormous, dynamic approach. The proceedings are carried out by a group of musicians already noted for their forward-thinking work in electronic music. The list is extensive. Kevin Drumm (replacing usual member Christian Fennesz), whose approach is in some ways similar to Rowe's, uses an electric guitar as a transducer more than as a musical instrument. In recent years, he's opted to use a computer to transform that massive sense of electrical energy into an audible form. Pita, whose work on the Mego label displays an obsessive degree of aural annihilation, where familiar, tangible concrete and instrumental sounds are compressed and expanded into shards of digital noise with its original source looming translucently in the background, is also a member. These names, of course, are no more or less valuable to the recording than Kaffe Matthews, Thomas Lehn, Cor Fuhler, Marcus Schmickler, Gert-Jan Prins, Phil Durrant, Marcus Wettstein, and Jerome Noetinger, all of whom have certainly paid their dues as electro-acoustic musicians, and many of which have particularly definitive work on the Erstwhile label responsible for this MIMEO release. Erstwhile's modus operandi is the bringing together of first-rate improvisers that don't normally associate with one another, and on The Hands of Caravaggio, MIMEO is teamed with another third of AMM, pianist John Tilbury. Tilbury is the sole acoustic instrumentalist on the recording, cementing the theoretical approach: exploring the piano concerto form. The instrument maintains a ruling clarity throughout, though at times its pitches and preparations can only be found in what Tilbury aptly describes as ""the nooks and crannies in which their unique resonances find subtle expression."" Rowe and Tilbury are particularly clear-headed on what they hope The Hands of Caravaggio will achieve. Cor Fuhler is used as a foil to Tilbury's immense talent, simultaneously playing the inside of the same piano that Tilbury is attempting to twist sounds from. The digital sounds of the massive ensemble meet the acoustic piano before it has a chance to get out of the gate. The Hands of Caravaggio is a prickly recording; where a piano concerto used to be an example of human virtuosity, we now see disrupted ideas, doubt, and mechanization in Golem-like velocity. It brims with freshness and the fleeting beauty improvised music rarely achieves, and proudly wears the contributors' reputations on its sleeve.

Situationist Comedy,Dillinger Four,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b98a9d034d5c69bf5249/1:1/w_160/f757b29c.jpg,2002-12-09 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2316-situationist-comedy/,Fat Wreck Chords,"If you want to bitch-slap the rat-faced triumvirate of A. Jay Popoff (Lit), Derick Whibley (Sum 41) and Tom DeLonge (Blink 182), you're not alone. The fact is, we all do, but Dillinger Four may want it just a little bit more: the commercialization of punk has made their job considerably more difficult. What used to be artistically relevant has been reduced to a mere marketing gimmick, an excuse to spike your hair all cute-like and expose your genitals in public. Against all odds, Dillinger Four demand to be taken seriously; their previous release, Versus God, said as much. Actually, it said something like: ""Hi, we're Dillinger Four. We make hard rocking, hook-laden punk rock. Welcome to our album."" And you thanked them when you listened, because it was good-- good in the way NOFX once was. Dillinger Four weren't out to invent or even reinvent anything: they knew what they liked, and they wanted more of it. Their fans sympathized, and should now embrace the follow-up, which, not too surprisingly, doesn't stray too far from its predecessor. For Dillinger Four, success means freedom. Where some punk bands sound like they don't practice-- which is awfully sad, because why be in band if you don't enjoy it-- Situationist Comedy finds Dillinger Four hitting the same downbeats, riffing in sync, and generally nailing the rock'n'roll vibe. And there are times when their creativity makes the music something more: on ""Fired-Side Chat"", which fronts the ordinary-- a speed-core verse contrasted against a midtempo chorus-- but strips down to a bass ostinato before building into a four-chord anthem that just skirts emo. ""All Rise for the National Anthem"" opts for the same speed-punk canvas, embellishing upon it with tightly wound, cyclical guitar riffs and a dash of metal crunch. ""Labourissuesinthetoydepartment"" digs deeper into the bag of tricks, mimicking a wide-open, atmospheric hardcore vibe (a la Fugazi) before steering back toward a more traditional set of punk rhythms. Given the state of pop/punk today, Dillinger Four may be impossible to take seriously. That's not to say they don't rock out, just that it may take a few years for prejudices to subside before people finally realize it. The rewards of artistic integrity aren't quite as material or immediate as those enjoyed by the Dillinger Four's glamorous MTV peers, but they certainly are rich.","If you want to bitch-slap the rat-faced triumvirate of A.

Tides of Tomorrow EP,Cave In,by: Isaiah Violante,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a55d5e6ef95969320ab2/1:1/w_160/43c206aa.jpg,2002-12-09 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1361-tides-of-tomorrow-ep/,Hydra Head,"Boston's Hydra Head Records has become synonymous with the best and brightest of the early twenty-first century hard rock scene. Boasting a catalog replete with talents like Coalesce, Soilent Green, Converge, and Neurosis, Hydra Head has helped cultivate a slew of formidable acts at a fever pitch, only to see the cream of its crop lured away by the substantially larger bankrolls of major labels. Yet, while Hydra Head's roster runs the gamut from prog to metal, few members of their talented stable have exhibited the sonic versatility of their most recent defection, Cave In. Prior to departing for the cushy confines of RCA, Cave In dropped a six-track swan song EP entitled Tides of Tomorrow, completing one of the most dramatic genre shifts in modern rock since Radiohead reinvented themselves with Kid A. Laying its noise-core roots from 1998's Beyond Hypothermia and 1999's Until Your Heart Stops threadbare, and softening the space-rock soundscapes of their critically acclaimed Jupiter LP, Cave In have chosen a more radio-friendly approach, reminiscent of ambitious indie rockers like Failure, Hum, and Juno. Combining shades of emo, alt-rock, and pop with intelligent songwriting, Cave In is clearly on the verge of major mainstream success, the kind of popularity thus far alien to the Hydra Head roster. In all honesty, most of these songs could easily wind up on your local KROQ clone's playlist, up against the likes of Audioslave, Lifehouse, and Puddle of Mudd; with the catchiness of these riffs, the innocuousness of Stephen Brodsky's vocals, and track lengths averaging five minutes, there's nothing remotely intimidating to the casual listener here. Long gone are Brodsky's designs on Tom Araya's vocal stylings: Brodsky's adopted a far more lush, melodic sound, in the vein of David Baker and Black Francis. Adam McGrath's solos are dark and infectious, meandering through Middle Eastern tonalities and metal-head white noise with ease. Peripherally speaking, McGrath and Brodsky's guitar work is the only visible link to the dearly departed noise-core Cave In of old, shuffling in a mountain of effects pedals amidst the more delicate and refined pop/rock sound. This is precisely why a track like ""The Calypso"" works so well: it blends an indie rock sensibility with subtle undertones of progressive metal and space-rock, effortlessly. The title track holds an undeniably Paul McCartney hook, suffused with Brodsky's ethereal harmonizing and the nightmarish, pop-perfect intonations of McGrath and bassist Caleb Scoffield. With a texturally rich canvas of elusive shifts and progressions, and the usual slew of Pet Sounds acoustics, Tides of Tomorrow demands multiple listens in order to fully appreciate its creamy aural goodness; much of its technique and character is lost on the casual critic. Yet, although Tides of Tomorrow excels in its display of musical growth and maturity, much of this seems lost on Brodsky as lyricist, whose metaphors are as sophomoric as ever. His voice also has a pesky habit of straying into that no-man's-land, xFC-metal falsetto. ""Dark Driving"" is a dreary but solid ballad with strong roots in the early, plodding Seattle metal scene a la Soundgarden. The song is spacious and atmospheric, but Brodsky's clumsy play on words-- ""the reality check is in the mail""-- and adenoidal Chris Cornell-meets-Rodney Anonymous timbre is a total disaster. The EP's closer, ""Everest"", falls considerably short of the majesty of its name: Brodsky's accidental impersonation of Aaron Lewis is almost unbearable. Despite the many comparisons made between Radiohead and Cave In following Jupiter's release in 2000, Tides of Tomorrow largely rehashes ground Radiohead covered on The Bends and OK Computer over five years ago. This EP won't be nearly as impressive to weathered indie rock fans as to Hydra Head loyalists; it's an album depicting the growth of an adventurous former metal band, yes, but an ultimately predictable record where the means never exceed the extremes. It's also no doubt that many purists will view this EP-- and the concurrent shift to RCA-- as a sell-out of the highest order. Granted, it's an eye-opener anytime a noise-core band attempts to expand its musical dynamic to encompass inspirations like Spiritualized and Poster Children, but it's also impossible to ignore the marked shift toward accessibility and ""easier"" listening embraced by Cave In since the close of the 1990s.","Boston's Hydra Head Records has become synonymous with the best and brightest of the early twenty-first\n\ century hard ...

Infection and Decline,Flying Luttenbachers,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bddcabf31b7dc7156044/1:1/w_160/d13b4305.gif,2002-12-08 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3122-infection-and-decline/,Troubleman Unlimited,"Destruction has always been central to the Flying Luttenbachers. It's a key ingredient in both their unique brand of punk/jazz/skronk/metal/improv music (or as the band's only permanent member, Weasel Walter, calls it, ""brutal prog""), and in their live shows (which tend to teeter mercilessly on the edge of an Andy Kaufman is-this-for-real sensibility before ending with Walter and company annihilating their setup and stomping at the remnants with nihilistic glee). Besides, the whole history of the band-- which, I should add, predates most of the ""edgy"" extreme noise bands benefiting from all sorts of instant press these days-- is interwoven with a vaguely outlined plot about the destruction of the world, civilization's fall into chaos, and the rebirth of order in the form of... a 100-foot tall green aluminum robot that hibernates underground, waiting for an opportunity to break free and fly off into the far reaches of space. (Weasel's words, not mine.) Giant robots or no, it's a far cry from the fairies-and-gnomes bullshit that served as inspiration for most stereotypical prog-rock. With all this chaos and calamity at heart, it came as no real surprise when, less than six months after the release of Infection and Decline, the Flying Luttenbachers self-destructed. One member quit, the other was kicked out. And this isn't the first time this has happened. In the 12 years since a precocious youngster forged an unlikely alliance with experimental jazz impresario Hal Russel (whose real name, for the record, is Luttenbacher), the lineup of the Flying Luttenbachers has seen more change than a tollbooth attendant. Indeed, Walter's vision seems to be one of an ever-changing band that evolves alongside his ideas, with each change, ideally, bringing him closer to realizing whatever mad ideas lurk in the dark recesses of his twisted mind. Say what you will about his music, his persona, and his fashion sense (the white button-up shirt, the X on his forehead, the boots, and the antenna in his hair): there's no denying the uniqueness of Walter's vision. His regimen is challenging, and his goals even more so. He readily (and often) admits he has yet to achieve what he's aiming for, but one gets the feeling he's getting closer. The Flying Luttenbachers' first decade saw them playing everything from structured jazz-inspired death-metal to abrasive and painfully deafening free-jazz (an incarnation that included recently revered Chicago improvisers like Ken Vandermark, Fred Lonberg-Holm and Jeb Bishop). Currently, Walter is touring on an absurd one-man-band shtick, where he plays along (mostly on bass) to pre-recorded backing tracks, cracking wise the whole time. Chuckle if you must; as Weasel recently told the Chicago Reader, ""I'm willing to take the risk of sucking, because without doing that there's no progression."" Regardless of the lineup and execution, a few elements remain Luttenbacher constants. Among them, Walter's near-humorous obsession with approach: his it's-never-good-enough demeanor, combined with a penchant for showmanship, has earned him a reputation for yelling at his bandmates during sets and tromping about, making clear his utter disappointment in his performance after many shows. He's also developed a proud inaccessibility. The Flying Luttenbachers make difficult music, precise as can be, impossible to ignore; that much always stays the same. Infection and Decline documents the last year-and-a-half of Walter's attempts to realize his far-fetched musical ideas. Dual bassists Jonathan Hischke (who also does time with My Name is Rar-Rar and Strawberry) and Alex Perkolup join him here, dueling with quick wits, quicker fingers, and a few effects as weapons, while Walter assaults his homemade drum kit with formidable, latent rage and precision. The kickoff track, ""Infektion"", opens with crescendo, escalating like the blood pressure of a speed-freaked metalhead who's just realized he's about to be hit by a truck. One bassist plays a grind-metal riff over and over while the other thrashes up the scales like he's scoring a punk rock suspense film, Weasel bashes unabashedly, and then it all stops, and changes. The music plummets, stops again, then mutates into the worst kind of call-and-response muso nightmare, as the two bassists exchange piercing high-pitched licks that would seem improvised were it not for how tightly they cling to Walter's percussive skeleton. ""Elfmeros"" begins similarly, but quickly takes a turn for the primal and propulsive: here, as on their dead-on (if more than a bit savage) cover of Magma's epic ""De Futura"", the Luttenbachers demonstrate why they're more than just a wild gimmick with a zany live show, ably navigating a composition filled with surprise twists and turns, insane feedback, and skull-crushing percussion. ""The Elimination of Incompetence"" is as challenging and epic an undertaking as Walter has ever attempted, and again, his cohorts manage every sharp turn and abrupt stop he throws their way before the whole thing crumbles to the ground. The repetitive, almost gabber drumming, and bursts of sheer noise that make up ""Destruktion Ritual"" may lack the tension or anger of its show-stopping in-concert equivalent, but it's still worthy of documentation. Music nerds everywhere ought to be glad Infection and Decline exists; it serves as the only proper recording of this chapter in Luttenbachers history, one that saw Walter claim new control over his unchained beast. He's tying up his loose ends in Chicago right now, readying himself for a move to the West Coast where he hopes he'll find a more receptive audience for his particular brand of constructive deconstruction. Maybe Weasel Walter will finally find the Mecca he's been searching for out on the west coast. Maybe he'll drive his new bandmates to create the musical monolith he's been dreaming of all these years while waiting patiently for others with a similar vision to emerge. And maybe not. But one thing's for sure: his uncertainty will feed the music. Chaos, constant change and self-described failure seem to suit Flying Luttenbachers best, nurturing a necessary fire that fuels Walter's seemingly endless excursions. And if the failures are this intense, I'm not sure the human ear has what it takes to cope with Walter's version of success.","Destruction has always been central to the Flying Luttenbachers.

One by One,Foo Fighters,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdf413d197565213b66b/1:1/w_160/5e1cf100.jpg,2002-12-08 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3147-one-by-one/,RCARoswell,"I expect to see the Foo Fighters featured in ""Have You Seen Me?"" ads on the backs of milk cartons any day now-- a band this lost needs all the help they can get. What happened to the uneasy, no-frills drive they once had? I think back to ""Everlong"" and hear Dave Grohl's uncertain musings of whether ""anything could be this good again,"" and in the clarity of hindsight, it seems the answer, unfortunately, is a deafening ""no,"" screamed over the shiniest, shallowest guitar bridges around. With every album, the Foos get slicker than before; the passion behind their songs waxed off by an ever-thickening veneer of overproduction. Right now, the Foos are so polished you can see right through them. One by One is a particularly apt title for their fourth radio-ready shout-along: slowly, inevitably, the last rough edge of the Foo Fighters' sound has been buffed away, leaving most of these songs with a palpable emptiness. Which is not to say the Foo Fighters were ever lo-fi, just that, next to this one, The Colour and the Shape could have been recorded out of a suitcase. At the very least, though, there's a sense of substance. The weightless, antiseptic cuts of One by One seem to reach for the racing glory of ""Everlong"", but fall short; they don't get their hands dirty long enough to even recall the beautiful filth of ""Stacked Actor"". Without exception, studio gloss aims to pass for the excellence the Foos have occasionally displayed on their previous two albums; it never even comes close to the relative grit and power of their debut. Now, I'd be deceiving you if I didn't say that there was a saving grace to One by One. It's a scary, awful sort of saving grace, but you take what you can get. Despite the tepid, manufactured essence of these songs, and their failure to create any sort of sustained, visceral jolt, Grohl & Co have managed to hit on a sort of mediocre consistency by virtue of the precision with which their material is recorded. Really, the fact that any of these songs sound at all distinct from one another is kind of an achievement in light of 1999's There Is Nothing Left to Lose. The glossy, assembly line techniques hold the record together, but their clinical craftsmanship creates eleven songs about as superficially interesting and diverse as they are uninspired. Grohl even seems to admit as much in the album's booklet. Throughout are crude drawings of disembodied, bleeding hearts (illustrated by renowned artist Raymond Pettibone) with accompanying text clearly retaliating against the record industry's dehumanizing of commercial music-- the old face-off of art vs commerce. On the center page, the words are handwritten: ""I do wrong to put my heart into what I write. That is no longer done."" If this is simply drama to accompany the theme of the artwork, as some might suggest, it's an awfully suspect choice of words for a record so packed with commercial potential and no actual heart. And if the sentiment is sincere, Grohl must understand that it's the choice he's made-- label execs might be aggressive or persistent, but no one's forced him into commercial viability. One by One does, in fact, deliver what the business expects-- it's a groove the Foo Fighters have hit on before, and it's the prevailing mindset behind virtually every single that hits the airwaves: mindless catchiness. We've heard it in songs like ""Breakout"", but the Foos had never put together a full album's worth of this stuff until now. And yet, even this presumedly intentional dumbing-down can't cloak Grohl's skill as a songwriter. The lyrics may be utterly banal, but the hooks are tight. And in that sense, the record isn't a total loss; if you're looking for flashy radio rock, look no further. ""Burn Away"" is like ""Learn to Fly"" lite: it soars on similar wings for about five minutes, and it's even pretty great while it lasts, but after it finds its way back to Earth, you may be hard-pressed to recall the impact. The same holds true for ""Low"", whose blistering aggression and searing guitar attack serves nicely as One by One's token kick to the groin (even if it feels more like a charley horse), despite being totally out of step with an album that largely opts for sweep over brutality. Still, if nothing else, it shows that Dave's been paying very close attention during his time with the Queens of the Stone Age. What's surprising is that, in the end, One by One's even, middling quality proves to be its silver lining. In the car, on that long descent into rush hour, it could come and go without so much as a batted eye, but neither would you be scrambling to change the disc. Its skillful composition is undeniable-- the problem is that it comes without any real strength or character. Foo Fighters have been in short supply of both for a while now, and this record might be a hint that they now plan to do without them entirely; I just can't help but miss the sincerity of their older material. At one time, Foo Fighters could pull off ""great"" with a fraction of the technical support; One by One had its sights set on ""good enough"" from the very beginning.","I expect to see the Foo Fighters featured in ""Have You Seen Me?"" ads on the backs of milk cartons ...

Rhythmix,Univers Zero,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8e55e6ef959693212ee/1:1/w_160/47a083d1.jpg,2002-12-08 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8356-rhythmix/,Cuneiform,"Once upon a time, Univers Zero were the scariest band on the block, the one that lived in the house at the end of the road with the high iron fence and unkempt lawn, their activities inside kept secret from the world outside. Early records like Heresie and Ceux du Dehors were terrifying walks through the valley of death, a chamber ensemble wheezing out moaning studies in extremely unpleasant texture and gripping dissonance. I don't know what kind of childhoods kids in Belgium have, but that country has managed to produce some of the world's most frightening bands, and Univers Zero were, without question, the most terrifying. Rhythmix is Univers Zero's second album since the band reformed in 1999 after a 13-year hiatus, and if nothing else, it proves that they're still very bizarre. At its best, Rhythmix sounds like the Merry-Go-Round breaking down in some gruesome alternate dimension; at its worst, it sounds like a troupe of mall goths found their way into the keyboard section of Sam Ash and messed with the ""spooky"" presets. Technology is a mixed blessing for older bands, offering an inviting array of new possibilities, but frequently leading them astray. And so it goes that, on Rhythmix, drummer and band leader Daniel Denis fails most frequently when he attempts to use new technology to his advantage, sticking a ""pizzicato string section"" keyboard setting into passages for which he couldn't hire actual violinists. He and co-producer Didier de Roos also shy away from the dry, unaffected sound that made Univers Zero's early albums so brutal and direct, which robs the otherwise well-composed music of some of its potential impact. Somehow, they also manage to record some of the ""real"" instruments, like Michael Berckmans' woodwinds and Bart Maris' trumpet in such a way that they sound as though they're synthesized. Still, even with its relatively neutered sound, the album manages quite a few genuinely disquieting moments, such as ""Waiting for the Sun"" (not a Doors cover), which features Bart Quartier's glockenspiel front and center and sends the other instruments to the back to scrape out a dark corner for it to sit in. ""The Fly-Toxmen's Land"" is ferociously rhythmic and even spastic at times, building to an intense coda wherein Denis pulverizes his drums for your edification while the rest of the band holds a quivering drone behind him, completely subverting the rock vein the song begins in. Elsewhere, the music is frenzied, but hampered by the production. Eric Plantain plays a pretty badass bass, but it has this bright Tony Levin tone to it for the first few tracks that just doesn't gel with the music. Thus, the staggering processional, ""Terres Noires (Blacklands)"", sounds more awkward than it was probably intended to-- the idea and composition is great, but the fake harpsichord and slap-bass suck the evil straight out of it. And that's really my biggest beef with Rhythmix. Superficially, it sounds like Univers Zero-- but without the evil, what do you have? Just another wanky prog band, I'm afraid. And while these guys are in no danger of becoming Liquid Tension Experiment anytime soon, they are risking becoming their own pale shadow, and that would be a sad waste, indeed. I urge you to give these guys a chance, but don't start here.","Once upon a time, Univers Zero were the scariest band on the block, the one that lived in the house ...

The Language of Cities,Maserati,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3c9eb335119a49ed7c8/1:1/w_160/97578239.jpg,2002-12-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5131-the-language-of-cities/,Kindercore,"Named after a second-fiddle Italian luxury car, Athens, Georgia's Maserati set themselves up for a superb analogy with the world of motorsports. A curious coincidence points us toward such a comparison: what band's name starts with ""M"", ends with ""I"", and plays grandiose, instrumental post-rock? If you said Mogwai, you made the right call. So the question, then: does the analogy hold water? The answer is twofold: sort of, but not really. Let's start with the ""sort-of"". Maserati sort-of treads a path that's been blazed two or three times over. They describe their sound as ""instrumental U2, with punk rock roots."" The first half is easy to hear in their huge, confident sound, full of spacious, atmospheric guitar work, grounded by a tight rhythm section and prominent, dynamic basslines. In essence, Maserati employs the same approach to post-rock that Mogwai does (as opposed to the more hollow sounds of a band like Godspeed You Black Emperor!). The punk half of their self-description is less apparent, appearing in the attacking moments of songs like ""Keep It Gold"". Even then, the jabbing, punk-inflected guitar work is eclipsed by a propulsive low-end, which is in turn overcome by distortion and prog flourishes. Maserati are far less fiery than they are moody: there's nothing unsettling in their mix, and they seem allergic to math and dissonance. Now, as to the ""not really"" half of our prong, the results Maserati achieve may sound familiar in this oversaturated genre, but they're not unwelcome. Though they don't break new ground, they walk field adeptly, boasting superior execution and occasionally impressive moments of fusion. ""Being a President Is Like Riding a Tiger"" is one of those moments, where a solo guitar meditates for three minutes until drums enter, hastening a Godspeed-like tempo and flavor. After another minute-and-a-half, the composition draws back, shifting gears to steel itself for crescendo: a recurrent two-measure melody carried by the bass alternates one measure in 16th notes and a full measure of rest. Spiraling above the bass are a pair of charged, supernal guitars that gradually swell as the bass modulates to play both the melody and the rests. At full bore and full volume, the band musters a powerful climax. The band doesn't reach the same heights again on the disc, but comes close on a few tracks. ""Cities"" follows a similar form, with a restrained, tense opening that segues into an uptempo jam that, while anchored by a prog bassline, is punctuated by more stratospheric guitar work. The slower material-- like ""Ambassador of Cinema"" and ""The Language""-- is also pleasant and well executed, but its meandering nature and lack of distinguishing hooks ultimately renders it innocuous. Verdict: Maserati may be redundant, but not undesirably so. They take what's already been done and infuse it with their own aptitudes and energies. The results are just fresh enough to remain engaging.","Named after a second-fiddle Italian luxury car, Athens, Georgia's Maserati set themselves up for a superb analogy with the ...

Alphabet Book,Paul Lansky,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bca613d197565213b386/1:1/w_160/929ecd50.jpg,2002-12-05 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4686-alphabet-book/,Bridge,"A,B,C,D,E,F. Tink tink, gleeeeeee. G,H,I, j-j-j, K. Bink bink tick tick tick, gleeeeeeeeee. Ah, yes, alphabet fun. How long has it been since you really had fun with the alphabet? Probably several years. There are so many letters to work with, yet the over-familiarity can kill even the best round of Scrabble. But go back even further, to the sounds of the letters themselves. How long has it been since you actually gave any thought to the sound of 'S' or 'L'? What about numbers? 3,4,5,6,7. 3. 3! Hmm. Who has time for that? These modest building blocks have long since been stored in archival areas of my mind; they aren't supposed to be interesting. American computer music pioneer Paul Lansky believes otherwise. Born in 1944, and receiving a PhD from Princeton (where he has taught since the 1970s), Lansky was one of the first proponents of both computer-based music and electronic alteration of existing sounds, and sometimes whole works. In many ways, his work is a precursor to that of modern electro-heads Fennesz, Otomo Yoshihide and Jan Jelinek, and his 1973 piece Mild und Leise was mined for samples by Radiohead, giving Kid A's ""Idioteque"" its unique synth-whir. But Lansky went further than most electronic composers by actually inventing his own musical programming language (Linear Prediction Coding), which he has made available for free via the Internet. Similar to Yoshihide and Fennesz, one of Lansky's primary goals has been to approach ""familiar things from new vantage points, using a novel perch to gain a fresh perspective on things we may have come to take for granted."" Alphabet Book tackles those early building blocks, letters and numbers, and somehow sheds a heck of a lot of light on objects we take for granted in the extreme. It's not that Lansky redefines anything here, but the bright, mystical tone clusters and narration by Hannah MacKay (Lansky's wife and longtime collaborator) cast the characters as part of an alien libretto to an ambient opera. It isn't really minimalism-- more like muted micropolyphony. That is, it appears Lansky has compensated for the potentially hyper-basic nature of the material with hundreds of minute details and configurations of a small group of objects. It's watching ""Sesame Street"" with OCD and a penchant for Tangerine Dream. The most alluring songs are not coincidentally the most superficially simple. The opener, ""ABC"", is a straightforward recitation of the alphabet by MacKay over tic-tac percussion (in places, Lansky seems to flirt with microhouse) and some seriously ominous/heavenly synthesizer clouds. As the piece gradually unfolds and the chordal backdrop ebbs, flows and threatens to overtake the entire arrangement, MacKay's enunciation becomes drawn out and double-tracked. The percussion tails the misty synth, and the trail of reverb after the letters near the track's end further obscures the list. Similarly, ""Alphanumeric Song"" recites both the alphabet and a numerical countdown of sorts simultaneously over oddly comforting bell glissandos and drones, effectively synthesizing the retro-futuristic, info-saturated music 60s sci-fi obsessives thought we were supposed to be listening to now. Everything is calm, smart and amiably removed from any reality I know. Alphabet Book also comes with three Flash animations by Grady Klein to accompany Lansky's music that are gifts from the out-of-body-experience gods-- just try keeping your pupils in line watching the clip for ""ABC"" and its post-gothic, disappearing calligraphy. Sure, spending an evening with L,M,N,O,P isn't everyone's idea of a party, but that's probably not the point, anyway. This isn't flat academia, and it certainly isn't elitist condescension towards everyday phenomena-- Lansky's music goes for a much subtler infiltration of your senses than Kindergarten ever did.","A,B,C,D,E,F.

A Valentine for Fred Katz,Fred Lonberg-HolmGlenn KotcheJason Roebke,by: Matthew Wellins,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd40abf31b7dc7155ee7/1:1/w_160/7c8ee384.gif,2002-12-05 06:00:03,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4835-a-valentine-for-fred-katz/,Atavistic,"Pittsburgh's local public radio station, WDUQ, was responsible for some particularly unique late-night programming, especially on Sundays. Unable to sleep, dreading another middle school Monday, the diversion and mentally exhausting activity DUQ provided often allowed me to fall asleep with ease. Relevant specifically to this review, however, is what came on at 1:30 a.m., the timeslot I longed for during the week: Ken Nordine's Word Jazz . Nordine would embark on tangents about colors, nagging wives, sit-down-showers, bohemians, whistling, movie scripts, and his favorite topic of discourse, language and thought. Perhaps most emblematic of Nordine's style was the constant personification and visualization of language and sound, exemplified in pieces like ""Reaching into In"" (available on the Rhino Word Jazz compilation), where, as the title explains, he attempts to reach into the very ""in-ness"" of ""In"". You can only imagine what a disappointment it was for a kid who grew up listening to this stuff to have to learn about semantics. I haven't gotten to the cello-playing and compositions of Fred Katz yet because I didn't know who he was until last week. Until I heard the recent tribute, led by consistently adventurous cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm (Peter Br√∂tzmann Tentet, Lightbox Orchestra), I had no idea Katz was responsible for a good share of the backing music that mingled with Ken Nordine's bizarre monologues over the airwaves each week. The work with Nordine is what drew me into Katz's work; it would have been enough to secure his place in the history of strange music, but Lonberg-Holm's tribute brings to light solo cello LPs, work with Chico Hamilton, and a nice chunk of soundtrack compositions, most notably with Roger Corman (though of Katz's film work, only a piece written for a Burt Lancaster film-- in which Katz appears-- makes it on to the album). These are recordings I imagine many, including myself, will be more than inclined to hear after Valentine's convincing argument. The execution by Lonberg-Holm, Wilco percussionist Glenn Kotche, and bassist Jason Roebke is at least partially responsible for this newfound enthusiasm, but the instrumental mastery and subdued sweetness of this recording isn't enough in and of itself: it stands up thanks to Katz's songs, presented with pristine delicacy and consideration. John Corbett's liner notes suggest that Lonberg-Holm's interest in Fred Katz might have something to do with the shortage of cello-centric jazz musicians, but more than a cellist, Katz showcased the instrument in his pieces. Corbett remarks that the cello has roughly the same tonal range of the favored jazz instrument, tenor saxophone, yet the use of double stops, glissandi, pizzicato, and emphasis on timbral color are all focal points for Katz's work, accented twofold by Lonberg-Holm's choices as an interpreter. The interplay between Jason Roebke's acoustic bass and Lonberg-Holm's cello is a particular pleasure, as they exploit their similar tone for dynamic counterpoint. Kotche's percussion might be easy to overlook, as his degree of professionalism and light touch make for seamless playing, but when he makes a pronounced gesture, as he does in the ""The Squimp"", it catches the listener by surprise-- and just ten minutes before the album ends. The trio plays two standards and one original, allowing the listener to get a feel for what is specifically unique to the recording, and what is due to Katz's fairly idiosyncratic compositions. Lonberg-Holm's composition, ""Mystery Kat"", adapts to and explores Katz's rhythmic nuance and exotic harmonies. A gorgeously drawn-out, warbling rendering of ""My Funny Valentine"" shows one of the many appeals of cello in a jazz setting, especially to the distinctively reductive aesthetics of so many modern jazz musicians on the Atavistic label. There's no concern about breathing, as there would be with a horn, so notes can linger indefinitely. Fred Katz's music is well served by Lonberg-Holm's trio, in spite of the fact that A Valentine for Fred Katz might be a more down-to-earth, traditional affair than its participants have been involved with in quite some time. Lonberg-Holm displays a reverence for Katz that saturates each track, bypassing the inane bravado that makes its way into so many jazz recordings, and making a somewhat brief 40-minute album feel remarkably full.","Pittsburgh's local public radio station, WDUQ, was responsible for some particularly unique late-night\n\ programming, especially on Sundays.

The Parker Tapes,Cassetteboy,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a545ea9e61561daa50d1/1:1/w_160/5fca12c7.gif,2002-12-05 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1339-the-parker-tapes/,Barry's Bootlegs,"It's easy to dismiss this as a prank album. With a non-stop, wacky surface and a calamitous flow of cheap laughs, The Parker Tapes sounds like the kind of novelty record you'd only own to one-up your friends' Jerky Boys albums. Even ""Mike""-- who, with someone named Simon, makes up Cassetteboy-- dismisses it this way: ""Basically we record famous people and make it sound like they're talking about sex or drugs. It's a winning formula."" But this is far more than a string of gags. The Parker Tapes is composed entirely of voice and music samples, cut to shreds and reassembled over the course of seven years. It's a labor of love-- a kind of life achievement for the semi-anonymous duo that made it-- and it's also extremely funny, marked by a dry British wit and an ear for great sound bites. They set the tone early with a re-edit of David Bowie's ""Space Oddity"": ""Here am I shitting in a tin can/ And I'm farting in a most peculiar way."" This clip lasts approximately 18 seconds, and then they're onto the next thing; the disc has almost a hundred distinct tracks, each running into the next, jammed with cuts and samples. A prim British woman narrates a sex act; a respectable BBC reporter intones, ""Bill Gates is part of the Forces of Darkness""; Bill himself notes that Microsoft can ""make people do things""; Julia Child suggests, ""If you have a child handy, put it through a sieve,"" and, ""A cup of tea goes very well with a joint. It's a hallucinogenic drug. I love it. Stoned. Stoned. Quite high. Look at those donkeys. Lovely bunny rabbit. Fluffy bunny. Rabbit stew."" And so on. Cassetteboy have formidable technique: you'd think a busy collage like this would take a lot of effort to sit through, but it's so fluid and methodical that it carries you along rather than wearing you out. The guys break things up with dozens of music clips and remixes, from hip-hop to pop, making for a kind of post-modern vaudeville, and they construct each voice track with attention to rhythm and flow. Listen to ""Joliver"", which remixes clips from Jamie Oliver (BBC's The Naked Chef): they make fun of him (""I'm a bit of a tosser""), but they also build an interesting rhythmic pattern into his speech. It's this skill, as much as their sense of humor, that has landed some of these tracks in the Boom Selection of bootleg recordings, and earned their work favorable comparisons to the high-concept Plunderphonics of John Oswald. They've also earned praise for their satire, which is the most striking part of the record. Cassetteboy use their hard-won irreverence to sneak in vicious political humor, and these pieces have become their most circulated and notorious works. One of their earlier singles, ""Di & Dodi Do Die"", tore down Britain's beloved Princess Diana, but it sounds blunt and sluggish compared to the attacks on this album. For example, they mock Prime Minister Tony Blair, twisting his words to say that the Labour Party will start slashing eleven-year-olds with a knife. In this country, the most devastating track is ""Fly Me to New York"", which mocks the only thing Americans don't make fun of: the attacks on the World Trade Center. I don't want to give away too much for those who haven't heard it; I just have to hand it to Cassetteboy that not only is the piece disturbingly brutal, but their decision to build it around samples of Frank ""New York, New York"" Sinatra is the final nail in the coffin of good taste. And yet, whenever I play it for people they're reduced to fits of laughter, no matter how much they object to its criticisms of America. And isn't that the key to great satire? Whether you listen to it once for laughs or study it in depth; whether you take it as a comedy record, a major statement, a technical and aesthetic accomplishment, or just a couple of guys doing silly shit with their tape recorders, this is a hilarious, gripping album. Don't turn your back on it.","It's easy to dismiss this as a prank album. With a non-stop, wacky surface and a calamitous flow of ...

Total Lee!: The Songs of Lee Hazlewood,Lee Hazlewood,by: Kyle Reiter,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c08bc0084474cd0c31df/1:1/w_160/222ba1bf.gif,2002-12-05 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3784-total-lee-the-songs-of-lee-hazlewood/,Astralwerks,"Buried deep within the liner notes of Total Lee!: The Songs of Lee Hazlewood, is a reasonable plea: ""Demand official induction to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame for Lee Hazlewood."" This is followed by the address of said institution. While the obscurity of Lee's work may leave some scratching their heads, Total Lee! brings the unconverted one step closer to understanding exactly why his acceptance to the rock'n'roll pantheon is indeed logical. For almost four decades, Hazlewood has epitomized the renaissance man: songwriter, producer, singer, actor, label owner, faux-Swede, artist developer (most notably Duane Eddy, Nancy Sinatra, and Gram Parsons), cowboy in exile and, with the exception of the rabid cult which usually accompanies such uncompromising artists, he's done all of this without ever gaining the recognition he undeniably deserves. Recently, both hipsters and old-school obscurists alike have sung the praises of Hazlewood to Skip Spence-like proportions. Naturally, Total Lee! is ripe for the pickin'. Steve Shelley's Smells Like label began reissuing Hazlewood's albums in 1999, and is now accompanied by Astralwerks' compilation in tribute to the man's career. While the material being paid tribute to is both thought-provoking and playful, Total Lee! unfortunately works better in theory than in practice (like most tributes), though it does thrive a bit more than your typical musical homage. The strongest contribution to Total Lee! comes from a group called Madrugada, whose cover of ""Come on Home to Me"" completely alters the song's attributes-- in the hands of these Norwegian rockers, this somber ballad becomes a charging doomsday crooner. By the same token, King of Convenience's Erlend √òye successfully delivers ""No Train to Stockholm"" by reversing its 70s soft-rock harmony to a solo acoustic whimper. The Webb Brothers effortlessly update ""Some Velvet Morning""; they could easily pass their version off as an original were they capable of penning anything quite so poetic themselves. UK session man and recent Pulp contributor Richard Hawley teams up with Jarvis Cocker for ""The Cheat"". In fact, over the course of the album's 60 minutes, more indispensable namedrops show up for a turn at Hazlewood's catalogue: Evan Dando, Calvin Johnson, Calexico, the list goes on. It's not all worthwhile, but this man's renaissance is long overdue, and most of these artists do his songs justice nicely. In the liner notes of this release, Lee Hazlewood himself gives a track-by-track opinion of each song as he hears it for the first time. His opinion ranges from enthused (Stephen Jones & Luke Scott, Kathryn Williams) to the cordial (Calvin Johnson, The Amazing Pilots). But it's interesting to get an idea of what the artist thinks of his own tribute (much like The Kinks homage, This Is Where I Belong) although much of the dialogue is directed at the songs themselves. What makes the album far from essential, yet still enjoyable, is the rediscovery of songs that are so heartbreakingly genius, yet so neglected. Rather than just demonstrate their love for a popular artist (see 2000's Badlands: A Tribute to Bruce Springsteen's Nebraska), the musicians on Total Lee! bring a contemporary element to an abandoned body of work that reminds us just how essential it really is.",,7.1,
Two,Andrea Perry,by: Brian James,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0409d034d5c69bf2688/1:1/w_160/d413c910.jpg,2002-12-05 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6243-two/,Trust Issue,"Since women are still in the overwhelming, overwhelmed minority of musicians, it's difficult to discuss female performers without making at least a discreet reference or two to their gender. The artists that seem to escape this curse are, sadly, the ones that conform to sexist stereotypes, depicted as weak, submissive, and desperate to subsume their identities in a romantic relationship. Those who've tried to slip this yoke would have been blasted in a less sensitive era with accusations of masculinity, but today, they're greeted with condescending girls-can-rock-too rhetoric from misguided critics. The whole situation is enough to make you throw your hands up in disgust, when along comes someone like Andrea Perry, offering a graceful escape from the gendered ghettos of pop music. An mp3.com darling, Perry follows up her debut, Saturday Morning Sweet Shoppe, with the appropriately titled Two. She runs through a dozen songs in forty minutes, proving along the way that the attention she's garnered thus far is no accident. Despite her idiosyncrasies-- and there are many-- Perry remains easily accessible, never letting her unique artistic vision slip into insularity. This is surely due to the fact that, at heart, she's a pop songwriter, and a very fine one at that; though some tracks inevitably shine above others, all twelve display an assured sense of craft. The hooks are never repeated ad nauseam; the bridges always arrive in the nick of time. Perry is able to marry simple joys with depth and sophistication, as on the opener, ""Bursting Through the Clouds"", a potentially radio-friendly crossover hit, but its magnificent chord progressions signal the author is capable of sustaining whatever attention she grabs. An even more daring balancing act arrives with ""I Think of Nothing"", which chugs along in a disorienting 5/4 beat beneath an ethereal cloud of melody. The degree to which Perry was responsible for these sonic details makes the album's accomplishments all the more striking; she plays everything except the drums, and sounds thoroughly comfortable on bass, guitar and keyboards. Perry earns added accolades for her production as well: the record feels crisp and clean without veering into sterility. Drummer Chris Searles, the only other musician on Two, is as sympathetic a partner as Perry could ask for, keeping busy without becoming intrusive. Together, they give the songs the thrust they need to keep from stalling. With all due respect to Perry's talent, what makes Two a success is her attitude. While her liner notes reveal the album is dedicated to a deceased former bandmate, and a quick look at her lyrics reveals no shortage of somber subjects, the music itself is luminous and joyful, a rare thing in these irony-soaked days. If Perry has a weakness, it's that she occasionally works this happy-sad angle into the fey, but like Marc Bolan's records with T.Rex, Two has more than enough conviction and charm to make its overt songwriting forgivable.","Since women are still in the overwhelming, overwhelmed minority of musicians, it's difficult to discuss female performers without making ...

Approximate Love Boat, Zelonky's Low Res debut, remains a masterpiece of out-there jazz/noise/IDM: his take on jazz was both hipsterish (borrowing heavily from the space-age bachelor end of the jazz spectrum) and elitist (in its warped, misshapen moments). Blue Ramen, as befits an album whose title denotes exotic noodling, furthers Zelonky's exploration of alien jazz approximations. It's as unsettling as it is spirited-- the Martian equivalent of Les McCann's Layers. ""Shaftasia"" opens the album with fuzzed-out keyboards and rumbling percussion. Looser than a telltale's mouth, the track meanders through awkward harmonies, Morton Subotnik-style electro-acoustic spaciness, and some Sly Stone funk. The Latin jam ""Bailamami"" treads on Se√±or Coconut's kitschy toes, but tempers humor with the old world pathos of the Buena Vista Social Club. ""Blue Ramen #3"" continues that melancholy with a teary, cinematic organ, serenading a lost love; ""Blue Ramen #2"" follows swiftly with a freak-beat, Fisher Price take on the same theme. The bourbon-and-smoke blues of ""Chalky"" and ""Dirty Serenade"" are the sort of wee-hours laments you'd expect to find in a second-rate science-fiction film. But while their emulation of Rashied Ali's infinite percussion is engaging, both fail to evoke more than the bleeding colors of a badly developed b-movie. Now, certainly, b-movie soundtracks have their place in my cold heart. It's just that it's apparent that Zelonky doesn't understand the lightweight nature of the Max Rebo Band's mutant melodies: he's actually trying to sell us this stuff at face value. Things look up on ""Veneer"", as he imagines Eric Satie drifting through the cosmos, picking out chromatic commentaries on his interstellar sojourn. But the record ends a bit anti-climactically-- as if to prove he's capable of conventional performance, Zelonky closes Blue Ramen with the relatively pedestrian ""Heliotropic 5"", a gutsy, stomping tune that cloaks nonconformist viscera at its deeply buried core. Blue Ramen exists, for me, as an alternative soundtrack to John Carpenter's longhaired, paranoiac deep-space comedy, Dark Star. Zelonky's imperfect, cloudy jazz perfectly mimics the stir-crazy atmosphere of the film: just as you think you've got your head in the same galaxy, he punches the coordinates for a far freakier sector of the universe. In a world of music designed by robots, the extraterrestrial Blue Ramen distinguishes itself in its approximate humanity.","With Blue Ramen, Danny Zelonky returns to the moniker that made his name, and to the label whose profile he ...

Improvisations and Edits: Tokyo 26.09.2001,Jan JelinekComputer Soup,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9e75e6ef95969322a8d/1:1/w_160/d9fcf1ca.jpg,2002-12-04 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4236-improvisations-and-edits-tokyo-26092001/,Audiosphere,"Jan Jelinek titled his 2001 full-length loop-finding-jazz-records in reference to his compositional technique: sampling and manipulating tiny fragments of jazz vinyl. Critics never failed to mention how it was put together, and a lot of them claimed to hear elements of the source material in Jelinek's grooves. As much as I loved loop-finding-jazz-records, I didn't really hear the jazz embryo it supposedly matured from. That might have been because I fell in love with Jelinek's sound via personal_rock, an album he recorded under the name Gramm in 2000. Personal_rock has a palette quite similar to loop-finding-jazz-records, but the sources for his warm, crackly sound remained a mystery at that time. I believed the hype regarding his inspiration for loop-finding-jazz-records, but the samples were transformed so radically that the sounds could rightfully be called Jelinek's own. Jelinek's relationship with jazz was a little fuzzy through his first three full-lengths, but this excellent collaboration with Japanese electronic improv trio Computer Soup makes the connection plain. Jelinek's Rothko-esque technique-- all warm, blurred hues and unpredictable surges-- fits perfectly with Computer Soup's jazz aesthetic. At its best, Improvisations and Edits (recorded live in Tokyo last September, then tweaked in the studio) is a signpost pointing toward a new path for electronic, improvisational music. What makes the record remarkable is the way it refers back to the patterns and history of jazz, as well as our collective memories of the genre, while still managing to sound like another strand of music altogether. The mind-blowing first track ""Straight Life"" is perhaps the best example of what the album has to offer. Jelinek's trademark smears and washes occupy the midrange, like ghosted images of Joe Zawinul's electric piano floating quietly in the wind. DSP jazz modes are set against a walking bassline (possibly computer generated) and a gently tooted trumpet complete with Harmon mute, a dead ringer for Miles Davis' Prestige-era ballads. The effect is something like a three-dimensional film, with different realities on each layer; images of what jazz was manage to interact with a real-time demonstration of all it could be. Computer Soup lean heavily towards electronics themselves, so it's not always easy to know who does what. There's some plucked guitar, and that muted horn crops up repeatedly throughout the record, but the bulk of the sounds seem to bubble up from deep within circuitry. ""Ballads"" echoes the dreamy feel of the opening track with only slightly less success, but ""The New Anthem"" is a jaw-dropping return to form, as Jelinek's heavily modulated chords and glitches again duet with the serene trumpet wails, this time backed by some light cymbal brushing. ""Hot Barbecue"" shows the collaborators in a less controlled mode, with chaotic computer-game bleeps working to elbow the horn out of the way. The noisy tracks are a bit less unique, as they discard the multi-layered, referential depth that makes the best aspects of this album so powerful. ""Watch What Happens"", while toned down a bit, meanders and comes up short. Such is the nature of improvisation: you often have to sit through moments of tedium to arrive at brilliance. Like any free-form collaboration worth its mettle, though, Improvisations and Edits summons a handful of those epiphanies.

Surrounded by Thieves,High on Fire,by: Isaiah Violante,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0dd13d197565213bae8/1:1/w_160/f418c426.jpg,2002-12-04 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3863-surrounded-by-thieves/,Relapse,"In his 1964 book Understanding Media, Marshall McLuhan coined the phrase ""the medium is the message."" As advances in technology yielded an inscrutably decentralist, mechanized culture that hypnotized viewers with sensory overload, many stopped questioning content: mere association with a valid medium validated any product. As far as contemporary music is concerned, genre has usurped ""medium"" and many listeners have come to define an album or artist according to its relative standing within a predefined class. If ""medium is the message,"" image is its courier. Within the contemporary metal scene, we've seen a rash of bands latch onto a core group of image-conscious (but decidedly working-class) metalheads seeking to supplant stereotypical, thuggish ""old-school"" modes with a politically correct amalgam of MENSA and anger management. As is often the case, especially with bands like Isis and Mastodon, so much effort goes into manufacturing that sludgy, choleric sound that most of the music's spontaneity and excitement goes missing in action. Northern California's High on Fire, on the other hand, show there's still hope for a metal band to not only operate according to its own whims, but also produce organic and monstrous music, devoid of bullshit. Working at the fringes of stoner/doom metal, High on Fire-- guitarist/vocalist Matt Pike, bassist George Rice, and drummer Des Kensel-- are as powerful and gargantuan a threesome as metal has produced since the mid 90s. Their new LP, Surrounded by Thieves, pushes drone to its limits, with a crushing wall of bass tones guaranteed to alter heart rhythms and weaken building infrastructures. High on Fire have unleashed an album of old-school metal with all the meaty sloth of Black Sabbath and Saint Vitus, and the drug-induced grooves of Obsessed and Celtic Frost. Employing vintage tube amps and minimal studio acrobatics, Pike, Rice and Kensel recorded a relentless forty minutes of unadulterated gloom. There's no interest in excess here, no melodic distraction or polyrhythmic frill; all energy is devoted to establishing mood, with thundering grooves and economical phrasing. With the album's opening title track, High on Fire launch into a massive riff, with gently shifting melodies entwined within power chords and a seismic wave of repetition. The low end is so overwhelming that it frequently washes out any neighboring treble tones. But that's the point, isn't it? The strength of this album lies in its nihilistic theme and all-encompassing walls of drone. Pike's lyrics, while often somewhat trite, capture High on Fire's minimalist ideals perfectly; hovering between iron frenzy and hoarse despair, Pike's intonations serve as a subtle tonal counterpoint. In ""Hung, Drawn, and Quartered"", Rice and Kensel pound through a primal groove with marked precision, as Pike rounds out the barren landscape with, ""The evil has come and the darkness will cover the light/ Above the legions, who will slay the poor and the blind/ Warriors that follow, won't you read the sign and the time/ Stand now in battle and we'll crush the clan and their kind."" Pike's solo-- and make no mistake, the guy can absolutely shred-- is fantastic, and one of the band's most interesting anomalies; representing a departure from the droning, methodical pace, providing tangential harmonics and perhaps a new direction for the band. ""Thraft of Cannan"" is High on Fire's most blatant homage to the slumbering stupor of Paranoid-era Black Sabbath. Trudging through an unremitting progressive blues jam at a snail's pace, ""Thraft"" is eight minutes of ambient, minimalist metal at its best. As the band gradually, stealthily ascends to the fastest tempos on Surrounded by Thieves, Pike launches into a ferocious solo of shapes and colors while Rice's brilliant bass work cements the groove beneath Kensel's meandering toms. With nary a snare drum in sight, and little modulation, Kensel's drumming is a lesson in feel and consistency. If you've never experienced street drugs, it's a safe bet you probably won't enjoy this album. I'd also suggest getting your kicks some place else if you're medicated for Attention Deficit Disorder: as is the case with all doom metal, this album is an exercise in patience. Where High on Fire separates itself from the pack is its disregard for the usual cluster-fuck of tricks and trappings pervasive in the alternative metal scene. Matt Pike's threesome is a blue-collar collective; yes, the production is pure aggro, but the band makes no pretense about their DIY image-- no flashy one-sheets are necessary. Shunning all tacky ploys and glitz, High on Fire's Surrounded by Thieves develops a wholly organic aesthetic of granular strength and power, propelling this disc well beyond the hackneyed trash of lesser modern metal bands.","In his 1964 book Understanding Media, Marshall McLuhan coined the phrase ""the medium is the message.""

I'm Coming Home,St. Thomas,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a53913d1975652138ecb/1:1/w_160/4169e6ea.jpg,2002-12-03 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7455-im-coming-home/,Misra,"I don't speak Norwegian very well. For this reason (and many others), I do not perform alt-country music in Norway. But apparently, what seems like common sense to me is nonsense to St. Thomas (aka Thomas Hansen), Norway's most popular alt-country artist. Language barriers? No barrier at all for this man. He is determined to bridge all cultural gaps and bring his Norwegian music to America in its native tongue. To wit: ""Oh, there are horses everywhere/ Little doggies barking at the chair/ Oh, please get out of my hair/ Small elephants doing their distance/ Well, what do I tell you now/ Will you ever know somehow/ Please do not understand/ That I am a normal man."" For those of you not yet overcome by profound grief, take this: ""Emily Lang has got me so far/ It can't get it any worse/ Emily Lang is in my head/ And I am in her purse."" In her purse! Oh, empathize for poor St. Thomas. For a number of years, Hansen toiled as a postman, but something hit him-- namely, the twin muses Will Oldham and Elliott Smith, whose music prompted Hansen to leave the letters behind in pursuit of his singer/songwriter dreams. So far, the choice has paid off well, as he's scored top-ten pop singles and critical acclaim throughout his homeland. This attention caught the eye of U.S. label Misra, who picked up I'm Coming Home for a stateside release. Sure, the Smith/Oldham influence is apparent, but even more apparent (and less egregious) is an uncanny resemblance to After the Gold Rush-era Neil Young. The falsetto warble St. Thomas employs sounds not unlike Young performing on ""The Muppet Show"" with the Swedish Chef harmonizing. I could forgive this if it were somewhat modified (something like how Doug Martsch and Jason Lytle and Wayne Coyne do it), but Hansen gives us a straight impersonation. This, coupled with his cribbed song structures, make it clear he's still trying to figure it all out. Ditto for the music: while the opener, ""The Cool Song"", has a catchy, campfire appeal that, combined with its urgent, compact melody, impels sympathetic foot-stomping, a background of curious percussion, fiddles and a drum circle on ""Bookstore"" are pure essense-of-Oldham. Hansen then tops this off with a chirping vocal performance, and though the music is dense, uniformly well executed and nicely produced, it's ultimately unremarkable given its inspiration. The guy's just aping his mentors, ill-equipped to blaze his own path. But St. Thomas is likely just getting warmed up. If nothing else, he's committed to his genre and has a decent pedigree. It's even possible that, if his English improves, he may rise above the kitsch factor for which he is quite obviously exploited.","I don't speak Norwegian very well.

"Shut Up, You Fucking Baby",David Cross,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6ad5e6ef95969320dcd/1:1/w_160/33741f2e.jpg,2002-12-03 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1675-shut-up-you-fucking-baby/,Sub Pop,"I hereby admit to belonging to a pathetic cadre of ""Mr. Show"" devotees. We've hosted sedentary marathons in our apartments, stockpiled Bob and David bootlegs bought on eBay, and incorporated the ""lessons"" from the show's skits into our lives like parables from some foulmouthed, existential Tele-Talmud. I also admit to having developed a strange, extra-textual concern for David Cross. Likeminded futon-psychoanalysts fret over his fluctuating weight, his fitfulness and despondence, his drinking and drugging, and the degree to which he seems either to be ""really trying"" or ""just getting by."" We even think we've detected some anxiety in him regarding his age and an apparent prolonged adolescence, a tension common in indie-folk old enough to remember when a Buffalo Tom t-shirt (Cross sported one here and there back in the day) was a Friday night staple. I recently got a chance to impose my assumptions on Cross in person, when ""Mr. Show""'s ""Hooray for America"" tour came to DC. The day of the show, I was in a posh glasses shop, begging the clerks to fix the specs I'd destroyed the previous night. I'd already spotted Henry Fool's Thomas Jay Ryan that day, so by the cosmic idiotic rule of three, I was due for two more brushes with unbridled famousness. My friend was staring at some cyborg-shades that fit over your skull, like a mohawk blended with that Bespin robo-slave's digi-headwrap. That's when I saw a wiry David Cross sneering through the shop's doors. We pursued him, noting that he was smaller than we'd dreamed (a fragile flower). Flinchy and downcast, he looked miserable between his headphones, which we imagined he might be wearing as some form of protection. We stalked him until he went into an international news store, and gentle giant Ralph Nader came striding from the opposite direction, fulfilling the trinity and forcing us to recalibrate our gawking. On his new double CD, David Cross trashes President Secondbush's leadership by claiming that even Nader would have bombed Afghanistan. He also gives his would-be nannies many, many reasons to worry about his ""wellness."" Shut Up, You Fucking Baby! could be subtitled Portrait of the Atheist as a Ranting Phantom. David Cross's latest comedy project will elicit laughter, but without the uplift: his drive to amuse via rage is, ultimately, a colossal bummer. Slathering fangeeks-- the people already trafficking in the album's punchlines instead of being independently funny; the ones who bought up the depressing heap of catchphrase-merch at the Mr. Show concerts-- are too quick to make a guru of Cross and his sharp, protean mimicry of Odenkirk's nonlinear child-man. The comic principles in Cross's stand-up and on ""Mr. Show"" work, though they're so exciting at first encounter, they threaten to become crutches. These elements are amusing, but not new: they're not what we non-slathering-- but still sick and needy-- ""Mr. Show"" disciple-scum expected from this long, long player. You decide: A) Profanity. See the title! See the warranted explicit content sticker! See the cuss-pocked liner notes that end with an apology for all the ""lazy"" swearing! I love me some potty mouth, but after repeated plays of this CD, the listener begins to understand that profanity is nihilistic, a kind of anti-language: utterances that eliminate themselves. The fucking planet's full of fucking fuckers, according to this fucking disc, and fuck, man, are they fucking fucked. Will future cultures view our profanity as a generational cry for help, since so many funny and intelligent folks' response to our global predicament is to flee to the sweet, default comfort of obscenity's shitty asshole? (See also The Onion and Get Your War On.) B) ""Breaking whatever walls are left, now that everything's meta-."" Like a scrappier Letterman, David Cross loves to leave piss-stains on the parameters of sketchy comedy and stand-up. On this mammoth, career-defining statement, he includes an audience member's apparently drunken interference, and an impromptu trashing of people who forgot to turn off their telecommunications revolutions during his performance. C) Reading from sources. Like his earlier readings from Goodpussy or spurious dating guides, Cross presents some anecdotes from a Promise Keepers handbook, an Atlanta newspaper, and an ad for Squagels. The riffing is exquisite, but not singular: the world's full of material so painfully absurd that it can speak for itself. Cross comes off like a kid throwing a pebble at a charging pit bull; I'd assume most of us spend a good part of our dayjob hours spotting similarly maddening minutiae, as a salve against the ways it overwhelms us. D) Risking alienating your audience. Squint in bastardized awe as Cross confidently offers his sickest Catholic-blast since the raped-by-Mary bit in his much tighter HBO special ""The Pride Is Back"". It involves children, duh, and it needn't be repeated by anyone who believes their soul has a Velcro underbelly to which crud could stick. A moment involving the n-word is the boldest mock unveiling of concealed prejudice since Denis Johnson's African breakdown in his essay collection Seek. In ""The Pride Is Back"", Cross had even made fun of losing his audience, saying, ""Yeah, get to the comedy, enough of this 'I don't like Jesus'."" By the second disc of Shut Up, You Fucking Baby!-- which is much more vitriolic than the comparatively frivolous first-- Cross has obviously passed the point of no return, and is so clear in his convictions/aversions that he can tirade and judge as if atop a soapbox in the center of a Kurtzian compound. Cross even mines the ruins of the World Trade Center for comic zirconium, preferring to call ""the events of September 11"" ""the week football stopped."" The package's most glorious image comes in his description of a New York rollerblader outfitted with a deluxe gas mask-- what a perfect icon for this age of perfect icons. Though I find his spiel about the WTC rubble's foul smell almost inhumane, he is brave to tiptoe, then stomp onto terrain viewed as off-limits for comedy, which is still a very hypocritical stance for a country that freely circulates jokes about Helen Keller, Anne Frank, Ethiopians, dead babies, and the Challenger astronauts. E) Lengthy, impassioned skewering of marginal celebrities. Rickey Henderson gets it this time! And the VH1 non-band Harlow! Before you can think ""who's next, Rhea Perlman?"" remember that Cross knows these aren't moving targets, and that's his point: look how much !#@%!&$ mental space these ""stars"" take up. F) Disdain for mass gatherings/trends. A running theme in his career, from the days when he'd harangue the Aspen Comedy Festival, to his anti-award-show rants, to his Tampa Bay story about the abused elephant's galactic vagina. Now comes this album's impaling of Atlanta street parties and the flag fad. Cross is the portrait of homeland insecurity, doomed to a state of Ashcroft-ordained heightened alertness. G) Disdain for religion. He even admits to being ""obsessed,"" and he sounds it, more so than ever. At some points his voice trembles, he yells, and even repeats himself-- just like the preachers he's excoriating. The irony of sounding preachy about being preached to is heavy, unfunny freight. Again, you might enjoy bits of this (""missile defense shields work by magic,"" Cross explains) but it's hard on the spirit. Cross slings invective, sometimes witlessly, only to end on ""that's so stupid"" or ""that's fucked up."" Anyone who shares his politics and sensitivities will probably already have thought of the things he says here. At one point, Cross acknowledges he's in a rut of beginning topics with ""Another thing I hate..."" He's aggressively curmudgeonly, and skirts losing composure as his observations accumulate. Self-deprecation remains a subtext. I love him, but he sounds defeated. Is the title aimed at his targets or at himself? I've been one of the multitudes asking ""where's the anger?"" lately, but now that I hear it, I feel just as confused, empty, and emotionally homeless as Cross.","I hereby admit to belonging to a pathetic cadre of ""Mr. Show"" devotees.

The Distance Between,Great Lakes,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf9eabf31b7dc7156332/1:1/w_160/bf6ad040.jpg,2002-12-03 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3565-the-distance-between/,Orange Twin,"After long days and nights of federally mandated carpet-bombing, the once-mighty Elephant 6 collective finally gave itself up, but not before a select few escapees could be spirited away in the night. Some of the various refugees have sought sanctuary with Orange Twin, some with SpinART, but all still faithfully live to tell the tale of E6 to all who will listen; amen. Fortunately, judging from the post-E6 outburst of some of these bands, the story hasn't changed much. Unfortunately, though, the story hasn't changed at all, and the Great Lakes aren't gonna be the ones to bring something new to the table. The Distance Between features the same fuzzy, sunny day parade retro-pop that typified their former label, doing exactly what's expected-- which, of course, is mining that same old late-60s pop territory. Still, the faith with which these guys have adhered to the E6 party line smacks of a wholesome, charming consistency which, surprisingly, goes quite a long way; that the songs manage to vary somewhat independently within such a rigid aesthetic is a further bonus. Slight shifts of tempo and rhythm help to keep things from going stale too quickly; sometimes the guitars are jinglier, sometimes fuzzier. With some shiny, near-ubiquitous orchestral flourishes, the band at times even comes across like Beulah (the best band in my recent memory to cop the same rosy, 60s psych sound), albeit without quite the same fervor or dynamism. So go ahead and call me a miserable, baby-eating cynic when I say that, for being such a solid, mildly enjoyable album, all The Distance Between's blue skies and warm breezes just wear me out. This album only has two moods: happy and really fucking happy. Whether the Lakes are stomping their way through the hazy rock of ""Sister City"", or drifting along on languid string swells and harmonica in the following ""Ever So Over"", they never fails to have a dreamy, Oxycontin-induced smile mercilessly etched across their faces. Even the covers they choose are cheery; The Zombies' ""This Will Be Our Year"" is reproduced in all of its glorious optimism as a faithful homage to one of the Lakes' obvious influences, along with Mike Nesmith's ""Some of Shelley's Blues"". The hyper-extended jam outro to ""Conquistadors"" was the last straw. After only a half-hour, it felt like I'd been cracked in the face with a rainbow hammer. The Distance Between never sets its sights beyond the blissful psych-pop it emulates, but they nail it, at least. The closest they ever come to breaking stride is ""Tugboat Sailor"", a barely-disguised rip-off of Galaxie 500's signature distortion layers, and even then the Great Lakes still allow their fundamental breezy good-humor to shine through. By switching through numerous combinations of piano, horns, and strings, they keep things from stagnating, while preserving a vital cohesion. But while the E6 legacy of guitar fuzz and hooky retro is being upheld competently by the Great Lakes, they take it just a little too far. Still, there's nothing wrong with being happy (I hear some people are actually rather fond of it), and this album can fill that niche admirably. But after this record's relentless reign of joy, even the most carefree individuals may feel like frowning, just to make sure they still can.","After long days and nights of federally mandated carpet-bombing, the once-mighty Elephant 6 collective finally gave itself up, but not ...

Animals,Lot Six,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a29eea9e61561daa4ab6/1:1/w_160/1656e134.gif,2002-12-02 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4869-animals/,,"Hollywood is always lying to you. Those actors? Not their real skin. That lighting? Doesn't actually exist in nature. That big, stirring, extemporaneous speech that drove home the message? Took ten takes and hours of editing. Films can't help but trap reality in a sort of capsule that serves their purposes. I started thinking too much about this a few nights ago after catching some snippets of a James Bond movie during an epic channel-surf session at a friend's house. The thing that struck me when we dropped in on the chase scene (Bond careening around Moscow in a stolen tank) was how graceful the accidents and crashes looked. There was nothing violent about the impact of the police cars, even as the metal crumpled and twisted and the foley boomed in thunderous Dolby. Stuntpeople even have a term for what they do with cars-- auto ballet-- which fairly gives away just how intricately staged and planned all of these catastrophic-looking events are. I bring this up because ""graceful car wreck"" is the best term I can imagine to describe the sound of The Lot Six's sophomore album, Animals. The first time you listen to it, it has the feel of a jumble-- sounds crashing into each other and sections twisting unnaturally into other sections, but additional spins slowly reveal an intricately catastrophic piece of work that stands apart from the stuff other bands in this vein are doing. The Boston quintet's basic starting points seem to be D.C. post-punk and emocore, and maybe some of that San Diego stuff like Drive Like Jehu, with a bit less math. But to this they add a host of other elements that make it infinitely more interesting than most of the third-generation emo and math-rock that litters today's rockscape. Animals opens with the instrumental ""Skrahs"", a crunching attack that emits white-hot flecks of guitar that threaten to set the carpet on fire. ""All So Nice to Know"" and ""Freezin' Scene"" open solidly, give way like crumple zones, and then explode like airbags and safety glass into shouting choruses full of splintered guitars and smashing drums. It's impressive stuff, but a whole album of it would surely tire, and the band seems to realize this fact, arcing off at the album's midpoint into territory informed by everything from country to early-70s prog. ""My Son"" is the first real departure, riding a propulsive cowpunk beat onto a big-skied plain slashed by huge swathes of destructive slide guitar. ""Old Bass River Rd."" is the aftermath of the accident, a dejected lament on a place from a long-gone childhood, and closer ""Took My Place"" veers from its disco-punk intro into several tempo changes and thick briar patches of guitar without feeling forced. Perhaps best of all, though, is ""The Tiniest Tin"", an icy piano-driven ballad that at times has a stately, almost classical feel. There are times when The Lot Six's tightly controlled chaos gets the better of them, and there are a few spots that lack the invention that characterizes the rest of the album, but these are hardly common enough to kill the record, or even significantly hurt its momentum. The Lot Six have struck an impressive balance of restraint and unpredictability here, resulting in a unique record with a wealth of stellar moments. If only all wrecks could be this graceful.","Hollywood is always lying to you. Those actors? Not their real skin. That lighting? Doesn't actually exist in nature ...

Dirty Dancing,Swayzak,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5f6b1335d7bf1698d0d/1:1/w_160/a507725f.jpg,2002-12-02 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7649-dirty-dancing/,!K7,"UK tech-house duo Swayzak's third album goes out of its way to obscure what they're best at. On their 1998 debut, Snowboarding in Argentina, James Taylor and David Brown forged nine gleaming ingots of silicon-based, dub-leaning techno. DJs like Mr. C and Terry Francis spun tracks like ""Bueno"" and ""Fukumachi"", and effectively made Swayzak the cat's meow of tech-house. That album's success lent the duo the credit and credibility to expand their horizons; their follow-up, Himawari, featured guest slots from dub poet Benjamin Zephaniah and former Opus III vocalist Kirsty Hawkshaw. But while it retained some of its predecessor's gleam, it too often settled for transient pop. Dirty Dancing now finds Swayzak pursuing the latest flavor-of-the-month-- electroclash-- even more vigorously. Clearly, Swayzak would like to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Fischerspooner, Adult., and Ladytron. Himawari, in acidic electro-jams like ""Mysterons"" and ""State of Grace"", included traces of this sound before it become a phenomenon-- isn't it only fair they should scoop up some of the acclaim? Well, frankly, no. While it's not torture to listen to Dirty Dancing repeatedly, it does contain more than its rightful share of slip-ups and missteps. To be fair, Swayzak's take on electroclash opts to rubs noses with John Selway's innovative style, rather than certain acts' slap-dashed approximations of Speak and Spell-era Depeche Mode. The opener, ""Make Up You Mind"", grafts a minimal techno rhythm track onto jaunty electro-pop, as guest vocalist Clair Dietrich bobs and weaves her adenoidal Sarah Cracknell impersonation through gleaming sheets of cool German ambience and Jackmaster Funk bass bounces. And Swayzak relate the murderous tale of ""Buffalo Seven"", as narrated by Alan Vega's doppelganger Klaus Kotai, with similar panache. ""In the Car Crash"", however, is the first sign of Swayzak falling back on an electroclash clich√©-- it's yet another adaptation of The Normal's J.G. Ballard-worshipping ""Warm Leatherette"". But this track can't add anything to its subgenre; ""Warm Leatherette"" said it all, as starkly and as chillingly as possible. The duo goes as far as to soften and romanticize its inspiration's most inhumanly fucked-up, mechanical porno lyric, by exchanging, ""The handbrake penetrates your thigh,"" for, ""Face through the window/ But you're always on my mind."" It's an honest effort, but for my money, the closer you can get to the amoral essence of Ballard's novel Crash, the more visceral and provocative the effect. The Normal understood this, and presented its mechanical erotica without feeling or judgment. ""In the Car Crash"" is a Merchant Ivory reading of the same story. The instrumental ""Celsius"" returns to Chicago house for inspiration, and glossies the groove with some nods to Orbital, but ""I Dance Alone"", a duet between Adult.'s Nicola Kuperus and Carl Finlow, is the album's most egregious electroclash moment. With a fuzzed-out bass, Kuperus' blank shouting, and Finlow's pining refrain, it stands as Swayzak's bid for a hit the size of Fischerspooner's ""Emerge"". It's only on the slow electro-dub of ""Halfway to Yesterday"" that Swayzak evidence how innovative this album could have been. Forgoing the expected indicators of digidub (reverbed rimshots, Pole-like distortion), Swayzak create a massive void through which their vocalist reminisces, as a cyborg harpsichord occasionally fills the void. They keep percussion to a bare minimum, making the listener feel as lost and abandoned as the vocalist-- it truly is 21st Century dub. Yet, realizing that their key audience might be bewildered by such innovation, Swayzak return to plink-plonk electroclash with the ghastly ""Take My Hand"". In recompense, Clair Dietrich's vocals imbue the tech-house ""Sob 1"" with languid jazz-- similar to labelmate Herbert's Bodily Functions-- but Dietrich's French purr can't hold even a penny candle to the beguiling honesty of Herbert's Dani Sciliano. And then, Dirty Dancing closes with the immensely predictable ""Ping Pong"", sampling the primitive sounds of said video game as some plumy Brit repeats the title. Though the album sparsely showcases what excellence Taylor and Brown are capable of, it mostly finds them lollygagging on paths well rutted by nag-drawn bandwagons. Or, to put it more succinctly: their retro-futurism fails to make me chuckle in ironic solidarity.","UK tech-house duo Swayzak's third album goes out of its way to obscure what they're best at.

Irony Is a Dead Scene EP,The Dillinger Escape PlanMike Patton,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b988ea9e61561daa6fef/1:1/w_160/1ad42610.gif,2002-12-02 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2314-irony-is-a-dead-scene-ep/,Epitaph,"Sometime last year, omnipresent vocalist and Ipecac label owner Mike Patton teamed up with one of hard rock's current hottest commodities, the Dillinger Escape Plan (DEP), to record a four-song EP while the band was between singers. But the significance of this pairing goes beyond simple collaboration. It is historical. Here's why: Love him or leave him, Patton's influence on underground metal and hardcore, particularly through Faith No More, is undeniable. His influence on mainstream rap-rock is similarly undisputed, serving as the template for vocalists like Korn's Jonathan Davis. There's a list of side-projects and guest appearances too long to mention, boasting an acclaimed cast of cohorts: John Zorn, Dan the Automator, Dave Lombardo (Slayer), Duane Denison (Jesus Lizard), and Melt-Banana, among others. And at the foundation of the legend, there's simply the mad genius of Mike Patton, a.k.a. ""Hardcore Pavarotti"", with his immense vocal range and penchant for perplexing artistic expression. He may be too much to handle sometimes, but it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call the man an icon. And then there's the Dillinger Escape Plan: With only one release under their belts (the three-song EP Under the Running Board) at the time, this band laid down perhaps the seminal recording for the now flourishing math-metal genre, blending elements of math-rock, metal, and hardcore with a tip of the hat to modern jazz. Highly technical and intelligent, but still tenacious and punishing, 1999's Calculating Infinity set a high-bar for the genre, and garnered loads of praise for the New Jersey upstarts. In 2001, while searching for a new vocalist to replace the departed Dmitri Minakakis (who took lead vocals on Calculating Infinity), DEP butted heads with Patton to produce this four-track EP. For a meeting of the minds of this caliber, you might assume there had to be some give and take, but here, the two parties complement each other perfectly by blending their two distinguished sounds into one primal force: DEP's cerebral approach interlocks with Patton's more visceral leanings, making for a seamless, happy medium of intense technical proficiency and quirky, creative flourishes. This one is on par with DEP's finest, yet it's more accessible-- and more importantly, it surpasses everything Patton's done since Faith No More's Angel Dust. Patton himself hasn't changed. The cartoon-baritone hyper-rap on ""Hollywood Squares""-- in addition to the Snarf melody-- tells you the eccentric Patton of old hasn't gone anywhere. Similar spastic rap stylings on ""Pig Latin"" further reinforce the point. And just in case you still aren't convinced, he sports a multi-faceted, all-natural Richard D. James impression on the band's rendition of ""Come to Daddy"". Yet, unlike most of Patton's other recent projects, including Tomahawk and Fant√¥mas, DEP refuse to reflect the strained caricature of his vocals in their music. There is no ""goof"" in hardcore punk, and the band hasn't compromised-- these are, after all, the guys who shat on stage during a performance at the August 2002 Reading Festival. The band's calculated proficiency stands in stark contrast to Patton's right-brained outlandishness; while Patton is busy stammering about ""your mother, your father,"" and God-knows-what else on ""Pig Latin,"" DEP are furnishing him with flawless funk-metal. The multi-faceted ass kicking of ""Hollywood Squares"" relies on the band's patented, eruptive math-metal passages to break up a modicum of Patton weirdness. And even ""Come to Daddy"", which may sound like a bad idea in theory, comes off with supreme ferocity: Chris Pennie's drums simply decimate iBooks. The complete package is neither arcane nor peculiar. Patton and DEP have managed to find a midpoint between two styles that speaks to both sides of the brain. The only unfortunate thing is that we'll likely never again witness the two in action together; last year, Dillinger hired vocalist Greg Puciato who, despite handling his growling duties admirably, doesn't near possess Patton's vocal range or ambition. So it's just as Patton himself once mused: ""You want it all but you can't have it."" Four songs will have to suffice.",,8.4,
Tzomborgha,Ruins,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2ceea9e61561daa4b2d/1:1/w_160/3b46862d.jpg,2002-12-02 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6867-tzomborgha/,Ipecac,"Torn. Torn between wanting to heave balls of fire into the faces of unsuspecting audience members who probably came expecting to see Cibo/Shonen/Banana, and wanting to tap into the secret meter, unplayable to all but the most gone-prog hill-gurus. Torn between sliding into a comfortable niche as happy-go-lucky medley geeks and unleashing actual noise-terrorism, improvisational masochism, brutal Catechism! Torn between paying homage to Magma, Area and This Heat and ruining the reputations of said inspirations (and consequently, anyone who would recommend Ruins). Nothing about Tatsuya Yoshida's longstanding-- and at this point probably ""legendary"" (which may be part of the ""problem"")-- duo is easily digestible, except for the maddening consistency of his vision. And even that isn't a given. Ruins' music can be roughly grouped into three sections: the first (1985-1991) features bassists Kazuyoshi Kimoto and Hideki Kawamoto. This period-- best represented on 1990's Stonehenge LP-- established the band's rep as Hardcore junkies (or not; Yoshida claims he hasn't listened to much punk) with a prog fetish. The second era (1992-1996), which I consider the most interesting time for the band, featured bassist Ryuichi Masuda. The songs got longer, the bass lines thicker-- a lot more like those hallowed Magma lines of yore-- and their oppressive lack of dynamic contrast suddenly seemed like the mark of true originals rather than some po-mo noise experiment gone horribly wrong. The current Ruins lineup (1997-present) features bassist Hisashi Sasaki and is probably the most frustrating of all. Rather than ride off into the Zeuhl sunset, Ruins recently decided to destroy all ties to anything recognizable and/or coherent, opting for polyrhythm over speed-beat, and micro-fugue over smash-rock riffs. It's been a gradual triumph of brain over brawn for the past 17 years, and predictably, the results have been mixed. Tzomborgha is the group's eighth full-length of studio material (not counting the demo-heavy Refusal Fossil), and it's arguably the best of the Sasaki discs. As with 1998's Vrresto and 2000's Pallaschtom, the obsessive desire to change directions as many times as possible in one song could drive many listeners to drink. Furthermore, Yoshida's recent love of medleys (""Progressive Rock Medley"", ""Classical Medley"", et al) is somehow not as neat as in the past. Here, ""Black Sabbath Medley Reversible"" (don't think for a second they can't play this stuff backwards) and ""Mahavishnu Orchestra Medley"" should be novelties but for the fact they sound a hell of a lot like typical Ruins tunes. There are some classic jams here, too, for anyone willing to go the extra kilometer. ""Skhanddraviza"" starts out suspiciously goofy, with what sounds like a goat vocalizing over a punk bossa nova beat, but soon enough erupts into high-pitched, harmonized yelping and a trapset tantrum. In the middle, it settles on a three-note ostinato that's superficially reminiscent of Stonehenge's ""B.U.G."" mid-section, except, instead of playing the ""we could go on like this all day"" card, Ruins prefer to mix in some echoplex, metallic soloing over the figure (Sasaki's secret weapons are his effects pedals) before moving on to other business: ""Gurthemvhail"" begins with Sasaki proving chicken scratch funk licks are possible on the bass before Yoshida cuts him off at the pass with some of his tightest drumming on record. What might not go over with most listeners is the hallmark of Ruins' current incarnation: extended free-rhythm and improv pieces. Sasaki and Yoshida have an incredible ability to play the most intimidating figures in perfect unison, and don't need any pesky beat to accompany their adventures. The opener ""Komnigriss"" (similar to Vrresto's opener ""Snare"") makes mincemeat out of any expectations you might have for a downbeat; ""Messiaen"" (apparently a cover of one of the French composer's melodies) leaves no room for breath or handclaps. None of that can be considered criticism where Ruins albums are concerned, but for newcomers, I'd go with Hydero or even last year's hellish live record on Tzadik first. If you're still onboard after those, grab a charge card and a copy of Tzomborgha-- like Yoshida, you'll be in it for the long haul.","Torn.

Nothing Left to Lose: A Tribute to Kris Kristofferson,Various Artists,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc09eb335119a49ecb8c/1:1/w_160/8c3940f4.jpg,2002-12-01 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4539-nothing-left-to-lose-a-tribute-to-kris-kristofferson/,Incidental,"Shame on those of us who only know Kris Kristofferson as the kindly carny in Big Top Pee Wee, the Harry-Crews-looking, homicidal constable in Lone Star, or the silly scruffs in Blade II and Tim Burton's toneless Planet of the Apes remake. Shame on those of us who only know him as the guy with the feathery hair on the cover of some album we saw stacked inside one of Mom's crapboard endtables alongside Lionel Richie, Air Supply, and those hunky Kenny's: Loggins and Rogers. Shame on us, because the very educated Kristofferson was an estimable American songwriter (though I have to pitch my tent across the field from those who'd label him one of the Greats). Kristofferson's most impacting work strings together the observations of chronically defeated visionaries. These mini-martyrs can be absorbedly self-pitying, like prisoners who pay lip service to free livin', but their capacity for surrender yields some powerfully fatalistic evaluations of hope. ""Jesus Was a Capricorn"" is possibly the best synthesis of Kristofferson's concerns (Low's messianic hypothesis ""If You Were Born Today"" owes this tune a debt), and Diana Darby's minimal, whispered rendition is only one of the reasons this compilation trumps 2002's other Kris-nod Don't Let the Bastards Get You Down. This disc's roster is largely a who's-who of subdued alt-folk-rock, both traditional and progressive. Souled American's slop-twinkle handling of the last-chance anthem ""Please Don't Tell Me How the Story Ends"" is both brainy and sentimental, ideal for those fidgety hours before one's pride allows them to hit the bar or bottle. Both Califone offerings, ""Borderlord"" and ""Nobody Wins"" (the latter a team-up with Rebecca Gates) prove my thesis that this band doesn't know how to bore: they use all manner of digital manipulation, yet still sound earthy and interplanetary, yet symphonic and hymnal, despite their static-blasts. They contrast overstated and understated percussion, they strain pianos-- they even serve up some phased Olivia Tremor Control transitions. Calexico defies their predictable cactus-funk formula by adding an amazingly sour organ tone and Nico-versus-Marlene-Dietrich vixen vox to ""Casey's Last Ride"". Radar Brothers' deservedly increasing fanbase should pounce all over their panoramic ""Help Me Make It Through the Night"", and if my ears don't lie, that's Brother Jim Putnam's thin-soul throat fronting a much warmer Court & Spark on their ""For the Good Times"" (one of at least three songs about opportunistic ex-couples saying ""What the hey, let's get it on""). The showoffs in Zmrzlina and Milkchopper create the comp's richest soundscapes, mixing six-string theatrics with windshield wipers, drum tracks, radio samples, anxious keys, doleful strings, and layered, coed vocals. Their pairing deconstructs Kristofferson's most famous song to the point of redefinition, editing the refrain down to, ""Freedom's just another word for nothing."" The rest acquit themselves as well: Richard Buckner is a moving fit for the strumming ""Loving Her Was Easier"" ; Crooked Jades make a hootenanny of ""Shipwrecked in the Eighties"". Virgil Shaw and Howe Gelb both tip their hats amenably to the outsider ethos, but Deanna Varagona threatens to over-sing Kris' great line about ""seeking salvation we don't understand."" Creeper Lagoon's ""Why Me"" and the Handsome Family's ""Sunday Morning Coming Down"" are decent, but labor in the shadows of Johnny Cash's and Crooked Fingers' recent revisitations. Only Grandaddy's power-trio take on ""Best of All Possible Worlds"" (the polar opposite of the version from Bernstein's Candide) reeks of sleepwalkers' drool. You could insert a lengthy rumination on the futility/plurality of tribute compilations here, but recall that the oft-covered Kristofferson reportedly wrote a song called ""Let's All Get Together and Steal Each Other's Songs"". To their considerable credit, most of the artists on this austere compilation strive to give a little back.","Shame on those of us who only know Kris Kristofferson as the kindly carny in Big Top Pee Wee, the ...

Nuclear War EP,Yo La Tengo,by: Kyle Reiter,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaf9c0084474cd0c12b4/1:1/w_160/a2dcf423.gif,2002-12-01 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8866-nuclear-war-ep/,Matador,"In 1982, jazz composer and self-proclaimed Saturnite Sun Ra recorded the song ""Nuclear War"" just as the Reaganization of the Cold War had swung into full effect. The song, a swampy, pulsating chant about the inevitable genocide that will ensue, sooner or later, as a result of nuclear weaponry, went largely unheard in the U.S. due to poor distribution, until seeing reissue recently as a part of the Chicago-based Atavistic label's Unheard Music Series. Twenty years on, the song now suddenly strikes with the same poignancy as it did upon release. Yo La Tengo have always made cover songs an integral part of their repertoire, and the release of their four-track Nuclear War EP follows in that tradition. The song began showing up in live sets almost two years ago, but has just now been recorded. And while the band's tastes are sweeping and informed, never before has one of their covers been so apropos outside of its immediate rock context. ""Nuclear War"" might not be a post-9/11 tribute, per se, but it rightly encapsulates the languid panic of a post-ironic America. While Alan Jackson celebrates his inanity for foreign policy and Steve Earle proves himself too careerist to impact anything outside of his own record sales, Yo La Tengo see how beautifully this song summarizes our nation's apathetic despair: ""It's a motherfucker/ Don't you know/ If they push that button/ Yo ass gotta go."" Poignancy aside, the single does dull the senses with its uncanny ability to become increasingly repetitive. Four distinct versions mark the single, and it's difficult to cross the finish line of one track knowing that ahead lies more of the same. The disc opens with the band chanting the song's mutating refrain for nearly eight minutes, accompanied by nothing more than tribal percussion. Sun Ra achieved an eeriness by only coolly stating the obvious, and with his relaxed delivery, he created an uneasy, irresistible tension. Yo La Tengo, however, have greatly accelerated the song itself, and stripped it of its fun. On the opening track, they seem almost to be pleading for the message to be heard, and their somewhat morose delivery dilutes its power. While the cacophonous horn trio on the 15-minute third version is perhaps musically the closest to Ra's original, version two is the best homage. Although it's nothing more than version one's backing track with the addition of an otherworldly guitar loop and a choir of children in the call-and-response, the resulting track is almost devilishly cartoonish. Upon first listen, the children create a lighter atmosphere (and a hilarious ploy when saying ""motherfucker"" over and over), but as the song plays on, the kids don't seem quite so funny anymore. The na√Øvet√© involved in an actual nuclear assault sets in, and with every response from the children comes an increasingly unsettling feeling. The song conveys the realization that everyone's in the hot seat, not just the adults. It's this twisted sense of structure that ultimately owes itself to Ra. I won't get into version four too much, as it's just a remix by the admittedly incredible Mike Ladd, and seems to exist here solely as additional bang-for-the-buck. It essentially closes the disc by rehashing the first three-quarters, adding a dubbed-out drone, a curious organ breakdown, and some additional percussion and effects. Needless to say, after a straight half-hour of this already repetitive song, we just don't need to hear another take on it. It's hard to point a finger at a band like Yo La Tengo because the intentions are obviously good. They do manage to kill two birds with one stone by revealing the coolness of their record collection while responding to a cultural state of affairs, but unfortunately, the results are less than stellar. Lucky for us, we can still look forward to the pending full-length due early next year, which, if their previous four albums are any indication, will be another winner.","In 1982, jazz composer and self-proclaimed Saturnite Sun Ra recorded the song ""Nuclear War"" just as the\n\ Reaganization of ...

The Teaches of Peaches,Peaches,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0189d034d5c69bf2625/1:1/w_160/c9c537d8.jpg,2002-12-01 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6203-the-teaches-of-peaches/,XLBeggarsKitty-Yo,"The unfortunate thing about Peaches is that she's turned into a one-woman referendum on the worthiness of the genre we'll go ahead and call electroclash: the widespread misconception that this stuff is all hucksterism and schtick can be traced pretty directly back to her lyrics and Fischerspooner's stage wardrobe. The one possibly good thing, for our bar conversation and general sense that Something Is Happening, is that this makes her a little like The Strokes used to be: we all know she's out there, and most of us feel obligated to have some sort of opinion about that. So now that her album, The Teaches of Peaches, has been re-released to the U.S. with a second disc of bonus material, and I've devised a brief questionnaire to help you sort out your feelings. 1. What is Peaches all about? Sex. This starts with a triple-punch: you (a) look at her crotch on the cover, (b) put on the first track, which is called ""Fuck the Pain Away"", and then (c) Peaches leads in with the immortal words, ""Suckin' on my titties"": she doesn't work up to it at all. The remainder of the album includes a lot of grunting and squealing and songs about sucking on different things. 2. Am I meant to find that sexy, or revolting, or shocking, or what? Peaches is really big on crotch-shots lately, only she's made it official Peaches policy not to shave her bikini line, so all of these crotch photos feature pubic hair straggling out under her panties and down her thigh. I'm guessing that, however you feel about that mental image-- hot, foul, offensive, or lame-- is pretty much how you'll feel about this record. 3. What, precisely, is the point of that? There is an interesting aesthetic element to it: electro is captivated by the idea of machines as clean, perfect things, next to which the human body-- particularly sex-- seems messy and organic, maybe even scary or disgusting. Sweaty, sticky, hairy: this is the world of Peaches. It's possible, if you're so inclined, to read it as a performance-art take on pro-sex feminism; it's also possible to read Peaches as the sort of person who thinks she's ""challenging"" supposedly ""inhibited"" people, who are actually just indifferent, irritated by the crazy woman sticking her bits in their faces. Which of these is actually the case is not really important. 4. So is the music any good? Sure, totally... it's pretty okay. Just like the lyrics, the sounds are stripped down and dirty, all stiff, minimalist grime: here in the capitol of Electroclash sleaze are the echoes of post-punk electronic abuse, ghetto-tech booty-bass, and the grind-fests of the nastiest hip-hop. Remember how Salt 'n' Pepa's ""Push It"" sounded when it came out-- all fuzzed-up and raunchy? This is what Peaches tends to shoot for. And she's reasonably good about it, apart from one thing: her dedication to the sex-show antics sometimes comes at the expense of the tracks themselves, which makes her failures pretty grueling for the listener. ""Fuck the Pain Away"", on one hand, is great: big blurts of bass and stiff drums pump away under one of her better vamps (and better lyrics: ""I.U.D., S.I.S., stay in school, 'cause it's the best""-- good lord, is Peaches self-aware?). The pure forward motion of ""Cum Undun"" actually manages to get off the ground a little, revving up progressively into one of Peaches' most effective tracks. On the other hand, you get stuff like ""Diddle My Skittle"", an interminable miasma of crawling beats, static noise, and dull babble. Yes, sure, there's ""only one Peach with the hole in the middle,"" but six tracks in, talk like that is pretty much just wallpaper. Every track is memorable, though rarely on a musical level. ""AA XXX"" actually has an unconfident nuance to its sex-talk (that's double-A as in cup size, not stimulator batteries); ""Lovertits"" strips its beats down to the barest strut to accommodate that rather talented squeal, and ""Hot Rod"" milks a loving chuckle out of its chorus, which runs, ""Come on/ Hot rod/ Give me/ Your wad."" There are also some rock moments, like ""Rock Show"", which is way too much of a theatrical gag to work on a record, or the clumsy ""Sucker"", which I like to imagine certain people would be crazy about if only it were a lost Sleater-Kinney drum-machine demo. 5. What's up with the new material? Covers, for one thing, which strikes me as a pretty lame thing for Peaches, of all people, to be doing. Jeans Team's ""Keine Melodien"" originally sounded like a robotic Prussian dictator stomping his army over a hill, where Peaches minimizes it to an ominous cruise; her version of Berlin's ""Sex (I'm A)"" invites unflattering comparisons with Teri Nunn. The only new track is ""Casanova"", which pairs Peaches up with Mignon for a surprisingly playful and girly romp. And then there are remixes, obviously. Tobi Neumann's reworking of ""Set It Off"" bulks up the beat and adds actual dynamics, with which Peaches seems to have only a passing familiarity. You'd think Kid606 having his way with ""Fuck the Pain Away"" would be fascinating, but you'd be wrong: he's a lot more restrained than usual-- no splattering snare drums-- and he uses a lot of major-key loops to rewrite the track's fairly grim tone. It's plunderphonia of the least order: ""Look at me, I worked a bunch of different samples together."" Also, there are two videos. Enjoy. 6. So should I buy it? God, I have no idea. Do you prefer listening to stuff because it's ""interesting,"" or because it's ""good?""","The unfortunate thing about Peaches is that she's turned into a one-woman referendum on the worthiness of the genre ...

Young People,Young People,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aae2ea9e61561daa5c6a/1:1/w_160/fe4fd56c.jpg,2002-12-01 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8845-young-people/,Kill Rock Stars5RC,"A few plucked notes, a warm drone and a cantankerous electric guitar introduce singer Katie Eastburn, whose flat tone sounds like a washerwoman laboring over the drawers of the man who done her wrong. Young People's debut album wallows in backwoods ambience, a fetishization of rural life with a kernel of the blues somewhere at its heart. But the music they cut from this atmosphere is intriguing, and inventively realized. This Los Angeles trio makes music not unlike Nina Nastasia's recent The Blackened Air, but grayer and grainier, with more jagged edges. The band includes Eastburn on vocals and violin, and Jeff Rosenberg (Pink and Brown, Tarentel) and Jarrett Silberman (The Hansel & Gretel Disease Forest) switching between guitars, drums, organ, and other instruments, sometimes clanking and rattling like rough sex in a tool shed, and other times plodding along like a chain gang. The mood is thick and dreary: it's absorbing, but dangerously close to becoming a caricature of misery. Of the twelve originals and one cover, almost every song is a ballad, dirge, work song, lament, or threnody-- including the one genuine blues song, their grave-diggingly somber cover of Rev. Gary Davis' ""Death Don't Have No Mercy"". And there's an edge of hipsterism that undercuts the starkness-- for example, they name the first track ""Ron Jeremy"", after the fun-to-namecheck porn star. At least Leadbelly would have written ""The Ballad of Ron Jeremy"". But one reason the album works is that these slow tunes and sturdy melodies are a framework for their spatterings of noise, which turn this into engrossing art-folk. The guitars are raw and unsteady, playing bashing distortion on ""The Dishwasher"" or short creaks of feedback over ""The Pier"". The drums often play not so much a beat or a pulse, but lumbering repetitions-- just as Eastburn's violin at the start of ""Repent"" is the weariest sawing I've ever heard. Likewise, Eastburn's voice has a matter-of-fact plaintiveness that defines, but can also box in, her performance. In contrast, the few times Young People do break the mood are revelatory, especially on the last three tracks. ""Collection"", and my personal favorite, ""Elizabeth Taylor"", break free with the horsepower of a brand-new pick-up truck, the lead guitar searing over Eastburn's reinvigorated voice. And on ""Fly Seagull Fly"", when engineer Rod Cervera steps in to provide more conventionally rhythmic drums, Eastburn is pushed to a fine point of yearning. Still, as much as this album can suck you in, it rarely connects. It draws on styles that encourage empathy as much as sympathy, where you listen to singers spill their sob stories because they remind you of your own, and they pull you into a two-way exchange. But Young People are more like a spectacle: you're detached from the sharp pain they describe, much as it seems like their music is detached from the folk and blues that it cribs from. Maybe to get them in character for their next record, 5RC should sentence them to a couple years of hard labor.","A few plucked notes, a warm drone and a cantankerous electric guitar introduce singer Katie Eastburn, whose flat tone sounds ...

The true cost, the human cost, the material cost? Few can say. From what I hear on the Internet, though, the band is damn cute (especially that drummer, Mikey!). Telegenic, even. They're also vaguely ""punk"" (more screamo than anything else), which makes them the perfect talent for this sitcom I've been developing. Here's the pitch: ""The Angular Family""! Four strapping exemplars of today's disjointed youth all living under the same roof! Sometimes heart-wrenching, always hilarious! You don't even have to write a script, for Christ's sake, just take some of the more intelligible lines from Chimera and, you know, put 'em together. Eg., Episode I (Stephen Bites Off His Own Tongue): [The Angular Kids are gathered in their pastel-walled breakfast nook, calmly eating Cheerios, when STEPHEN runs in.] STEPHEN: All is not well! SEAN: All hands attention! This plane's going down! STEPHEN: The last three weeks have been a drawn-out train wreck! As time sheds its bruises I'm left in its wake! SEAN: I have reoccurring nightmares of dying in airplanes! MIKE [Looks to the camera, smiles]: This is not the worst part! [cue laugh track] Gold! Maybe they can even bring the band thing into the show, a little anti-Partridge action, though they'd have to work on the music. Okay, I mean, sure, they're angular, angular like a Cubist fox, but is it good angular? Angles have to be put in the proper places to make shapes, and the math has to work out right (180 degrees in a triangle, 360 in a square); you can't just stick them anywhere you want. And you sure as hell can't announce almost every tempo- or time-signature change with a full-band pause. I mean, sometimes these kids break my heart-- following that chiseled Fugaz-ish drum intro on the first track with all that flabby distortion and flatly declamatory angst, or periodically dragging ""Left in Its Wake"" down into a slower tempo just for the sake of math. It's a shame, really; on the more straightforward rock tracks (""Hated Man"") and the ones that sustain the quiet side of the dynamics see-saw (""Symptomatic""), the band's anger actually sounds like something more than Drive Like Jehu on autopilot. And the target audience: Kids! Kids love angles! And maybe if we can squeeze a few more ""relationship"" issues into the script (I assume they've got them, though I can't make heads or tails of those lyrics), maybe a life-threatening disease or two, we could probably hook the older crowd who were too freaked out by Frodus when they were doing the same thing five years ago.

Stoke,Philip Jeck,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9deeb335119a49ec8b8/1:1/w_160/819bfc10.jpg,2002-11-26 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4226-stoke/,Touch,"Liverpudlian Philip Jeck studied visual art at the Dartington College of Arts in Devon, England. During the early 80s, he drifted from painting and sculpture to music, and began working with old and discarded turntables. Though he's roughly a contemporary of Christian Marclay, recognition for Jeck came much later, beginning in 1993 with his massive installation ""Vinyl Requiem"", which incorporated 180 record players and multiple film projections. Since then, he's released several solo records for Touch and the German label Intermedium, and has collaborated with Otomo Yoshihide, among many others. Much of Jeck's solo output is culled from edits of live performances. Using a number of battered turntables, a Casio keyboard, and a CD player or minidisc, Jeck creates dense, pulsating sound collages from the grooves of ancient and forgotten records. Like Yoshihide and Marclay, Jeck is no DJ. Though he stands over his decks with headphones on, his intention and methods with records has nothing to do with beat-matching or spinning tunes. Records are truly just sound sources for Jeck, raw material to be shaped via mixer and effects into his ghostly compositions. Listening to his most recent album, Stoke, it's hard not to think about Jeck's background in visual art, and how it informs his audio work. There's something very cinematic about these pieces, though the music sounds nothing like a soundtrack. Some of the visual referencing could come from the regular pops and scrapes in the vinyl, which are reminiscent of the sound of a spool of film being fed into a projector. Jeck's endlessly rotating platters, like the whirr of moving film, serve as a constant reminder of the time-based nature of the medium. These pieces happen, and all you can do as a listener is try to extract information before they fade back into nothingness. You have to listen close and listen often. Stoke finds Jeck more in the realm of focus and refinement. While the tracks in his ""Vinyl Coda"" series (worth checking out, by the way) ranged from 20 to 60 minutes, the seven distinct pieces here average less than eight. The relatively tight construction of the tracks means that Jeck can hone in on a single sonic idea and amplify it, extracting the maximum amount of emotional material from a few grimy loops. ""Pax"" is an uncharacteristically minimal piece combining a simple organ refrain and slowed-down vocals, possibly from an old gospel 78. The keyboard is very clean-sounding and might not be sourced from a record, but it perfectly complements the churched-up feel of the warped vocal, stretching the anguish of the indecipherable lyric to its breaking point. ""Close"" uses ancient recordings of sacred music from another culture to beautiful effect, this time the ringing sounds of Indian classical. The undisciplined hiss of a loose sitar string is clipped to ribbons, then looped and recombined to sound like a warning, some indeterminate alarm sounding through a Himalayan valley. The piece takes a stunning left turn in its final quarter, turning to a loop of surface noise with an echoing and unbearably lonesome vocal floating on top. ""Lambing"" is Jeck in drone mode, patiently adding and removing layers of sound and noise whose vinyl sources remain a complete mystery. The style on ""Lambing"" could be considered Jeck's signature, and it's amazing what he accomplishes through additive processes. There's something wonderfully machine-like about the operation. Since Jeck has the entire world of sound at his disposal, he has to figure how much of it to let in at any given moment, like mixing air with fuel inside a carburetor. Stoke proves him a master mechanic.","Liverpudlian Philip Jeck studied visual art at the Dartington College of Arts in Devon, England. During the early 80s, he ...

Three EP,Mobius Band,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c36013d197565213bd07/1:1/w_160/047daf11.gif,2002-11-26 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5341-three-ep/,Prescription Rails,"Opening bands have one of the hardest jobs in the world. Often mismatched on the bill, these poor souls know you're not there to see them, and that most of the audience will spend their set impatiently clicking their Indiglos to gauge how much longer until the main attraction takes the stage. And then there's the pressure of realizing they've got just this one chance to reach everyone in the venue-- if their set doesn't go well, they've likely lost potential audience members for good, and even if it does, it's a crap-shoot as to whether or not any new fans will jump on board. Every once in a while, though, the opening act just nails it: the audience matches up, the performance kills, and just enough confidence gets projected from the stage to distract from the passage of time and win a few mailing list signees. I caught the Mobius Band opening for Hood and Surface of Eceon about nine months ago, and this is pretty much exactly what happened. I came in wondering who they were, and walked out with a copy of their second numerically titled EP, the hand-packaged Two. And it mostly lived up to their show, with a few pleasantly surprising twists and turns thrown in. The band's kitchen sink blend of everything from fusion-era Miles to prime Kraut groove to glitch to straight-up rock was pursued from a fresh angle, and their exploratory, amateurish approach was charming. With the release of Three, their third EP in two years, the Massachusetts trio make the jump into the world of labels and grow fully into their sound, eradicating nearly every inconsistency found on their past releases. The speed of the band's progress is stunning. I won't even venture to imagine where they'll be in another year. Opener ""Frozen Lake in Unison"" is a fairly basic instrumental-- choppy drums, loosely wielded guitars, some background glockenspiel tinkling and a vaguely jazzy feel, but the recording renders it much deeper, utilizing the ambience of the room it was recorded in (and the freeway, if I'm hearing things correctly) and samples of indecipherable conversation to open the composition up. ""Burnoff"" surges forth in its wake, swathed in sheets of buzzing analogue synth, underlined by a cutting, tonally limited bassline. There's a deceptively infectious pop song hiding in all the buzz, though, and that's what really makes it work. The Mobius vocal chops are up of late, and they've crafted their most immediate melody for the occasion here. The upward quality arc continues with the gorgeous acoustic guitar and crunchy beats of ""Arrows"". Uneasy string samples flutter in and out of the background, haunting the laid-back vocal melody and ultimately taking over the song as the drum kit rises over the programming to bring everything to an unsettled conclusion. ""Well-Thumbed Page"" simultaneously offers a nod to the American Analog Set and a wink to Autechre, while the impassioned strumming of ""Snow on Snow"" puts you in the austere beauty and calm of a winter landscape without turning your fingers blue. The EP closes with ""Plastic Pillar"", a creeping thing that opens with harmonics, slippery beats and barely audible ambient voices, and ultimately morphs into a pulverizing assault led by overdriven drums and topped-out VU meters. With Three, the Mobius Band have definitively disproved their own punny moniker, proving that they do, in fact, have more than one side. As they continue to focus their sound and hone their craft, I have no doubt they'll emerge as a force to be reckoned with. For now, they're certainly one worth listening to.","Opening bands have one of the hardest jobs in the world. Often mismatched on the bill, these poor souls know ...

An Anthology of Dead Ends EP,Botch,by: Isaiah Violante,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a359ea9e61561daa4c62/1:1/w_160/4ca1f702.jpg,2002-11-25 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/876-an-anthology-of-dead-ends-ep/,Hydra Head,"A few weeks back, I happened upon an old interview with god rock timber Creed on MTV2. After suffering through bible-thumper extraordinaire and vocalist Scott Stapp waxing rhapsodic on Matthew 3:12 and its significance in contemporary media, Stapp was asked how the band felt about Radiohead. ""Yes, we are definitely Radiohead fans. When interviewers ask you what your favorite band is, Radiohead is a really good thing to say to them."" As a general guideline, I try to avoid reviews before I've fully absorbed an album. In the case of the new Botch EP, however, ignoring the swell of overwhelming praise from my cluster of devoted intellimetal friends proved impossible. I'd heard so much hyperbole from armchair reviewers on the quality of * An Anthology of Dead Ends * that I quickly pushed it to the front of my Pitchfork priorities list. Little did I know that I'd already heard all of these songs before and, surprisingly, from shittier mainstream bands with less indie cred. As I sat down to draft this review, I had a startling revelation: Botch, Isis, Converge, the Dillinger Escape Plan, Cave In, and most of the Hydra Head crew, while not on a commercial par with Radiohead by any means, are names typically dropped because they sound good to the fairweather metal fan: hard rock that's loud, brash, and angry, but without any of those nasty Satanism questions from your folks. In case they've managed to fly under your radar for the past nine years, Botch was a four-piece hardcore-metal meld out of Seattle with guitarist David Knudson, vocalist Dave Verellen, drummer Tim Latona, and bassist Brian Cook. Botch released two fantastic metalcore albums in 1999 and 2000 entitled * American Nervoso * and * We Are the Romans * , respectively. Both albums pushed mathematical metal to a wider audience, crafting dense walls of sound with off-kilter rhythms and snarling vocals in a more accessible manner than their Hydra Head counterparts. Through jilted tempos, filthy riffs, and even an improbable cover of ""Rock Lobster"", Botch carved out a solid niche with a loyal fanbase. Picking up my copy of * An Anthology of a Dead End * , my attention was immediately drawn to the track titles: ""Spaim"", ""Japam"", ""Framce"", ""Vietmam"", ""Afghamistam"", and ""Micaragua""-- the kind of nursery school cipher that might have come from a book on combinations and permutations authored by Richard Scarry. Opening with a 14-second guitar intro, ""Spaim"" signals Botch's entrance to a professional downward spiral that concludes with a fiery crash into a mountain twenty minutes later. Where the Dillinger Escape Plan at least hinted at the possibility of a creative future with their four-track EP, * Irony is a Dead Scene * , earlier this year, Botch opted for a series of safe plays to close out their career in the least offensive, and more importantly, least memorable way possible. Make no mistake, * Anthology * is undoubtedly a hardcore album; despite a handful of prodigious flashes, this is math-metal for kids on the short bus. All the middle-class, white-male posturing and angst is very much in place but minus the intrigue. ""Japam"" is short attention span theatre at its worst, crashing through a number of uninspired chord changes between hardcore and lazy pulse with violent wails, churning pop punk riffs, and insipid drums. It's all so predictable that one could train the ear to identify this supposed experimentation as Botch's brand of verse/chorus/verse. Sure, it's all negative, ominous, and assuredly very angry but where's the weenie? Guess what-- there isn't one. Spend two minutes with the first actual song on the disc and you've got a master's understanding of all the tricks and textural and temporal variation present on * An Anthology of Dead Ends * . ""Framce"" and ""Vietmam"" are the two closest approximations to Botch circa 2000. While the desire to embrace conventionality is still present, it's handled in a more organic way. In the case of ""Vietmam"", the methodical approach pays off. Through a poetic mechanism of guitar and bass, the track plods ahead with far more minimal orchestration and greater flexibility. Strong colors, harmonizing riffs, false starts, false stops, and taste abound, elements sorely lacking on most of * Anthology * . Knudson's guitar work is liquid and naturalistic while Cook and Latona move solidly through an unorthodox cadence with ease and intricacy. ""Afghamistam""-- which could as easily have been titled ""Smore"", ""Borimg"", or ""Pomderous""-- marks Botch's lone foray into post-four-minute territory. Not only does this track fail miserably as an attempt at multi-dimensionality, but it's so chockfull of pretension that one might expect a grinning, fawning Burt Bacharach to emerge from the bombed-out rubble of Kamdahar. Replete with piano, sullen lyrics, and schmaltzy string orchestration, this track would try the patience of even the most devoted fanboy. Botch's career comes to a close with ""Micaragua"", another cute and ineffectual hardcore ditty-- including a suitably unimpressive drum solo from Cook-- with the stamp of trivial alterna-metal trash a la Mudvayne and Mushroomhead. It's worth highlighting that every note on the album is produced exceptionally well for a self-avowed DIY band. In addition to possessing an extremely tight dynamic, the nuances of every instrument are clear and distinct (translation: slick and phony). This album so blatantly panders to a moderate, fail-safe audience it couldn't be packaged any other way. I'll readily admit that I've never been in love with Dave Verellen's purposefully awkward metaphors, or any of the band's calculated noisecore pretexts. Still, it seemed plausible that the same band who had recorded the menacingly vague ""Mondrian Was Liar"", invoked Dali and John Woo on * American Nervosa * , and Orff's ""Carmina Burana"" on * The Unifying Themes of Sex, Death and Religion * didn't shoot its wad two years ago. In the course of listening to the same six tracks for nearly four weeks, I realized that Botch had simply exhausted their capabilities as a unit. Mercifully, Knudson and Verellen recognized their limitations, forced out a contrived and forgettable 20 minutes of music, and decided to move on to greener pastures. To all you tepid metalheads fond of referencing this fallen pack of √ºbergeeks-with-attitude, fear not, you've still got several dozen pariahs with overdrive pedals to cling to.","A few weeks back, I happened upon an old interview with god rock timber Creed on MTV2.

Audioslave,Audioslave,by: Chris Dahlen & Ryan Schreiber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1449d034d5c69bf2907/1:1/w_160/c9dab1b2.jpg,2002-11-25 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/356-audioslave/,Epic,"Us Generation X'ers never gave the world shit. We don't care about anything. We don't even care about ourselves. We blew through our dotcom cash and we're still stuck with our student loans. Our biggest political moment was turning Ralph Nader into a presidential spoiler. And now, justice comes swiftly knocking. It is time to face that which we fear the most: the second coming of Lollapalooza's grunge-rock all-stars. Recent days have seen the re-emergence of an eerie number of megacelebrity has-beens-- from Jane's Addiction backing Courtney Love on tour, to Krist Novoselic joining forces with Meat Puppeteer Curt Kirkwood in Eyes Adrift-- combining their powers in the hopes of forming one mightier superbeast. And yea, we have seen these bands and known our sins, and the discipline was just and fair. But repent we did not. And so, as further castigation, we now find ourselves faced with the ultimate grievance: Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell assuming vocal duties for Urban Outfitters politicos Rage Against the Machine. Let the punishment fit the crime. The story goes that sometime after Zach de la Rocha dropped out of Rage, Cornell agreed to be the new singer, so long as they ditched their political bent and changed their name. And based on the evidence, losing the politics doesn't hurt the music: as Cornell proves here time and again, he can still voraciously belt the most inane lyrical tragedies with such conviction that you'd almost think they meant something were it not for such giveaways as, ""Pearls and swine bereft of me,"" and, ""Heaven waits for those who run/ Down your winter and underneath your waves/ Where you watch and wait."" It's also amusing to note that after years of playing the hardcore leftist, overeducated liberator of jailed antiheroes, Tom Morello gladly dropped the message from his music in lieu of playing venues that don't hang their name on a Schlitz sign. Bassist Tom Commerford and drummer Brad Wilk fall in line, but it's Cornell that's made a bitch out of all of them-- from forcing them to cancel a slot on the Ozzfest bill, to sticking them with the most asinine bandname of the year. (It was Cornell's idea to dub this bloated masturbathon Audioslave, and the name says everything with the same exacting precision that it says nothing at all. Audioslave. It's like it was tailor-made for a Sam Goody voiceover.) It's kind of incredible how slick and lifeless the Rage band sounds without de la Rocha spitting all over everything. The guys just autopilot their way through the most generic hard rock possible behind Cornell's Dio-like wailing about highways and death and more highways. Morello tries to stick out with his wanky solos, but all his effort amounts to little more than an indulgent novelty. He, of course, is less an embarrassment than Cornell. Now, I'll freely admit being a Soundgarden fan: I remember when all the guys admired his politically correct take on machismo, and all the girls swooned at his hairy good looks and dreamed of just ripping the flannel right off him. To be fair, his voice sounds great, even after years of larynx-shredding throat-gore. The effect, unfortunately, is lost when you realize that all the lyrics are complete gibberish. ""Set if off/ Set it off, my children."" ""I will wait for you/ Like a stone/ I will wait for you there/ Alone."" Or best of all: ""I am a virus!"" He also rips off some pseudo-spiritual lyrics from the latest Christian grunge bands, which is ironic because... well, you know the drill: the student becomes the teacher, and they all ride the short bus together. Sure, the pulsing noises and rumbling groan that open ""Set It Off"" sound wicked, and ""Bring 'Em Back Alive"" and ""Getaway Car"" almost don't suck. You could even say that, technically, Audioslave ""rock"". But they do so emptily, predictably, and without a single new idea. Producer Rick Rubin has fashioned a synthesized rock-like product that emits no heat. It's the worst kind of studio rock album, rigorously controlled-- even undercut-- by studio gimmickry; the rare instances during which the band starts to let go (the end of ""Shadow on the Sun"") are incidental and abruptly cut off. At its worst, this project is just plain retarded. On ""Show Me How to Live"", Audioslave snatch the opening chords from Simple Minds' ""Don't You (Forget About Me)""-- try keeping the ""hey hey hey hey"" out of your head during this thing-- and then cop the riff from Aerosmith's ""Walk This Way"". Top this hall-of-fame moment of classic un-inspiration with a bridge that consists solely of heavily processed violin, and the fact that the song features Cornell yelling to his creator, ""You gave me life, now show me how to live!"" Was it too much to ask for some effort? Were we already pressing our luck that these guys even got together? And it's so frustrating because Cornell would be better suited to virtually anything else. The man would sound more at home dueting with Shania. Listen to that! I'm in awe of his lungs. He belts these songs like they never went out of style, like he's still got that curly Louder Than Love-era mane thrown back and glistening, like he wants to shake the studio to its very foundation with the power of all his gristled fury-- when all of a sudden, the effects kick in and morph his voice into a fucking sitar! It just might be the most ridiculous and ill-timed production trick of his career. And all I can picture is Cornell high-fiving Rick Rubin and hitting the beach to play volleyball with Creed. Duck, because America's gonna vomit.","Us Generation X'ers never gave the world shit. We don't care about anything. We don't even care ...

Ephemera,Tarentel,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7379d034d5c69bf3735/1:1/w_160/a6e6b2c2.jpg,2002-11-25 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7942-ephemera/,Temporary Residence,"It's not every day you run across a singles collection that contains only five songs and stretches them out to almost 70 minutes. But San Francisco five piece Tarentel, whatever their other virtues, have mastered the difficult practice of patience. Like Labradford, they know that getting there is half the, well... I guess ""fun"" is probably the wrong word. Let's just say that the journey is its own reward. These songs take their time. The first thing you'll notice if you come to Tarentel through last year's album The Order of Things (like I do) is that these tracks are comparatively skeletal. No orchestral flourishes, vocals or scratchy field recording samples here. Ephemera is basically guitar, bass, drums and a little keyboard, with heavy emphasis on the guitar. Somewhere after the time of Spiderland, indie musicians the world over fell completely in love with the sound of a plucked electric patched into a nice amp, and decided that this simple sound, slowly moving through the notes of a chord, one by one, was enough to serve as the focal point for a 10+ minute piece of music. This attitude made songs like this record's opener, ""The Waltz"", possible. The first seven minutes or so are little more than the guitarist walking through the chords, slowly and steadily. Of course, then Tarentel has the good sense to add some grumbling organ chords and then finally a distorted blast of guitar noise about 12 minutes in, nicely releasing the tension of the lengthy build. The peaks and valleys of ""Looking for Things"" are much more subtle, reminding me a lot of Mogwai circa Come On Die Young (which equals ""boring"" for me, sorry). My favorite two tracks are the shortest. Both parts of ""Two Sides of Myself"" come from a seven-inch single, and run a little over six minutes each. The seriously bent guitar notes on the first part remind me a lot of Pink Floyd's soundtrack work. There's an ""Age of Aquarius"", European hippie vibe that lends an aura of mystery, which the cymbal washes make even more explicit. Part two begins with ripples of some very controlled and quiet feedback and then spreads out from there. This is Tarentel in pure drone mode, close to the bliss world of Windy & Carl. The closer is the 24-minute ""Searching for Things"" (are these the same things that were ordered for last year's album?), an odd choice for a single by any measure, which impressively glides slowly from one section the next, folding in all kinds of ominous guitar noises as it grows ever more moody and dark. I won't say it never gets a little dull, but I've heard worse side-length tracks. As for the collection as a whole, nice stuff, but I have a hard time being drawn completely into this world. There's something a bit vague and uncertain about the tracks that deadens their emotional impact, despite how nice they sound.","It's not every day you run across a singles collection that contains only five songs and stretches them out ...

Laughter Fills Our Hollow Dome,The Impossible Shapes,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b958c0084474cd0c25b9/1:1/w_160/55d7f879.jpg,2002-11-25 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4084-laughter-fills-our-hollow-dome/,Mr. WhiggsLuna,"Now that Elephant 6 is officially a closed book, maybe it's time to look elsewhere than Athens, Georgia for the next psych-pop explosion. The psych strongholds of old-- the Bay Area, East Texas, Canterbury, etc-- won't do; they have too much history and too few new ideas. No, a genre that has fallen on such hard times of late needs a fresh start in a fresh place. I suggest Bloomington, Indiana. Now, I'll admit I'm more than a little biased; I used to live there, and in a lot of ways, I still think of it as my home. But putting as much bias as I can aside, there's a band there that I think could lead the next charge of paisley frock. They're called the Impossible Shapes. Laughter Fills Our Hollow Dome is the Impossible Shapes' second proper full-length and it's got enough catchy, bouncy melodies to make Robert Schneider sully his Osh-Koshes, and enough of a fuzzy lo-fi glow to make Will Hart re-bury his tape recorder. Lyrically, Shapes frontman Chris Barth writes like Bob Pollard drunk on Krishnamurti tomes, and his voice recalls a boyish, Midwestern George Harrison. ""Spirits Enter"", ""Dancing in Heaven"", and ""Graceful Arc"" combine a ecumenical spiritualism with a fondness for analog keyboards and hazy pop. ""Jesus and Squares"" sets a more ominous tone, ending with the words, ""Try and love everything that is not dead""-- it'd stand as a recollection of a bad trip if not for the rousing, galloping rhythm that powers it. ""Go Somewhere Beautiful"", a two-parter bridged by a spiraling keyboard-driven interlude, is almost as pure a picture of na√Øve hippie optimism as could be hoped for in these troubled times and, as such, is this close to being a defiant protest song. ""Look for an Opening"" and ""Found a Sister"", on the other hand, have a whimsical, almost Broadway musical style recalling Love's Brian Maclean. Meanwhile, ""Another Flooded Dream"" and ""Supermaze"" show the Shapes stretching out into collage-style chaos-- like their forbearers in Olivia Tremor Control were fond of doing-- without losing sight of the song. And indeed, The Song is always primary with these guys. Even when they do momentarily stray from it in order to modulate the perspective or bring a revealing distortion into play, it demonstrates just how strong the songs are in their underlying foundations. These detours never sound distracting or gratuitous like is so often the case when a ""song"" band wants to get ""way out"" and ""blow your mind"" with some ""spacey jams"". Rather, all experimentation is brought into the service of the song itself. Regular acid-eating Hoagy Carmichaels, these kids. ""Across the River"", while not one of the most instantly memorable songs on the album, might be its spiritual center. A short, simple song, beautifully wrought from acoustic guitar, piano, and organ, Barth and multi-instrumentalist Aaron Deer trade off singing the refrain, ""Inside this great home."" And that's what this album does best: it transports you fully into a dream-like world, a home built of warm, full sound and winding corridors of melody. And when it's over, and you're back in the harsh real world, all you want to do is revisit the world of Hollow Dome where things are simple and beautiful. Psychedelic pop may not be in vogue at the moment, and Elephant 6 folding was just a symbol of this change in the musical climate, but that doesn't mean there aren't still a number of good-- or even great-- psych-pop bands keeping the dream of '67 alive, and without being too awfully retro about it. A number of musicians who sprung from the fertile soil of the Elephant 6 collective continue to make compelling music (Will Hart's Circulatory System and Jeremy Barnes' various projects, for example), not to mention the various (heavier) psych bands coming out of the Philadelphia area. And then there are relative newcomers like the Memphis-based Snowglobe and the Impossible Shapes from Bloomington. Hopefully, these bands will stick it out to reap the rewards when the winds of popular taste inevitably turn back their way.","Now that Elephant 6 is officially a closed book, maybe it's time to look elsewhere than Athens, Georgia for ...

Crown of Fuzzy Groove,Seiichi Yamamoto,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab159d034d5c69bf3f6a/1:1/w_160/1771fc45.jpg,2002-11-24 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8894-crown-of-fuzzy-groove/,P-Vine,"Follow this path to creamy nirvana: destroy cats, consume dangerous chemicals, make noise, practice a little bit, organize chaos, rinse and repeat over a twenty year cycle, come out alive. If you're lucky, you might even notice the change within; the transformation from a violent, terminally bored slack-jaw into a wise old new age magician. It happens to the best of them. Why, it happened to (former?) Boredoms guitarist Seiichi Yamamoto, who hasn't been this tranquil on record since Chocolate Synthesizer. There and back again: a fuzzy groove tale. Or, how I learned to stop worrying about my hardcore cred and bathe in the green and gold milk of Osaka. Yamamoto appears on every Boredoms release except their 1986 debut seven-inch, but he will not appear on their next one. Vooredoms (as Eye has christened their current formation) cut their ties to rock when their guitarist and bassist left, and I see this in two ways. In one sense, it is a very interesting way of making the leap to a new plane, perhaps their Jupiter and Beyond. On the other hand, as Crown of Fuzzy Groove makes clear, when Yamamoto left, he may have taken their heart with him. Crown is Yamamoto's first solo disc that isn't comprised of solo guitar improvisations, and it's dissimilar in almost every way not only to his previous outings, but also to his most famous non-Bore projects Rovo and Omoide Hatoba. Where the latter band played skewed pop and punky psyche, and the former sprightly post-rock, this record is milky ambience to the core. There are plenty of guitars to be found, but no riffs (substitute melodies-- who'd have thought?) or even distortion. Distortion would disturb the carefully balanced ensemble on this album; no one voice is more dominant than another. Gently tapped hand-percussion and cymbal swells provide the spark for a series of mini-epics that vary from exotic future-lounge to all-out Calgon moments. Airy synth patch upon airy synth patch fill all the blank space and then some, and there's just enough electro-blip to keep the sine wave 'n' sampler crowd happy. ""Whity"" begins with a drawn-out introduction that sounds similar to some of Eye's airplane-in-space experiments on the last Rebore CD. After takeoff, the now very familiar sound of jungle rhythms and electronic drone take up the slack. It's familiar because that seems to have been the order of things for this camp over the last several years, but where Yamamoto's concept differs is in what's emphasized. Chiefly, this isn't a percussive rave with ornamental sound effects; it's a remarkably rich tonal atmosphere with subtle rhythmic propulsion. In short, it's the inverse of Vision Creation Newsun. Similarly, ""Mantral"" takes a melody that might've been a communal chant in another time and uses it as the glue that holds together a blissed-out trance. Twelve minutes of aural Cool Whip, and at no point does the ""noise"" ever seem noisy. Folks expecting Boredoms II will probably be bummed by the general calm of this record, and that goes double for anyone expecting another Omoide Hatoba. Crown is something you put on after getting high, to watch the ceiling spin to. There's no danger of being hit with something unexpected halfway through a groove, and while that might be disheartening to long-time shock-city citizens, I take it as refined clarity from Yamamoto.","Follow this path to creamy nirvana: destroy cats, consume dangerous chemicals, make noise, practice a little bit, organize chaos, rinse ...

Real Feelness,The Pattern,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a00cc0084474cd0bfa85/1:1/w_160/2962675f.jpg,2002-11-24 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6191-real-feelness/,Lookout!,"Just a few months ago I had to put the smack down on the Pattern's Immediately EP, citing the inevitable problems of taking a (reportedly) good live garage band and trying to catch their energy in the studio. Singer Chris Appelgren's balls-out whining stuck out above the textbook two-guitar garage rock, and as for the songs, they just weren't there. This disc wasn't going to convince Americans to ditch The Hives and buy domestic. But their first full-length, Real Feelness, is better in every way. I'll skip the comments on how similar they sound to the other garage acts touring post-Ramones America right now: a good time is a good time. The first track, ""Fragile Awareness"", comes raging like a schoolful of kids let out early for a bomb scare. Appelgren's ""pitch? fuck the pitch"" vocal stylings soar and swoop around the band's clean, battering attack, which allows just a hint of sweat-- but they also let up for some trickier riffage: there's that great barbed hook on ""Selling Submarines"", and the perfect denim-jacket power harmonies on the ""The Best Called Rest"". More interesting are the moments where Appelgren exposes more about his past-- and not just in a cock-rock way (though ""You or You"", about his indifference to which groupie he takes home, is snazzy). ""Selling Submarines"" is about drug-dealing, and Appelgren has said that his mother was ""a very low-level cocaine dealer,"" a heavy inspiration for a briskly catchy pop-rock confection. And then there's the risky closer, ""Rangefinder"", on which we discover that Appelgren is really, at heart, one sappy motherfucker: It's an acoustic love song, absolutely unguarded. The lyrics are unabashedly sentimental, and Appelgren's voice is bare and sneer-free. ""When you develop your photographs/ And hang all your pictures to dry/ I will appear as a small red star/ Patiently watching the world passing by."" Yeah, that's cheesy, alright-- so cheesy it could only be on a record with the name Real Feelness. Hell, I get embarrassed just listening to it. But I won't heckle it for the simple reason that more risks ought to be taken in indie rock these days. And while this track might be a step in the wrong direction, it is a step nonetheless. As for the future of The Pattern? I don't know where they plan to go after this. This genre revival's passing us by faster than you can say ""Swing Kids"". But there's always that remote possibility that they'll transcend their pigeonhole and come with something harder, or just better. Garage rockers do the darndest things.","Just a few months ago I had to put the smack down on the Pattern's Immediately EP, citing the ...

We Are Your Friends,Simian,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a40f5e6ef959693207a9/1:1/w_160/496a3398.jpg,2002-11-24 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7171-we-are-your-friends/,Astralwerks,"Oh, Lordy, 'tis a rough time for fans of experimental pop. The kind with guitars, anyway. Too many bands can't get over their fascination with the classic rock originators, or worse, their emulation of second-generation bands already over-obsessed with the 60s. The harvest is so scarce, I've been forced to turn to  the IDM boroughs, where Max Tundra and Schneider TM are making the best sticky melodies in unusual settings I've heard this leaf-shedding season. UK band Simian might be an exception to this trend, though, a predominantly guitar-based pop-rock band that somehow doesn't fall easily into my preset compartments. For the first time in a while, I can actually write about such a group without referencing Elephant 6-- um, except for that mention, I guess. The comparison is tempting, however; when my friend first introduced me to We Are Your Friends, he said he'd heard that it was a side project of an Apples in Stereo member. That this wasn't true was pretty clear after one listen-- even the most convention-toeing Simian tracks are far more interesting than any Apples product in recent memory. We Are Your Friends might not be a completely successful album, but it's rarely less than a compelling one. Simian manages this by embracing musical innovation more recent than Pet Sounds, most notably in their use of computerized rhythm tracks to flesh out the sunshine daydream, leaning more on the sampler than the spacey psychedelics of their debut, Chemistry Is What We Are. Right, sounds like fellow British casserole chefs Super Furry Animals a bit, but Simian strikes me as slightly more devoted to the technological possibilities. Which means audio surprises abound on We Are Your Friends, providing enough subtle tweaks on a familiar formula to hold attention. Opening track ""La Breeze"" switches back and forth between Bollywood soundtrack and Britpop anthem like a radio crossing frequencies from New Delhi and London. ""When I Go"" starts out as an embarrassing stab at country twang, but improves as it moves through lands of loop-assisted organ strut and dense blue-sky harmonies. ""In Between"" and ""The Way That I Live"" are set to nervous beats and spooky synths worthy of The Neptunes... well, maybe worthy of The Streets... okay, not even that good, but pretty commendable for a rock band, anyway. So with a group so obviously full of clever ideas, it's a little disappointing that their songwriting chops don't quite measure up to their bag of tricks. Often I find myself more interested in the computerized embellishments than the songs themselves, and paying attention to the melodies of the schmaltzy ""End of the Day"" or butterknife-edged ""Big Black Gun"" is a far less rewarding endeavor. Simian also tends to get a little too jokey in their delivery, a weakness that becomes gratingly annoying in the cartoonish vocals of the otherwise groovy ""Helpless"" or the awful horror-show lyrics of ""Skin"". But stumbles and all, Simian deserves a cap-tip for evolving beyond the more standard psych-pop trappings of their last album into techno-curious territory. They may not quite be able to shake sounding like a rock band dabbling in electronics, but all the same, they remain a good photo-negative counterpart to the lap-pop movement currently sweeping through IDM circles. After all, there's still a lot of unexplored territory between traditional rock forms and computer creations, and We Are Your Friends represents a pleasant, if flawed, expedition into this wilderness.","Oh, Lordy, 'tis a rough time for fans of experimental pop.

You Can Play These Songs with Chords,Death Cab for Cutie,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8d7c0084474cd0c0f0b/1:1/w_160/4b058c61.jpg,2002-11-24 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2226-you-can-play-these-songs-with-chords/,Barsuk,"Wanna make a home copy of You Can Play These Songs with Chords for free, without taking your chances of drawing the RIAA's ire and endangering your ability to hold political office in the future? Dust off a vinyl copy of Death Cab's 1999 debut Something About Airplanes, dig out that old Fisher-Price record player (the tan-colored one with the fat needle), stick a pillow over the speaker, and play it at about 27 rpm. Wal-la! This Mr. Wizard solution works because the meat of You Can Play These Songs with Chords is a reissue of the band's treasured demo tape of the same name, eight ultra-lo-fi recordings released on cutting-edge cassette format back in the simpler times of 1998 when said band was comprised only of Ben Gibbard and Chris Walla. Five of the eight songs later turned up with increased fidelity on the official debut, Something About Airplanes, and like most of that album, the representatives here contain at least one great moment surrounded by a lot of mere goodness: the envelope-glue sweetness of organ-laced ""President of What?"", the subtle guitar melody shift a minute into ""Champagne in a Paper Cup"", the ""I'm def-in-ite-ly shaking"" segment of ""Pictures at an Exhibition"". So, these five tracks were obviously enough to plant the seeds for a happy indie label contract, but what of the other three? Well, two of them (the surprisingly punk-paced ""That's Incentive"" and pleasantly forgettable ""Hindsight"") weren't done much injustice by languishing in obscurity, but ""Two Cars"" was worth digging out of the attic. Melancholy/playful organ complementing Gibbard's nice guy vocals, simple Walla-brand production, and non-flashy drumming keep the song appropriately approachable-- it's almost mopey-friend enough to fit on the band's high water mark We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes. Eight songs and twenty-nine minutes leave a lot of blank disc space, though, so Barsuk has graciously filled out the package with assorted breakup-rumor-starting rarities, to the point of outweighing the featured material 10-to-8. Too bad the first five of these are, frankly, rather embarrassing, representing an era that suggests the image of Death Cab as high school band playing graduation parties. Heretofore unknown tendencies to sound like a) They Might Be Giants fans (""TV Trays,"" ""Tomorrow""), b) by-numbers pop-punk (""New Candles,"" an unwisely suped-up ""This Charming Man"" cover), and c) vocal sample experimentalists (""Flustered/Hey Tomcat"") all come back to haunt, like yearbook photos from when you used to part your hair. The latter five tracks, collecting seven-inch odds-and-sods for vinyl-phobes, fare a bit better, as they feature later incarnations of DCFC more confident in their dreamy sound. ""State Street Residential"" and ""Army Corps of Architects"" are wobbly first steps exploring the vaguely slowcore epic approach employed on the Stability EP, while the cover of Secret Stars' ""Wait"" is obvious, but plays to DCFC's strengths when they put their guitar thang down, flip it, and reverse it (er, subtly) all over the coda. An early version of ""Song for Kelly Huckaby"" is the one useless inclusion of this quintet, which otherwise as a package comes close to the fine Forbidden Love EP, but without a clearly essential standout like that release's ""Photobooth"" (the two-tiered ""Prove My Hypotheses"", however, comes close). These last few tracks raise the ownability of You Can Play These Songs with Chords considerably, but it's still not really a must-have collection for anyone that doesn't have a Ben Gibbard shrine in the corner of their dorm room. In fact, the release of this early material would be most useful as a reminder to the band themselves that they always sounded better recording in a living room, blanketing their output in warm hiss and simple rhythms. And while the recent departure of overcompensating drummer Michael Schorr may have already pointed them in this direction, a listen to their own reissue certainly couldn't hurt.","Wanna make a home copy of You Can Play These Songs with Chords for free, without taking your chances of ...

Loud Like Nature,Add N to (X),by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a00c5e6ef9596931fe76/1:1/w_160/0f72e56c.jpg,2002-11-21 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/50-loud-like-nature/,Mute,"If avoiding categories is a virtue, praised be Add N to (X). When we first caught a glimpse of the band on the cover of its first record, featuring a garish and kitschy photograph in which a vintage Moog is pulled from a human stomach Alien-style, it was easy to peg them as some kind of retro art project, making music from the cast-off instruments of records past. That album confounded expectations, offering varied and inspired knob-twiddling that often worked against type. And here on their fourth album, it's now clear that Add N to (X) are very difficult to define and don't fit very well into any particular scene. Being on Mute and composing music primarily with keyboards, one wants to place Add N to (X) somewhere in the dance-pop continuum, but from the first track on Loud Like Nature this sort of classification is problematic. ""Total All Out Water"" is anthemic rock at the corner where Glam meets Classic, a corner Gary Glitter (his ""Rock and Roll Part 2"" drumbeat is stolen here) and David Bowie (circa ""Panic in Detroit"") have been known to frequent. The riff is undeniable and the bass throb is sleazy, but it would sound like hell worked into a DJ set. This is music for cruising the L.A. freeway system with the top down. Add N to (X) have a fondness for natural drum sounds and generally eschew drum machines, which partly explains why the band often sounds so much more rock than one would expect. ""Sheez Mine"", on the other hand, fits quite well into what's happening now in electroclash, with an appropriately stiff drumbeat, chanted lyrics expressing disgust, and an uptempo propulsion. The following ""Invasion of the Polaroid People"" makes another sharp left turn, with spoken word sections and weird sound effects that combine to sound very mid-90s, like something off the album Steven Jesse Bernstein did with Steve Fisk for Sub Pop. The vocals on ""Party Bag"" remind me of Neil Haggerty's neo-soul falsetto, but the music is thick analog grunge, all oscillating bass tones and messy noise settings. Despite the presence of a Theremin solo, it still sounds difficult to place in terms of era. All this variety is to be commended, but a lot of the tracks here sound like unfinished sketches. You find yourself waiting for the hook or chorus to kick in, and too often, it never does. For every ""Take Me to Your Leader"", another catchy electro track with a great chorus riff, there's a ""P.P. Machine"" or ""Up the Punks,"" marginal between-song interludes that go on for four minutes, filled with enough interesting noises but fewer interesting ideas. Still, these moments of tedium, while too frequent, don't overwhelm the album, keeping Loud Like Nature on par with the bulk of Add N to (X)'s output. They may be hard to pigeonhole, but they're easy enough to like.","If avoiding categories is a virtue, praised be Add N to (X). When we first caught a glimpse of the ...

Practical Wireless,Jack Hayter,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c088ea9e61561daa7c2e/1:1/w_160/041fdcbf.jpg,2002-11-21 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3781-practical-wireless/,Absolutely Kosher,"Despite being perennially thrashed by ye olde Pitching Fork, I can think of worse bands than Hefner. It might take me a few seconds, but I can totally do it. Hell, once in a while, the band even manages to stumble over something pretty great-- I was briefly enamored with ""I Love Only You"", and I'm only a little ashamed to admit it. Still, if Darren Hayman started offering me musical advice, it might just give me pause. I'd sooner trust my musical career to the psychic crapshoot of Miss Cleo, given Hayman's recent decisions, but then again, I'm not the guitarist for Hefner, so what do I know, anyway? Jack Hayter, on the other hand, is the guitarist, and when Hayman cajoled him into putting his meek acoustic balladry to tape, he heeded the call. Practical Wireless is the result. And how is it? Let's say this: it's nothing Earth-shattering, but as sensitive solo artists go, the guy can hold his own. Ever since the traumatic singer/songwriter drought of 1983, global stores have rebounded forcefully, and we've all been able to enjoy the mixed blessings of a surplus for the last few years. That aggressive climate, however, means problems for Jack. Most of us are already hip-deep in wool-cap wearing dudes armed with acoustics, and Hayter's more-of-same technique isn't likely to set him apart from the crowd anytime soon. Occasionally, he trades his acoustic guitar in for a steel pedal rig, and there's some accompaniment to speak of in the form of maracas, distant flutes, and the odd accordion, but in general, the album is almost uncomfortably sparse. Most tracks leave little beyond Hayter's voice and his slight, often repetitive compositions to hold a listener's interest. He breaks stride with standout tracks like the awkwardly, uncertainly charming ""Blind Man's Fog"" and ""Narrow Skies"", but even three minutes of most of these arrangements could bore the brass off a doorknob. Really, though, it's Hayter's voice that gets top billing on Practical Wireless, and with good reason. Hayter has one of the weariest, most world-beaten voices around, his ace-in-the-hole. His strains to hit the highs, and extended notes reek with character; if it were any more pained, it would sound forced, and if it were any less so, he couldn't even begin to sell these lyrics. He falls into neither trap, though, and nails these songs with all the sincerity they deserve, giving the album a surprisingly personal texture. In fact, his vocal work even helps to salvage its musical accompaniment-- the acoustic plucking is so whisper-soft that even his exquisitely tired voice sounds somewhat strong in comparison. It's this underlying implication of strength that really adds depth and humanity to his work, and it goes a long way to redeeming the overall blandness of the record. Between that and a set of uniformly sweet, but slightly absurd lyrics, even the worst songs on this solo outing at least glimpse redemption. All but one, in fact. As soon as Peter Perret kicks off, he'll be spinning in his grave at Hayter's cover of his Only Ones classic ""Another Girl Another Planet"". For his part, Hayter certainly ""makes it his own"", but this means reducing the gorgeous burn of the New York Dolls-inspired punk classic to a dull ember of a song. He manages to bring out a lot of emotion that probably wasn't there in the first place, but also completely neuters the original's dramatic crash of breathless emotion. In the end, it becomes sincere and sweet like all the other songs on the album; not terrible in its own right, but not great, either. Still, if it comes down to a choice between this and Hefner? Hayter could build on this album if he threw in some more inventive arrangements; at this point, Hefner's just holding you back, Jack.","Despite being perennially thrashed by ye olde Pitching Fork, I can think of worse bands than Hefner.

Start Breaking My Heart,Manitoba,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1dec0084474cd0bfef9/1:1/w_160/6f44be01.jpg,2002-11-21 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5078-start-breaking-my-heart/,LeafLeaf,"Boards of Canada's Music Has the Right to Children can be seen as the Kind of Blue of IDM. Mind you, I'm not comparing the quality of the music (hey, BoC are good, but they're not that good), but where the records sit in their respective canons. Like Kind of Blue, Music Has the Right is a record that appeals to people who aren't normally fans of the genre and rates exceptionally high for those who are. These albums of accessible excellence serve as the perfect introduction to a new field of music. Which is probably why one of the FAQs by rock fans on the hunt for electronic music is, ""What can I get that sounds like Boards of Canada?"" For a while I had difficulty answering this question. Sure, the Boards borrowed heavily from Aphex Twin, and much of their sound can be traced to moments on I Care Because You Do and The Richard D. James Album. Yet both of those records are all over the map and ripe with abrasive moments (""Start as You Mean to Go On"", ""Corn Mouth"") that appeal more to those familiar with the beat-driven electronic scene. Music Has the Right to Children was a tightly focused, unified listen with a distinctive sound that never strayed far from the timeworn principles of pop. All said, it's a unique formula. I've previously answered the BoC query with a suggestion to look for artists on Germany's Morr Music label. The two-disc set Putting the Morr Back in Morrissey covers a decent amount of stylistic ground but never strays far from the ideal of dreamy, contemplative electronic pop. As an added bonus for rock fans, artists on Morr like Accelera Deck and Manufracture don't have guitarophobia. I can, without reservation, add Manitoba to the list of artists I'd recommend to BoC fans. There are many stylistic and thematic parallels (warm analog tones, sharp focus on melody, song titles like ""Children Play Well Together""), but Stop Breaking My Heart never feels second-generation. The point-of-view here is unique, even if the sources are easy to trace. Where others in this vein opt for a hazy, nebulous cloud of half-remembered dreams, Manitoba's music is direct and unassuming while still remaining evocative. Dan Snaith is the man behind Manitoba, and he opens Start Breaking My Heart with a reference to his motherland called ""Dundas, Ontario"". It sets the tone with a warbling synthesizer, some glitchy stuff happening in the distance, and crisp drum programming. ""People Eating Fruit"" is an early highlight, with the prettiest melody on the record and a perfectly executed air of nostalgia. The keyboards make me think of what I'd hoped Plone would sound like when I first read reviews of For Beginner Piano. Central to the track is a lovely vocal bit of children doing ""me re la so, do re mi"" like the von Trapp family on ecstacy. Things take an emotionally deeper turn when the voices are pitch-shifted to sound like a chorus of chanting monks. ""Mammals vs Reptiles"" follows and comes as a bit of a shock as Manitoba dabbles in jazzy electronic fusion. The cymbal-heavy drum line could be lifted from an Art Blakey stomper, and a section of blaring horns (also sampled, I imagine) reminds me a bit of Spiritualized. As the horns reach a crescendo, the record clicks abruptly into the midtempo ""Brandon"", which contains melodic elements from ""Dundas, Ontario"" (Brandon is also a Canadian town). The spacious track is the perfect tonic for its dense predecessor, and it neatly illustrates one of this album's primary strengths: smart sequencing. A good sense of design is necessary to make tracks like the cinematic ""Children Play Well Together"" (one of the darker shadings on the album, it contains an uneasy piano refrain and nervous acoustic guitar arpeggios) work next to the busy, percussion-driven ""Lemon Yoghourt"". The jazz motif returns for the eclectic ""Paul's Birthday"", which combines busy cymbal work, a melodic fragment on flugelhorn, harp glissandi, and eventually, a tough beat. Start Breaking My Heart may sound like a bit of a balancing act, but Manitoba holds it together and even makes it look easy. The term ""accessible excellence"" fits like a glove.","Boards of Canada's Music Has the Right to Children can be seen as the Kind of Blue of IDM ...

Under Construction,Missy Elliott,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc4fabf31b7dc7155cb2/1:1/w_160/ad44bac6.jpg,2002-11-21 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2756-under-construction/,Elektra,"Aside from Eminem, Missy ""Misdemeanor"" Elliott's the most interesting pop persona of the moment. Unlike other video stars, she has yet to attempt a beatless hip-hop album (I'm looking at you, Lauryn Hill), disrobe on TRL in a psychotic rage (Mariah Carey), or project herself as finger-licking jailbait for repressed pedophiles (take your pick). With superproducer Timbaland lacing her tracks, Missy's been able to achieve the level of popularity usually reserved for people half her size, and her bizarre sci-fi costumes and off-the-wall attitude conjure a mainstream, female version of Kool Keith-- albeit one without the hip-hop pedigree, lyrical skills, or off-camera insanity. And yet, despite her spunk and Timbaland's funk, hip-hop headz have a hard time accepting her as anything other than a (very) lovable MTV personality who makes great club-hop. While it's doubtful that anything Missy ever does will touch Critical Beatdown, Under Construction shows that Missy's much more than the product of an extraterrestrial focus group, and that she deserves to be taken seriously among hip-hop aficionados. 'Course, it doesn't hurt her cred that the theme of Under Construction gives an au courant nod to classic hip-hop forms. From the weak graffiti in the liner notes to the two-inch-thick gold chains, it's obvious she's mining the same nostalgia trip as countless underground acts-- only Missy doesn't have the burden of having to spend years laying broke in the gutter, studying the nuances of the culture. Naturally, it's not Missy's fashion appropriations that make this record tight; it's Timbaland's musical palate, thick with old-school samples and breaks. He even kicks off low-rider ""Funky Fresh Dressed"" with the same ""here's a little story that must be told"" sample that introduces DJ Premier's Deep Concentration. Tim lays down a classic break for the track's beat, with the hook cribbing the MC Lyte lyric, ""Funky fresh, dressed to impress, ready to party,"" which seems appropriate considering Missy's status in today's musical climate. It gets better: as Ms Jade steps up to the mic for her cameo, Tim flips the track with the reverse-loop mindfuck of the Beasties' ""Paul Revere"". It's true, of course, that all these elements are overused and obvious enough to make Jurassic 5 blush. But they work because Timbaland makes them work, his frantic, chopped-up, bass-quake production recontextualizing them in a neo-futurist soundworld that, though using an eighth of the samples, hits with all the strength of a Bomb Squad fury. Less auspicious is Missy's reworking of Method Man's '94 classic ""Bring the Pain"". Unlike the Wu classic, there's nothing raw or vital about this baby. The production is identical to the original but smoothed out on an R&B; tip with pop feel appeal to it, and even Missy's slick croon seems diametrically opposed to the spirit of the original. And Method Man took off time from endorsing Speed Stick to lay down a verse on this shit? The man's career is already a corpse; validating a painful rehash of a track from his peak isn't gonna win him any friends. Fortunately, Jay-Z's guest appearance on ""Back in the Day"" carries a little more weight. Although the song reeks of both a Confucian historical reworking and old-skool hip-hop dilettantism, Jay delivers a smoothly masterful verse that name-checks personal heroes Showbiz and AG and calls out the narrow-minded moralizing of political pundits Bill O'Reilly and Chuck Phillips. One of the year's funniest lines is Jay comparing himself and Missy to ""Rae and Ghostface"". (So... is Missy supposed to be Ghost or Raekwon?) Missy's delivery ain't bad, either. I mean, it's not like she's composing anything traditionally deep or revelatory, but the ease with which she navigates the Timbaland's musical landmines is stunning-- these two were made for each other. And I haven't even talked about ""Work It""... but do we really need to talk about ""Work It""? If you don't already know it's the greatest pop single/video of the year, I suggest that you emerge from your dusty record crates and turn on MTV. Just for a second!! I bet it's on right now. Even with all its clever samples and sideways acknowledgments, of course, Under Construction is to true-skool hip-hop what SI's Swimsuit Issue is to women's fashion-- but don't try and front like you don't salivate over that shit. Once you push the politics of it aside, Under Construction's a good record with some incredibly sick production work. Anyone who'd dismiss it for the sake of maintaining some bullshit underground cred is only playin' himself.","Aside from Eminem, Missy ""Misdemeanor"" Elliott's the most interesting pop persona of the moment.

Obscured by Clowns,Rumah Sakit,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2d3ea9e61561daa4b3a/1:1/w_160/4c788523.gif,2002-11-20 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6872-obscured-by-clowns/,Temporary Residence,"In an ideal world, innovation would happen once, unmarred by copycats. But in the real world, there are no Radioheads without Coldplays, no Sunny Day Real Estates without Get Up Kids, no Strokes without Vines. Trends spawn idolaters, which in turn spawn shit. This, of course, is not limited to bands who break the mainstream; it happens with every genre, no matter how popular or underground. In recent years, post-rock has seen the worst of it. You had your pioneers (Slint, Tortoise, Mogwai, etc) and you had your everything else. And while most of the greats are still together, the ""everything else"" has left us tired-- no, sick and tired-- of the whole business. The post-rock subgenre most clearly running on fumes these days is the jazz-centered variation, influenced by Thrill Jockey powerhouses as Tortoise and Isotope 217. Rumah Sakit fits somewhere between that and a brand of math-rock championed by Don Caballero. Something, however, saves Rumah Sakit from the clich√©d boredom commonly propagated by jazzy and mathy post-rockers. Never steeped too far in theory and proggy details, Rumah Sakit keeps a keen eye out for two things: emotional intensity and an awareness of unity and consonance. Both jazz-based post-rock and math-rock pride themselves on musical expression through complicated theory. As has been well-documented, though, it often comes at the expense of accessibility, reducing the music to an intellectual exercise. Rumah Sakit takes cues from bands at the opposite end of the spectrum-- the delightfully simplistic and overtly emotional Explosions in the Sky, for example (albeit less funerary)-- to avoid such pitfalls. ""Go Horsey Go (Live)"" typifies the approach, killing 2\xBD minutes of complex, winding, metallic rock into silence, then gradually resurrecting its more primal essence with a simple, climactic denouement, driven by non-sequitur guitar patterns and feedback, and a steadily mounting drumbeat. So now let's talk about ""New Underwear Dance"", which not only deserves a Grammy for year's best song title but is also further indicative of this band's balance of theory and passion. A bright, bucolic guitar passage draws strength from the gradual addition of drums, overdrive, modulation and counterpoint, finding a vibrant and complex, yet evocative, intensity. The band retreats from this opening section to a simpler groove, but again rises to maximum power-- this time uncomplicated, just balls-out volume. Rumah Sakit also understand a need for unity and consonance, foundations of rock music. ""No One Likes a Grumpy Cripple"" bluffs an unsettling modal jazz number, with something like a 7/8 time signature, but instead of leaving the tension unresolved, the band blows the song up with a chorus of attacking guitars. ""Sausage Full of Secrets (Live)"" also gets to the point, this time a bit more quickly, transitioning from a brief, sparse, Slint-like opener to ascend to atmospheric heights (and a 4/4 time signature welcome to the ears). Low points are predictable, coming when Rumah Sakit falls prey to the usual cerebral, antiseptic post-rock temptations. For example, the title track's obscured by excessive meandering, never giving any indication of the song's center, or the composition's significance. It winds down with a languid, free-form spaz-out, clocking in at a needless 10\xBD minutes (five of which are discombobulated spaz-time). Other pretentious interludes are less egregious, but their presence definitely hurts the album's overall appeal. Rumah Sakit largely manages to avoid stereotypes and clich√©s to carve a unique nook within the saturated panoply of post-rock. They may not have created a timeless legacy for themselves, but that doesn't mean this album isn't compelling enough for you to enjoy in the present.","In an ideal world, innovation would happen once, unmarred by copycats.

Out of Season,Beth GibbonsRustin Man,by: Jesse Fahnestock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf21c0084474cd0c2fc6/1:1/w_160/e1871030.jpg,2002-11-20 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3446-out-of-season/,Go!Beat,"Portishead were a simulacrum, their anchors sunk deep in sample culture with Beth Gibbons' torch singer stylings and Adrian Utley's soundtrack scrapings operating merely as tools in the sample yard. In its evocation of forgotten jazz, blues, film music, and hip-hop, Portishead's Dummy was the quintessence of ""even better than the real thing"", yet when the magic ceased on the band's eponymous sophomore album, it was ultimately due to their desire to be the real thing. On Portishead, the trio retained their hip-hop elements only in principle-- they played every sound themselves, pressed the results to dubplates, and then cut and looped them into backing tracks. In practice, Portishead had abandoned the sampler's art-- the recontextualization of sound and the creation of history from history-- and so, the thrill had gone. It's no coincidence that the best post-Dummy release from the Portishead camp remains DJ Andy Smith's eclectic mash-up, The Document . Beth Gibbons, one assumes, was never much into hip-hop. Hers, after all, was the bleeding heart at the center of it all, and her remarkable, tortured voice (equal parts Billie Holiday and Sandy Denny), remains capable of gravitas for any occasion. ""Mysteries"" opens Out of Season brilliantly, folk arpeggios plucking their way around Beth's gasps while a cadre of gospel singers in the background oooooh the record into being. ""Tom the Model"" takes that cue and runs with it, answering delicate folk verses with a nicely retro big-band soul chorus. Beth attacks the song with verve, and even the hint of self-pity in the lyric is kicked into touch by her defiance. If only the rest of Out of Season displayed that energy. Instead, we're quickly plunged into moodiness for the sake of moodiness, overwhelmed by Gibbons' frankly unpitiable obsession with her own misfortune. At their best, Portishead turned this kind of smoky cabaret blues into an invigorating showpiece. But replace crackling vinyl and subwoofer bass with somber piano and mournful cello, and all you're left with is... well, a pretty goddamn miserable woman who happens to have a great voice. That's ""Show"" for you, and for all its miserable pleading, it's as forgettable a song as Gibbons has ever crooned. ""Romance"" tries some moaning french horns on for size, and frankly looks ridiculous in them. Chrissakes, who suggested a 90-second french horn solo was a good idea? And again, if Gibbons' Billie Holiday routine was engaging in Portishead's hip-hop context-- reconstituted blues that fit their mix perfectly-- here it threatens to go a little pantomime. And now to the issue of Rustin Man: What is the deal with calling yourself Rustin Man? Are we supposed to let that slide? Turns out it's an alias for ex-Talk Talk bassist Paul Webb. Now, Talk Talk did some wonderful things-- Spirit of Eden and Laughing Stock both proved what can be achieved with emphasis on mood and atmosphere. Here, however, Webb allows Gibbons to dictate both, and it just doesn't work. Striking as her voice can be, she does little to prove that it has the emotive range to match its power. Elsewhere, ""Resolve"" is a pretty but inconsequential folk tune, and ""Drake"" and ""Funny Time of Year"" waltz their way in and out of the frame without forcing you to take much notice. Which leaves ""Rustin Man"" the song, a frustrating hint of what might have been. Its pure ambience (think Dot Allison's recent album, if produced by Tim Friese-Greene) sounds remarkably modern next to the trad fare that precedes it, and the warbling and sizzling of the synths forces Beth to be a little more active with her vocal-- she slips in and out of the mix, allowing atmosphere to build rather than overwhelming it with her moods. Sonically, of course, it's no less bleak than the rest of this album, and though it does bring in some much-needed excitement at the end, it's just not powerful enough to save the whole from its vanilla dejection.

The line, ""My dandy voice makes the most anti-choice granny's panties moist,"" from Paul's It's Very Stimulating EP, is repeated on Paullelujah! in the chorus of the song ""Cock Mobster"". Nonsensical, awkward alliterative rhymes! Lame-ass mnemonic devices from high school math class! Gratuitous references to Greek epic poetry! Wow, Paul Barman sure is one clever, well-educated guy. He can rhyme words with other words! He's an iconoclast! In a thigh-high condom cast! Building upon the past like Monet painting a pond and grass! So what exactly is Paul trying to say with Paullelujah? Well, let's see... Paul's rhymes consist mainly of vaguely clever attacks on trendy ultra-liberal types, totally out-of-place references to art and academia, third grade poop humor that would probably lead most third graders to kick the shit out of him, and aimless, self-indulgent wordplay. What can we learn from all this? Obviously, that Paul is a smart fellow! He knows lots of stuff about everything! Hey, he rhymes about John Cage! And rapping about John Cage is like crapping on a fond sage! Or an actor napping when he's supposed to be on stage! Hey, that's more confusing than reading a Jacques Lacan page! Yes, that's right, it's fun to see how many consecutive rhymes you can construct for a given phrase, regardless of logic and meaning! It's not even that difficult! And when you're done, you're left with that wonderful sense of smug self-satisfaction that you can only get from doing something completely fucking useless. On Barman's It's Very Stimulating EP, the relatively consistent theme of sex at least gave Barman some kind of focus, resulting in some genuinely funny rhymes. Here, he's all over the place, the only at all constant theme in Barman's raps being... well, Barman himself. It was kind of funny the first time around, when Paul opened his EP with the line, ""My brain makes the earth dark/ But I'm hung like a birthmark,"" but on the unrelentingly self-glorifying Paullelujah!, Barman tries to play both sides, dropping endless, useless bits of trivial knowledge as well as endless, useless references to his endless, useless store of trivial knowledge, while glibly playing up his own weaknesses as an MC. And indeed, Barman's flow is even worse on Paullelujah! than it was on It's Very Stimulating. He trips up on his own words so much that it's often hard figure out what he's saying. Thankfully, it doesn't really matter what he's saying-- twenty seconds into the record, you'll probably have already stopped giving a shit. And it's kind of a shame, too, because Barman got some pretty talented producers to help him out on this record. Old standby Prince Paul, modern-day innovator MF Doom, and probable furry Phofo, all lend their production skills to the record. Some of the beats-- most notably MF Doom's contribution to ""The Anarchist Bookstore""-- are pretty tight, but any rhythmic complexities present in the beats are immediately bulldozed by Barman's lame and awkward rhyming. It's always been clear that Paul likes to be the center of attention-- and though some of the beats on Paullelujah! are pretty creative, they're always kept repetitive enough that you'll eventually have no choice but to pay attention to Paul's lame-ass rhymes. I could spend another ten pages going into the specifics of why this album is disastrous, but I don't think that's necessary. Instead, I'll briefly summarize what you can learn from listening to Paullelujah!, leaving absolutely no reason for you to bother with it. Paul Barman is a smart, educated, politically informed guy. He knows stuff about art and math and stuff. And he can rhyme, like, anything. He's probably way smarter than you. Seriously. But he's not like those other smart, educated, politically informed guys. Because he makes fun of them. So he's smarter than them, too. Seriously. But, seriously, don't take him that seriously. Because he thinks poop is really funny, and there are goofy skits and stuff on the record. Hey, remember De La Soul? Didn't they do goofy skits? Didn't Prince Paul produce them, too? Didn't it actually seem relevant back then? So, in conclusion, Paul Barman has recorded the perfect album for his target audience-- assuming, of course, that his target audience is Paul Barman. I can only hope he enjoys it as much as I do.","Sometimes it's best to stand aside and let a record speak for itself.

Rolled Gold,Action,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ffac0084474cd0bfa51/1:1/w_160/4b03d0b4.jpg,2002-11-20 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/31-rolled-gold/,Parasol,"If The Action were so great, why haven't you heard of them? If only it were that simple. Famed Beatles producer George Martin signed this British mod outfit to his AIR Productions in the mid-60s and helped them produce a few psych-pop singles (including 1967's ""Shadows and Reflections"", featured on the Nuggets II box) to no popular avail. Their sound was more refined than The Small Faces, punchier than The Zombies, yet they were hardly would-be contenders. The Action's failure to chart a single during their brief existence is one of the mystifying anti-climaxes in rock history, as most of their songs have aged remarkably well. The band formed in the early 60s as The Boys, and cut one single for Pye before changing their name to The Action. The principal players were vocalist Reg King (possessing a powerful, debonair croon), guitarists Alan King and Pete Watson (later replaced by Martin Stone), bassist Mike Evans, and drummer Roger Powell (a tighter, funkier Ringo-esque stylist). Their early singles on Parlophone (courtesy of Martin) were comprised of highly respectable R&B; covers (""Land of 1000 Dances"") and freakbeat. By 1967, their sound had developed similarly to many of their peers into an eclectic mix of folk-rock (probably Byrds-influenced) and even psychedelia. Eventually, this group would disband, later forming an even better pure psych group called Mighty Baby, but Rolled Gold captures their final demo recordings in 1967-68. The music on this collection offers evidence that The Action were a truly wronged band. The hooks are bright, the playing rough but assured, and the songwriting on par with anything The Who or Zombies were producing. However, the sub-par demo-quality of the recordings (this material was laid down hastily in hopes of landing a new record deal) robs more than a little power from the music-- for that reason, you'll need some imagination to draw parallels between this record and Odessey and Oracle. Nevertheless, there are moments of brilliance any lover of late-60s British rock will want to hear. The opener ""Come Around"" was planned to open a pending (but never recorded) proper LP, and it's a lively slice of proto-power-pop, with that dash of quaint melodicism only the English bands could pull off convincingly. The descending bassline and Reg King's stately boom practically define the Mod sound in 1967, as does the flowery white soul of ""Something to Say"". Even better is the show-stopping, Austin Powers-destroying frill of ""In My Dream"". The chorus is the ultimate crossbreeding of mod-cool, Bond sheen and garage splinter, and I can only imagine the splash they'd have made had this ever been given the professional veneer it deserved (though George Martin's minimal touches are ace). The highlight of the compilation-- one that transforms Rolled Gold from an interesting curio into a near must-have-- is the transcendent, rock-splendor of ""Brain"". Reg King shouts, barely able to contain himself, ""Take your brain/ It's time to go/ You don't have long to go!"" over a wah-wah fueled pound that would make Thunderclap Newman proud. Brent Rademaker of Beachwood Sparks contributes some liner notes to this collection, and gives his awed respects to this song-- rightly so, as ""Brain"" alone dwarfs most neo-psych bands entire catalogs. Classic. Of course, not every song is a winner, and the lack of production keeps me from determining just how this stuff would have worked as a coherent experience (singles are a blast, but surely The Action deserved an entry in the concept LP sweepstakes of their day). A collection of their released material titled Action Packed is also available, and any serious evaluation of their sound begins there. However, there's something magical about this stuff, too, and I'd guess anyone sufficiently into the scene might eventually work their way through to it.","If The Action were so great, why haven't you heard of them?

White Star Line,White Star Line,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa15c0084474cd0c113c/1:1/w_160/cd7befa5.gif,2002-11-20 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8649-white-star-line/,Antiantenna,"A trip on the White Star Line only takes forty-three minutes, but it feels like days and days, and no matter how often it seems like it's going somewhere, it never quite leaves the station. Time and again, it shows tremendous promise, shooting for dreamy, slow-building psych with the occasional look at upbeat pop songwriting... but this story ends badly; the White Star Line derails among countless stylistic flirtations, and in the end, nothing gets out without being at least somewhat half-assed. The tragedy of it all is that White Star Line often sound like they might be on to something with one genre or another, but by never fully committing, it all just ends up sounding displaced. White Star Line's arrival is so overcooked that it's easy to be fooled-- ""BBQ"" begins with a lulling acoustic stroll that blossoms into wide-open spaces, and even the fairly gratuitous horn section works briefly. A flawless segue into ""And Fine Wine"" follows, and the expansive sweep of ""BBQ"" explodes into a towering, yet tranquil, blast. The impact of reigning slowcore titans Low is evident in the gentle bombast of these opening tracks, but as quickly as it arrived, it's discarded. Cracker's brooding, western shadow looms over the exceptional ""Sniffer's Row"", the crown jewel of the Line. Bass notes crest and break in waves between the rise and fall of bittersweet choruses, paving the way for a crash of piano and guitar. The doe-eyed, plaintive refrains allow Luca Maoloni to display an astoundingly expressive vocal ability that's conspicuously absent elsewhere. The shift in tone and style between the first two and this one is abrupt, but ""Sniffer's Row"" is singularly gripping; it renders the growing identity crisis of the album temporarily forgivable. From here on out, the album steadily loses footing, becoming more and more impenetrable as the band begins to search increasingly frantically for something to which they can anchor their drifting sound. The two-minute instrumental of almost unobstructed near-silence that follows sounds more the like the band huddling up and deciding what to do next than a track meant to contain any worth or meaning. ""'A' Is for 'Arousal'"" is what turns up, and this six-minute epic can't even completely hold itself together-- the song morphs constantly, though not entirely inexplicably. It's not even really worth mentioning that the song's first half is a direct take on the Silver Jews; by the time the second half opens with the incredibly strained call of, ""White Star Line's for dreeeamers,"" the song has completely broken down. This is the sound of a talented band with a good ear for melody who has no idea what they actually sound like. If the band could have hit a few more showstoppers like ""Sniffer's Row"", this wouldn't even be a concern. Sadly, nothing else approaches it, and the fact that none of these songs can really unify into a whole leaves all of them out there to fend for themselves, which they're ill-equipped to do. ""Bowels of a Bummer"" is the single most disappointing reminder of their inability to nail anything down-- even though it's probably the second-best song on the record, it punctuates the album like a massive, festering question mark asking ""Why?"". Maybe White Star's next trip around the block will provide a response.","A trip on the White Star Line only takes forty-three minutes, but it feels like days and days, and no ...

Can't Hear Nothin',Yesterday's Kids,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab09c0084474cd0c12cf/1:1/w_160/a792f860.jpg,2002-11-19 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8883-cant-hear-nothin/,Lookout!Panic Button,"I wish more bands had liner notes like Yesterday's Kids. Some bands don't even have liner notes at all, usually due to laziness or extreme pretentiousness, and most offer only a few bare details. But these three guys (one can assume by their name that they must be adults today) took some time to put a little humor and personality into their liners, offering insight into each of the songs with disarming little anecdotes. This can, of course, be taken to negative extremes, but in this case, it's a nice introduction to the band you're about to listen to, and serves to highlight some of the things you might otherwise miss. In truth, I still can't really find some of the things they talk about putting into these songs (I swear to god there's only one tiny instance of cowbell on this record, though they credit it on a full third of the tracks), but the snapshot of the band's personality is welcome all the same. And while they exhibit a lot of healthy ambition, Yesterday's Kids are fundamentally a pop/punk trio, for better or worse. I think about it as the kind of record I'd like to listen to on the way home from work, but not the kind of record I'd want to listen to at home-- it's diversionary and fun, sometimes even great, but not very deep. The Kids open with ""(Ode to) Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet"", a tribute to the Ontario surf-punks responsible for the ""Kids in the Hall"" theme song. It's an apt enough opener, as it lays out their blueprint-- ringing, lightly distorted guitars, lockstep drums, two-part harmonies, and melodies designed to sit in your ear. By and large, this is what they stick with, and it works most of the time-- ""I Wanna Be Alone (With You)"", ""Keep It Down"" and ""Eighteen"" are three sparkling tracks in a row, a veritable sugar rush of punchy pop. Elsewhere, things run together a bit, and songs like the swaggering ""The Shithead"" flounder on their length or lack of sonic variety. A generic song or two is a hard thing for a band like this to avoid, and Yesterday's Kids don't escape that pitfall. However, they compensate with a little imagination, like the slip into a waltz that ends ""I Don't Care"", or the strings that pop up here and there. In fact, it's violinist Sara Farenholz's contribution to ""Trouble on the Way"" that provides the album's most epiphanous moment. The band adds a harmonica to their usual mix in the verses, enlivening the song's chugging riffs, but it's during the bridge-- where the music suddenly becomes clear and Farenholz's violin bubbles up like lava for a brief, fleeting moment-- that you get the best idea of what this band is capable of. With a few more moments like that on their next record, Yesterday's Kids could graduate completely from any pop/punk label a critic like me could throw at them. And of course, they could always use more cowbell. At the very least, they've proven themselves an able, ambitious band on their second album, and their continued maturation promises good things in the future.","I wish more bands had liner notes like Yesterday's Kids.

Impasse,Richard Buckner,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3dbc0084474cd0c0370/1:1/w_160/c3b99bb1.jpg,2002-11-19 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/998-impasse/,Overcoat,"These alt-country types are supposed to be storytellers, right? Spinning the everyday into gold and crap like that? Well, if that's the road they drive, Richard Buckner may have finally run into his titular impasse. After documenting the achiness and breakiness of his heart over the course of a number of fine records in the mid-to-late 90s, the San Francisco native switched gears to take on the project of adapting the histories of others (namely, the backwater protagonists of poet Edgar Lee Masters' Spoon River Anthology). The result, 2000's The Hill, was a glorious, barely cohesive run-on sentence of a record, crammed almost to bursting with narrative detail. Still, even though Buckner did an admirable job of getting into his characters' heads, he was obviously telling other peoples' stories, begging the question: had he run out of his own? Impasse marks Buckner's return to the first person, as well as a reversion to the blunter rock persona he picked up on 1998's Since and then quickly abandoned in favor of The Hill's sparser acoustics. This shouldn't be (and, for the most part, isn't) a bad thing; as the pop-rockers that kick off the album (""Born Into Giving It Up"" and ""Hoping Wishers Never Lose"") suggest, he's pretty good at it. Still, even between these two songs, the similarities nag-- the same low, metallic guitars clang in the introductions, and the same humming synths wash over the choruses. It doesn't hurt that a number of pleasant numbers in the same mold (Buckner's wife Penny Jo's drums being the main distinguishing features) show themselves throughout the rest of the album; problem is, these are the best the record has to offer. Buckner's lyrical mode has gone from despairingly particular to optimistically impressionist, which is fine for the more upbeat songs. Without that extra weight, however, the more folky tunes don't hold up so well-- where we once were given a story, start to finish, Buckner now pours out a succession of vague images and emotions, and whenever he decides to cut off his stream of consciousness, it sounds like it's a little too soon. Only the sort of epic, sweeping guitar gestures Buckner applies to ""Dusty from the Talk"" make it sound complete; the others end up fragmented and premature. And when he tries to do dire, as on ""Were You Tried & Not as Tough"", it ends up sounding forced, which is awfully disconcerting on a record as unforcedly simple as this one often is. While Buckner's uniqueness still stems from his gorgeous and clear but deep-as-dirt baritone, his voice also seems complicit in homogenizing these songs. The same twang-tricks seem to pop up over and over again, and, unsupported by sonic variety in the songs themselves, this makes melodies all run together. I mean, they're all nice on their own and everything, but over the course of an album, the effect is of a guy at a party that won't stop telling the same story. With the details excised, the story Impasse tells isn't even that personal anymore. Like a ride through the prairie on a summer day, it's pretty, but about as flat as it gets.","These alt-country types are supposed to be storytellers, right?

A Cat May Look at a Queen,Franklin Bruno,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3c65e6ef959693206fb/1:1/w_160/2b193461.jpg,2002-11-14 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/980-a-cat-may-look-at-a-queen/,Absolutely Kosher,"Last spring, someone sent me a frankly despicable novel by Chris Batchelder called Bear v. Shark. Like a lot of novels lately, it was set in a not-too-distant future where people's lives are so entangled with pointless consumerism and cable infotainment (and the all-consuming spectacle of a robotic bear fighting a robotic shark) that they're largely unable to have profitable relationships with one another beyond languid discussions of same. You've heard this complaint before: everything increasingly mediated and branded, less and less of our emotional lives untouched by commerce and commentary. From the early 70s to the mid-80s this still seemed like an important issue to address, but at this late date it looks bankrupt and repugnant: if Batchelder's complaint is that we should have something more ""meaningful"" in our lives, surely his job is to quit fretting over the cable box and figure out what that thing might be. He can blame it on consumerism and sporting spectacles all he wants-- the central point of Bear v. Shark remains that its own author can't give us the very thing he's claiming we need. I say all this to explain what's so special about ""Bulk Removal Truck"", a track on Franklin Bruno's new record, A Cat May Look at a Queen. Bruno started his career with the word ""clever"" stamped across his forehead, playing verbose power-pop with Nothing Painted Blue and rhyming five-syllable words-- but his songs, about things like office supplies and urban development, had a knack for unironically addressing The Way We Live Now. His solo career has seen him mellow on the clever and work doubly hard on the real, putting him in a league with sometimes-collaborators John Darnielle (Mountain Goats) and John Vanderslice: people trying very hard to write songs about the complex highs and lows of people's unglamorous everyday lives. ""Bulk Removal Truck"" is Bruno's biggest success at this yet. Over a fingerpicked acoustic guitar, he begins: Peter Hughes was out of town
when our lease expired.
So I turned some temp work down
and did what was required
to get the house as well prepared
for walkthrough as I could. What follows is really an emotional masterpiece of the everyday, the cleaning up of the things that actually comprise most of our lives: books, coats, Post-It notes, freezers in need of defrosting. It's a litany of waterlogged settees and security deposits gliding into a simple, unexpected metaphor: ""This is how it ends-- friends are lost to lovers, and lovers lost to friends."" It's the sort of sentiment-- and song, and album-- best appreciated in certain wistful contexts: during the bad hours of a killer drive, for instance, when you've already listened to every disc in the car and anything with a kickdrum or a power chord would seem as obnoxious as having Andrew ""Dice"" Clay in the passenger seat. Hangovers; Sunday mornings; trying to get to sleep once the sun's already battering the blinds; listening after you've already got the whole thing memorized. It's spacious and low-key and great-sounding: most tracks work from subdued guitar, with double bass, cello, trumpet, or light percussion rounding out the minimal arrangements. A lot of songs go country-western; others take on the form of jazz standards and bossa nova pop. Breezy; friendly. Also writerly: a collection of very short stories as much as anything else, with the instrumentation largely playing support for the texts. The exhausted-sounding ""Tired of the West"" is a winner both in music and in metaphor, the giving-up lament of the would-be pioneer who strikes out for a new life and eventually finds it as disappointing as the old one; the stately musette-and-piano title track makes exactly the self-deprecating apology one expects; the third-wheel story of ""Dashboard Issues"" has a tossed-off charm that deepens into something near-perfect. ""Blue's the Only Color"", on the other hand, is a trifling faux piano-bar number-- you can probably guess what comes after ""blue's the only color of the rainbow""-- and the more swinging ""Love's Got a Ghetto"" doesn't exactly take that conceit anywhere valuable. The album's centerpiece, ""Janet Shaw"", is an ominously sprawling and only partly successful rummage through the keepsakes of a one-time starlet. Hits and misses, then. What's amazing is how literature's working through its own crisis of confidence has put songwriters in such a position to take up its traditional role. It's not that pop music-- or indie rock, or what have you-- doesn't tell us anything about our lives, but there's something to the way guys like Bruno and Darnielle approach it that's difficult to get elsewhere: these are the people that can sort through the banality of the life that everyone complains about-- the cluttered bedrooms and beat-up cars and undramatic breakups-- and, when they get it right, locate what it is in there that makes it important to us. And as with most writerly records, this one only seems to be growing on me.","Last spring, someone sent me a frankly despicable novel by Chris Batchelder called Bear v. Shark. Like a lot of ...

Nirvana,Nirvana,by: Will Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c40cea9e61561daa806d/1:1/w_160/245b578a.jpg,2002-11-14 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5810-nirvana/,Geffen,"It's been weird the last couple of months, driving around the plywood-lined canyons of Hollywood-- the endless construction zone, the castles of scaffolding and the drywall fa√ßades that mark the parking garages, the Scientology test centers, the mini-malls of tomorrow. Between rows of handbills for 8 Mile and Christina Aguilera's Stripped there are stark grids of them, white on black, with a single word: NIRVANA. And for a moment, it's as if nothing has changed in the ten years I've lived in Los Angeles. The payphones are still plastered with flyers beckoning models and movie extras, and you can still get a pretty decent slice of pie for six bucks. I'm still secretly infatuated with the oversized billboards that hawk made-for-cable movies down on the Sunset Strip, and I still think In 'n' Out Burgers are overrated. But somehow it's comforting to see the handbills-- ghostly, surreal tombstones, reverent in their simplicity. Had Kurt Cobain not shot himself in the face in April 1994, it's hard to say how different the world might be. The commercial explosion of alternative rock began with the four-chord blitzkrieg of ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", decimating the glass ceiling that had taunted major-label hopefuls like R.E.M., The Flaming Lips, and The Pixies in the 80s. The majors responded by hiring battalions of silver-tongued A&R; reps to find a successor for the band, bloating their rosters with gimmicky wannabes and booking Butch Vig, Jack Endino, Steve Albini, Scott Litt and Brad Wood solid through 1998. While the feeding frenzy brought deserved attention to idiosyncratic bands like Smashing Pumpkins, Soundgarden, and Pearl Jam, it ended with the ""alternative"" tag being co-opted by any and every new band, and soon the uniformly aggressive sounds of Bush, Live, and Silverchair ruled the airwaves. Kurt Cobain did not live to see this. Nor did Cobain live to see the music-biz megamergers of the late 90s, which found a liquor empire acquiring venerable Hollywood labels like A&M;, Geffen, and DGC (Nirvana's label) and booting literally hundreds of bands-- including Cobain's beloved Raincoats and Meat Puppets-- from the majors. Surely Cobain would have reacted with abject disgust to the brazen payola which successfully poised Limp Bizkit as the new alt-rock prototype, or with disappointment as the old-school punk stylings of Green Day and The Offspring gave birth to the eerily homogenous, overcompressed frat-rock that currently dominates your friendly neighborhood Clear Channel or Infinity affiliate. Likewise, Pitchfork was not around in 1991 to guardedly praise the slick, but undeniably classic Nevermind, to shake our heads in bafflement at the curiosity shop of Incesticide, or to hold lighters aloft at the majestic bombast of In Utero. Had Kurt Cobain lived to mark the ten-year anniversary of his biggest success in September 2001, he would have gotten his Leonard Cohen afterworld, and if it wasn't his weekend to keep Frances Bean he probably would have written a song about it. Perhaps he'd have recognized the budding songwriting chops of bandmate Dave Grohl and begun a songwriting collaboration/competition worthy of Lennon and McCartney, or taken a couple of years off before emerging with a brilliant, basement-recorded solo album (and a beard). Instead, I find myself in the curious position of eulogizing Nirvana based on this fourteen-track best-of collection whose very existence is the result of a legal settlement. Exciting, huh? I think we can all agree that Sid & Nancy would've been a much more compelling story if, rather than Nancy Spungen dying in a Chelsea Hotel bathroom, she had survived Sid Vicious, kicked her habit, taken acting lessons, hired a phalanx of attorneys to force evil journalists and record companies to cease and desist their dastardly anti-Nancy conspiracies, and published Sid's private diaries for a $2 million payday. Long story short, Grohl and Krist Novoselic spent a year compiling an exhaustive box set with heaps of previously unreleased material, demo and rehearsal recordings, live gems, and the like; Courtney Love insisted on releasing this more conventional best-of first. On the one hand, this radio-friendly unit shifter is indeed an artful selection of the band's most seminal material-- four cuts each from Nevermind and In Utero, two from Incesticide and Unplugged in New York, and one from Bleach. Then, of course, there's the bait: the haunting, previously unreleased ""You Know You're Right"", recorded during Nirvana's last-ever studio session, and laced with tantalizingly literal expressions of the physical and mental pain that dominated the last months of Cobain's life. On the other hand, the very existence of Nirvana is a cynical assessment of the current retail climate-- a party mix for parents who want to appreciate Cobain's Lennon-esque knack for great melodies without having to click past ""Scentless Apprentice"" or ""Territorial Pissings"". With the possible exception of ""Rape Me"", Nirvana is utterly inoffensive: an impulse buy from Columbia House, perhaps, with no more artistic value than The Eagles' Greatest Hits or the Beatles' 1. If the kids want a righteous Nirvana mix, they'll burn one-- let the yuppies pad Frances Bean's college fund with their filthy dotcom lucre. Nirvana lies all of its cards on the table immediately with the familiar chugging rhythms of ""You Know You're Right"", Novoselic's bass menacing as Cobain rakes the strings above the bridge of his beloved Mustang for a dissonant, Thurston Moore-on-Zoloft effect. The song itself is something of a sketch: Kurt reportedly rewrote several lyrics just before the recording session and intentionally slurs where the words aren't quite there (er, ""Let's talk about someone else/ Steaming soup begins to melt""?). ""You Know You're Right"" predictably hits all the familiar Nirvana marks, and pointed lines like, ""I will move away from here,"" and, ""Nothing really bothers her/ She just wants to love herself,"" seem aimed directly at Love, hinting that ragged dissections of marital discord might have dominated Nirvana's fourth album. This is one of the most beguiling mysteries of Nirvana: how a thrift store-sweater-wearing kid from trailer-park Aberdeen went from the carefree jangle of ""About a Girl"" to the stormy malevolence of ""All Apologies"" (which pointedly rhymes ""married"" with ""buried""; Cobain would be both shortly after writing it). ""About a Girl"" feigns nonchalance, but there are omens beneath the surface that would haunt much of Cobain's short life-- the intrinsically unhealthy relationship that festers more out of apathy and convenience than genuine affection. ""I'll take advantage while you hang me out to dry,"" Cobain sings with matter-of-factness. In his liner notes for Nirvana, David Fricke notes that Cobain wrote ""About a Girl"" after an extended session listening to Meet the Beatles, and while the connection is not immediately apparent, the song does serve as a blueprint for some of Cobain's most tuneful later compositions. Built around a mostly two-chord groove, the song veers in unexpected directions for the power choruses, made all the more effective by Cobain's unique guitar tuning. It's curious, based on the clean guitars and tinny cymbals that dominate here, how Nirvana ever came to be identified with grunge, the genuinely dirty and moody sound more readily associated with contemporaries Mudhoney, Soundgarden and Tad than the punk-metal hybrid Nirvana favored. This is followed by Incesticide's two most accessible cuts. ""Been a Son"", from 1989's Blew EP, sounds like a test run for Nevermind, all rigid harmonies and tight, churning guitar (interestingly, the version here restores 30 seconds of music inexplicably cut from the Incesticide mix, including Novoselic's bass solo). ""Sliver"", one of the few Nirvana songs to directly address biographical details from Cobain's childhood, turns a simple visit to grandma's into a traumatic episode of parental abandonment, confusion, and fear. Next up are the quartet of selections from Nevermind, which rightfully explode from the mix just as ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and ""In Bloom"" seemed to slice through your Passat's shitty speakers on your way to high school. I still contend it's Grohl's punishing drum attack and not the famous four-chord riff that sells ""Teen Spirit"" (even Cobain admitted the song was a derivative pastiche of Boston's ""More Than a Feeling"" and The Pixies), though Andy Wallace's slick-as-Valvoline mix remains the gold standard of the soft verse/loud chorus dynamic. Likewise, ""Come as You Are"" gleans its hook directly from Novoselic's rubbery bassline slithering in and out of the mix with frightening stealth. But ""Lithium"" and ""In Bloom"" are wholly Cobain's, with references tailor-made for the American everyteen: ""Today I've found my friends/ They're in my head""; ""I'm so ugly, but that's okay 'cause so are you."" Both knowingly turn the enthusiastic ""yeah yeah yeah's"" of the Beatles into snarling expressions of sarcasm-- an allusion literalized in the ""In Bloom"" video, which pitched Nirvana as 60s idols with matching outfits on an Ed Sullivan-esque variety show (which in turn inspired the complete wardrobe of vintage Weezer). It's interesting how Nevermind, written and recorded well before the crest of sudden fame crushed Cobain's spirit, almost seems more jaded than its successor-- ""Teen Spirit"" and ""In Bloom"" deriding fans as mindless drones that demand entertainment, yet ""don't know what it means."" By contrast, In Utero, which begins with the words, ""Teenage angst has paid off well/ Now I'm bored and old,"" and ends with an apology, is full of curiously thoughtful retractions and carefully worded sentiments. The provocatively titled ""Heart-Shaped Box"" and ""Rape Me"" represent Cobain's sympathy for, and fascination with, the female of the species. I've always considered ""Heart-Shaped Box"", with its elliptical guitar figure and explosive choruses, to be one of Cobain's most accomplished compositions. For all its heavy-handed symbolism, the song strikes deepest to Cobain's preoccupation with birth, the menstrual cycle, and female anatomy, wound tightly with primal tension in the verses and released with sublime catharsis in the choruses. But ""Rape Me""-- meant to be an anthem of empowerment from the perspective of the victim-- comes off as a shallow and transparent attempt to court controversy. The four-chord riff that drags the song through the motions is an almost direct inversion of the famous ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" riff (Nirvana would often tease live audiences with a few licks from ""Teen Spirit"" before launching into its intellectually stunted first cousin). The seemingly tacked-on bridge (""My favorite inside source/ I'll kiss your open sores"") is one of Cobain's most awkward, and I think most of us could have done without the distressed round-robin choruses of ""Rape me! Rape me!"" that close the song. ""Pennyroyal Tea"" is presented here in a ""previously unreleased"" alternate mix (actually, it's widely available on the 'clean' version of In Utero) that basically nudges the guitars and Cobain's harmony vocals up ever so slightly. The mix was prepared by Scott Litt for a single withdrawn after Cobain's suicide (the single included ""I Hate Myself and Want to Die"" as a b-side). Cobain's fascination with female bodily processes continues (pennyroyal tea was famously used to induce abortion in colonial America) as he enumerates remedies he's tried to relieve his own pain-- warm milk and laxatives, but not heroin. ""Dumb"" is one of Cobain's most underrated efforts, a populist revision of ""Lithium"" that replaces Nevermind's misanthropy with earnest self-deprecation. With a jaunty guitar hook that rivals ""Polly"" or ""About a Girl"", ""Dumb"" finds Cobain not sneering at his fans with distaste, but pining for the simple pleasures of wasting time and taking drugs (well, sniffing glue) with his friends. Kera Schaley's cello is ""Dumb""'s secret weapon, overshadowing Novoselic's simple bassline and lending the bridge (hands down, Cobain's best) a transcendent country-rock lilt: ""Skin the sun, fall asleep/ Wish away, the soul is cheap/ Lesson learned, wish me luck/ Soothe the burn, wake me up."" The emphatic harmonies in the final refrains (""I think I'm DUMB, I think I'm DUMB..."") are among Cobain's most vulnerable, successfully conveying a deep longing in a way that the overambitious ""Pennyroyal Tea"" and ""Rape Me"" miss completely. Nirvana closes with two cuts from Unplugged in New York: a low-key reading of In Utero's somber ""All Apologies"" and an inspired cover of David Bowie's ""The Man Who Sold the World"". Keen selections, but unfortunately the loss of fidelity between the crystalline studio recordings and a live performance that was only supposed to sound good on TV gives this collection a distinctly incomplete feeling. So do I give Nirvana a 10.0 for the unimpeachable quality of the material, or a 2.0 for the crass cynicism for which it's exploited? I mean, this collection is by no means essential-- Nevermind and In Utero are. I almost wish that the release of Nirvana had been postponed another year so that Courtney Love could have seen Matador's illuminating and respectful double-disc packaging of Pavement's Slanted & Enchanted, which offers the original album, an entire live show, two Peel sessions, three singles, and previously unreleased material-- all for the same suggested retail price as Nirvana. The packaging includes hand-scribbled pages from Stephen Malkmus' notebooks (but not his whole goddamn diary) and liner notes written by band members and people who were actually there-- not just some rockcrit eager to unpack his adjectives. It's probably the best reissue of any album I've ever seen, and not just because it's an indie rock classic, but because it's assembled with such selfless affection. By comparison, Nirvana feels like a rush job-- reverent to the memory of Kurt Cobain, but disrespectful, even patronizing, of his infinitely patient fans. It would have been fantastic, for instance, to finally hear the original Steve Albini mixes of ""All Apologies"" and ""Heart-Shaped Box"", or favorites like ""Sappy"" (a huge radio hit here in southern California) and ""Spank Thru"" placed in the greater context of Nirvana's better-known repertoire. Dozens of illuminating b-sides and compilation tracks (everything from covers of the Velvet Underground and the Wipers to a full-band reading of Grohl's excellent ""Marigold"") are conspicuously absent here, doubtlessly because the publishing royalties don't go to Love. But at least the floodgates are open, with both a rarities collection, and yes, that box set finally in the pipeline. Since words are cheap, though (and Cobain's diaries are only $20.97 over at Amazon), I'll leave you with a quote from Cobain himself, quoted by Fricke in defense of this album's crassness: ""All the albums I ever liked were albums that delivered a great song, one after the other."" Hey, I like albums like that, too, Kurt. It's just that records like Nirvana, with its 24-bit remastering job to smooth the transitions between drummers and producers, deprive the listener of the very thing they should be generously supplying: context. And while Nirvana does indeed look and sound great, honoring Cobain's legacy with all the peace, love, and empathy you can eat, I'll always listen to the original albums instead.","\n\n\ It's been weird the last couple of months, driving around the plywood-lined canyons of Hollywood-- the endless ...

The Book of Spectral Projections,Outrageous Cherry,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba1bc0084474cd0c277e/1:1/w_160/98c9e1ea.jpg,2002-11-14 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6062-the-book-of-spectral-projections/,ParasolRainbow Quartz,"""A space opera of sorts, very different from anything we've done."" This is how Outrageous Cherry frontman Matthew Smith once explained how this album was supposed to sound, back before it was released. Matthew Smith is a damn, dirty liar. First of all, this is hardly a space opera. When I hear the phrase ""space opera"", I think Buck Rogers belting out Kiri Te Kanawa arias in a corset. You get none of that. Secondly, this is hardly ""very different from anything [Outrageous Cherry] have done before."" Not that that's a bad thing-- I dig Outrageous Cherry, and I've always found their swirling update on psychedelia enjoyable, regardless of how little the sound has changed over the years. So, under the assumption that he's a nice guy, I'm willing to forgive Smith's under-interview transgressions and just take his album for what it is: a pretty neat modern psych album. Experienced fans of the Detroit quartet named for a shade of hair dye will be familiar with the elements here: piles and piles of reverb, Deb Agolli's Moe Tucker-inspired drumming, Smith's pleasing tenor, and a healthy layer of guitar fuzz. To Smith's credit, the format is a bit different from the Cherry's last outing, 1999's excellent Out There in the Dark, relying more on mood and noise than that album ever did-- a move that actually makes it more akin to the band's earlier records. Out There in the Dark was outstanding, boasting a clutch of songs that were instantly memorable, and a staggering consistency of craft. The Books of Spectral Projections, recently released in the UK on ex-Creation labelhead Alan McGee's new Poptones imprint, can't quite make that claim, but it does have a wealth of moments (plus, it continue the tradition of horrible cover art that Out There kept up). The disc's primary failing is its breadth-- 20 songs in 80 minutes is just too long for an album like this; if only the best moments were kept, you'd have one rock-solid 45-minute pop pleaser. Now, I admit it may be easy for the uninitiated to be skeptical of this band's knack for a pop hook, especially in light of song titles like ""Electric Child of Witchcraft Rising"", and ""It's Only Sorcery"", but Smith has this way of taking these incredibly absurd subjects like, say, time-traveling witches, and situating them in well-written, plaintively delivered songs that tend to make you forget the lyrics, or at least look the other way. And the music is so tightly executed, you may have a hard time convincing friends it's not period stuff: ""It's So Nice to be Here"" is worthy of a Barrett-led Pink Floyd, while ""Here Where the Stars Are Cracking Up"" feels like a late addition to the Nuggets box set. Not everything meets the quality standards set by those two songs, though, and after ten years and five albums, the band's best work seems behind them. Still, there's amazingly nothing truly awful lurking on this album, and that the band are capable of creating psychedelic rock that doesn't feel forced or ironic speaks volumes of their talent. If you don't mind a little bit of sorcery creeping its way into your acid trip, The Book of Spectral Projections is pretty nice.","""A space opera of sorts, very different from anything we've done.""

The Wedding Mixer,Rhettmatic,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a26c5e6ef959693203ef/1:1/w_160/2b78fc73.gif,2002-11-14 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6776-the-wedding-mixer/,Beat Junkie Sound,"Perhaps you've heard that us Pitchforkers are hitting you readers with our 100 favorite albums of the 1980s on Monday. I've seen the list, and I can promise that you hipsters won't be disappointed... unless you dig Lisa Lisa & Cult Jam, Hall & Oates and Shalamar. Rejected by the purveyors of taste and abandoned by the Top 40 radio that fostered them, these brave artists made the kind of bubblegum R&B; and pop that was, after its brief moment in the sun, destined for landfills. Fortunately (I guess), Beat Junkie and turntablist extraordinaire Rhettmatic have been digging through our collective trash to collect a mixtape that fuses turntablism gymnastics with the dopest beats from the worst songs ever. Yet, while there are no doubt countless mix tapes surfacing of 80s songs mined for their camp appeal, Rhettmatic takes a different route; for The Wedding Mixer, he actually puts these songs in a context that brings out their accidental genius. Klymaxx's ""Meeting in the Ladies Room"" may be the hottest song ever about getting laid in the bathroom. And KC & The Sunshine Band's ""I Get Lifted"" may be the best song ever, period. I wanted to kiss Rhettmatic for mixing Hall & Oates' ""I Can't Go for That"" into Michael Jackson's ""Billie Jean"", a song that has faired far better than its creator. Rhettmatic even drops some great old-skool hip-hop classics like Rodney and Joe Cooley's ""Supercuts"" and ""Looking for the Perfect Beat"" by Afrika Bambaataa & The Soulsonic Force. In fact, my only complaint with the disc's selection is with what may be its best song: James Brown's ""Get on the Good Foot"". While there's no denying its status as a classic and massively influential track, it feels out of place here not only because it isn't from the 1980s, but because it is a recognized classic. Why not throw in some New Edition or Giorgio Moroder? Of course, Rhettmatic slices and dices his material so that the breaks are accentuated, and his work on Evelyn ""Champagne"" King's ""Love Comes Down"" is particularly hot. And although nothing mind-blowing, Rhettmatic's scratches on this disc are very nice and add a certain hip-hop flavor to the proceedings, even when laid over Yaz's ""Situation"", perhaps the whitest song ever made. Despite the skills on display, though, the purpose of this album is to reclaim the music that we felt embarrassed to have ever listened to. Sure, this album may be a novelty, but if nothing else, it's at least a really good one.","Perhaps you've heard that us Pitchforkers are hitting you readers with our 100 favorite albums of the 1980s on ...

Plus Minus Equals,The Velvet Teen,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a934ea9e61561daa59c9/1:1/w_160/facafff4.gif,2002-11-13 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8432-plus-minus-equals/,Slowdance,"Alright, I'm confused-- where does ""emo"" end? At first, the term seemed mainly limited to whiny hardcore bands, but now the term gets thrown around about Bright Eyes, Hot Hot Heat, and just about any band that expresses human emotion. If the spread of the term isn't contained in short order, everything aside from Kraftwerk and Cabaret Voltaire will be reducible to a three-letter word. Fuck that noise. There's a time and place for emotion in music-- sometimes (and I realize how revolutionary this sounds) even for the cloying, overbearing kind. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Although The Velvet Teen tend to play heavy on the emotional drama (courtesy of Judah Nagler's overwhelming falsetto) and shallow on actual substance, they display a knack for occasionally pulling themselves out of that emotional filth and into something approximating true sincerity without the slightest hint of forcing it. Or, at least, they used to; the now out-of-print Comasynthesis and Great Beast February EPs from The Velvet Teen's early days (i.e. the days before the release of their only other album, Out of the Fierce Parade) are proof. The vast, aimless compositions and iron-fisted emotional pomp that hamstrung their debut are in their embryonic stages here, but haven't yet become the crushing dead weight they later would. Come back with me, won't you? You see, in their formative prehistory, before they adopted the sound of a soporific Radiohead clich√©, they were easily referenced somewhere between the late, oft-remembered Velocity Girl and Death Cab for Cutie on the handy-dandy indie rock influence-o-meter. These EPs see the Teen vacillating between superball tempos and jangling riffs, and sonic Nyquil, courtesy of soothing electronics and a comparatively spare dose of Judah Nagler's baby grand. And even though they never find a way to put much musical distance between themselves and their ancestry, the homage is always faithful. In particular, the gorgeous opening one-two of ""Naked Girl"" and ""Counting Backwards"" summon forth hooks of fearsome potency-- pop can rarely equal the mind-expanding ecstasy of Velocity Girl's ""My Forgotten Favorite"" or ""Sorry Again"", but these two are half a candyflip away. They slow things down with ease, as well, as the surreal dream-lounge of ""Super Me"" demonstrates, but what ultimately kills the early buzz of the Plus Minus Equals collection is a lack of focus. Between focusing on their primary reference points, The Velvet Teen veers off to include some of the piano-heavy Radiohead bites they'll later dwell on, to mixed effect, and one isolated, absolutely obscene attempt at Dismemberment Plan emulation, entitled ""Never Happy"". If it sounds as though The Velvet Teen are guilty of nothing more impressive than a semi-random assortment of musical appropriations, you'd be right in terms of the music. But it's Judah Nagler's voice that saves the day (no pun intended). Folks may bristle at the wearying pomp of his Yorkian falsetto, and I'll admit that the melodramatic sentimentality of it can be stifling, but the EPs on Plus Minus Equals never allow it to become overbearing. Besides, he's a talented vocalist in the classical sense, and lack of subtlety or not, it alone is capable of distancing these songs from their obvious influences and bringing everything together beautifully.","Alright, I'm confused-- where does ""emo"" end?

Shenzhou,Biosphere,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2af5e6ef95969320489/1:1/w_160/ab41e786.jpg,2002-11-13 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/709-shenzhou/,Touch,"""Shenzhou"", aside from being the name of the Chinese manned-spaceflight vehicles, means ""magic vessel"", and I can't imagine a more apt description for Geir Jenssen's latest excursion into ambient deep listening. After following an Aphexian trajectory with his releases on Apollo, the ambient sublabel of Belgium's R&S; Records, Jenssen veered from the padded sci-fi-inspired techno of Microgravity and Patashnik with 1997's Substrata, a genre-defining exploration of drifting soundscapes. Substrata remains for many the album that perfectly expresses the serenity and intensity of Arctic wildernesses, a landscape Jenssen knows intimately, having spent much of his life in the Norwegian Arctic Circle. In 2000, Jenssen nearly eclipsed the success of Substrata with Cirque, a frequently frosty submerging of excerpted conversations and found environmental sounds that rivals Wolfgang Voigt's Gas project in its rumbling, gauzy beauty. Jenssen again relies on found sound as source material for Shenzhou, but this time, the found sound is old vinyl recordings of the orchestral works of French Impressionist composer and ambient precursor, Claude Debussy. Jenssen lifts fragments of these scratched records in a similar manner as he did for Cirque's ""Black Lamb Grey Falcon"" and ""Iberia Eterea"". The ten tracks (out of the dozen on the album) that follow this model all begin as a barely audible hum, like a small electrical transformer, out of which the dust-dappled loops of Debussy's woodwind, brass, and strings emerge, condense, and fade out into pink noise rustles. Unlike Steve Reich's phase pieces or Brian Eno's Discreet Music, though, Jenssen doesn't set his loops against each other to produce juxtapositions and piquant dissonance; he uses them to describe imagined terrain, at first glance monotonously flat and barren, but on concentration, replete with minute detailing. The overall effect of these pieces is a sense of immensity. The orchestral loops sound distant, abandoned in a vast wilderness, and strenuously battling against Arctic winds. Jenssen sets the listener down in this wilderness as an aloof observer, a witness to the music's futile struggles against entropic forces. The two tracks not derived from Debussy share the same hypnotic aesthetic. The brief interlude ""Bose-Einstein Condension"" is a loop of piano chords lolloping in search of coherence, while ""Gravity Assist"" is a longer voyage into woofer-quaking low-frequency manipulation, bell-like drones, and contrails of subdued noise. I can't help but feel that these tracks fit awkwardly and break up the conceptual flow of the album. This, however, is a minor quibble given the power of this music. Shenzhou is unquestionably a magic vessel, but one that reveals its enchantment only to those who pay close attention.","""Shenzhou"", aside from being the name of the Chinese manned-spaceflight vehicles, means ""magic vessel"", and I can't imagine a ...

Slap fives with the other team, pack up the equipment, get your Little Debbies and Capri Suns from Mrs Freed; it's time to go home. Garage rock, I mean. It's probably silly-- no, it's definitely silly-- to declare a scene that was 80% media as D.O.A., but an album like The Datsuns' debut will drive a man to such pointless hyperbole. A few months back I declared, in a review of the brilliant-by-comparison Selby Tigers, that garage rock had reached minute #12 on its Warhol watch. It's now on 16. If The Datsuns serve any purpose, it's to remind us that 70s glam/garage-rock was largely accountable for the abomination that was 80s hair-metal (or wait, is that cool now? I forgot to check the Brit mags this week). When the guitarists start feeling the urge to show off how fast their digits can fly, when singers really, really want you to know that they're just fucking thrashing all around that stage, dude, when lyrics take the slightest little turn toward macho and misogyny... hey, look what you got! M√∂tley Cr√ºe without the recording budget! And speaking of which, all this self-consciously gritty production is starting to get on my nerves. V2 should know better, being the label that bought the White Stripes from Sympathy-- ""Fell in Love with a Girl"" was a hit with me, my 16-year-old sister and the demographics we represent because of Jack White's song, not the over-EQed production. It would've been a hit if it were sung by Justin Timberlake on a slick Neptunes beat, or Tim McGraw in laminated Nashville; the energy is inherent. The Datsuns don't have exuberance imbedded in their material, they just have in-quotes ""attitude"" and songs called ""Motherfucker from Hell"" and ""Fink for the Man"" recorded in a tar pit.

Herr Schreiber and I used to ease into ""120 Minutes"" by pounding the hops, laughing at the Eels, and telling ourselves that someday, someone will put everything in its right place. Now the playful buoyancy of 1997s past has been usurped by a tense desperation, broken only by darting eyes and muffled scoffs when Ryan sees my hand reaching for the Electric Soft Parade. It's surprising to see how well Holes in the Wall holds up under the weight of its own hype. The British music press almost couldn't unsticky their promos open after Ed O'Brien cited the album's guitar-driven sound as an influence on Radiohead's as-yet-untitled sixth LP. Opening the bill for NME-darlings Oasis didn't hurt them much, either. Fact is, though, that the Electric Soft Parade-- who, reportedly, added the 'Electric' modifier after being legally arraigned by a Doors cover band-- are not here to galvanize the industry. And damn, do they pop/rock while doing it. It's true that sibling chemistry has been known to lead to an early musical fruition. Keeping in the tradition of Oasis, principle songwriters and part-time brothers Tom & Alex White share an amazing knack for melodic derivation and emphasized vocal treatments. Unfortunately for your indie cred, this time it works, thanks in no small part to the long electro-psychedelic excursions only hinted at by your favorite fey Brit-rockers. Things begin modestly enough with the tormented sludge rock of ""Start Again"", immediately invoking the ghost of Suede. As the song suddenly shifts dynamic from murky grunge to a synthetic, trippy-dippy verse (replete with phaser effects and everything), we're introduced to the White Brothers' similarly charcoal-steeped vocals. Luckily for ESP, Holes in the Walls' litany of cliched lyrical sentiments falls to the wayside of Chris Hughes' heart-wrenching production, which wraps even the most unforgivable of lines (""You never took the time to look at what you've got/ And all the times you fell/ I was there to pick you up"") in inviting and, occasionally, inventive sonic textures. Elsewhere, on the disc's title track, the group turn in their token attempt at balladry, albeit with more muscle than a whole legion of 'next Radioheads'. But the album's real highlight is the schizophrenic ""Silent to the Dark"", a nine-minute jam that looms over the band's other accomplishments and finds the group indulging in all manner of studio trickery. The song begins, ingenuously enough, as an atypical exercise in teen angst (read: emo) shortly before bursting into a Specter-induced wall of sound faintly reminiscent of Godspeed You Black Emperor!'s Lift Your Skinny Fists. As whirring synths proffer the white noise a sense of foundation, bits of song begin to reestablish themselves before the band fully commits to reprising the chorus once more. So, in between the instrumental intelligence and the lyrical negligence, what are you left with? Well, with Holes in the Walls, the Electric Soft Parade have crafted a debut that, despite its often forced accessibility, aches with potential unrealized. And, while Electric Soft Parade is still yet to write a song that would justify such a pretentious bandname, it's comforting to know that they've got the chops to perhaps pull it off someday.","When the mid-90s post-grunge, pre-pop implosion passed with the same painful obviousness as Corey Feldman's transition into manhood, few ...

That's right. They play sea shanties. Of course, that's just one of a million things The Coral does on their hyper-eclectic debut, a pop pastiche that jumps across a dozen genres during the course of its 40+ minutes. And though the just-out-of-their-teens sextet, who come from a ""nondescript seaside town"" outside Liverpool, are as diverse and well-polished as their fellow NME cabin boys The Vines, you at least aren't overcome with the urge to punch these kids in the face. After all, The Coral are much more talented, and singer James Skelly's confident, sneer-free vocals lend just the right amount of weight to the music. I'm guessing he'll sound even better after he takes up clove cigarettes and whiskey. We first heard about The Coral back in September of last year when, during an interview, Clinic mentioned them to us as one of their favorite bands of the moment. The two sound nothing alike, of course, excepting that their influences are far too numerous to list. One thing I can say with some certainty, though, is that The Coral must have grown up digging through their mums' Merseybeat vinyl and dads' psych-rock collections: the first spaceshot note on the album cribs from Pink Floyd's ""See Emily Play"", and the bridge to ""Goodbye"" references it a bit, too, though while sounding predominantly like a Turtles song. Elsewhere, the folky ""Simon Diamond"" sets the life of the professional wrestler to a bouncy remake of the old traditional, ""John Barleycorn Must Die"", and extra guitars whiz around like bugs, with Nick Power's organ needling home the period feel. With a quick-stepping rhythm section and two horn players in the band (Bill Ryder-Jones on trumpet, Paul Duffy on sax), The Coral also take a reasonable stab at British ska-pop; ""Dreaming of You"" sounds like Jim Morrison fronting Madness. It's a likeable single, but it would have blown away like so much fluff twenty years ago; and while it proves that the band is capable of turning out well-produced dance numbers, the most disposable tracks-- like ""Bad Man""-- mark them as this close to becoming England's answer to the Cherry Poppin' Daddies. So as weird as it may seem, it's on the sea shanties that the band finds its voice. For whatever reason, they really open up on the nautically themed tracks: ""Skeleton Key"" is a massive beatdown where the pounding drums and jittery guitars set up a bellowing chorus; the verse-only opener ""Spanish Main"" makes them sound like genuinely scary men of the sea. And even on a quieter numbers like ""Shadows Fall"", the reggae beat and laborers' harmony vocals blend well with the sax part, psychedelic frills, and shuffle. Sometimes the band seems more curious than inventive. They're swollen up with ideas but don't always have an original hook or clear idea to attach them to. There's definitely a lot to like throughout this disc; the band has boatloads of talent, and the eclectic spread gels much better than you'd expect. But they're at their best when they're more raucous than clever. If the sea shanties work for any reason, it's because they're labor songs, tunes about working hard and playing hard. That's a great lifestyle for any young band, and a better goal than just ripping off the 60s.","Sea shanties. That's right. They play sea shanties.

There's something sort of apt about The Telescopes including such a diagram in their artwork, though-- it fits the futurist theme of the music, for one thing, and with a record like this, they sound like they might be poised to take over the world. Everyone's favorite band from Burton-upon-Trent, England has a lengthy history, dating back to the glory days of gazing at shoes whilst coaxing feedback from six-strings. Back then, there were five Telescopes, and they distinguished themselves by experimenting with instrumental textures outside of the guitars and effects that the other shoegazers were using. They split in 1995, with Doran and Lawrie moving on to establish Unisex, whose debut album, Stratosfear, impressed me a few years ago with its deep-space lounge and day-glo exotica. It's a bit puzzling, actually, as to why the two chose to go back to the Telescopes name for Third Wave, as this serves pretty well as a follow-up to Stratosfear. Lawrie keeps his hands on the helm at all times, and guides you through a series of inventive, oddball tracks that hold together remarkably well for such a wide-ranging collection. There's the spy-on-Mars jazz noir of ""A Good Place to Hide"" and the drifting, soupy electro of ""You & I Are the Foxboy Noises"", and in between everything from clarinets and violins to Atari samples and home-made grooveboxes. Anyone who ever played ""Space Invaders"" will recognize the core rhythm of ""Tesla Death Ray"", which centers on a sample of the descending alien ships, in addition to Black & Decker drills, toy car, stylophone and some deeply vocodered vocals. Opener ""A Cabin in the Sky"" features the close harmonies of Doran and Lawrie moving cautiously through a Terminator-bleak futureworld of cold piano, processed laughter, ectoplasmic strings, and Theremin. Horns hang in a loosely organized cloud over the tabla-inflected beats of ""3D Jesus Ashtray"", but note: those tablas are employed for their specific sonic qualities, and not to give the track an Eastern feel. Lawrie and co-producer Angus Wallace give the whole thing a deep, bass-rich treatment that makes every last electronic flourish and fuzzed-out blast go down easy. It's humorous, unique, laid-back, beautiful and chaotic by equal measures, and for music that was so obviously a serious labor to put together, it all sounds amazingly fluid and natural. Third Wave may not put you any closer to ruling the world, but hey, that just gives you more time to listen to it. Call me I think I'm willing to trade just a little bit of global domination for that.","I hold in my hands the plans for a device so powerful, so diabolically destructive that soon the world will ...

'We No Longer Knew Who We Were' EP and 'Fins to Make Us More Fish-Like' EP,Liars,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcf1abf31b7dc7155e2f/1:1/w_160/f0ef384b.gif,2002-11-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4763-we-no-longer-knew-who-we-were-ep-and-fins-to-make-us-more-fish-like-ep/,Sound VirusHand Held Heart,"Able-bodied hipsters got acquainted with this Brooklyn-based quartet when their sneering, vitriolic triumph of a debut, They Threw Us All in a Trench and Stuck a Monument on Top, was first issued last year on the Gern Blandsten label. Then, earlier this year, the record got reissued by Mute, spawning an immediate press frenzy with journalists across the globe wondering just who, exactly, was this new ""The"" band? But the media quickly realized that this record would not easily lend itself to mainstream marketability, and not just because there's no ""The"" in the name Liars. The attention served the band well, though, because while they may be about as far as you can possibly get from garage rock revivalism, their music is a thing of raw, jagged beauty, and one of the more original sounds to emerge from the indie rock underground this year. They Threw Us All in a Trench was a brilliant portrait of tenuous restraint, fluctuating wildly between a noise sharp and vicious enough to shred through an entire offensive line, and periods of tense too-calmness designed to lull its victims into a trance-induced state of false security before the storm arrived again. This startling ebb and flow produced a kind of frenetic delirium, as all expectations of what was to come were thrown out just before the music finally culminated in a mesmerizing locked groove. So you may wonder how such epic unpredictability can be followed-- and Liars have an answer for you. In continued defiance of expectation come two EPs, separating and isolating the two key aspects of the band's sound: tense fury and furious tension. Driving post-punk guitar rhythms and Angus Andrew's vocal spitfire are six minutes of unstoppable force on We No Longer Knew Who We Were, which collides sharply with the immovable opacity of Fins to Make Us More Fish-Like's experimental edge. Individually, these EPs highlight one of the band's strongest elements in condensed, cohesive form; taken together, they throw Liars' range and invention into impressive relief. Whether slumming with the straight-ahead post-punk mechanics of We No Longer Knew Who We Were, or creating frayed, surreal otherworlds on Fins to Make Us More Fish-Like, Liars continually shatter preconceptions. ""We Got Cold, Coughed, and Forgot Things"" typifies the aggravated assault of We No Longer Knew as Pat Nature's bass opens the record, careening back and forth amid a driving beat supplied by Ron Albertson. Momentum builds until Aaron Hemphill cuts through the fray like a blowtorch, his guitar's vicious whine evoking a bandsaw clattering against solid stone with calculated, machine-gun rhythm and deadly accuracy-- it takes charge of the song the moment it arrives on the scene. The guitar work is so dominant, in fact, that Andrew's vocals take on an almost subliminal quality as they seethe inches removed from the surface. He screams, ""When my mind is weak/ You always let me know,"" before truly breaking through the dissonance, and only then does it sink in that you've been hearing him for the last minute or so without fully realizing it. The effect is subtle, and all the more striking for it. The anthemic pseudo-choruses and dancefloor appeal of the three tracks on We No Longer Knew are the common thread, but Liars still find opportunity for strange interludes like the mid-song breakdown in ""You Know I Hate Stupid Phones"", during which Andrew speaks confessionally as the clamor in the background cuts instantly to deafening silence. This sort of disorientation is Liars' stock-in-trade. As tempting as it might be to pigeonhole them as nothing more than art-punks emulating the groove-oriented 70s groups like Gang of Four, Liars are simply too bizarre to validate those claims, even on a disc as traditionally structured as this one. That dedication to the unexpected is good news. Because even while We No Longer Knew warrants such comparisons with a decidedly ""song-oriented"" focus, the band is equally focused on keeping the listener off-balance. Listening to this group is never simply a passive experience. Furthering this end of the sound is the Fish-Like EP. ""Pillars Were Hollow and Filled With Candy, So We Knocked Them Down"" and ""Every Day Is a Child with Teeth"" both seize on Liars' unstructured, improvisational tendencies, leading to strange, violent noisescapes. ""Pillars"" opens the disc with Liars at their mind-cleansing best. Andrew repeatedly shouts, ""Do something magical and disappear,"" over a cardiac disco tempo and a storm of echo-laden vocals before he counts down to the song's furious build and searing rhythmic feedback. ""Every Day Is a Child with Teeth"" is less entrancing, with its ritualistic chant anchoring a hollow backdrop of almost random sound. Although the track itself is fascinating, its formlessness creates the weakest moment of either of the two EPs. A cleaner, clearer version of ""Grown Men Don't Fall in the River, Just Like That"" closes Fish-Like with a bang, though, releasing the tension accrued from the first two tracks with what is still Liars' greatest achievement. This song is a true embodiment of nervous post-punk energy, and this rendition even improves on the original by allowing its shouted refrains to ring louder and the guitars to buzz more shrilly. More than anything else Liars have done, this song is a testament of things to come. With their debut and these two EPs, the band has easily proven that they do indeed have their ""fingers on the pulse of America""; now it's time for them to run with it.","Able-bodied hipsters got acquainted with this Brooklyn-based quartet when their sneering, vitriolic triumph of a debut, They Threw Us All ...

Woodshedding,Jack LoganBob Kimbell,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd3cabf31b7dc7155edd/1:1/w_160/134e3fcc.gif,2002-11-12 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4831-woodshedding/,Parasol,"Prolific artists scare the hell out of me. How is it they crank out so much, so often? I envision the writer huddled over a typewriter, the painter peering into the canvas, the musician stroking a guitar-- all into the wee hours of the morning, skin sweaty and pale from lack of sleep and sunlight. Their only company is a bottle of whiskey and maybe a lazy dog. I think pain. I think isolation. But what's even worse is when the prolific artist makes it look easy. John Updike, for instance, spits out novels like hockey players spit out teeth, and without even a trace of pain. The same goes for Georgia native Jack Logan, who has averaged about an album a year since he burst onto the scene in 1994 with his aptly titled two-disc debut, Bulk, which contained no less than 42 songs. Even worse: that collection was whittled down from around 600 tracks demoed over the previous decade. So, yes, Jack Logan likes to write a lot of country- and blues-inspired rock'n'roll songs. Whether he does so with ease remains unknown, but he sure sounds relaxed most of the time, even when cranking up the electric guitar a little bit. Perhaps recognizing that this combination-- being prolific with apparent ease-- could be a pitfall of mediocrity, Logan mixes it up as best he can. In this case, he has enlisted friend Bob Kimbell of pop band Weird Summer. The two have hooked up before, for 1998's Little Private Angel. That record was spotty, but there were enough bright spots to suggest a second Logan/Kimbell album might be in order, all the kinks presumably having been worked out in their first effort together. And so it happens, that's largely the case with Woodshedding, a collaboration that doesn't at all sound like a collaboration-- almost always a good sign. ""Further South"" gets the leisurely beat rolling, with just enough harmonica, pedal steel and tambourine to ease the listener into the mood of the fall season (notice the leaves on the cover). Logan and Kimbell are attributed as co-writers for the entire album and, somewhat surprisingly, it's not always clear who's responsible for which tracks. Nonetheless, kudos to whoever wrote, ""This river meets an ocean further south/ With New Orleans on the corner of its mouth/ The sin runs down from the people in the towns/ And runs to the ocean further south."" Kimball is likely responsible for the light pop of ""Host of the Party"", with its peppy drumbeat, saxophones and subtle keyboards. But I'll have to blame him for ""I Still Miss Her Dog"", a knee-slapping, tongue-in-cheek ode to (obviously) an ex-girlfriend's dog. Logan's fingerprints, meanwhile, are all over the somewhat bland rock of ""Legs and Brains"", which recalls the lesser moments of his major label debut, 1999's Buzz Me In. He then delivers, however, on the stellar rock number ""Ripped It Away"" and the more brooding reflections of ""Nothing but the Sky"" and ""Just as You Are"", which highlight his two strengths: a smooth, sturdy voice and thoughtful lyrics. I can't blame Logan for being prolific. It's just the way he is (and at least he doesn't flaunt it like Ryan Adams does). That said, Logan does suffer a little from the sameness that plagues Updike, which perhaps explains why they're both able to produce at such a rate-- with each new book and album, they never stray too far from their artistic home. And this is why Woodshedding is, if nothing else, a welcome effort. With the help of a friend, Logan sheds some of that sameness without seeming desperate for change.

Have You Fed the Fish?,Badly Drawn Boy,by: Jesse Fahnestock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1f813d1975652138766/1:1/w_160/8189542a.jpg,2002-11-11 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/527-have-you-fed-the-fish/,ArtistDirect,"He's feted by the British, but his biggest inspiration is Bruce Springsteen. He cut his teeth on scatterbrained no-fi folk music, but he made his millions from sentimental balladry and Gap commercials. He's the scruffiest, gamiest shambler you'll ever set eyes on, yet he's got Hugh Grant's phone number. The artist exclusively known as Badly Drawn Boy might as well have stitched ""E-N-I-G-M-A"" onto that ethnic knitcap he wears around all security blanket-like. So how do we approach Have You Fed the Fish? On his terms? Nope. I've been through this thing an impossible number of times, and the only way to take it is on ours. Gough doesn't make it easy on us, though. A goofy, self-deprecating skit opens the proceedings, followed by a nondescript, throwaway instrumental called ""Coming in to Land"". And then we're hit with the ridiculous title track, which walks what is fastly becoming Badly Drawn Boy's very own fenceline between execrable REO Speedwagon pomp-pop and touching, emotive songwriting. It doesn't look pretty so far. But then comes ""Born Again"", an endearing (and rare) rocker where Gough manages to pull off sincerity without pandering, and the moment at which he hits his stride. Here, his self-consciousness slips away, allowing us to relate to the song without envisioning him as the song's narrator. Which is nice because Gough's more personal offerings (and I use the word ""personal"" loosely here) aren't the most original ever committed to DAT-- they're nice little saccharine ballads which could be love songs from anybody to anybody. When Damon brings himself too far into the picture, as often happens on this record, all it reveals is that he's just not that interesting a character. So it's moments like this, when he lets go of his ego and just plays the damn thing, that work best. ""40 Days"" is more of the same stuff he kicked out on The Hour of Bewilderbeat, and about on par with that album's better material. It's a jaunty narrative, the kind of song you might sing along to in the morning to help shake a hangover. And despite that the retro-glossy ""All Possibilities"" attempts a nods to Love Unlimited and comes out ""Love Boat"", his enthusiasm is charming-- the guy clearly loves what he's doing, and the joy he communicates in the song is infectious. Of course, the frustrations remain. ""I Was Wrong"" is a delicate Elliott Smith type thing with a genuine Nick Drake fragility, but it disappears before it has a chance to break your heart. Instead, Gough insists on a failed attempt at cleverness by merging clumsily into a smoothed-over Fleetwood Mac substitute called ""You Were Right"". It apparently wasn't enough for him that this track even had to appear on the record-- it had to take one of the album's better offerings down with it. Fortunately, it's not a total loss, as he drops some pretty entertaining lyrics (which I won't spoil here), and a whistle solo (can't beat a whistle solo), but the momentum's out the window. And that's just the thing with Badly Drawn Boy-- he doesn't care about momentum, or continuity, or a lot of other things that you might quite reasonably care about when you sit down to listen to his records. He's going to give you devastating insight and wacky novelty, and by god, he's going to give them to you in the same song if he damn well pleases. Which would be fine and everything-- lots of folks, not least of which is Elvis Costello, have made their names on doing just this-- if he could only pull it off. But he can't, and there's fatal proof of this in a song like ""How?"", which dares to spotlight the whole problem with the lyric, ""How can I give you the answers you need/ When all I possess is a melody?"" How, indeed? So it's up to you, my friend, to opt out or to love unconditionally. Will you accept Badly Drawn Boy on his terms, no matter how inscrutable? Will you indulge his penchant for sweetback 70s funk long enough to embrace the lovely ""The Further I Slide""? Will you endure the music hall diversions of ""Tickets to What You Need"" to arrive at the impassioned coda of ""Bedside Story""? Will the frustrating interludes, ill-conceived genre experiments and half-finished ideas keep you from finding the life-affirming power that lies in the chewy nougat center of Badly Drawn Boy's music? I'm not sure he's worth it, personally, considering the ease with which we could toss on a record from one of his many on-sleeve influences and witness perfection. But luckily, there's always the 'skip' button.","He's feted by the British, but his biggest inspiration is Bruce Springsteen. He cut his teeth on scatterbrained no-fi ...

Sound Event,Rob Swift,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a60b9d034d5c69bf343d/1:1/w_160/89fada9e.jpg,2002-11-11 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7668-sound-event/,TableturnsMixwell,"Allow me to preface this review by stating my extreme admiration and unqualified respect for turntablists. Watching a master work the wheels is every bit as inspiring and transcendent as witnessing Tony Williams or Andres Segovia at their prime. If you've ever seen Q-Bert dissect an original break, draw out an individual beat from that break, and reconstruct that beat on the spot to build a wholly different rhythm, you know what I'm talking about. If you understand the myriad of scratches employed over the course of a DJ set, and how they build and play off one another, you know what I'm talking about. Although there are still those who would argue that the manipulation of prerecorded music doesn't require the same technical virtuosity as that of a traditional musician, I would argue that creatively harnessing an almost limitless sound palette is every bit as involved and difficult as moving your fingers up and down a guitar neck. With that said, I also understand why turntablist albums have yet to garner as much commercial attention as other forms of hip-hop. For one thing, the art form is relatively new and the artistry behind it remains largely esoteric; for the most part, neither the mainstream music consumer nor the high-art, traditional music establishment has yet to grasp the nuances of turntablism. The deconstructive approach to rhythm and the cubist, cut-n-paste compositional arrangements sound cacophonous and random to the uninitiated and lack the rhythmic thump or lyrical immediacy of other forms of hip-hop. With Sound Event, Rob Swift, who is one of the genre's greats, has succeeded in creating an album that has as much visceral impact as it does technical virtuosity, as much soul as it does science. It reaches for innovation while paying respect to the genre's conventions. It alternates between the round and soulful resonance of early 90s NYC hip-hop (e.g. Pete Rock and DITC) and the more mathematical angles of late-90s, ISP-inspired turntablism. Perhaps the greatest strength of Sound Events, though, is its ability to incorporate other genres without diluting its own. On ""The Great Caper"", Swift enlists the help of Dujeous? guitarist Taylor Rivelli and bassist Alex Gale for a sweaty jazzy number that's a testament to Swift's ability to trade chops with the best of 'em. ""Salsa Scratch"", featuring legendary Spanish music pianist Bob James, may be the most satisfying turntablist composition in years. It's a family affair, paying homage to Swift's father, who came to the United States from Columbia, and featuring his mother on the track's introduction. The limitlessly talented D-Styles shows up and lays down a series of sublimely expressionistic scratches, and Bob James, who's worked with Freddie Hubbard and Grover Washington among others, graces the keys with his trademark Latino flavor. Sure, we've seen the turntable incorporated into countless xFC-metal, R&B;, and ""experimental"" jazz compositions, but rarely has the turntable been used as a primary instrument and mingled with other genres more naturally, or with as much subtly as it is on ""Salsa Scratch"". ""The Ghetto"" finds Swift reflecting the paranoia, crime, and poverty that have claimed his friends. It may be a somewhat cliched theme, but Swift draws water from dry ground with his brilliant use of vocal samples. ""Sub-Level"", featuring J-Live, may be the most immediately accessible track on the album. Swift once again proves that he knows how to produce for an emcee, a skill that seems to elude lesser turntablists. He lays down a frantic, constantly morphing beat as the super-hot J-Live offers his opinions on the current state of underground hip-hop: ""The rich act poor and the poor claim rich/ ...When you fronting on the mic, you still the industry's bitch."" The genius of this album is not only Rob Swift's skill, but also the restraint he shows in displaying his considerable talent. While every scratch and rhythmic twist is on point, Swift never allows his skills to overwhelm his compositions. The scratches are chosen and inserted for emotional resonance, and not as a self-indulgent display of turntable mastery. ""Once you have an understanding that scratches are a form of communication,"" Swift explains in the liner notes, ""you gradually realize that scratches are like words. Using long, dictionary words doesn't necessarily make you a great speaker. It's about knowing your audience and understanding that sometimes simple words make the greatest impact."" I couldn't have said it better.","Allow me to preface this review by stating my extreme admiration and unqualified respect for turntablists.\n\ Watching a master ...

The Science of Breath,Polmo Polpo,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0d5ea9e61561daa465a/1:1/w_160/86af540e.jpg,2002-11-11 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6387-the-science-of-breath/,Alien8Substractif,"Having spent the last two years inundated with sleek microhouse and minimal techno, it's refreshing to come across a record like The Science of Breath. Polmo Polpo is Sandro Perri of Toronto, and while his music falls squarely into the techno realm, his is the loud and tattered kind that does away with clubland precision and pop niceties. There's no room on this stage for a diva; these basslines are about as sensual as rusty butcher knife. Rather than relishing the beauty of clean open space, Perri stuffs up the cracks with noise and static. In one way, The Science of Breath is like the other side of the dancefloor glitch coin. While artists like Matthew Herbert and Luomo take the sound of digital mistakes the compress them into spaces small enough to become whatever percussion instrument suits the composition (crackling noises make good hi-hats), Sandro Perri lets the noise stay noise. All of these tracks course with persistent hiss that ebbs and flows but never disappears. The Polmo Polpo trademark may well be that a track never-- not even for a microsecond-- makes it down to 0 dB. There's always something happening, and it's usually quite loud. Another interesting thing about Polmo Polpo is the incorporation of guitar and laptop steel into tracks with pounding beats. Perri's manner with the ringing guitar as a source of rhythm is at times reminiscent of the sampled guitar work found on Burger/Ink's Las Vegas. Indeed, the Wolfgang Voigt connection is strong throughout, but Perri remains fixated in the earlier, darker Gas material, where murky string samples and an aquatic kickdrum were all that was needed to conjure an atmosphere of anxiety and dread. No lush pop-ambient sonics to be found here. Perri can also compose for the body. ""Acqua"" is the most punishing yet strangely addictive bit of dancefloor fodder I've heard this year: the snare sounds like a plumber's wrench being slammed against a 55-gallon drum; the hi-hat upbeat could well the sampled whine of pneumatic machinery; dense clouds of hiss float through the track for no apparent reason; a funk guitar riff repeats endlessly; and then weaving through the morass is a rather beautiful and snakelike melody played on lap steel. The utterly unique ""Acqua"" is guaranteed to get some part of my body moving every time I hear it. Three other tracks focus on the dance beats, and while none have the over-the-top drive of ""Acqua,"" all are at least good. ""Riva"" has a particularly hypnotic steel guitar riff tensing and flexing like a large rubber band, giving the comparatively tame house beats a melancholy, end-of-an-era feel. The dance tracks were previously released as twelve-inch singles geared toward the DJ set. Stitching these are a series of dark ambient interludes (all reference breathing), and here, too, Perri shows skill. The twangy guitar mixed with drones on ""Low Breathing"" veer toward the post-rock sound of Fly Pan Am, while the gurgling electronic throb of ""Complete Breath"" would make a nice piece of experimental film music. Though they came from different times and were meant for different audiences, the alternating tracks work well in sequence. The Science of Breath offers a tug toward techno's dark side that is difficult (and pointless) to resist.","Having spent the last two years inundated with sleek microhouse and minimal techno, it's refreshing to come across a ...

Humpty Dumpty LSD,Butthole Surfers,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a40cea9e61561daa4df5/1:1/w_160/e3dc789f.jpg,2002-11-10 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1044-humpty-dumpty-lsd/,Latino Bugger Veil,"Dude, man, dude, shit, man, how much do I love the Fork? I got stoned for this review. Blizzard-stoned. Pilgrim-stoned. Perestroika-stoned. What, man? What'd you say? Laser who? Mom, I know you, man! I will murder you for an omelet! Hey, zoo-keeper. Say it, it sounds so alien, man. Zoo-kee-per. Zoo-bie. Run from the Zangler! A fifty-foot Nancy Reagan brain beams out for me to Just Say No. I got grandkids. Hey, sleepyhead, answer me this: how can we sleep while our beds are burning, huh? How? Ahem. The most entertaining chapter, by far, in Michael Azerrad's mammoth Our Band Could Be Your Life, is the chapter on the Butthole Surfers. Their exponentially high jinks way outshine the runner-up bits about Ian McKaye being afraid of beer because of his tippy pappy or the chronicle of Lou Barlow's impulsive mid-show revolts against J. ""The Masticator"" Mascis. The Butthole chapter documents how they wiped their testicle-sweat on a suitcase that Jimmy Carter came to pick up for his stranded daughter, and how the Surfers moved to Athens just to stalk/pester R.E.M. And everyone knows that Gibby Haynes called his major label tour opener the Stoned Pimple Toilets just as the second or third wave of fake grunge was cresting. Black Heart Procession's Pall Jenkins told me at a concert a couple weeks ago that right up there among his influences with Brian Eno, Black Sabbath, Johnny Cash, and the Residents lurk the Buttholes and their ""total drug songs"". Though Independent Worm Saloon served up some viable trash-rawk while cashing in on the sound of the Flannery O'Connor-inspired Ministry team-up ""Jesus Built My Hotrod"", the Buttholes' output has been snoozy of late, with drumloops, tame material, predictable song structures, and perfunctory freak-outs that feel half-freaked. Humpty Dumpty LSD, though, is a gathering of home recordings, four-trackings, practice-space jams, comp tracks, and outtakes from 1982-1994. Meaning: it's a hell of a good time, taking us listeners all the way back to when we used to repeat Hairway to Steven on our headphones while the adults in proximity worshipped God or beat each other with telephone books. This is the trippier-than-a-napalm-Slip-N-Slide band, powerful enough to convince haters than the Buttholes' career isn't an extended prank but a piece of redneck performance art. The tracks are predominantly instrumental, and some of them, such as the apocalyptic lurcher ""Eindhoven Chicken Masque"" or the panoramic synth-plus-feedback picnic of ""Space"" parts I and II are excellent. In fact, much of this raucous release makes one wish that post-rock would unbutton its stiff shirt already. The Buttholes' grinding pedal-messes and tribally intoxicating drums sound like dumb fun, but they display a visceral intelligence, far from the vibe of certain Grubbs/O'Rourke theses-readings. Gibby (going by Gibson Haynes on this outing, in the fanciest formality upgrade since Red Heat's Larry Fishburne metamorphosed into Laurence Fishburne III) is a profane Robert Pollard, and you get all his great bad sides here: the voice so distorted it's monstrous, the panic-attacked insect voice, the buzzsaw, and his natural Buddy-Holly-meets-Yosemite-Sam nasal/guttural yowlp. The album forms a kind of Texas-nut triumvirate since Roky Erickson's ""Earthquake"" gets covered and Daniel Johnston performs vocal assistance on the eight-minute hellstomp ""All Day"". And for every nugget of nonsense (""Night of the Day"" is just pretty chords getting pitch-shifted and whammy-barred mixed with some distance screams, snores and wet farts), gurgly anti-symphonies such as ""Hetero Skeleton"" spaz all over the place. Plus, you get treats like the hilarious intro to early punker ""I Hate My Job"". Whether the band is in flailing or militaristic mode, this is the soundtrack to those nights you don't deserve to have survived, when only your Converse All-Stars saved you from that electric fence, or when you wake up with the taste of rust in your mouth, blood in your Cheerios, an oboe-sized bruise, and a tattoo that says ""I Am a Thundering Herd"".","Dude, man, dude, shit, man, how much do I love the Fork?

If you've been reading our site for long enough, you should be behaviorally conditioned to recoil in fear from the word, crawl under your computer desk, and assume the grade-school tornado warning position. Nothing brings out the Pitchfork Ginsu like some earnest musical diary-reading, especially if it's from loyal sponsor Vagrant. One thing I'll grant the Vagrant crowd, though, is good sportsmanship; cheers, mates. One problem-- and I only feel comfortable telling you this after many months of loyal service-- but yeah, I like some emo. The problem lies in the definition, I guess, since ""emo"" has a Supreme Court pornography kind of definition; one knows it when one sees it. Emo to me is not so much the three-chord pop riffing of the Get Up Kids or the overpassionate nobody-loves-me preciousness of new-schoolers like Dashboard Confessional, but instead the mid-90s Midwestern scene of bands with a recipe of rhythmic complexity, hardcore/post-punk sensibility co-existing uneasily with anthemic tunefulness, and a tendency to moan about the womenfolk. Hey, the wintry climate of Middle America produces a lot of sensitive dorks, your humble narrator included. It's these emo-for-lack-of-a-better-term bands (Braid, the Promise Ring's first album, Joan of Arc, and even Rainer Maria) that I fess up to occasionally dusting off for a Saturday afternoon, and pleasingly, they seem to be maintaining some semblance of influence beyond the dumbed-down nu-emo. First there was Pretty Girls Make Graves with their Braid + A Girl! formula, and now comes Canada's Hot Hot Heat, whose sound, lyrics, and album title set off my emo alarm, but in a manner gleefully free of embarrassment. Of course, the emo label is only one of many arbitrary genre ornaments to hang on Hot Hot Heat; one could equally focus in on their new-wave Attractions fetish for Hammond organ or their post-punk urgency and off-kilter progressions. But if the Canuck quartet resembles anyone, it's Dismemberment Plan circa Emergency & I: insistent, poppy music superbly summarizing most of the melodic states punk rock has evolved through since its invention. So even if Make Up the Breakdown contains a lyric like ""bandages on my legs and my arms from you,"" there's no navel-gazing to be found, unless you can stay focused on your belly button while spastically thrashing about the room. Breakdown launches with a trio of energetic flashes: ""Naked in the City Again"" setting the nervous tone with a cymbal groove and jagged guitar; ""No, Not Now"" traipsing through a series of irresistibly catchy segments; ""Get In or Get Out"" exploding at one point into an organ freakout during which you can almost hear the keys flying off. By now you'll have surely noticed singer Steve Bays' voice, and therein lies the swing point of your Hot Hot Heat enjoyment. Rarely pausing for more than a breath, Bays flips violently around the range, speeding up and slowing down to match the stop/starts and time signature fuckery of his bandmates. It's the kind of performance that can either obscure your enjoyment of the entire album (as it did for my esteemed colleague Eric Carr in his review of the band's Knock Knock Knock EP), or enliven the experience as a seeming nod to crazed post-punk vocalists like David Byrne and Wire's Colin Newman. For me, it's the latter-- the voice initially seemed a major flaw atop these otherwise incredibly solid rockers, but by the fourth track I'd dropped my defenses, and now find it gives these tracks the character and caffeinated energy they deserve. No matter your feelings on the mic work, though, you can't help but notice the musical talent at play here, be it in the unusual song structures or the unobtrusive, color-adding use of the organ behind Dante DeCaro's unpredictable chords. ""Oh, Goddamnit"" borrows more than messy hair from Is This It? with its tik-tak drumming and poppy bass, but Bays' enthusiasm on the hook is an improvement on the Strokes' studied ennui. ""This Town"" deftly refuses to allow for standard toe-tapping while remaining singalongable, and ""Talk to Me, Dance with Me"" features an urgent Latin shuffle that amazingly (given that we're dealing with a north-of-the-border band here) skirts awkwardness. Make Up the Breakdown still has its weaker moments-- the overlong ""In Cairo"" or the awkward Long Beach reggae bridge of ""Bandages"" in particular-- indicating that Hot Hot Heat's peak might be in the gotta-wear-shades future rather than the present. Still, there's no reason Breakdown couldn't put Hot Hot Heat on the national stage-- the band's accessible enough on top of their inventiveness to be a feminine facial structure or two away from superstardom. In the meantime, revel in the rare emo-inflected album that won't earn admonishment from us Pitchforkers.","Emo.

The Liturgy of Ghosts,Unstable Ensemble,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8edea9e61561daa5933/1:1/w_160/5737371e.gif,2002-11-10 06:00:01,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8363-the-liturgy-of-ghosts/,Family Vineyard,"Nudged comfortably between pure noise and modern jazz is arguably the most polarizing music in the West: free improvisation. I don't want to launch a considered historical treatise on the subject, but I will say that, despite its scary rep for some, there's as much a variance in sound, texture, even impact-- I've experienced more than one performance wherein my reaction was almost completely different than my mate's-- as you'd find in any other kind of music. The problem isn't that there's not enough sound to keep my ears busy; it's that my ears are generally accustomed to a much more rigid flow of events. Groups like the Unstable Ensemble leave few breadcrumbs or signposts for me, so if I am to consider this music a ""journey"", it's inevitably going to be closer to metaphysical than linear. And, as any member of the real world will tell you, metaphysical music-journeys aren't often on the daily agenda. None of that is to say I haven't gotten lost on a few and lived to tell about it. When I was younger, I figured people listened to this stuff because 1) they were crusty academics and/or music snobs; 2) they were super-geniuses who I should fear; or 3) they were strange homeless bohemians. Having seen many lights since then, I've realized that free improvisation isn't terribly different than other music I listen to, except that I sometimes have to guide myself (rather than let the verse/chorus/verse do it for me). Unstable Ensemble, an electro-acoustic quintet featuring members from all over the Midwest and East Coast, formed in 1999 and is only too eager to lead me into mysterious regions. Two saxes (baritone and soprano), guitar, percussion and no-input mixing board (a probable nod to Japan's bustling ""onkyo"" scene featuring Toshimaru Nakamura and Otomo Yoshihide, where this kind of freedom is undergoing a slight renaissance) ebb, flow, rattle and hum their ways through extended expositions on apparently poetic themes (""In the Fullness of Time"", ""To Speak, To Listen"", et al). The group's sound is sparse considering the amount of sounds available at their disposal; to their credit, very few toes are stepped on here, as the players clearly possess big ears. Often, if two or three instruments are sounding at once, another will drop out, or play a supportive role; effectively, this lends no small amount of shape to music that would be formless by definition. ""Beneath the Rafters"" begins with Jason Bivens' scraped guitar, sounding like rusted metal, but soon enough turns to agitated clawing and swooping. His opening becomes an overture, incorporating jazz-informed lines and eventually stating a minimal melody, at which point the saxes and percussion join the fray. Marty Belcher's soprano takes the high, ethereal road while Joe Donnelly's baritone opts for more punchy terrain. This kind of everyone-in-their-place, spatial interplay is typical for the music on The Liturgy of Ghosts, and may be good news for anyone expecting hardcore skronk. This record is strictly abstract (probably closest to European free improvisers like Hans Bennink, or even the Art Ensemble of Chicago without the overt humor), which places them firmly outside the trumpeted, oddly populist downtown NYC improv clique, but is always engaging. I'm tempted to say the album would be a good starting place for newcomers to free jazz because of its relatively restrained mood, but I don't want to imply that this is a gentle breeze. It's an interesting record, and one by a group who should be on the radar for anyone interested in these kinds of journeys.","Nudged comfortably between pure noise and modern jazz is arguably the most polarizing music in the West: free improvisation.

What Would You Do,Mike Johnson,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba129d034d5c69bf538c/1:1/w_160/5ff6aeae.jpg,2002-11-10 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4278-what-would-you-do/,Up,"There are lots of different types of bars out there, but most fall into one of two categories. First, you've got your hip, stylish establishments, the kind college kids hang at every night from Thursday to Saturday to get wasted and possibly to score with some stranger they'll never see again. And then there's the other kind, the local dive off the interstate or secluded on a neighborhood sidestreet, where the bartender knows most of the faces and the troubles those faces have known. If his music is any indication, Mike Johnson spends most of his time in the latter kind of establishment, drowning his sorrows nightly in a foamy stein and conveniently forgetting that the guy handing him drinks isn't a licensed therapist. The place he haunts isn't exactly Cheers, either-- you're unlikely to hear a lot of clever one-liners and it's probably not quite so immaculately kept up. Yet, unlike most of the denizens of this consoling tavern, Johnson happens to spend most of the rest of his time with an instrument in his hand, hanging out with guys like Phil Ek and Mark Lanegan. He's actually been tolling around the Pacific Northwest for about a decade and a half now, starting out in the little-known Snakepit before playing bass in Dinosaur Jr throughout most of the 90s. Aptly, he's also been one of the principle forces behind Mark Lanegan's post-Screaming Trees work, which is just about the closest thing I can think of to his own solo work. Johnson's forlorn baritone also occasionally conjures up a more restrained Mark Eitzel, or even Nick Cave at his most subdued. Johnson's fourth solo album, and first since 1998's I Feel Alright, picks right up where he last left us. That is, in an emotional ditch, crushed by the weight of relationships that didn't last and light that's struggling to poke through thick clouds of dread and disgust. Sure, anyone at all familiar with his stuff isn't going to expect the feelgood hit of the summer, but here the morose delivery sometimes gets a little overbearing, as it's hard to find a break anywhere. Thankfully, the persistence of the man's mopes is largely offset by the quality of the material. Johnson has an odd approach to songwriting, setting a mood first, and then extracting a narrative from it. Ek's production is friendly and inviting, framing each of Johnson's songs so that they reveal themselves slowly, growing with each listen. The hook for opener ""Arise"" ingratiates itself so subtly that you'll hardly even notice it's happened until you find yourself humming it at work a few days later. By and large, Johnson couches his themes in a backdrop of rock-stained country and folk, though it's never firmly in either territory. He breaks out of dirge mode here and there, most notably on ""Come Back Again"", which, while not exactly jaunty itself, manages to charge things up nicely with some startlingly anthemic guitar work and an unusually animated vocal performance. The whole thing ends with what could be a pompous disaster, featuring Johnson dryly reading a passage from the Purgatory section of Dante's Divine Comedy, but the music that rises behind him and eventually overwhelms him is so spirited and unpretentious that it actually elevates the mood, capping things on a markedly positive note. Though not his best, What Would You Do is another solid effort from Johnson, who by now has developed a fairly impressive little canon of downtrodden songs and a fairly distinct gothic country musical calling card for himself. A pretty good companion, really, for emotional distress during those times when a friendly bartender's nowhere to be found. It's better for your liver, anyway.","There are lots of different types of bars out there, but most fall into one of two categories. First, you ...

American IV: The Man Comes Around,Johnny Cash,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a53d13d1975652138ed3/1:1/w_160/5c50a5f5.jpg,2002-11-07 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1331-american-iv-the-man-comes-around/,American,"The Man in Black's vision of the American west is one of a rugged, mournful land, where outlaws carry bibles over their hearts, and where sometimes, the good book even stops a bullet. The Man Comes Around is poised as the next chapter in Cash's darkling fairy tale, the fourth in an ongoing series of mostly-covers albums on which he gives material by some of today's most talented (or alternately, best-selling) artists his own aged slant. Now, time was, Johnny Cash covering a song like Soundgarden's ""Rusty Cage"" was a clever novelty made impressive by his ability to infuse these modern-day rockers with overwhelming emotion. Cash's renditions of songs like Nick Cave's ""The Mercy Seat"" and Leonard Cohen's ""Bird on a Wire"" weren't so surprising, but far more powerful, as the spirit of those songs was so close to his own. The simple truth, of course, is that Cash's talent is such that he can elevate nearly any song to which he turns his ear. But on this, his fourth go-round on the same theme, it hardly seems necessary anymore; the songs of this record are taken from the most disparate ends of the musical spectrum, to no apparent end but show that he can do it. The first tragic subject of this case study is, almost predictably, Trent Reznor. (We knew it was just a matter of time, didn't we? I give it one more album before he gets around to Tool's ""Schism."") The curriculum: ""Hurt"". Now, I'm not a big advocator of the NIN sound, but I'll give ""Hurt"" that it's got a fine melody, and its arrangement here is fantastic. Cash treats the song with such sincerity and honesty that it takes on a power that it never held in Reznor's hands, infusing it with genuine heart to accompany the bitterness. But that's just it-- could Cash really fail to bring something to this desolate ballad? It's like taking target practice at the Empire State Building. There's no challenge here-- it's just driving home a point. (And incidentally, those of you anticipating the line, ""I wear this crown of shit,"" will be sorely disappointed.) Still, from the slithering blues groove of ""Personal Jesus"" to a surprisingly subtle duet with Fiona Apple on ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"", Cash never falters. Gorgeous, minimal arrangements highlight his emotive baritone and distill each track to its finest essentials. However, when an album consists of twelve covers and only three originals, something more than pretty arrangements is necessary, and it's called cohesion. Cash's renditions are often breathtaking in their simplicity, but rarely do they justify their presence among a dozen other similarly afflicted songs. A few exceptions are able to rise above, of course. ""Hung My Head"" is, and always has been, more Johnny Cash's than Sting's, and there's no disputing it now. And Cash and his understudy Nick Cave do justice to fellow Country hall-of-famer Hank Williams' ""I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"". In these tracks, Cash finds something more than excellent composition and heartfelt regret-- he taps into the essence of each song and truly makes it his own. If he could have done this more often, and with a better selection of songs, the bulk of this record wouldn't be overshadowed by the cataclysmic magnitude of its original title track. And the weaknesses of the covers wouldn't be half as apparent if they weren't thrown into such stark contrast with an original that could stand proudly alongside ""Folsom Prison Blues"" or ""I Walk the Line"". The Cash-penned ""The Man Comes Around"" is an epic tale of apocalypse, interpreting Revelations with uplifting exuberance. Restraint, resignation, and a hope of peace pervade the prophetic imagery. Truly, the subdued fury and beauty of this track reduces everything that follows. The immediate question posed is: if this man can still write and perform works of this caliber, why is he resorting to the words and music of others? Ideally, the covers should speak this answer for themselves. Unfortunately, Cash fails to give them voice to do so, and as such, they remain unfortunately silent.","The Man in Black's vision of the American west is one of a rugged, mournful land, where outlaws carry ...

Charango,Morcheeba,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3baeb335119a49ed79b/1:1/w_160/d9a12907.jpg,2002-11-07 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5425-charango/,Warner Bros.,"Not to disappoint the readership, but this review won't feature any tales of my exploits with the ladies. Word from on high has it that the Big Man discourages lusty anecdotes suffused with bodily functions these days. But Pitchfork old-schooler James P. Wisdom may have nailed the atmosphere just right when rating Morcheeba's first album, Who Can You Trust?. It's hard to have sympathy for a second-gen trip-hop band whose name is a not-so-thinly veiled pot reference, not to mention song titles like ""Trigger Hippie"". Still, Skye Edwards' voice cooed so smoothly that it felt more like soul than angst, and the simple arrangements and subtle detail chilled many heads. Of course, the London trio soon caught the whiff of cashflow and shifted rapidly from lounge chic to generic, radio-friendly pop in a downward spiral shared by most of their contemporaries (Hooverphonic, anyone?). The Sire execs saw to it that all elements of darkness, ethereality and-- gasp in shock here-- black soul were quickly and efficiently excised from the mix, to be replaced by the most predictable, glossy surface settings this side of IKEA. Now whitewashed, Edwards and brothers Paul and Russ Godfrey have dropped their fourth and most atrocious album yet, Charango. The name comes from a South American lute usually made from the shell of an armadillo. A fitting title for dead meat. Charango begins with a hint of the band's former sensuality on ""Slowdown"", which features reverbed guitar and Edwards' breathy voice begging you to ""slow down"" after a long day. Unfortunately, her lyrical banality has progressed far beyond excruciating rhymes, to the point where every chorus reads like a self-help manual. ""Otherwise"" features canned string frills that accompany Edwards' advice: ""It ain't gonna hurt now, if you open up your eyes/ You're making it worse now, every time you criticize."" Next up is ""Aqualung"", which, unfortunately, is not a cover of the Jethro Tull song-- the spectacle of Skye eyeing little girls with bad intent might have added some punch to the cod-Western riffs copped from earlier albums. You may get a kick from the lyrics, though: ""Square up to fight, like dynamite!"" Somewhere, Bis beam with pride. The guest stars aren't lacking in commandments, either. On the title track, Outsidaz rapper Pacewon finally makes the pun in the band's name overt for the chronically sheltered: ""Y'all need to roll your blunts with Morcheeba!"" Another guest spot features Lambchop's Kurt Wagner doing his best Mark Eitzel impression. But the abominable low comes with ""Women Lose Weight"", which features the venerable Slick Rick. Yes, the man who brought you the classic ""La Di Da Di"" returns for a sketch in which he decides he's got to kill his wife as a result of her putting on weight over the years. In the cheery chorus he sneers, ""Send that ass right to the morgue."" It might be amusing to the socially callous if the entire affair wasn't so irredeemably wack that even a white guy like me just shakes his head in embarrassment. It doesn't help that Rick's flow and the rhythm parody the Gorillaz's ""Clint Eastwood""; ripping off Del isn't the way to bring this bilge back to earth. Morcheeba don't need outsiders to sound contrived, though, evidenced in the pseudo-Tropicalia of ""Sao Paulo"". Tame percussion and turntable scratches paint the perfect picture of a self-absorbed traveler boozing it up in the exotic South, and Skye signs it with the line, ""My life is just one big clich√©."" Yes, imitative fallacies usually suck, and no, Latin Americans don't need any more cheap caricatures; they're sick enough that ""passionate"" and ""fiery"" seem to be the only adjectives ever applied to them. On Morcheeba's website, the band talks about their interest in Brazilian Tropicalia's cannibalistic tendencies, the urge to consume different musical styles and synthesize them all. Likewise, Charango reeks of Warner Brothers' attempt to find a viable audience for this waning band, and the seemingly anti-consumerist ""Way Beyond"" rings hollow next to the rest of these marketing imperatives masquerading as songs. If only it were somehow more enjoyable to watch it all devour itself...","Not to disappoint the readership, but this review won't feature any tales of my exploits with the ladies.\n ...

Happyness is their fifth album, and either I'm going old and developing a taste for vanilla, or the Aluminum Group continues to improve. Everything here is just so precise and fitted together so perfectly, not unlike the Ray Eames furniture line the band take their name from. Plenty of sweat went into the creation of Happyness, I'm sure, but none happened in real time. The music, melodies and arrangements have the kind effortless sheen that comes only from focused studio tinkering, and the result is a relaxing invitation to take in all the detail. One thing that makes the Aluminum Group interesting is they act like rock never happened. For John and Frank Navin, music jumped from the Bacharach/David/Warwick holy troika directly to the most melodic, new-romantic end of 80s synth-pop, and then took a short detour into mid-90s German electronics before dropping into the timeless realm where their records happen. They'd sooner retire to the Unabomber's cabin than bring a distortion pedal into the studio, and forget gravel-voiced angst. The Navins gargle and floss before every trip to the microphone, so don't bother with Happyness unless you're ready to meet the music on its own clearly defined terms. Befitting their perfectionist streak, this is a short and compact album, their third 10-song collection in a row, and it hovers just below the 40-minute mark. This is allegedly the first album in a trilogy, but the thematic direction is difficult to detect. The lyrics are still rife with literary allusions, arch turns of phrase, and tales of love and betrayal, but nothing unusual knits them together as far as I can hear. I can say that you'll enjoy the songs a lot more if you find lines like, ""It's springtime in Jellystone park,"" funny (like I do). Musically, Happyness is sparer than the recent work. If Pelo was an electronic excursion and Pedals found Aluminum Group indulging in acoustic chamber pop with Jim O'Rourke at the controls, Happyness incorporates hints of both approaches but tones the backing down. ""Kisses"" illustrates nicely the integrated approach, as a ringing synth patch forms the basis of the tune, but accents and rhythmic thrust are provided by a cool-as-a-snowcone muted trumpet. Despite impressive electronic accents, the arrangement seems designed for the kind of mid-60s crowd that agreed with Frank Sinatra about Elvis Presley. Whatever you think about the Aluminum Group's mad reverence for the AM radio pop of '65-'74, there's no denying the strength of these melodies, and this is why we have to take these guys seriously. These are damn good songs. Like Lord Bacharach, the Navins know how to string together a verse, bridge and chorus, each with ample melody to power its own tune (""Pop"" here is particularly impressive in this respect.) Hear most of these songs a few times and you'll feel like you've known them all your life. And if you find yourself in the mood for some smart pop music that hits all the right notes, you could do a lot worse.","Aluminum Group have been playing the DL for four albums now, consistently delivering the kind of smooth, sophisticated orchestra-pop that ...

But rather than buckle under the pressure and become another statistic running through ballistics, 'Face managed to cipher that pain and struggle into his rhymes. His booming baritone sounded alternately boastful and besieged, paranoid and supremely confident. His straight-forward recitation of the roughneck life was gangsta before we even knew what gangsta was. In his own words, he has ""turned a dream into reality with a fuck-you mentality."" And, in addition to his artistic and commercial accomplishments, Scarface has also reigns as president of Def Jam South, one of the best-known hip-hop labels, producing the always-amusing Ludacris. But even as the platinum records pile up, strife is never far off. Geffen almost refused to release the Geto Boys' debut; 'Face suffered from multiple and prolonged bouts with depression; and the FBI and DEA reportedly keep tabs on him. Although these events may be unfortunate on a personal level, the struggle keeps 'Face hungry, and, as he recently told BET, ""spoke through my pen to ease my pain."" The best songs on The Fix resonate with that classic 'Face blend of swagger and sadness. ""Safe"", which kicks off the album, is a bluesy and brutal ride through the man's hood. Children grow up disillusioned and poor; snitches slip, flip, and die; and the hustle goes on and on. Scarface walks through this carnage with his trademark nihilistic bluster and drug-game savvy. Sure, we've heard the tale of urban decimation and dime-bag capitalism a million times before, but 'Face was among the first to set this shit off and he navigates through the clich√©s of hopelessness better than most. For ""Guess Who's Back"", Jay-Z and fellow Roc-a-Fella cohort Beanie Sigel drop by to pay their respects to the real originator. Producer Kayne West, who has now officially arrived, provides a blazing track that wouldn't have sounded out of place on The Blueprint. Although Jigga and Beanie both drop serviceable verses, the crown for best guest appearance on goes to Nas for his verse on ""In Between Us"". Despite a generic beat, Nas lashes out with a newfound hunger that's kept him in contention for the title of King of NY. Still, even with a string of near-classic guest spots and some smokin' verses, The Fix has too many holes to recommend. The record features no less than nine different producers that were seemingly given the directive to come up with the most forgettable and formulaic beats possible. And the tracks featuring R&B; vocalists are the album's weakest, by a long shot. To quote Wu Guru RZA, ""R&B; equals rap and bullshit"". And, lastly, a large reason this album ultimately fails is because Scarface has been so successful in the past. After inspiring a hip-hop movement (the Dirty South), 'Face's tales of ghetto horror and valor now come off redundant. He may play it better than most, but it's still that same old song.","Growing up in Houston's 5th Ward, ex-Geto Boy Scarface waded through a constant litany of violence, drugs,\n\ and ...

Instrumentals,The Nels Cline Singers,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5fdea9e61561daa527e/1:1/w_160/bcdcb137.gif,2002-11-06 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1510-instrumentals/,Cryptogramophone,"Yeah, singers. Like Cher. Cher sings on this album. And Madonna. And Sting. In fact, everyone who only has one name, they all sing on this album. If you didn't fall for that, good for you. The recently assembled Nels Cline Singers are guitarist Nels Cline's current touring outfit featuring Devin Hoff on contrabass and Scott Amendola on drums/electronics. And Instrumentals, though issuing forth from the titanic loins of these so-called Singers, is as unsullied by human voice as the rest of guitarist Cline's non-rock work. While Nels spends his days axing for the Geraldine Fibbers, noodling with Thurston Moore, shopping for shoes with Mike Watt, etc., all he's ever really wanted to do was go home and toss back a can of that cold, frothy jazz. Of course, given his background, Cline's never been afraid of inflecting the idiom with ideas borrowed from the more remote quarters of the rock world (exotic pedals, dictatorial spaz-mandates, etc). That he does so without ever approaching ""fusion"" is to his enduring credit. While Instrumentals suffers a bit in comparison to Cline's previous studio work with the huge Destroy All Nels Cline ensemble, it's mostly because the three-piece lineup curtails some of the wild tonal exploration done on that record. Don't fret, though, these folks still have an awful lot going for them. They can be furiously tight, for one thing, when in rock-mode. ""Cause for Concern"" and ""Ghost of the Pi√±ata"" both make for sublime chase music; the former spits convoluted back-alley riffs out from between clenched teeth, while the latter heat-shimmers with backwards reverb and crystalline arpeggios. ""Suspended Head"", dedicated in the liner notes to the awesome SF-based experimental art-rock band Deerhoof, comes off as an even more elastic, unhinged version of the same. In the presence of these tracks, the even more straightforward ""blues mutation"" ""Lowered Boom""-- a showcase for Hoff's menacing bow-work and Cline's rawhide chops-- even starts to sound a little lackluster. They more than make up for it, though, on the less structured pieces. The most immediately likable of these, the fifteen-minute ""Blood Drawing"", slowly churns a soup of Can-ish string squeals into a spacy, arabesque guitar workout. Though it's hard to tell who's doing what at times, it often seems like Amendola is the most interesting noisemaker of the group, stringing together drum loops on the fly and then letting them decay beyond recognition. On the ""freer"" pieces, ""A Mug Like Mine"" and ""Lucia"", it's Amendola too who acts as the loosest cannon, battering away wildly enough to give Cline and Hoff's follow-the-leader skronk the appearance of regularity. All right, you knew I was going to have to use ""skronk"" sooner or later (and dammit, you would have said it, too). Given the amount of it that's made it onto this record, though, the Singers' capacity for melody and delicacy is pretty remarkable. Cline's relatively spare figures, Hoff's sobbing vibrato, and Amendola's electronic manipulations on ""Harbor Child"" are all equally elegiac. The closer, ""Slipped Away""-- probably the most ""composed"" piece on the album-- is just as simply, sadly beautiful, pursuing the fundamental in slow-motion through a wasted chordal countryside. What's amazing is that this isn't really anything that new for Nels; the faces (and the warped musical personalities behind them) have changed, but it's mainly just another addition to a growing and worthwhile body of work.",,8.0,
Nextdoorland,The Soft Boys,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a49e9d034d5c69bf30f2/1:1/w_160/ad26377f.jpg,2002-11-06 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7312-nextdoorland/,Matador,"Though the music of the Soft Boys was hopelessly out-of-step with the times in which it was created, it has aged beautifully. Their 1980 masterstroke Underwater Moonlight now seems colossal; its excellently crafted power-pop packed the wallop of a hundred-ton rig hitting a concrete wall at top speed, even with frontman Robyn Hitchcock's inventive, surrealist lyrics softening the crunch. That album, however, was recorded 22 years ago, and since then everything has changed. Hitchcock has achieved a much higher degree of public awareness with his solo career than the Soft Boys ever saw, and the other members of the quartet have pursued their own paths through two decades of changing music, often playing on each other's records and even occasionally writing together. So, in light of this, it hardly seems surprising that the band reformed last year to tour in support of Matador's expanded reissue of Underwater Moonlight, or that they entered a studio shortly afterward to record another full-length. Surprise or not, to be skeptical about a project like this is only natural-- ""reunion"" albums routinely fall flat, and pretty much invariably pale in comparison to the band's past work. But while that second part rings true here, I'm thrilled to report that the first part doesn't. Nextdoorland finds the band's old chemistry in full effect, and Hitchcock's songwriting seems re-energized by the presence of his old mates. They waste no time proving it, either-- drummer Morris Windsor and bassist Matthew Seligman immediately lock together on the opener, ""I Love Lucy"", a mostly instrumental song that succeeds by the loopy guitar interplay of Hitchcock and Kimberley Rew. Hitchcock begins the weirdly low-key ""Pulse of My Heart"" by claiming, ""You can set your watch by me/ I'm a regular guy""-- and then goes out of his way to suggest otherwise over the course of the rest of the album. This is perhaps best evidenced on ""My Mind Is Connected"" when he sings, ""My mind is connected to your dreams/ Bzzup uhzzup uzzup uzzuh bzzup uh-huh/ Your dreams are connected to the underside/ Where the skull of Africa meets the horn of Florida/ And petals ring in orbit, merry day/ Give me a pod of rock 'n' roll."" Elsewhere, he gets surprisingly explicit on ""Japanese Captain"", intoning in a paradoxically chipper sneer for the lines, ""Touch me, baby/ Rinse me, please/ Fuck me, darling/ Under the table is good, but under your fingers is better/ You know I'm in love."" (Something tells me he didn't get the date.) And amidst all this, the band plays as a tight, focused unit, congealing into thick rhythm on ""Protected Love"" and entering extended freakouts along the way, as with the vaguely Middle Eastern coda to ""Mr. Kennedy"" and the raging tangents of the six-minute powerhouse ""Strings"". The harmonies that shimmered so brightly on Underwater Moonlight are employed sparingly on Nextdoorland, spotlighting Hitchcock's Syd Barrett-influenced croon, which seems to suit this material best. Unfortunately, the absence of those harmonies also contributes to an overall lack of density, and this eventually proves the record's greatest weakness. But that doesn't strike me as a fault of the band's as much as producer Pat Collier's. Though responsible for producing Underwater Moonlight, he seem satisfied with a hollowed sound here, which weakens the punch of the group's older material-- and frankly, that punch was pretty essential to the whole hitting-a-concrete-wall-at-top-speed bit. The strength and conviction of the material is wonderful regardless, but I find it difficult not to wonder what might have been had they brought in New Pornographers producer David Carswell. In the end, of course, what might have been is beside the point. What we have here is an inspired comeback from a band who are finally getting their due, two decades after the fact. That nothing on Nextdoorland hits quite as hard as ""I Wanna Destroy You"" or ""Pigworker"" isn't an indictment, nor a shock. But that most of the record manages to come so close after a 22-year hiatus is a serious achievement-- it deserves only commendation. Here's hoping the Boys don't quit again on us too soon, as this new evidence proves they've hardly run their course.","Though the music of the Soft Boys was hopelessly out-of-step with the times in which it was created, it has ...

Terrible Hostess,Carolyn Mark,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3b2ea9e61561daa7fa4/1:1/w_160/851bb298.jpg,2002-11-06 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5109-terrible-hostess/,Mint,"When Mark is moonlighting on her Room-Mates, she finds the time to be Neko's Corn Sister, but when she splits from Case, Neko must take the lion's share of the ""alt-"", because Mark sure has plenty ""country"" to spare. Nevertheless, it's easy to see strong similarities between these two, particularly in vocal delivery, though Mark largely eschews Case's smoky, dusky drama, opting instead for a worn-in, down-home sound that can be very ingratiating. She warmly invites you into her home, though she readily admits to being a Terrible Hostess for an intimate evening with a few close friends. It gets a little rowdy here and there as the tempo picks up, everyone has few laughs, there's some quiet reflection, and in the end, a good time is had by all. Now, as I've said, occasionally the dinner party atmosphere comes close to becoming a full-fledged hoedown, as on tracks like ""Fuzzy Slippers"", or the worst offender, ""After Bar Party"", and I'd be lying if I pretended that it didn't impair my enjoyment of this album. That said, though, there's evident quality lurking within even these tracks. After all, just because they taste like grits to me (and I hate grits) doesn't mean they aren't delicious to those that have a taste for them. The musicianship is extremely tight on these fast-paced numbers, and they're effortlessly infused with Mark's charmingly wry sense of humor, which goes a long way to pulling them off. Still, I'm happy to say that the largest part of this album is spent on slower, more seemingly personal numbers; unhurried sweet-and-sour gems like ""Gopherville"" or ""Port Moody"" really allow Mark's innate charm to shine through. Her unforced (but still powerful) voice gives these tracks a very meaningful air; like fond recollection of past happiness, they're at once thankful for the memories, but regret that those times won't come around again. If that sounds depressing, don't fret-- the bottom line of the multi-layered emotion within these songs is always an undeniable optimism. And it's Mark's voice alone that conveys such complexity; the arrangements are well-played, but sparse-- there's typically just enough music to serve as a suitable backdrop. So I suppose Mark's party really is pretty entertaining. If you don't mind your alt-country heavy on the country, there ought to be plenty to keep you there well into the wee hours. If you're a rock 'n' roller kinda kid like me, though, that's probably not going to be the case. But regardless, I'd recommend dropping by anyway-- just be fashionably late and plan on leaving early.

1st Class,Large Professor,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcab5e6ef95969322ec3/1:1/w_160/5e31710d.jpg,2002-11-05 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4691-1st-class/,Matador,"Without question, Large Professor (aka Extra P) has more hip-hop cred than most continents. At an age when most of us were asking ourselves ""Stridex or Noczema?"", Large Pro was dipping out of gym class to lay down tracks for the legendary Rakim Allah. From there, he went on to work with the likes of Biz Markie, A Tribe Called Quest, Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth, the Beastie Boys, Gang Starr, Main Source, Nas, Big Daddy Kane, Kool G. Rap... and the list goes on and on and on. Unfortunately, at the height of his career, Large Professor signed with Geffen Records, who financed, promoted, and then promptly buried his debut album based on a perceived lack of interest in the excellent lead-off single ""I Just Wanna Chill"". While there have certainly been greater travesties committed in the name of record company money, failing to release an already-completed album by one of hip-hop's masters surely ranks up there somewhere. Seven years after the Geffen debacle, Extra P is back behind the boards and ready to prove that you don't need the Neptunes, a master's degree in Art Theory, or cases of Courvoisier to make a great hip-hop album. Large Pro still packs his tracks with that '93 flavor, and those of you who were around in '93 know that this isn't a bad thing. The production on 1st Class, his (second) debut album, sticks to the NYC roots hip-hop formula that Extra P helped refine. ""'Bout that Time"", which was released as a twelve-inch nearly two years ago, exemplifies Large Professor's approach. A simple drum track thumps harder than a Suge Knight pistolwhip with a distorted horn tightly looped to further emphasize the track's aggression and momentum. In Large Pro's world, pop gimmicks are ineffectual and redefinition takes a back seat to perfection. For reasons that will be explained later, the highlights of 1st Class are the tracks that feature guest emcees. Nas, who was introduced to the world on Large Professor's ""At the BBQ"", guests on the sublime ""Stay Chisel"". Over a slickly soulful production that sounds straight off the Car Wash soundtrack, Nas switches to conscious mode, rapping, ""Take the weight of the world on my shoulders, I hold it/ So I consume most of the pain for my niggas I roll wit'/ 'Cause, see, the streets ain't no Gold's Gym poppy/ And if I feel it going down then my niggas will spot me."" Not to be out-conscioused by QB's finest, Q-Tip shows up two songs later on ""In the Sun"" to drop his best verse in years. Large Pro delivers a simple boom-bap beat with harmonizing gospel vocals turned down real low in the mix to affect a smoothly reflective mood. Surprisingly, Q-Tip finds a fresh and ironic angle to highlight racial hypocrisy and urban decay: ""Where's the 40 acres and a mule?/ You'd rather give us Micky D's and a tool/ And in the sun I see the way you pull our heart strings."" Unfortunately, Large Pro is a far better producer than he is an emcee. His flow is a bit monotone and stale-- imagine Guru with a little more bass and a little less variance-- and his lyrics are rather insular and rarely reference anything outside of the world of hip-hop, with a noted exception being the sadly nostalgic verse he drops on ""In the Sun"". His limited mic skills can work when he has a guest emcee to play off, or on upbeat tracks such as ""'Bout that Time"" and ""Born to Ball"" when his deep voice acts as yet another percussive element. But he falls flat when the tracks are more delicately nuanced and the focus lies on actual content rather than momentum. While a plethora of guest vocals is generally a liability for an album, Large Pro might want to consider enlisting a few more of his legendary friends for the next LP. After all these years, his production work is still amongst the best in the businesses, and it would be hard to imagine anyone turning down the opportunity to spit over a Large Pro beat.","Without question, Large Professor (aka Extra P) has more hip-hop cred than most continents.

Amalgamated Sons of Rest EP,Amalgamated Sons of Rest,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0709d034d5c69bf26fd/1:1/w_160/1b057b72.gif,2002-11-05 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/148-amalgamated-sons-of-rest-ep/,Galaxia,"Back in the mid-to-late 80s, I was a fan of the Boston Celtics. Actually, not so much the Celtics as Larry Bird, the ""Hick from French Lick"". Bird was my favorite player and when he retired from basketball, I lost interest in the game. But one reason I liked him so much (besides the fact that he was one of the best players ever, and a fellow Hoosier) was that he brought out the best in others. And not just his teammates, but his opponents, too: fellow Celtics Kevin McHale and Robert Parish would have been good, but not great, without Bird, and Magic Johnson and the Lakers were undoubtedly at their best when facing the Celtics and Bird. Maybe it was because I was thirteen or so at the time, but I was honestly excited when it was announced that professional players were eligible for the Olympic Team. ""The Dream Team"", it was called, with Bird and Johnson and all the other greats on the same team. No one else stood a chance, and the thought of Bird dishing it off to Isaiah Thomas or Magic... well, to my young mind it was like Neil Peart jamming with Joe Satriani. Of course, as good as this sounded at the time, I hadn't quite anticipated just how incredibly boring this would quickly become. I don't remember who they played in that first round of the Olympics or what the final score was (something like 278-29), but I do remember flipping to summertime re-runs of ""227"" after about two dozen fast breaks in a row. You probably see where I'm going with this. Amalgamated Sons of Rest is a Dream Team of sorts, if your dreams include birds of prey, whoring, and/or traveling in gypsy caravans. Comprised of Will Oldham, Jason Molina from Songs: Ohia, and Alasdair Roberts from Appendix Out, the Sons o' Rest sound like a great idea on paper. Unfortunately, it also sounds exactly as you'd expect it to sound, and therein lies the problem. Everything about this disc is a foregone conclusion, excepting who's going to sing bass on the three-part harmonies (usually Will). From the mix of traditional and original material, to the subject matter (death, longing, whaling), the mood (dejected, yet philosophical), and the instrumentation (acoustic guitar, some piano), the record reeks of coasting. Even the song titles (""Maa Bonny Lad"", ""The Gypsy He-Witch"") could be approximated beforehand. Granted, no one was expecting anything revolutionary from this trio beyond what they've already accomplished with their own solo projects and full-time bands, but a little effort certainly couldn't have hurt. Still, there are small pleasures, if only for completists. All three of these croaky crooners take two turns in the lead vocalist's rocking chair. On the remaining, uncredited song (the hidden track on the CD and the lone song on the etched side of the vinyl version) each members takes turns singing what could nearly pass for a children's song, with the chorus, ""I will be good,"" repeated with increasing adamancy. It's by far the best offering here, not quite so serious as the other songs. Oldham's single songwriting contribution, ""Major March"", is also notable, but for a different reason: it's one of the few songs here in which the members sound genuinely passionate about the project, which obviously makes for a solid track, but also serves to highlight the limitations of the rest of the disc. The execution is forceful and determined, with Roberts and Molina echoing Oldham's stark phrasing: ""I have grown my hair out longer/ I have grown my beard out, too/ My skin is failing, my arms are frailing/ But you'd still know me, wouldn't you?"" During this chorus, in particular, the firm course of direction and the impassioned delivery on the part of each member makes sparklingly clear what this record is lacking elsewhere: leadership.","Back in the mid-to-late 80s, I was a fan of the Boston Celtics.

Oh Me Oh My...,Devendra Banhart,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a20aea9e61561daa493b/1:1/w_160/89904555.jpg,2002-11-05 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/546-oh-me-oh-my/,Young God,"He possesses a warble I won't soon forget, and if that isn't the mark of a classic balladeer I don't know what is-- except that he can paint a wild picture of slow snails, cold snow, the Charles C. Leary, and very nice people. There are probably thousands of nomadic, dark troubadours who would stumble upon some surrealist notion of wisdom if given the time and the audience, but 21-year-old Devendra Banhart draws ellipses around more than mere romantic, hard travails and etched self-portraits. In short, he isn't your everyday, everyman's folk singer, though folk aficionados would do well to weird themselves out every once in awhile with his stuff. Banhart's debut release for Michael Gira's Young God label is the work of someone presumably half-awake to conventions like ""professional recordings"" but fully aware of his own idiosyncrasies even as he performs without much trace of pretension or self-conscious nuance. The music on Oh Me Oh My is rarely more than an uncluttered combination of his unorthodox acoustic guitar pickings, more than a little tape hiss, and his immediately recognizable tenor. Banhart's voice might be a cross of Tim Buckley's flutter, Marc Bolan's timbre, and Tiny Tim's vibrato, but I would be hard pressed to claim he was imitating anyone. Similarly, his songs hit like sea chanteys started by Syd Barrett and then left mysteriously half-finished. In some cases, this is frustrating, but for the most part it seems bizarrely fitting. Banhart does share a link with traditional minstrels in the instances he opts for epic tragedy. ""Soon Is Good"", one of the longer tracks here (the shortest being all of 39 seconds), could be about the buried pain of a lost love, though the typically half-nonsensical lyrics are tough to decipher. Fortunately, the solemn, but not quite melancholy, guitar figures are uplifting enough to support Banhart's odd mumble. Later, he drops lines like, ""My toes have my favorite feet,"" in ""Michigan State"" over understated, optimistic guitar accompaniment, and somehow comes off like a weathered road-poet. Elsewhere, the songs can range from whimsical to slightly crazed. ""Lend Me Your Teeth"" stops just short of being a novelty number, perhaps due to the fact that Banhart keeps his yelp in check for most of it-- only leaping into whistle-warble territory for a brief stretch. ""Nice People"" may be the spookiest song on the album, beginning with ominous strumming, only to explode into a chorus of witchy Devendras repeating ""they certainly are nice people!"" There are moments on Oh Me Oh My that seem as if I'm overhearing a private sketch rather than a performance. Over the course of the CD, that might translate to ambience for some and annoyance for others. And the idea of a personal sketch might have been the idea all along: none of the music here was meant for release, but merely Banhart's collection of home and road tapings. It's possible that his voice would resonate more clearly with the aid of a good mic and decent mix, but that could very well detract from the considerable intimacy of his sound. If part of a folk singer's power comes from the purity of his conviction, then Banhart's promising debut is the sign of someone destined for great, strange things.","He possesses a warble I won't soon forget, and if that isn't the mark of a classic balladeer ...

Field Recordings 1995-2002,Fennesz,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd7a13d197565213b553/1:1/w_160/e9512c7b.jpg,2002-11-04 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3033-field-recordings-1995-2002/,Touch,"In the wake of the critical and (by Mego standards) commercial success of last year's Endless Summer, Touch presents Field Recordings 1995-2002, an assortment of compilation contributions, soundtrack work, unreleased tracks, and remixes from laptop wunderkind Fennesz-- plus the entirety of the notable 1996 debut EP Instrument. It's interesting to hear Fennesz again stripped of the conceptual cues that played a part in Endless Summer's success. In addition to the fantastic music, Endless Summer was a triumph of small label indie marketing. It's true that it had thematic unity and a good half the tracks followed the pattern of the Plays single, dissecting the structures of pop music in the context of an abstract computer-composed record. But if Fennesz had given the album a title like XRtN8ts and slapped some vector graphics on the cover, there's no way in hell the words ""beach"" or ""boys"" would have made it into a single review. So Field Recordings 1995-2002 is a great opportunity to interface with Fennesz' music directly, mediated only by the absolutely gorgeous Jon Wozencroft photography and design that adorns most Touch releases. And Christian once again brings the goods, with a handful of stunning tracks, a few more very good ones, and a nice overall portrait of his development as an artist. It may technically be a c: drive disk cleanup, but Field Recordings is strong throughout, and serves as a solid Fennesz sampler. It's particularly instructive to hear Fennesz's work in early form on the five tracks that comprise Instrument. He still seemed to be finding his footing at that stage, and these tracks are much more readily identifiable as pure IDM than what came after. ""Instrument 3"" has the kind of skittery, insanely quick beats-as-texture that Autechre would fully commit to by the time of LP5 and EP7, and ""Instrument 4"" isn't terribly far from the more disturbing end of Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works II. The other two Instrument tracks show Fennesz's talent with drone construction, but the occasional intrusion of not-terribly-imaginative beats holds ""Instrument 1"" back. The remainder of Field Recordings is a highly appealing hodgepodge. Two tracks involve remix work with inventive composer Ekkehard Ehlers. Fennesz' beautiful version of Ehlers material ""\xDFetrieb"" does wonders with the string and organ textures, combining the 20th Century classical air with wispy electronics. Fennesz's remix of ""Coedine"", a track by Ehlers and Stephen Mathieu, is no less beautiful, awash with more organ and acoustic guitar strumming, and given tension by unpredictable patches of static. The inclusion of ""Menthol"" from Clicks + Cuts 2 is welcome to anyone who missed that compilation. This track's warm bed of gurgling processing ranks it as on obvious precursor to Endless Summer. ""Good Man"" is an unreleased gem of recent vintage that shows Fennesz at peak interest in combining acoustic strums with seemingly unrelated but complimentary laptop squiggles (whatever his skill level on the instrument, Fennesz is again content to pepper his electronic work with rudimentary chords). Several short tracks culled from soundtrack projects point to a more subtle side of Fennesz. ""Stairs"" is from the soundtrack to the film Blue Moon, and it's basically a bed of quaking bass pedals mixed with hiccups and pops. ""Invendoo"" is kind of a laptop version of Nurse with Wound, all eerie scrapes and the sucking sound of container lids being pried open. Continuing his interest in covers, ""Namewithnohorse"" destroys the chords to America's ""Horse With No Name"", burying the strums in an avalanche of distortion. This sounds interesting but the development is lacking-- it's easily the worst track here. Still, Field Recordings 1995-2002 affirms Fennesz's status among the most gifted artists working the abstract end of the electronic music landscape. References to his established style affirm his strengths, and some of the odd tangents point to the dozen interesting directions his music might yet take. This doesn't rank with his last two full lengths, but Field Recordings is a must for any serious fan.","In the wake of the critical and (by Mego standards) commercial success of\n\ last year's Endless Summer, Touch ...

Homesick and Happy to Be Here,Aberdeen,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fe6ea9e61561daa4441/1:1/w_160/ae88920d.jpg,2002-11-04 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11-homesick-and-happy-to-be-here/,Better Looking,"If you caught this little blip in the mid-90s, you must have had a pretty sensitive radar, or at least an intense interest in what was going on over at legendary house of twee-focused Sarah Records. Aberdeen existed for a time back then as a duo-- a couple and their trusty drum machine cranking out a couple EPs of shimmery pop. And then they vanished, the victim of relationship tensions that lead to a five-year hiatus. And now they're back, reconvened with an expanded lineup and a long-awaited full-length that shows them no worse for the wear from the time off. In fact, if anything, they've improved considerably by expanding their sound (a human touch at the drum kit adds immeasurably), introducing dynamics and a certain lushness that just weren't there before. Above all, Homesick and Happy to Be Here sounds great, an inviting, warm listen that sounds especially good with a cold wind whipping outside. The members of the band retain a certain degree of anonymity, withholding their surnames in the liners and press materials, and it seems fitting enough for a band this approachable to be known only by their first names. The album opens with the sleepy ""Handsome Drink"", wherein vocalist Beth, draped in a haze of reverb, aptly declares, ""I can't wake up,"" in the chorus. From there, Aberdeen take off on a tear through an endlessly na√Øve world of post-adolescent love, full of crushes and likely lots of heavy petting. It works well with the music, but if you spend too much time reading the lyrics it might make you a bit sick (plus, the grammar is pretty atrocious in the booklet). Regardless, Beth's understated vocal delivery fits it perfectly, whether she's telling you about a flagging relationship or just reeling off some la-la-la's. Behind her, the band largely alternates between slow, contemplative arrangements and peppier backings that usually turn out a lot more satisfying. ""Sink or Float"" and ""Sunny in California"" are loose, laidback pop songs that nevertheless move at a rapid clip, and both rank among the album's best entries. Elsewhere, ""Clouds Like These"" makes good use of loungy Latin rhythms and sparser instrumentation. Yet, for all its successes, there are moments where the album doesn't quite hit-- for instance, the wandering ""Thousand Steps"", which just isn't bold enough to support its slow pace and meandering structure, and winds up getting lost in the background. The next song, ""Homesick"", seems ready to follow suit at first, but saves itself with a sharp dynamic shift near the end and a more thoughtful arrangement. It's difficult to say if Aberdeen are back for good with this release, but I certainly won't register any complaints if they are. Homesick and Happy to Be Here is hardly a landmark or some sort of masterpiece, but it's still highly enjoyable, and that's ultimately what's important with music like this. If you're looking for an easy-going album with a strong melodic core, Aberdeen might be worth the trip.","If you caught this little blip in the mid-90s, you must have had a pretty sensitive radar, or at least ...

The Joy of Sing-Sing,Sing-Sing,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4169d034d5c69bf2fa2/1:1/w_160/98011dcf.jpg,2002-11-04 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7178-the-joy-of-sing-sing/,ManifestoPoptones,"If you're anything like me, you're charming and remarkably virile and have fond memories of a time when American record stores still carried British weeklies like the NME. There was a time back then, in this imported Brit-indie world, when Alan McGee seemed incredibly important. He ran Creation Records back when people still wanted rock labels to be legendary: he signed My Bloody Valentine and the Jesus and Mary Chain. He also signed Oasis, who bankrolled his massive drug habit for quite a while; after that he got really into soccer, palled around with Prime Minister Tony Blair, sold Creation, and went off to start a new label called Poptones. Lush were important, too: they gave hilarious interviews to the weeklies, lent guitars to Kevin Shields, and hung out with the Cocteau Twins. They started off making shimmery shoegazer records and then gradually turned to making shimmery Britpop records, and just when something commercial started happening, their drummer killed himself. The others, understandably, went off for a while as well, and now one of them-- guitar player Emma Anderson-- is back, on Alan McGee's new label. No surprise: they were part of the same changing game. As were a lot of the folks on The Joy of Sing-Sing, which is like a collision of Anderson's and singer Lisa O'Neill's friends. Emma borrows former members from shoegazers Moonshake and Slowdive spin-off Mojave 3; O'Neill, of slightly more recent pedigrees, escorts members of the Departure Lounge and the more ambient Locust. Sing-Sing's first single was even released by Cocteau Twin Robin Guthrie's Bella Union imprint. What this supergroup of the vaguely dated are assembled to do is the same pretty ambitious thing you get from high-gloss, tech-savvy acts from Goldfrapp to Garbage, and the same thing you get from shoegazers-gone-pop like The Verve or Mercury Rev or that disappointing last Lush album: Sing-Sing are using the whole run of studio technology to make a tight, interesting, and great-sounding pop record. What's surprising, in this instance, is that this down-the-center approach to ambitiously arranged pop gives the group a ton of room to pack in a refreshingly wide variety of ideas. The obvious bases get covered: the fizzy swagger of Curve, or the slick trip-hop loops of however million Monos and Hooverphonics swarmed across the late 90s. But then the band's off elsewhere: swinging rhythms and hyper-sunny harmonies on the Stereolabby ""Far Away from Love"", shiny futuristic Motown on ""Feels Like Summer"", late-period Lush ambience on ""Underage"". Anderson even goes full-scale on her long-standing pull toward saccharine 80s pop, turning ""Panda Eyes""-- a Lush song if I've ever heard one-- into the sort of dreamily pulsing, synth-heavy number you might imagine coming either from a Corey Haim movie or the Darling Buds. The spirit of 4AD-- Lush's label, the label that turned the word ""ethereal"" into a critical staple-- makes a number of visits: O'Neill, who both sings and writes melodies disturbingly like Shelleyan Orphan's Caroline Crawley, invites the comparison directly on a few arty crooners. * All of which could easily have been the dullest, nicely produced thing in the world, if not for the fact that the songs are remarkably good. This, actually, was the whole glory of Americans listening to British rock bands as ""indie"" in our sense of the word: as opposed to the raw, grotty rockers slouching around the U.S., the Brits were honestly trying to write fabulous perfect pop singles that would get them on the cover of Melody Maker or on ""Top of the Pops"". Which is what The Joy of Sing-Sing delivers, more or less-- the pair's melodic turns are all pop, consistently sharp, and oddly fresh-sounding, and the structures of the arrangements are clever and sophisticated enough to spend a decent amount of time picking through. Making a great big shiny pop/rock record: sometimes it seems like everyone is trying to do it, and sometimes it seems like everyone is too much of a wimp to try. Right now seems a little like the latter-- so the fact that this album occasionally sounds like it's competing with 1995 Britpop flashes like Echobelly and Sleeper seems more like adorable charm than grounds for dismissal. If Starsailor and Coldplay are what popular British indie bands have come to, a little nostalgia isn't out of order, and Sing-Sing, Black Box Recorder, and the still-brilliant Pulp can be forgiven a whole lot. Granted, if you're one for history, you could find it a useless little anachronism. But even if it turns out to be an incredibly useless thing, it would be churlish to pretend that it's not the best little useless thing it can possibly be. Sing-Sing have made a sharp, simple record that will change absolutely nothing.","If you're anything like me, you're charming and remarkably virile and have fond memories of a time when ...

Plus, you can only really take so much Bonds or hash before you lose your mind. No. 2, a three-man outfit led by former Heatmiser co-songwriter Neil Gust, is a completely different kind of solid. Whereas hash goes up in smoke, and steroids go up in Bonds' ass, there's nothing deceitful about No. 2. Though hardly staggering, their results are always rock-solid and don't require moderation on the listener's part. But therein lies the positive and the negative, wrapped up like yin and yang-- or, better yet, like Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton in Monster's Ball, except not nearly as sexy or fucked up (respectively, of course). What Does Good Luck Bring? exhibits sound songwriting, as one should expect from Gust. His significant contributions to Heatmiser were overshadowed by the later success of his former bandmate, Elliott Smith; their excellent swan song, 1996's Mic City Sons, was as much Gust's child as Smith's. And when Gust released his impressive debut, No Memory, with No. 2 in 1999, his talent was proven. That record was in many ways a continuation of the pop/rock that Heatmiser had perfected, and it never came close to receiving the attention it deserved. Smith, as we all know, went on to become a media darling with his Oscar-nominated contributions to the Good Will Hunting soundtrack. Now he's back to fighting obscurity, where Gust has been all along. Fortunately, though, What Does Good Luck Bring? isn't the sound of a talented songwriter trying to prove himself. No. 2 effortlessly crank out 36 minutes of rock, though with slightly less pop than their earlier work. Frank Black's first couple albums with The Catholics come to mind. These songs are crisp and clean, but they have the live feel of a band that has toured relentlessly (as No. 2 have). ""What, then, is the negative?"" you ask. Simply put, No. 2 lack adventurousness. Gust knows the formula and he'll be damned if he's going to mess with it. This results in plenty of head-bobbers, with the band opening (as Heatmiser often did) with poppy licks and then moving on through that good old rock-song structure. The lyrics are equally inoffensive. ""I don't mind a little confusion/ I don't mind, throw it all away,"" Gust sings in the opener, ""A Little Confusion"". He's pretty much cool with whatever-- a mentality he duly passes on to the listener. Not that What Does Good Luck Bring? is devoid of any variation. The pop factor is still evident in many spots, from the handclaps in ""More, More"" to the cowbell in ""Good Intentions"". ""8:45 a.m."", meanwhile, offers up a downright countrified beat. And there are several slow, wistful moments, such as the atmospheric folk-pop of ""Stranger's March""-- which recalls Smith's DreamWorks output-- and the closing title track, which pairs Gust with another former Heatmiser bandmate, Sam Coomes of Quasi. In the end, though, a little something is missing. Maybe it's that Gust has ridden the same horse one too many times. Maybe he's just lost a half-step. Whatever the reason, one can't help but listen to What Does Good Luck Bring? and to Smith's last album, 2000's Figure 8, and wish that maybe, somehow, these two would team up again to spark their creative fires.","What do the following have in common?

Fugues & Flowers,Gold Sparkle Band,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf5913d197565213b893/1:1/w_160/3ddf6934.jpg,2002-11-03 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3499-fugues-flowers/,Squealer,"The Gold Sparkle Band originally hails from Atlanta, and relocated (for the most part) to New York at the end of the last century. By the sound of Fugues & Flowers, though, they're pure Ft Worth, Texas. That is, their Southern roots shine most obviously in the band's similarity to Texan Ornette Coleman's early 60s quartet with Don Cherry, Billy Higgins and Charlie Haden. And instrumentation isn't the only common trait the two bands share-- a freewheeling mixture of haphazard heads, breakneck group interplay, and occasional lapses into inner-space are major bullet points for both. It's a relief that these guys weren't satisfied with the superficial bonds, though, because they go even further into homage by playing music that is never less than viscerally engaging (even when they lead us on wild goose chases). Another notable connection for the Gold Sparkle Band is bassist William Parker, with whom sax/clarinetist Charles Waters, trumpeter Roger Ruzow and amazing drummer Andrew Barker have performed. This is an important connection because like Parker, this group forgoes the typically eclectic New York City avant-garde sound for a more traditionally ""free"" jazz style. This is not to say they play straight-ahead (and their raucous, epic pieces are as boisterous as any experimental klezmer band you'd care to name), but they're firmly part of a lineage including Coleman, Albert Ayler, Cecil Taylor and their heirs. Fugues & Flowers, the band's fourth release, documents several shows from late 2000. The opener ""Zodiac Attack"" is the most rhythmically straightforward on the album, as Barker and bassist Adam Roberts lay down a deft Latin-influenced groove over which the horns offer a typically flighty Ornette tribute (and come dangerously close to sounding like fellow Coleman admirers, John Zorn's Masada). It doesn't take long for the fireworks to start, as Waters' solo begins restless but restrained, and explodes into skronk-fury. After a brief solo entrance by Ruzow, both horns join in with Barker for more hi-energy interaction. The Gold Sparkle Band are most often at their best when they droop the solo/head/solo structure and simply all dive in at once. The last solo here belongs to Barker, and even those of you that hate the idea of a long drum solo should dig this one. (He's a monster and then some.) ""Motor City Fugue"" begins with a somber trumpet/clarinet exposition, but the bottom falls out soon enough. Of course, the idea of a jazz fugue isn't new; this group's subjects, answers and various interweaving lines, however, usually seem closer to vaguely related ideas than formally connected passages. As extended group improvisation goes, the band has a knack for keeping brainstorms in the ballpark of outsider comprehension. Waters' clarinet soliloquy about five minutes in is reason enough to stay alert, but Barker's return near the end (amazingly, his strokes suffered no ill-effects after twenty minutes playing behind the band) is as much a feat of endurance as it is musical statement. So, the Gold Sparkle Band's next move should be interesting: do they continue refining the sound of still vibrant post-ESP jazz, or declare intentions fully their own? Moments here suggest that the latter isn't out of the question.","The Gold Sparkle Band originally hails from Atlanta, and relocated (for the most part) to New York at the end ...

The Natural Riot,Shimmer Kids Underpop Association,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3cc5e6ef95969320707/1:1/w_160/d72671a0.gif,2002-11-03 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7109-the-natural-riot/,ParasolHidden Agenda,"With the demise of Elephant 6 recently made official, it's safe to say that psychedelic pop is on its way back underground. On the great up/down genre superhighway, psych-pop seems to be tunneling deeper beneath the earth's crust, waving at metal, punk-funk, and synth-pop as they zoom past in the opposite direction. Fans of the form shouldn't fret; in roughly 12-15 years, the paisley sound of the mid-to-late sixties should be due for another resurgence. In the meantime, you'll just have to settle for quieter media attention, smaller shows, and bands with more letters in their name than fans. Like, for instance, the Shimmer Kids Underpop Association, a Bay Area project with all the markings of vintage E6 material. In the Last Will and Testament of Olivia Tremor Control, the Shimmer Kids must've been bequeathed that band's recording equipment, as the Shimmer Kids' eight-track recordings at ""The Church of the Amplifier"" (aka the singer's bedroom) replicate the sun-bleached lo-fi sound of OTC. And with artwork inspired by Marvel Comics legend Jack Kirby, a Philip K. Dick quote in the liner notes, and a musical sensibility ignoring anything post-Beach Boys, the Kids appear to share a historical interest with Doss & Hart as well. Which means The Natural Riot doesn't exactly sound like the freshest produce at the Farmer's Market, but at least they earn high marks for competence. Singer Josh Babcock's pinched voice floats over a muddy mix of your standard guitar/bass/drums while theremins, sloppy brass, gypsy strings, keyboards, and instruments unknown all make appearances. ""Matadors in Red"" benefits from a darker tint to its piano foundation; ""The Getaway"" is endearingly warbled like early Scat-era Guided by Voices; the jalopy horn section of ""Like Candy, Like Poison"" lends a crooked oldies feel. It's no accident, though, that all these highlights come early in the album-- The Natural Riot tapers as it progresses, becoming increasingly lost in its own fuzziness. One thing the Shimmer Kids didn't inherit from Olivia Tremor Control, though, is the predilection for obtuse found-sound collage, making the album an easier listen, if not nearly as unique. The lyrical preciousness of ""Baby Bankrobber"", the Brian Wilson harmonies of ""Another Planet"", the Latin spicing of ""Se Acabo, Le Fiesta""-- all fail to achieve more than subtle adjustments to a fairly uniform pace and sound. Decent as The Natural Riot is, the Shimmer Kids Underpop Association can be faulted more for bad timing than for making a bad album. Five years ago (or twenty years from now), this record might've been something special in the middle of widespread zeal for the psych-pop format. Now it just sounds a bit too familiar to stand out. Underground music is in continual mutation-- unhipness tends to filter out the Johnny-come-latelys and forces the die-hards to craft ever more inventive, tight sounds to survive. The Shimmer Kids may continue to honorably wave the flag for psychedelia to a reduced audience, but they also illustrate that the sound is a ways off from resurrection.","With the demise of Elephant 6 recently made official, it's safe to say that psychedelic pop is on its ...

You Were a Diamond,Clem Snide,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5ef13d197565213908d/1:1/w_160/97aaf36e.jpg,2002-11-03 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1497-you-were-a-diamond/,Tractor BeamTractor Beam,"When I first checked out Clem Snide, it was on the recommendations of a gig flier from a favorite, underrecorded Boston band, the Pee Wee Fist. Fist leader Pete Fitzpatrick had a longtime friendship with the band-- he's now their full-time guitarist-- and listening to their debut, You Were a Diamond, it was easy to hear the similarities. Stylistically, both bands remained just outside any standard indie rock and alt-country conventions. Their leaders wrote and sung with deep but matter-of-fact expressiveness, cut with clever wordplay and imagery and just enough humor. And there was the use of non-rock instruments to make their sound more intriguing: in Clem Snide it was Jason Glasser on cello, whose playing here-- which can sound whisperingly soft, sandpaper rough or decorously smooth-- is a striking complement to Eef Barzelay's raspy, harsh singing. You Were a Diamond-- just reissued by spinART, with two bonus tracks-- is starker and coarser than anything else the band has done, with less of the irony and pop culture references that Barzelay now employs in his writing. Their songs also have darker, almost folky arrangements that are effectively atmospheric. At times, the album's as sad as watching an old woman drive alone to a cemetery. Barzelay emotes himself hoarse on ""Uglier Than You"", one of his most harrowing songs; and on ""Row"", he aches his way through the lyrics as Glasser and guest saw player Sue Weston bend and whisper as cooly as wind through a pile of leaves. Here, the band-- and Glasser in particular-- are grim colorists, playing more loosely and spontaneously than on their later, more polished records. Other songs are hopeful, and even blissful: for example, the convincingly crooned take on Hank Williams' ""Lost on the River"", with Pete Fitzpatrick soloing on banjo. And just when you were sick to death of songs about driving the highways late into the night, ""I Can't Stay Here Tonight"" captures the mood perfectly, with Barzelay's weary vocals nicely balanced by the light use of bells between the verses. But best of all is ""Nick Drake Tape"", written around memories of listening to mixtapes and being with a troubled girlfriend. Barzelay is gifted at indulging in sentiment while cutting straight through it, and on this track, he puts a beautiful tune and some of his most vulnerable singing together with increasingly dark verses. Glasser's gently scraped bowing in the outro is a perfect close. You Were a Diamond includes one of Clem Snide's first singles, the waltz ""Your Night to Shine"", and even a bonus video of the song. (The visuals aren't too exciting, but Barzelay looks just like a sullen Buddy Holly.) This song is closer to the later Snide: with the addition of a full-time drummer on their next album, the band began to make catchier and livelier music-- their latest album, The Ghost of Fashion, even has a horn section. Of the three records, Your Favorite Music may be their best, but this debut is a close second: it's a beautiful and gently melancholy album that crawls under your skin, and this is a welcome re-release.","When I first checked out Clem Snide, it was on the recommendations of a gig flier from a favorite, underrecorded ...

Irreversible,Thomas Bangalter,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2075e6ef9596932030e/1:1/w_160/92d30f81.gif,2002-11-01 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/542-irreversible/,Roul√®,"So Halloween's over and everyone, in one way or another, is hung over. Elderly women call the cops and complain about smashed pumpkins. Middle-school teachers arise thirty minutes early to pull down the countless strands of toilet paper draped over their thinning trees. And kids return to school with bellyaches-- not from those Snickers bars the night before, but from those Snickers bars this morning. I guess, then, that it's too late for Thomas Bangalter's soundtrack to the controversial French film Irreversible. As half of French duo Daft Punk, Bangalter might have seemed a good candidate to compose that perfect post-Halloween mix, with enough funky breaks to ease your pain and help you look ahead to Friday night. Not so. Instead, this here is the perfect Fright Night soundtrack. Screw those silly Hannibal masks; Irreversible can be downright scary. And Bangalter doesn't even ease you into the darkness. The title track opens with that horror flick standard: two kickdrum beats, then a single, echoed snare beat. Add to that a shrill pitch and deep organ chords, and you've got yourself an ideal score to a late-70s slasher flick. This plodding pace continues for more than six minutes with little variation. The masked killer just keeps stalking you, taking his sweet-ass time walking down the shadowy hallway, and all you can do is look back, stumble, and fall flat on your face. But what's even scarier about this and subsequent tracks is that Gaspar N√≥e's Irreversible isn't a horror movie-- at least not by genre. Told anachronistically, a la Memento, the film traces the origins of a violent opening scene. When it was shown at this year's Cannes Film Festival, 250 people walked out and 20 people needed oxygen after fainting, according to NME. The reason? Part of it, I would imagine, had to do with the nine-minute rape scene. Not exactly the best inspiration for another celebration like ""One More Time"", is it? At least now you know. This isn't daft, and it sure as hell isn't punk. It's a downbeat soundtrack made more frightening by the fact that, during one or more of these songs, someone is being brutally raped. Is it during the swirling air-raid siren that drowns in and out of the warped ""Rectum""? (Let's hope not!) Perhaps during ""Stress"", with its drab bass thud, hyperactive electro-harpsichord and (more) ominous organ chords. Or maybe it's as the beat picks up on ""Outrage"", and Bangalter swirls wavering electric fuzz around your head. But there are uplifting moments, too, even if Irreversible is largely devoid of the ecstatic rave-ups for which Daft Punk is known. The hi-hat, thumping bass and ceaseless ringing in ""Outrun"" will sound familiar to fans of the band's 1996 debut Homework. So, too, will the funky guitar toyed with on ""Extra Dry"", or the distorted vocals on the house-driven ""Ventura/Into the Tunnel"", during which Bangalter regularly submerges the sound 20 feet below water, then allows it to resurface. Only with ""Spinal Scratch"" does Bangalter approach the better aspects of Daft Punk's sophomore effort, last year's Discovery. The one truly fresh, inventive song here, it revolves around relentlessly tweaked guitar notes (or so they seem) with the occasional all-out breakdown. Like the best of Daft Punk, it's hard to summarize through its musical components; suffice to say, it grabs you and moves your every cell. And yet, like every Bangalter number here-- there are also Beethoven and Mahler excerpts, plus an unbearable French pop song-- ""Spinal Scratch"" is far too repetitive. Daft Punk has always been fond of looping, but they also mix it up enough that most tracks are engaging from beginning to end. Here, you get what you'd expect from a film score-- a lot of mood music with minimal song structure-- and as such, nothing on Irreversible is too arm-raising, except for when it scares the shit out of you. It would have come in handy last night, but I suppose there's always next year.",,6.0,
Close Cover Before Striking EP,Luna,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd9beb335119a49eceee/1:1/w_160/b61faf0c.gif,2002-10-31 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4918-close-cover-before-striking-ep/,Jetset,"A quick guide to Rob Mitchum's favorite rock-show heckles: Shouting out the name of a completely different band than the one that's playing, preferably one that's close enough to seem like an honest error (i.e. yelling out ""SIGUR ROS!!!"" at a Mum show). Shouting ""Blueshammer!"" at a band whose riffage is getting a little too chug-a-lug (director's commentary: Blueshammer being the frat-boy blooze act from Ghost World). The all-purpose cry of ""FILLER!"" when a band busts out one of the omnipresent lesser tracks from its newest release. Some bands, however, make the wise choice of leaving the filler off the LP and choose instead to segregate it onto a collectible EP-- you know, for fans. That's the path Luna's taken with Close Cover Before Striking, a companion piece to their album Romantica from earlier in the '02. All the usual suspects are here: outtakes from the original sessions, covers, an instrumental, enhanced video files. Funny thing, though: it ain't half bad! For one, thirty minutes and seven songs of Luna seems just about right these days, when they've settled into a stable but enjoyable holding pattern of midtempo guitar rock. For two, because it kicks off with ""Astronaut"", which pits Indian-war-cry effects guitar against Wareham's patented deadpan delivery, mixing in some peppy drums to keep the affair from getting too sleepy. It all leaves you reveling in just how good that Luna formula can still sound. After the peak of ""Astronaut"" it's all downhill, though more of a pleasant log roll down a slow incline than a jump off a cliff. While Romantica oozed springy sunshine and baseball matinees (as described by the very talented writer of our site's exceptional review), Close Cover seems to collect the darker material from those sessions-- and just in time for the Fall months. Less lovey-dovey stuff and less ""oodles and oodles,"" the whimsy of Wareham's lyrics has a more devilish slant, be it evoking images of ""tiny nightmares in the sky"" or telling you that he wants to ""feed you Diazepam."" But maybe it's just the plunging mercury getting me down, as most tracks here still have that same airy Luna quality to keep them miles away from dismalness. A little too much of that breeziness, perhaps, as ""Teenage Lightning"", ""The Alibi"", and ""New Haven Comet"" drift by without leaving much of a trail, warm, barely remembered dreams. ""Drunken Whistler"", the obligatory sans-vocal outtake, even seems a little half-finished, only saved by a keyboard preset drumloop that keeps coming and going like an evening mosquito. As for the covers, the Rolling Stones' ""Waiting on a Friend"" isn't much of a stretch for the band, coming as it does from the poppier side of the Jagger/Richards catalog. Other than Wareham's tremulous voice converting the main character ""watching girls passing by"" from sleazy to shy, it's a straight reading, right down to the shimmer guitars. Taking on ""Neon Lights"" is a more intriguing choice, given that Kraftwerk and Luna are two bands rarely thought to be in the same ballpark, or nation, or continent. But it's a little bit disappointing to hear just how completely the group envelops the computer spasms of the original with their own sound, leaving us with another Luna-ish song rather than a scary mutant hybrid of the two bands. But these are all minor quibbles; as leftovers, Close Cover Before Striking is more akin to day-old pizza than three-week-old pasta. As a supplemental EP, it holds more potential for repeated listening than for under-bed dust-collecting, and continues the gratifying solid streak Luna's been on of late. So, Dean, next time you're playing DC and you hear some asshole yelling ""Galaxie 500!!!"" at you from the crowd, know that I'm just giving you a playful heckle. What do you expect if you don't give me much to yell ""FILLER!"" about?","A quick guide to Rob Mitchum's favorite rock-show heckles:

But that's just the intro: it suddenly drops off and you're hit by a screeching, high-end rock assault. A pounding rhythm section bursts in, followed by bare-chested, doped-up rock-god vocals, and more than anything, guitars-- lots of them, grinding, screeching, scratching, and wrung through effects and oscillation. And for the whole rest of the album, that's all you get. But isn't that enough? The craziest astro-named band since Uranus & The Five Moons, Comets on Fire plays noise/psychedelic/space-rock. You'll hear many familiar sounds and riffs, but the band jumbles them up and cranks them so high they sound fresh again; and they also have a kind of trademark in their excessive use of Echoplex, a delay and echo device that dates back to the early days of rock. It's the main job of one guy, Noel Harmonson, just to work the Echoplex and oscillations through which the Comets run the guitars and the vocals. This makes a sound that's not unlike being screamed at through a fifty-foot cardboard tube. Field Recordings is their second album, after a self-titled limited edition debut that got attention for its fierce cover of ""Back in the U.S.S.R."" This follow-up is just as nasty but much more involved: where the debut was sharp, terse and loud as fuck, Field Recordings is sprawling, massive, and loud as fuck. There are four guys in the band: Harmonson, guitarist and singer Ethan Miller, the awesomely named Utrillo Belcher (his business cards actually read ""Potsie U. Belcher"") on drums, and Ben Flashman on bass-- and they're joined by over half a dozen guests. Ben Chasny of Six Organs of Admittance and the Fucking Champs' Tim Green (who also produced the album) guest on guitar, and on ""Beneath the Iceage"", there's a handful of people who just drink, chant and shake stuff. Chasny also writes one of the songs: ""The Unicorn"", much as Shel Silverstein did for the Irish Rovers. This, the album's shortest and only quiet tune starts as a folky acoustic ballad until it's crept up on by a bunch of overdubbed electrics. (The liner notes call them ""electric floating guitar"", ""electric destruction guitar""... hell, I don't even need my thesaurus to write this review.) Picture finding a grove full of hobbits and smashing them all with a hammer. But this is just an intermission compared to the other songs. Lean even at six-to-ten minutes each, the tracks are carefully arranged pieces coated with mess. The spontaneity of the playing belies the deliberate transitions, like the jerky end of ""ESP"" or the controlled breakdown into electric splatter on ""Black Poodle"". The guitars and electronics that scribble out the end of that track spill through a suburban guitar shop's worth of excessive gadgetry: this is definitely one of album's high points. You won't hum these tracks on your way to work, and who knows what the lyrics are-- never mind if they're any good. However, next time, Comets on Fire could bring in more variety. They might even turn down the volume a couple more times, you know, for artistic effect. Still, as a pure assault, this album's terrifically brutal and single-minded: with far better distribution than their debut, it'll be most people's introduction to the band, and it makes an awesome first impression.","Field Recordings from the Sun starts off like the next drum circle over from the No-Neck Blues Band-- congas, singing ...

Western Keys frontman Ben Dickey is also a heart-barfing amalgam of influences and mimicry (Oberst, Brock, and every other titan) whose looming maturity promises a masterpiece. Anderson's recent relationship-centric film Punch Drunk Love manages to be overwrought as it underreaches, but it also offers a zesty acknowledgement of the mysteries we are to ourselves. Dickey's new relationship-centric Damage EP also under-overs, but the project is in sore need of mystery. Hailing from Austin, Texas, where the self-mythologizing scene was supposed to be bifurcated into the dusty middle-aged singer/songwriter in a button-up shirt camp and the Roky Erickson/Daniel Johnston amenable-nutjob/aberration-prodigy camp, Western Keys is an exciting proposition, the rare nephew of Uncle Tupelo that propels rather than deflates. The four-piece band's debut throws down a warm, seven-track country-then-rock-then-punk-then-pop sampler, a gourmet smorgasbord crammed into a kindergarten snack pack. Homesick keyboards lead into humbly exquisite brush drums. Meandering steel guitars give way to slaughterhouse indie-rock solos (this whisper/kaboom tactic makes ""Driver Denies"" one of the top sneak-up-on-you jams of the season). Think heavy-pastoral. Think rock-out-with-your-flock-out. But hell, who are these people? Are they R.E.M. getting carjacked by Yo La Tengo outside of a That Dog yard sale (""Become You"")? Are they the keepers of the Desaparecidos' missing track (""Please Rock"")? Are they Appendix Out's warbly asses premeditating their quivers-n-mumbles-n-wails, but grounded in love-doom (""Free"")? Are they a dumber, pre-pubescent Jonathan Richman crooning about how ""all my friends/ And my best friend/ Sleeps with all my fucking girlfriends,"" as if the line were a comedically earnest epic message of global insight (""Laughter"")? Or is this just Pinkerton-era Weezer and pouty Matt Pond PA teaming up in a suburban basement? Tread patiently: Dickey's voice is initially unforgivable on the leadoff track, so torture-posed and nasal that Drainage seemed like a better title, and the shimmer/crunch production suggested that the dread genre of emo-fi was being born. Very soon, though, Dickey gets to yellin' and the band gets to shining-- not that they entirely shed their sense of preciousness. One could argue that Damage is juvenile and microcosmic in the best way, but these folks could use some more expansive lyrics to avoid seeming mired in prolonged adolescence. ""I don't love you anymore"" this and ""it's over"" that, Western Keys could apply its impressively shrugged-off harmonies to more than emotional dandruff. Dickey's band perpetuates the conundrum of the Americana: does that word connote music that is vast/universal or solipsistic/self-interested? Probably both, if that genre includes both Bob Dylan and Ryan Adams. Let's hope Western Keys evolves beyond their awkward Kirk Cameron stage fast, because they might be onto something big.","I'm sending you a parallel-ogram: Filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson is a heart-barfing amalgam of influences and mimicry (Scorsese, Cassavetes ...

In tonight's installment, Professor Grubbs will attempt to stretch the formula that carried 2000's worthwhile The Spectrum Between one step further, by adding glitchy electronics to his trademark flashy acoustic guitar stylings and alternately whimsical and impenetrable lyrics. For Rickets & Scurvy, Grubbs has enlisted quite a number of insanely talented individuals-- drummer John McEntire, who chews up polyrhythms like they were Polly-O string cheese, undisputed lord and master of exotic punctuation and jazz guitar No√´l Akchot√©, veteran producer and charming Frenchman Nicolas Vernhes, and the much-lauded electronic duo Matmos. Whether you rock out Hanukkah-style to the Silver Jews' American Water or regularly pretend not to be at all disappointed with Bj√∂rk's Vespertine, odds are somebody who plays on this album has had a hand in another album that you love very, very deeply. If not, that's still going to be the case after a run through Rickets & Scurvy. See, The Spectrum Between not only had a core of melody, structure, and intimacy supporting its more adventurous elements, but its flourishes of drums, horns, and electric guitars meshed seamlessly with Grubbs' songwriting. Rickets & Scurvy, however, suffers from a double-dose of disappointment-- the songs themselves aren't nearly as compelling as those on The Spectrum Between, and the nonessential elements of the songs seem... well, even less essential. Which is not, by any means, to say that Rickets & Scurvy is bereft of value. As far as it may stray from the focused and intimate nucleus of The Spectrum Between, this disc is still anchored by Grubbs' unique talents as a guitarist and lyricist. Within the first minute of ""Transom"", with its complex plucked guitar figures and casually delivered, noun-intensive lyrics, Grubbs has worked his way comfortably into his own stylistic niche. Yet, although the record is marked by the presence of a slew of known innovators (Grubbs himself included), it never really pushes any envelopes, opting instead to simply add more layers to the formulae that Grubbs has utilized in previous outings. He flirts with heavier sounds (""Pinned to the Spot"") and has two electronic interludes provided by Matmos, but the musical core never sees any kind of renovation that isn't strictly aesthetic. This wouldn't even be such a problem if the songs on Rickets & Scurvy were as strong as they were on The Spectrum Between, but the quality of the vocal melodies and the guitar work here just isn't up to par. Grubbs explored the more epic, meandering and experimental side of his songwriting on the banjo-centric The Thicket, and then focused in on melody and simplicity for The Spectrum Between. On both of those records, the bells and whistles provided by guest musicians engaged and enhanced Grubbs' songwriting. Here, they do nothing to deeply flesh out the songs, and Grubbs' intricately plucked guitar lines and laidback vocal delivery just aren't constructed as elegantly as they have been on previous outings. This record is absolutely overflowing with talent-- but without songs strong enough to support the gifted roster, Rickets & Scurvy never manages to rise above ""decent"".","Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to another episode of ""When Folk Meets Academia""!

That's My Beat,Mantronix,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3a2eb335119a49ed767/1:1/w_160/feebbf71.jpg,2002-10-29 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5094-thats-my-beat/,Soul Jazz,"The 80s have been back in force for some time. Film, television and publishing have been dabbling in nostalgia for the Reagan years (and of course, there's Grand Theft Auto: Vice City), but as is often the case, the music of the era is receiving the most exhaustive re-examination. A slew of books in the last year or so (Our Band Could Be Your Life, Fargo Rock City, From Joy Division to New Order: The True Story of Anthony H. Wilson and Factory Records, to name just a few) have approached the 80s from a number of different angles, and the recent spike in interest in post-punk, metal, synth-pop and electro all speak to the period's resurgence. The musical decade that was widely considered hopelessly uncool six or seven years ago today provides both musicians and listeners with a deep well of inspiration. Now comes London's venerable Soul Jazz label with this timely compilation, selected by pioneering producer Kurtis Mantronik, to show what the early 80s were like from the perspective of New York's club scene. I finally read the fantastic book Last Night a DJ Saved My Life a couple months ago, and it provided me a nice background with which to approach this compilation. According to the liner notes for That's My Beat, Kurtis Mantronik was a regular at David Mancuso's Loft, hung with Larry Levan at the Paradise Garage, and could be seen at Bronx parties with the likes of Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash. If this is true, Mantronik was at ground zero for three different music genres (disco, house and hip-hop), so he would seem uniquely qualified to select early 80s club tracks. And he delivers, for the most part, delivering the ""old skool hip-hop, electro and disco"" promised on the record's cover. That's My Beat really is fun, funky and educational from start to finish. As is to be expected, the older rap material is the iffiest stuff here. The singsong Sugarhill style is difficult to listen to now, as rhyming has grown increasingly sophisticated with each passing year. Jimmy Spicer's ""Super Rhymes"" is the worst offender in this regard, coming across as little more than another post-""Rapper's Delight"" bandwagon hop (it's got Chic's ""Good Times"" beat). Almost compensating is Funky 4 Plus 1's ""That's the Joint"", the tune that provided sample inspiration for the Dust Brothers on Paul's Boutique (it has both the ""it's the joint"" from ""Shake Your Rump"" and ""ain't you very proud to be an MC"" from ""Shadrach"") and formed the template for the Jurassic 5, for good or ill. The nine-minute playing time is something of a problem, as it was for so many singles early in the twelve-inch era, but the sunny mood and energy of the track make it enjoyable even at that length. The electro side of the equation is covered nicely by Yellow Magic Orchestra's undeniably great instrumental ""Computer Games"", which mixes vintage Atari bleeps with a killer beat and Eastern melodies. Art of Noise's ""Beatbox"" is a bit more dated (the lumbering, gated drum sound is from Phil Collins' production manual), but the sample-heavy structure packs one great hook after another. And the sleek, streamlined electro-beat of Visage's ""Pleasure Boys"" is the stuff of break record dreams. For my money, the lesser-known disco cuts are the most surprising and enjoyable tracks here. The bass propulsion, powerful vocal, and terrifically lascivious lyrics of Suzy Q's ""Get on Up and Do It Again"" mark it as dancefloor anthem to be reckoned with, and Machine's ""There But for the Grace of God"", a punchy, melodramatic tune that could have been a roller-rink smash, is a classic example of disco as it moved away from studio sophistication toward a more synthetic sound. The compilation is a success, even though you'll find yourself grinning a little at the goofiness occasionally. Next time you find yourself wondering why Sasha Frere-Jones continues to jabber on about how great early-80s New York was, put on That's My Beat.","The 80s have been back in force for some time.

This Night,Destroyer,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b970ea9e61561daa6fb3/1:1/w_160/b7207829.jpg,2002-10-29 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2291-this-night/,Merge,"Destroyer's one constant member, singer/songwriter (and ex-New Pornographer) Daniel Bejar, has steadily improved on the electro-acoustic folk of his 1996 debut We'll Build Them a Golden Bridge, culminating in the nearly flawless, off-kilter pop of last year's Streethawk: A Seduction. On that album, Bejar found a perfect balance between tight acoustic guitars and looser electric rock, and none of it sounded the least bit deliberate or sloppy. Streethawk, in other words, is everything that This Night is not. Whereas Streethawk whipped out twelve songs in forty-four minutes, This Night draws fifteen songs out along an interminable sixty-eight minutes. Do the math. Most of the songs here are overlong, messy things. Streethawk may have been unpredictable, but it also felt as though Bejar carefully considered every move. This Night, on the other hand, feels entirely haphazard without purpose. The title track that opens the album is no exception. Several uncoordinated guitars try to find each other's rhythm, then one takes over for some of the laziest strumming you've ever heard. Bejar enters with his adenoidal voice, not unlike Robyn Hitchcock's, as he sings, ""They led us on/ They said it would be yours/ Tear down the borders, stop patrolling the shores, let us in."" The lyrics are no surprise. Bejar has always been a bit enigmatic-- as often silly as he is poetic-- but his music always made up for the shortcomings of his odd voice and nonsensical lyrics. Here, he has no such bailout. The music is all confused and muddled, and largely devoid of any compelling artistry. And ""This Night"" is just the first of many songs that devolve into a jumbled, self-indulgent mess of electric guitars and exasperated yelping. ""Holly Going Lightly"" stumbles all over itself, with all kinds of masturbatory riffing and noodling that's enough to give anyone 70s flashbacks. Bejar, meanwhile, sings ""should know better"" ad nauseam, and all I can think is, ""Tell me about it."" The same goes for the nearly eight-minute ""Hey, Snow White"", yet another poor attempt at a longwinded rocker a la Neil Young & Crazy Horse. Oddly, though, even some of the shorter tracks here feel equally endless. All hope isn't entirely lost, though. ""Here Comes the Night"", with its melodica and chirpy background vocals, recalls some of the more whimsical side of earlier Destroyer. The crisp pop of ""Modern Painters"" would have fit nicely on Streethawk. And ""Goddess of Drought"", by far the best track here, consists of-- surprise!-- just Bejar and his acoustic guitar, with quirky lines like, ""I was looking good on the day that you fell for the way I looked."" In recording This Night, Bejar largely abandoned his Streethawk lineup, enlisting two members for guest spots only. The replacements are unwelcome, if only because of the final product, but I hate to blame anyone but Bejar himself. He reportedly left the familiar environs of Vancouver, British Columbia, and created This Night in the decidedly less tranquil city of Montr√©al. Let's just hope that when he grudgingly admits (on ""Trembling Peacock""), ""Vancouver made me, I guess it's true,"" that he hasn't sworn off his hometown altogether.","Destroyer's one constant member, singer/songwriter (and ex-New Pornographer) Daniel Bejar, has steadily\n\ improved on the electro-acoustic folk ...

August,The Standard,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a53c13d1975652138ecf/1:1/w_160/d923f966.jpg,2002-10-28 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7458-august/,Touch and Go,"Let's open with full disclosure: I once, albeit briefly and some time ago, subjected myself to nothing but emocore. Thus, in accordance with the Law of Recovering Emoists, I am instinctively skeptical of any lyrical mention of the months of the year. Actually, it makes me cringe. Invoking the calendar often reeks of sentimentality, and sentimentality is like strychnine: it's only ingestible in small doses. So you can understand my trepidation in appraising August, the sophomore effort from the Portland, Oregon-based five-piece The Standard. Add to this unfortunate album title the bleak, sepia-toned landscapes throughout the packaging and you've got yourself a reviewer who's forced to slap himself and say, ""Objectivity, dammit!"" before ever pushing the play button. At first, though, my suspicions were confirmed with the opener ""A Year of Seconds"". Over a plaintive acoustic guitar, Tim Putnam sings softly, ""I've been walking on pins and needles since you are not around/ I have been sweating like ice on fire because you are not here now."" But then The Standard changes their pitch up. A fuzzed-out keyboard barges in, accompanied by atmospheric whirring and stomping drums. And this was just a prelude. ""The Five-Factor Model"" goes straight to the keyboards, only this time they're beeping and ringing as though lifted from a 70s sci-fi flick. These notes become the undeniable hook when a jacked drumbeat kicks in, taking the song on a stop/start rush into post-punk territory. Later, blazing guitars soar together like I haven't heard since The Bends. Putnam's voice, meanwhile, is all jitters as he spits out blocks of words that, to my relief, don't make much sense at all. This alternation between slow, reflective tracks and unpredictable, bone-vibrating rock continues for the entirety of the album. If The Standard ever decide to hold an election on the matter, perhaps as a non-binding ballot question, then I'd like throw my support right now to the rock. I can't imagine it was lolling numbers like the piano-driven ballads ""Angelicate"" and ""The Quiet Bar"" that got them on tour with Wire and Clinic. Rather, I'd guess they were chosen for, say, ""Behind the Screens"", with its raw keyboards, tumbling drums and unexpected shifts. It's not that The Standard are terrible at the slow stuff. They're just a little, well, standard in that department. ""Paper"", for instance, skips along on a raining xylophone and brushed drums, clearly taking its cues from Tortoise and Gastr del Sol. ""Tree Line"" and ""Bells to the Boxer"", meanwhile, are pleasant, though not particularly noteworthy until, minutes into each, The Standard's slumbering electric guitars rip things wide open. The problem here is best exemplified by Putnam's voice. Simply put, his larynx is thrashed. It has been chewed up, spit out, and surgically reattached. So, unsurprisingly, it isn't well-suited for hushed singing. But what baffles me is this: If Putnam loves rocking out so much that he's willing to permanently damage his voice box, then why even bother with anything else? Next time, I say, go full tilt, and please, whatever you do, don't look back.","Let's open with full disclosure: I once, albeit briefly and some time ago, subjected myself to nothing but emocore ...

Eternal Youth,Future Bible Heroes,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be655e6ef95969323242/1:1/w_160/7143b785.jpg,2002-10-28 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3253-eternal-youth/,Instinct,"Have you seen this man? Stephen Merritt, I mean. He was last seen in an East Village dive bar, martini in one hand, rhyming dictionary in the other. Can't really blame him for keeping a low profile, though; after dropping an epic achievement like 69 Love Songs on the unsuspecting public, you'd take a break, too. While the Magnetic Fields have been recently plucked out of the draft by superlabel-in-the-making Nonesuch, Merritt's yet to release a follow-up under his highest-profile name, choosing instead to focus on scoring films, farewell live performances of 69, and writing a musical with stock accordionist and children's author Daniel Handler. Oh yeah, and also releasing another collaboration with Christopher Ewan under the sacrilicious nom de plume of Future Bible Heroes. Like the Heroes' last full-length, 1997's Memories of Love, Eternal Youth has Ewan electronically arranging songs co-written with Merritt, with vocals added by Magnetic Fields drummer/occasional singer Claudia Gonson. And also like its predecessor, Eternal Youth feels like more of a lackluster stopgap than equal-footing sidecar for Merritt's songcraft, a frustrating teaser from the Merritt portfolio of aliases. Part of the problem seems to lie with Ewan's arrangements, electro-pop that no doubt endears him to the equally 80s-fixated Merritt. While Merritt's electronic backings often sound like dancefloor anthems for the club inside his head, Ewan's slicker touch has the tendency to present the songs like actual club anthems, losing a lot of the intimacy of the Magnetic Fields' productions. Fair enough, but perhaps not the wisest of approaches given Merritt's flair for clever wordiness, Tin Pan Alley-style melodicism, and Gonson's voice. Gonson's occasional microphone duties on 69 Love Songs were a treat, as Merritt's songs tend to sound good delivered by the opposite gender. But as the sole vocalist on Eternal Youth (Merritt's Cash-ian baritone sits this one out), the pleasure of her slightly disinterested, sorta flat tone wears before long. Irony being dead and all (or so I'm told), the detached vocal is an endangered species, and Gonson's throws a warm blanket over the romantics of ""No River"", dampens space oddity ""Doris Day the Earth Stood Still"", and creates the wrong kind of bedroom voice on the smooth-operating ""A Thousand Lovers in a Day"". Merritt, meanwhile, remembers to bring his usual lyrical tricks (""I'd rather be a queen when the rooks take wing than be losing your affection,"" for instance), but seems to use a lot of his C-list melodies. For a Next Wave of Song-certified man known for penning instant-timeless melodies, it's disappointing to sit through stiffs like ""Find an Open Window"" or ""Kiss Me Only With Your Eyes"" that don't even come close to taking a spot on one's in-head playlist. ""I'm a Vampire"" is pristine danceable camp and ""From a Dying Star"" is a catchy/haunting continuation of the extraterrestrial theme, but on most of these tracks, Merritt sounds too much like he's phoning it in; ""The World is a Disco Ball"" could be a Magnetic Fields sendup on some forthcoming collection of indie rock interpretations by Weird Al (for which working titles would certainly include No Al-Ternative, My Bloody Alentine and Al's Tomorrow Parties). So the spotlight's on Ewan, who fills Eternal Youth with serviceably average synthetic-pop dioramas. The album is weighed down with sub-minute interlude filler, some of which (i.e. the almost-Timbaland-style skittery-strings of ""Viennese Lift"") are more interesting than the full-length backdrops, but which still kill what turtle-ish momentum the song cycle manages to establish. From the evidence presented on Eternal Youth, Ewan sounds mostly like the bad influence kid-next-door to Merritt, pushing him back from the slightly more organic sound of recent fare towards his (weaker) bleached-out keyboard symphony/guest vocalist early days. Maybe he's just taking some practice laps before turning on the Magnetic Field generator again, but regardless, non-completists are better off waiting for the real deal.","Have you seen this man?

Finisterre,Saint Etienne,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a33cc0084474cd0c0218/1:1/w_160/5b666ea6.jpg,2002-10-28 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6974-finisterre/,MantraBeggars,"1991: someone called it ""the year that punk broke"", but maybe the pun was intentional. ""Pivotal"", probably, but in a way that had as much to do with Cold as Ice as with Nevermind. And in London, Saint Etienne released their first self-penned single with Sarah Cracknell on it; it was called ""Nothing Can Stop Us"", and that was true. Bob Stanley has described what they were doing as ""ridiculously easy""-- here, just a paste-up collage of sprightly groove, pop vocal, fluttering reeds, and God's own harmonica-- and that ease was exactly the point: their grace was effortless, the equivalent of a thrift-store frock charming enough to make everyone else look idiotic. But who can keep that going? Forget knighthood: the fact that Saint Etienne's career had an upward trajectory from ""Nothing Can Stop Us"" is the sort of miracle the Vatican should be looking into. The sacred relic is 1994's Tiger Bay-- after which the game was up, temporarily, and Cracknell/Stanley/Wiggs retreated behind a pile of rarities, remixes, and singles collections, working out where to go. When they reemerged it was from Sweden, where they'd assembled a band and whipped together a swinging miniskirt pop collection equal parts Dusty Springfield and the Cardigans: this was Good Humour, about which one could mostly say, ""Good to have you back."" Next came collaboration with Sean O'Hagan and To Rococo Rot on The Sound of Water, the sort of record one's glad a band does but a bit worried they might keep doing. And now Finisterre, ""the end of the earth""-- a philosophical bid back toward the ridiculously easy. L'Etienne seem relaxed, carefree, unconcerned with direction, and Finisterre's singles are like watching a much-loved old dog chasing rabbits again. ""Action"", the first, layers a smoothed-out house throb with rushing acoustic guitar and Cracknell's most convincingly soaring vocal since ""He's on the Phone"". The other, ""Soft like Me"", is going to find trouble with American ears, given epidemic irrational fears about British people rapping (not to mention talk of ""touching the universe"" with ""feminine energy""), but I'm all for it-- guest rapper Wildflower has a subtle, MC Lyte sort of strength in her voice that sits well next to Cracknell's sunny choruses. Finisterre also finds a band known for their cut-and-paste raiding of pop's past pillaging their own career. ""Stop and Think It Over"" has Good Humour written all over it-- it's just the sort of soulful, piano-led crooner Burt Bacharach would have put together for Dionne Warwick. The instrumental ""Language Lab"" runs from English pastoral to Sean O'Hagan's sunnily orchestral territory, and ""Shower Scene""-- another side of ""Action""-- shows off the processing tracks picked up from the other end of The Sound of Water. The group's new kick is electro, a sound they're well suited to grapple with. ""New Thing"" is the big success on this front, pairing a grainy Italo-disco synth throb with a song that's still all Etienne; ""Amateur"", on the other hand, is a bit too reminiscent of the ""sure, but didn't you used to be brilliant?"" band of the past few years. The trick is that Saint Etienne records are in fact not all about style and sonics: like all great pop records, they're about the emotions we don't get to share, about perfectly articulating the passion of someone's everyday life. The big comeback on Finisterre's part is that they're tugging those strings again, confidently. The highlight is ""B92"", where a sly synthetic strut and determined hook load the ""music is our weapon"" trope into a triple-reference refrain: ""The boys are back in town/ And nothing can stop us now/ This is our wall of sound."" These moments are all over the record: in the plaintive chorus of ""Action"", in the clear-eyed momentum of ""Shower Scene"". If there's any criticism to be made it's only that the group doesn't let some tracks run free enough to back that up: ""Action"" and ""New Thing"" are just begging for the bigger kick drums that would turn them into flat-out stompers. We'll be waiting for the remixes. Finisterre closes with its title track, whose lilting chorus is a better summation than I can manage: ""Finisterre-- to tear it down, and start again."" Around it comes exactly what Saint Etienne are best at-- the soft-touch pop groove, the plush arrangement, and Cracknell talking, as ever, about details so local and personal they seem almost embarrassing to address on a record: ""There are too many bands that look lame, sound tame: I believe in Electrelane... I'm so bored with the myth of common sense. I believe in Donovan over Dylan, love over cynicism."" Saint Etienne have been ""back"" before, but this time-- this time it sounds like they're really back.","1991: someone called it ""the year that punk broke"", but maybe the pun was intentional.

Musique Automatique,Stereo Total,by: Christopher F. Schiel,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a55b13d1975652138f24/1:1/w_160/2faf5bd2.jpg,2002-10-28 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7490-musique-automatique/,BobsledBobsled,"When I was seven years old, I received a Casio keyboard from Santa Claus. You know the kind: 220 second-rate synth voices, several drum kits, and an auto rhythm section that could cover everything from ""piano waltz"" to ""hip-hop"" and back to ""slow rock."" Besides learning the theme to the Young and the Restless on that keyboard, one of my favorite elementary school pastimes was experimenting with the sound effects. Of course, I was seven, so I thought musical innovation consisted of playing ""London Bridge"" on the ""crickets"" setting. When fourth grade came around, I even entered a city-wide contest with an emotional improvised piece entitled ""Life Before Death"", which consisted of alarm sounds interspersed between melodramatic minor-key pipe organ lines backed by a three-piece jazz combo. Back in my day, it was all about the juxtaposition of disparate elements. But now in the age that disowns Casio (if you would consider Stephen Merritt the spokesperson for an age), synths and samplers are put to much more serious uses. Man, did you see that Linkin Park video where they're playing on that statue of Buddha? That synth player dude is seriously into it-- he moves like a madman! Can't cage him! Do you think he really puts that much emotion into all that button pressing? But I digress. Spinning on my stereo at the moment is Stereo Total's latest (that's ""tow-tall"" if you ever want to say it out loud), a band that bridges synth-pop with kitsch-rock and dangerously brings me back to my Casio days, as well as reminding me very much of Serge Gainsbourg. Musique Automatique, Total's fourth full-length, finds the half-French/half-German duo of FraxE7oise Cactus and Brezel G√∂ring ditching the premeditation and kicking out the trigger-happy sampling behind their deceivingly simplistic pop approach to songwriting. Lyrics on this record are sung in French, German, English, and Turkish, and love is their common focal point: love of the radio, love of robots, love of French highways, love of love, and so on. Total's arrangements are built around Cactus' infectious pop melodies, with accompaniment provided by guitars and live drums covered by synthesizer, pocketsampler, and drumatix (I'm guessing that's some kind of archaic drum machine). Musique Automatique opens with ""Automatic Music"", a bouncy number centering around a call-and-response between Cactus and G√∂ring that plays off the suffix ""-ique"": ""La musique/ Automatique/ La musique/ Nostalgique/ La musique/ Path√©tique/ La musique/ Chaotique."" The two verses of the song-- sung by G√∂ring about sound traveling through the soundsystem to the ears of the listener-- kick in with a folky guitar scale fill-in, defying the synth-pop of the rest of the track. But unlike my ""Life Before Death"" experiment, this juxtaposition is crazily successful. The second track, ""L'Amour \xC0 3"", is decidedly closer to radio-friendly pop, but doesn't drop the kitschy synth. The lyrics, again in French, sing about the love of three-way love (from bit translations in the liner notes): ""I know it's hippieshit/ But I say it loud/ With the three of us/ I love it."" ""Wir Tanzen im 4-Eck"", the first of the tracks in German, and also the first of five covers included, is built around Cactus' sampled vocals structured into an extremely infectious chant. ""Forever 16"", in English, is the first track dominated by live instrumentation with bleeps thrown in as ornaments, and it begs reference to the start/stop nature of ""BBC"" from the first Austin Powers flick. The sixteen tracks of Musique Automatique (including a Turkish reiteration of ""Forever 16"" and an English rendition of ""L'Amour \xC0 3"") keep with the exotic linguo-hopping and synth-bopping, and manages never to get tired or annoying. In fact, I thought that I could never have this much fun with synth-pop because of its stereotypic banality. But Stereo Total has made me learn to love, among other things, fun loving.","When I was seven years old, I received a Casio keyboard from Santa Claus. You\n\ know the kind: 220 ...

Nah, besides Folds, drummer Darren Jessee, and bassist Robert Sledge, there were two invisible members equally integral to the BFF sound: Folds' considerable ego, and his almost equally considerable songwriting talent. Argue if you must, but anyone who goes the eponymous route with his band, and then plays every single instrument on his solitary efforts, has got to be sporting heavy self-love. The famed ego is obviously at play here on the cheekily named Ben Folds Live, the take-home version of his truly solo man-vs-piano US jaunt from earlier this year. The question for prospective buyers, then, would be whether this ego trip obscures or potentiates the songcraft. It's a battle for Folds' rubber soul that sets the old seesaw of Good Idea/Bad Idea a-tippin' for the live album. Good Idea: Narcissism or no, the stripped-down nightclub setup of Ben/piano/audience makes for a live album that's more than just greatest hits + cheering. It's interesting to hear what tracks from the BFF catalog hold up sans rhythm section: ""Best Imitation of Myself"" defends its place near the top of the Folds fakebook, while ""The Last Polka"" manages to preserve all the marital meltdown urgency of the full-band workup. Bad Idea: Let us not forget the talents of Mssrs. Jessee and Sledge, however, who, despite not getting their name in the top billing, were pretty upstanding musicians and harmonists. Versions of ""One Angry Dwarf and 200 Hundred Solemn Faces"" or formerly string-soaked tracks ""Jane"" and ""Narcolepsy"" feel amputated without the originators. Good Idea: To fill the holes, Folds turns to some good old-fashioned audience participation, conducting his audience in recreating the spine-tingling fanfare bridge of ""Army"". The song wouldn't work without it. Sounds good, it's fun, Dr. Peppers all around. Bad Idea: Not so for the audience singalong ""aaaahhhhs"" on ""Not the Same"", a lobotomized chorus that brings to mind the brainwashed devotees on that creepy Dashboard Confessional Unplugged session. Good Idea: Peppering the setlist with obscurities, like the too-rare-for-the-rarity-comp oldie ""Silver Street"", the recent b-side ""One Down"", or the severely underrated ""Emaline"". Bad Idea: Leaving the rest heavy with songs from the ho-hum Rockin' the Suburbs. Sure, Benjamin's showing off his independence from his days with the Five, but songs like hyperglycemic United In-Flight Channel favorite ""The Luckiest"" don't hold up in the lineup next to the early material (enjoyable Jon Cougar Pianocamp snapshot ""Zak and Sara"" excepted). Also deduct points for the inclusion of ""Brick"", complete with pointless rehash banter about the song's inspiration. Anyone ever think about how Folds' high school girlfriend feels about being called a ""brick"" on Top 40 radio for post-abortion gloom? Good Idea: The cover of ""Tiny Dancer"" might seem unbelievably trite in these post-Almost Famous times, never mind Folds' perennial saddle as the new Elton Joel or Billy John. But I'll be damned if his straight-as-an-arrow reading of the greatest ode to Tony Danza ever written doesn't get me all gooey inside. Bad Idea: But does Folds get all his cover ideas from movies? The segue of ""Philosophy"" into Dick Dale's ""Miserlou"" is a bit pat, and as I over heard a necktie warrior at Bertucci's say last weekend, ""Quentin Tarantino is soooo five years ago, dude."" An even battle, but the scales are tipped towards the positive by the intact Folds sense of humor that gave BFF's live shows a, er, sixth member? Superfluous swearing, one of his half-impromptu, tongue-in-cheek concert ditties (""Rock This Bitch""), and a surprisingly on-pitch guest appearance by Cake singer John McCrea all provide entertaining moments. But clowning aside, it's the intimate setting, and the attention the stripped-down sound draws to the strength of Folds' melodies, that makes Ben Folds Live a document for more than just the fanclub. Better song selection might've pushed the rating higher, but a little bit of personality and restraint alongside the infamous ego makes the affair a bit easier to swallow.","The name Ben Folds Five was not, in fact, a goofy misnomer, despite the fact that the band numbered only ...

Yanqui U.X.O.,Godspeed You! Black Emperor,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf4cea9e61561daa7a31/1:1/w_160/a2766e8a.jpg,2002-10-27 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3487-yanqui-uxo/,Constellation,"You know what I miss? I miss political rock music. Probably it's out there and I'm looking in all the wrong places. But I know this: Indie rock, always one of the great dissenting voices of American (and British) underground media, has gone virtually silent. In the 1980s, this music was rife with anti-government sentiment, from Black Flag to The Minutemen to Gang of Four to The Dead Kennedys to Elvis Costello. But with the ushering in of ambivalent slacker-rock, political messages became pass√© and we grew steadily more tolerant of Washington's silent plots. Conspiracy theories soon became kitsch, and now, in the aftermath of X-Files geekdom and September 11th pacifism, there are few better ways to get hipster eyes rolling than by questioning authority. What perfect timing: We've lethargically accepted that Washington is brutally malevolent just as our most wicked administration yet has come to power. Yay, the most political rock band going right now is Canadian! Thanks, America. Granted, their message is pretty ham-fisted, what with those didactic, overbearing manifestos and ominous woodcuts of skull-faced forefathers chopping off peoples' hands. But Godspeed is at least putting forth some kind of an effort, which is more than can be said for most. I mean, I dig a lot of music, and songs about our girlfriends and our scenes and hating our parents are fine-- sometimes great, even transcendent. But when that's all there is, we have a problem. So, upfront, that's why I respect Godspeed You! Black Emperor. I just wish their approach was more effective. For one, they're an instrumental band whose political message is carried out through vague and overwrought packaging which merely hints at a greater ""something."" And their latest offering, Yanqui U.X.O., is vague as ever. We're told that ""09-15-00"", one of the album's song titles, ""is ariel sharon surrounded by 1,000 israeli soldiers marching on al-haram ash-sharif& provoking another intifada."" How? The music is simple atmospheric orchestration with no agenda of its own, and as easily reflects a DMV waitroom as Palestinian uprising. And on the back of the sleeve, we're treated to a six-degrees-of-bomb-makers, where Tomahawk cruise missile manufacturers Raytheon Industries are traced, through a twisted labyrinth of corporations to the recording industry's major labels. Briefly: Just because you have a friend who knows an auto mechanic who worked on a car owned by a guy who was the gaffer on the set of She's Having a Baby does not mean you know Kevin Bacon. Unfortunately, Yanqui's tenebrous finger-pointing isn't its only shortcoming. The band has taken its naysayers' gripes to heart and done away with those moody vocal snippets that not only hinted at deeper protest, but also jolted you awake just as your mind began to wander. And where the hell is the undercurrent? The two discs of 2000's Lift Your Skinny Fists used Godspeed's sweeping, emotional √ºbersuites as a basic centerpiece to the bizarre ambient textures and noise projects which backed them. Meanwhile, Yanqui U.X.O. strips the group to their essentials which, as it just so happens, are not quite essential enough. Ideas are scarce, too-- where Skinny Fists would erupt without warning into a scorching Satriani-esque solo (""Cancer Towers on Holy Road Hi-Way""), the tracks on Yanqui are content to continue building to bored, satiated endings we can see coming 20 minutes in advance. Couldn't we have some venting? Are we frustrated or just dramatic? Worse: The record is consumed by a painfully glacial pace. Each song plods endlessly onward toward an inevitable conclusion with no revelation in store for the poor listener, who can only endure these disc-filling five tracks in the hopes that, maybe, just maybe, that one glorious moment will arrive and redeem the interminable wait with a display of power so towering and majestic that it in itself will be a $12 experience. It doesn't. Once, at the end of ""Rockets Fall on Rocket Falls,"" the band comes close with a triumphant burst of cinematic melody and Efrim's wailing screwdriver'd guitar. The quarter-hour denouement that precedes it is a long road to travel, though, and with this record's production difficulties, you're slogging through the mud every step of the way. See, the importance of strong production on a record like this cannot be exaggerated, and I place much of the blame for Yanqui failure to impact on Steve Albini's shoulders. Last year, he turned Mogwai's similar-minded My Father, My King into a raging, five-headed superbeast with precision micing and mixing that brought the music's strongest elements to the fore, resulting in a speaker-rattling detonation of pristine strength. Yanqui is no recreation, or even approximation, of that tunneling force. Here, perhaps because of the number of instruments at hand, or maybe because of the insane over-reverbing, all of the instruments (save the ever-present martial drums) blend together into a kind of murky concordance, often making distinguishing the guitars from the violins an impossibility. What we're left with, then, is the skeleton of an incredibly original band whose once-driving conviction and determination has been sapped by sluggishness and a lack of invention. It doesn't help that they've spawned countless imitators and saturated the market with uniform side projects. Or that their radical politics, which could be such a defining attribute, are relegated to cardboard inserts. Or that they just keep doing the same thing over and over and over and over again, hoping for a different result. Someone tell Godspeed that orchestras play all kinds of music and that uprising can take other forms in music than apexes conveying abandonment, loss or apocalypse. Revolt, as I see it, is a beautiful thing, but not this beautiful.","You know what I miss? I miss political rock music. Probably it's out there and I'm looking in ...

Showroom Dummies,DACM,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8715e6ef959693211f4/1:1/w_160/f20e5f07.jpg,2002-10-24 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2126-showroom-dummies/,Mego,"Space is the predominant force behind Showroom Dummies, the latest solo offering from Mego labelhead Peter Rehberg, commonly known as Pita. The album opens with a repetitive string of bleeps punctuating a long chunk of silence. The second (none of the tracks have names) is a pulsating gob of low end and a high-pitched whirr, two loops slightly offset from one another that continue until the listener ceases to pay attention. Eventually, both sounds drop out, there's a minute or so of isolated clicks and echoing clangs-- and then more silence. The third track rides in on waves of Max/MSP-borne glory that enter distantly but soon make themselves much more obvious, lingering just long enough to produce an ominous vibe before fading back into nothingness, not unlike the behavior of a shoreline or Gilbert Gottfried. It would seem Showroom Dummies has as much to do with what isn't there as with what is. It's much subtler and more polite than any of Pita's previous releases, which is no doubt due to the nature of the recording: Showroom Dummies was commissioned by Grenoble avant-garde dance group DACM as a score to accompany their performance of the same name. I cannot claim familiarity with DACM's work, and what little information I've been able to dig up has been in the form of impossibly jumbled webpages ""translated"" by Google from French which say ridiculous things like, ""Forts of their will to create a place of meeting and exchange between artistic universes a priori isolated the ones from the others."" What I can tell you with reasonably certainty is that the performance involved a roomful of mannequins and six dancers posing all kinds of meaningful questions about the nature of perception and reality. But DACM's part in all of this seems largely irrelevant, since most of us will likely never see it. That said, the audio portion still makes for compelling listening on its own. Personally, I'd recommend turning up your speakers really loud and hanging out in a room across the hall. Something about the distance always made this music more real to me. This is indeed ambient music-- not meant to be listened to so much as experienced-- but not in the conventional drone sense. In fact, it thrives on playing with your awareness of it. Rather than allowing you to space it out entirely, it allows you to drift off temporarily before jolting you to attention, typically kicking into high gear at exactly the moment your mind starts to wander. Most of these tracks are built around the repetition of phrases which are tweaked gently with each recurrence. The slow pacing could be seen as a problem, but Rehberg fills the silence with such a variety of interesting sounds, from an abstracted sine wave to a deceivingly simple beat floating around in a glitched ether to backwards chunks of climatic film scores punctuated with bits of prepared piano. Granted, there are a few moments that veer from the standard, like track five, where an echoing kickdrum buoyed by atmospheric effects is overwhelmed as the background stutters, glitches out and eventually consumes everything, leaving nothing but a high-pitched static tone in its wake. Or the closing track which, in a garbled parody of some sort of typical theatrical climax, almost begins to take on the form of melody. But more often than not, it's minimal tones that overlap and intertwine, all on so small a scale that you'd miss it were you not paying close attention. Showroom Dummies may be substantially outside the norm of Pita's typically aggressive noise projects, but this almost makes it more valuable. With this record, Rehberg shows he's just as effective working on entirely different planes where the goal is sensory manipulation rather than simple sensory overload.","Space is the predominant force behind Showroom Dummies, the latest solo offering from Mego labelhead Peter Rehberg, commonly known as ...

Songs to No One: 1991-1992,Jeff BuckleyGary Lucas,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3d1c0084474cd0c0356/1:1/w_160/82e4236c.jpg,2002-10-24 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/990-songs-to-no-one-1991-1992/,Evolver,"As it turns out, Gary Lucas' contributions to many of Jeff Buckley's shining moments amounted to much more than just giving him an outlet to unleash his velvet-savage croon fronting the pre-Grace quartet Gods & Monsters, or helping him along with his songs. In fact, the music for some of Buckley's signature tunes like ""Grace"" and ""Mojo Pin"" was almost completely composed by Lucas. As the posthumous releases continue to mount for Buckley, I wonder if the kinds of revelations left are the ones like this that could as likely deflate his legacy as procure the myth. Buckley was an artist, and his leftovers are being deftly distributed in a style similar to other late legends like John Coltrane, Jimi Hendrix and John Lennon (oddly Kurt Cobain has thus far not enjoyed the same extended eulogy)-- and there will doubtlessly come a day when only the bottom of the barrel remains. The good news is that Songs to No One does not mark that day. Buckley had come to New York from California in 1991 with his girlfriend and soon found himself in an artistic community far removed from the cutthroat competition of LA. He met former Captain Beefheart guitarist Gary Lucas at a benefit for Buckley's late father and soon joined Lucas' rock project Gods & Monsters. Buckley supplied lyrics to several of Lucas' instrumentals, including the aforementioned pair that eventually became centerpieces of Buckley's only completed album. But Gods & Monsters never really got off the ground outside of New York, largely due to a growing tension between Buckley and Lucas. When Buckley refused to sign an agreement regarding his loyalty to the project, they effectively called it quits. Songs to No One features two of their songs, plus several more recorded privately by Lucas and Buckley, as well as a few other solo and duet performances. The highlight of the collection, and one of the finest Buckley performances outside of Grace, is the first track, a cover of Edith Piaf's ""Hymne a l'Amour"". Recorded at Lucas' residence, the track ebbs and flows on a mystical drone, transforming a quaint melody into an alluring raga. The looped guitar figure provides just enough rhythmic structure to support Buckley's already stunning voice. Lucas' soaring string-scapes supply the heady atmosphere, and the overall effect is not unlike something Buckley's dad would have committed to tape circa 1970's radical Starsailor. Similarly, the spare versions of ""Mojo Pin"" and ""Grace"" (featured twice on this set: once as a studio demo with band; once as a live duet) demonstrate that these guys had merely to find the right band and producer-- the songs themselves were almost fully formed. The Gods & Monsters tracks showcase the rock star barely inside Buckley, as both ""Cruel"" and ""Malign Fiesta (No Soul)"" forgo subtle phrasing for aggressive pounce. The former track is pretty grungy, like a cross between Stone Temple Pilots and Buckley's own ""Eternal Life"". Lucas' twangy lead keeps it out of the gutter, though even he can't salvage the peppy, sub-Jane's Addiction snort of the latter song. (""You're 24 years old and still don't know which way the wind blows."" Hmm.) Fairing better is the version of ""She is Free"" with downtown avant-jazz group Sex Mob. This track was constructed ""Free as a Bird""-style, with the band supplying their new backup to Buckley and Lucas' 1992 rehearsal tape. Sure, it seems a little creepy, but Sex Mob's tasteful roots-groove provides a smooth tapestry for Buckley's soulful strains. Similarly, Bill Frisell provides guitars after-the-fact to ""Satisfied Mind"". Other than Lucas' considerable contributions, what strikes me about this set is Buckley's already remarkable range of expression. Although some of the songs (particularly the G&M; numbers) would seem ill-suited to his strengths, Buckley dove into each performance as if it was the only one he would ever give, and manages to make all of this music his own. On the title track, an upbeat pop number that wouldn't have sounded out of place on Paul Simon's Graceland, Buckley implores the object of his affections to ""know this song for always"", yet ""show this song to no one"". Perhaps due to the vigor that went into these performances (and who knows what other ones that remain), that last request seems impossible now. Hopefully, any future installments have as much to offer.","As it turns out, Gary Lucas' contributions to many of Jeff Buckley's shining moments amounted to much more than ...

TJO TKO,Tara Jane O‚ÄôNeil,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9ddeb335119a49ec8b4/1:1/w_160/1a4b46c7.gif,2002-10-24 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6002-tjo-tko/,Mr. Lady,"Take a look at Pitchfork's last two Tara Jane O'Neil reviews and you'll see that they were both written in stormy weather: one during a snowshower, the other in the cold October rain. And, well, here I am under a deadline and the skies that haven't been clear in days and puddles are taking the streets hostage. If that's not a coincidence, I've got a hunch that the folks at Mr. Lady have gotten hold of some diabolical lesbian weather machine (maybe secondhand from Touch and Go, O'Neil's previous label) and pointed it right at me. Because (hear me out), as it's been said many times over, a little precipitation is the perfect complement to the particular sort of melancholy that O'Neil has been cultivating over the course of her solo career, and thus the most favorable climate for a positive review... Paranoia, you say? This, too, is a state of mind that goes well with TJO TKO, which is something that couldn't necessarily be said about her previous work. While her melodies have always been tricky upper-register wingwalks and her productions dense, it's never been this oblique or claustrophobic before. You would think that, after her recent brush with improv on the Dan Littleton-assisted Music for a Meteor Shower, O'Neil would be plum out of opacity. Apparently, she's been saving up. She's also, thank God, learned to put it to better use-- this isn't the train wreck that Meteor Shower turned out to be mainly because O'Neil chooses to use some of her formidable capacity for structuring the gloom. And the fact that she expands her already eclectic instrumental repertoire even further doesn't hurt, either. While her post-Rodan work has tended toward a sort of organic Appalachian gothic sound, O'Neil lets her mathematical side show again here, employing sharp synthesized percussion with no pretenses of humanity. These drums hiss and slunk through the opener ""Prick"", slowly pulling you into the ice-cold guitar and vox arrangement. It's bracing but oddly incomplete, changing without ever really resolving, and the next few songs follow its lead. ""Welcome Back"" is a more conventional piano-based dirge, but its more interesting elements (the disconcerting heart-murmur drumbox beat and O'Neil's spidery guitar lines) refuse to dovetail completely with the rest of the song. The all-electronic ""Juno"" introduces a Boards of Canada-esque modal melodic pattern that begs for a beat; when that beat enters, however, it's in a different time signature. All of this is delicately creepy enough to entice continued listening but not so compelling that you won't be pissed off if O'Neil doesn't give you some resolution, and fast. If the album's meant to be taken as a piece, then ""I Saw 3"" would be a perfect conclusion. This nearly seven-minute minuet's delicious melodic clarity clears away the fog without sacrificing sonic density; dissonances hover around the focal point of O'Neil's voice, intensifying and resolving in a palpable rhythm. Too bad it comes in the right smack in the middle of the album. The next song, ""With Yours"", has only one foot in the melody, and the stark ""Bye Bye"" retreats back behind the veil again, leaving us with two obtuse loop-fests at the end. You can sigh along to these on a rainy day, sure, but O'Neil rarely risks the directness that's needed to convey the feeling to anyone who's high and dry. There are albums that can make me feel like absolute crap on a sunny day; TJO TKO, despite its downer charms, isn't one of them.","Take a look at Pitchfork's last two Tara Jane O'Neil reviews and you'll see that they were ...

Welcome Black,The Negro Problem,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3c369fc7814a47cd70c/1:1/w_160/62360375.jpg,2002-10-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5741-welcome-black/,Smile,"Welcome Black opens with the love theme to your local nightly news broadcast, a stirring swell of flugelhorns and miscellaneous brass guaranteed to generate some semblance of interest, or if nothing else, outright puzzlement. Unfortunately, the only news breaking here is forty-minutes of bizarre, rigid soul-pop. Film at 11. The Negro Problem-- who curiously feel they can get away with touting such a blatantly offensive bandname because one of their members is of African descent-- have slowly carved out a (miniscule) niche for themselves in the wilds of L.A. over the course of three albums by colliding mellow lite-soul/jazz hooks with cutesy twee-pop harmonies. People are stupid. They should realize that this hybrid is, at best, the sad approximation of a Prince/Promise Ring collaboration, and at worst, the textbook definition of ""unholy"". And yet, I remain torn on my true feelings for this band. On one hand, The Negro Problem have created a sound that is uniquely their own (among indie circles, certainly), and even managed to drag some mildly compelling grooves, kicking and screaming, by its toothy maw. On the other, I can't help but feel that this sound is theirs alone because no one else particularly wants it. At times, it sounds a little like 70s crap-rock a la Chicago; the rest of the time it sounds like 90s wuss-rock a la Hootie & The Blowfish-- castrated, I might add. With that out of the way, though, this album does have a certain smarmy, unreal charisma. The strange mix of twee, jazz, and country is like watching someone get ass-impaled by a thorny branch on ""Real TV""-- it shouldn't be funny, but the combination of it being both unexpected and not you is a powerfully comedic aphrodisiac. The first listen will grip you inexorably as your mind reels to imagine what asinine stunt The Negro Problem might attempt next. Will it be a Beatlesque trip down Psych-Pop Lane like ""I'm Sebastian Cabot""? Or perhaps a relaxing soul jam straight off Al B. Sure's Do It 2 the Music like ""Lime Green Sweater""? We don't know! But it's all good, 'cause we stop wanting to right around the fifth track, anyway. If I could make this up, I would. In fact, I was momentarily tempted to give this album another point for the lyrics alone, before thinking of you, the poor reader. Lines like, ""Now I'm boning up on everything (At the center room library)/ Haven't had a bath since George was king (That is why we're acting wary),"" (sung in rondo!) or, ""And in time all time will be time,"" are tossed around with carefree abandon. It completes the trifecta of surrealism with the deplorable self-reference of ""Is This the Single"", and more independent mentions of popcorn machines than you will ever hear on one CD. Like the ludicrously goofy bandname/album title combo, Welcome Black is often hilarious and, I will say with confidence, something the likes of which you are unlikely to hear anywhere else. But as the old saying goes, the jokes get old while the bitter aftertaste will forever remain. If it's soul-pop you want, you'll have better luck checking your grocer's freezer.","Welcome Black opens with the love theme to your local nightly news broadcast, a stirring swell of flugelhorns and miscellaneous ...

No, Sensei. Is there fear in this dojo? No, Sensei. Hold up-- let's put the pain and fear aside for a moment and talk music. Is there a saxophone in this dojo? What about a couple guitars, an electric bass, and drums? And jazz-influenced, mostly instrumental rock compositions? What about those? Word up, Sensei. You know your dojo. Yes, Sensei, there is post-rock in this dojo. This post-rock comes courtesy of the five members of Sweep the Leg Johnny, a veteran group drawing influence from King Crimson and Ornette Coleman, and drawing comparisons to June of 44. All dropped names contain valid indicators of the Sweep sound: noisy, progressive, potent, avant-garde. Had I not told you that, however, and maybe even in spite of it, you might be drawing comparisons to other, less reputable artists; the Mighty Mighty Bosstones come to mind, for example, as do a wealth of mediocre hardcore bands. Sweep has been an active touring combo ever since their inception in 1996, logging over 725 shows in that period. All the action didn't take place without some success. Sweep gained a reputation as an energetic, hard-charging live act, one that always made sure to keep the power in post-rock. It's safe to say they still have that mindset-- you hear it in the first 20 seconds of ""Sometimes My Balls Feel Like Tits"" (reviewer attempts to hold straight face), which takes a middle-eastern flavored sax lick and tears it to shreds with a cascade of guitar rage. Problems, however, surface early. Like the ""Tits"" track-- for all of the volume, all of the power, there isn't much guts to the riffage. It's definitely a cerebral jam. Nothing in the guitars, drums or sax grab anything corporeal. Not ass, not balls, not viscera. Instead, it attempts to torch the ears while aiming at the analytical center, the brain. But as technically complex and interesting as this may be to Sweep, it is not all that interesting to the listener. As a matter of fact, the ""rock hard to stuff that doesn't really rock at all"" approach can provide quite a bit of frustration. Bring in classically half-assed post-rock vocals, as on ""Only in a Rerun"", and you unfortunately get more of the same. The vocals take a relaxed, jazzy feel, and the progression plods along with an uncomfortable, mathematical form, sounding like Zorn's Masada, but with less funk. It grinds, though, and pores over itself, with crunchy metallic guitar tones and frenetic drumming complementing the modal alto sax lines. But in the end, it's unsatisfying. All the amplification in world can't make up for a lack of soul, providing more proof that some genres just don't rock. Is there aggravation in this dojo? Yes, Sensei. I say give it the body bag.","Dojo inventory: Is there pain in this dojo? No, Sensei. Is there fear in this dojo? No, Sensei. Hold up-- ...

Out From Out Where,Amon Tobin,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7c8ea9e61561daa5679/1:1/w_160/7e9540ef.gif,2002-10-23 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8085-out-from-out-where/,Ninja Tune,"The nineties were a great time for beat cooking, and the London-based Ninja Tune label had some strong stew, from DJ Food's tasty hors d'oeuvres, to slices from Coldcut and Funky Porcini, to The Herbaliser's homegrown selections. But that decade has passed and-- post-pot smoke and the deleterious effects of ""trip-hop"" on the reception of downtempo grooves-- it's hard to deny that a good chunk of it sounds really dated. Not so for the man called Amon, whose ability to evoke entire jazz symphonies from two turntables and a sampler caused much jaw-dropping and salivation. He quit school and composed Bricolage and Permutation, each blending jazzy samples and drum-n-bass into tours de force that still sound fresh today. Of course, given the rapid pulse of the electronic scene, it's easy to forget that Tobin has steadily churned out an album every two years. In 2000, he dropped his first real departure, the aggressive Supermodified, which digitized his sound into fractals for the 21st century. Having paid his dues and grasped his contribution, he's left the exploration of improv's interstices to DJ Spooky and Thirsty Ear's Blue Series and has since ventured into the furthest realms of space. Out From Out Where beams back at us from one of those planets where mutant morlocks throw block parties and robo-dogs get it on with intelligent fire hydrants. It's a future that may not end in dystopia; there are a few user-friendly moments once you get past all the sharp edges. The physics of drums and bass haven't been abandoned altogether, evidenced in the insane opener ""Back From Space"" as a barrage of tech fills skitter amongst chimes and the surprise accompaniment of heavy metal guitar. But Tobin seems less concerned with showing off tricky breaks and Krupa-on-crack rhythms here, and more taken with just rocking the house. Thus, ""Chronic Tronic"" oscillates cycles of beats with hissing snare pistons, mining post-electro territory similar to that explored by Skinny Puppy or Download. ""Cosmo Retro Intro Outro"" likewise pursues a dance vibe, though this time it recalls an old-school rave-up as synth vamps come at the climax to push aside the junglist influence. This isn't easy listening in any sense of the word, but you have to nod your head to the nasty bass tremors on ""Rosies"" that echo the collaborations of Techno Animal and Alec Empire. There are traces of the organic instruments Tobin previously used, especially in the orchestral swells that dramatize a few of the tracks. More often they're stitched into the frames, as with the rumbling double bass that forms the engine of ""Searchers"". The later songs slow down for a series of drifting atmospheres punctuated by dubby upstrokes or hints of Brazilian percussion, and it's increasingly mind-boggling to believe that all the featured sounds originate from a sampler. But Tobin insists on his method, so we have to imagine that the plips and plops of ""Proper Hoodidge"" might have been guitar licks at some point, and that the ominous drone haunting ""El Wraith"" may have been a foghorn in a past life. Describing all the ethereal sounds flooding the beautiful closer ""Mighty Micro People"" would require a few hundred words alone. Out From Out Where's most dynamic workouts bounce along energetically, completely enamored of themselves; ""Verbal"" comes close to dopey big beat territory, with vocals from MC Decimal R diced into Prefuse and Chipmunks soundbytes. Tobin's definitely out to have some fun with this record, though the immense density of these soundscapes prevent them from being reduced to chop-shop filler. Unfortunately, he seems less interested in taking you on a journey, as each piece ends in roughly the same place as it begins. Where the pleasure lies here, however, is in listening to the rich layers unfold, and the music just glows, filled with his enthusiasm. Amon Tobin may never put out a party album, but this is probably as close as he's going to get.","The nineties were a great time for beat cooking, and the London-based Ninja Tune label had some strong stew, from ...

Rec.Extern,Radian,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1e1b1335d7bf169837a/1:1/w_160/4800820c.jpeg,2002-10-23 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6647-recextern/,Thrill Jockey,"It was a dull, dry Chicago day when I received my first warning about the Thrill Jockey. I'd been making preparations to head up to his cabin when I got a call from my editor. ""Be extra careful on this assignment, gumshoe, I hear the Jockey's been a little touchy lately,"" he growled, the underlying message being 'don't screw this one up.' A trip to the outfitters produced another, strangely conflicting warning: ""T.J.'s sort of settled down, so don't expect to get a wild horsetale up there, fella,"" said the shopkeeper, slipping some No-Doze tabs in with the standard flexigrip ballpoints and steno pads. ""Grown roots?"" I added. ""Nah,"" he snorted. ""More like ossification."" Now just why he'd given me stimulants wasn't exactly clear. Time was, the Thrill Jockey made for the most exciting headlines, stories about madcap fusions and all that jazz, enough to turn a tortoise into a trans am. But as rumor had it, the Jockey had begun to slow down a bit, quite possibly under the influence of some prescription from Vienna only classified as 'Radian'. So I took the stims against my better judgment and headed out towards the rail lines. The directions were a little vague: past the Town and Country Inn, halfway 'round the oval track, back behind the all-natural farm. When I arrived a cold, dead wind rose, like in those clich√© Westerns you always catch on broadband. Then I realized the 'wind' was coming from inside T.J. H.Q. itself. I stepped gingerly through the door and spotted the Jockey himself. The old coot was propped up on a rocker with his feet kicked in the air, and he motioned for me to sit down. The environment was strangely clean, pristine even, except for the sine wave I'd heard before and these erratic patches of noise. It was clear he'd been under the influence of this Radian: far from a tornado, he just sat there and absorbed all the random sounds, bass modulations, shifty percussive shimmers and the occasional ring of a vibraphone. It was boring as all hell. If I'd had a piece I might have put him out of his misery right there. The Jockey and I got to talking, and a peculiar thing began to happen. The longer I listened, the more those random synthesized shapes shifted into place, like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. In fact, at one point a sound just like a buzzsaw rose up, spraying out electric sparks that would eventually fall to the matte of feedback on the floor. The hour passed patiently as the sounds of electricity were brought to life: appliance purr, amped-up feedback hiss, the threshold hum of a jack-in port, all were animated and made to dance in their MacEntirety. A strange rhythm developed, like dub stretched out even further, with the skittering drums rolling into the sharp punctuation of the bass. I wasn't sure what the Thrill Jockey was on, though it was obviously more European than American in origin. The only strains that came to mind were occasional dalliances with FennO'Berg and Stock, Hausen & Walkman. The Jockey seemed to have found his own little world, a controlled environment that he could manipulate with pointillist precision. It wasn't the scoop I'd come digging for, but it was news all the same. I left him to his vices, sort of glad that he'd found a quiet spot away from the clamor of the thrill-seeking life. But a part of me hoped that he wouldn't confuse his repetitions-with-delay for progress just because he'd created warped machine funk. Still, I wasn't worried-- the Jockey still had a few good kicks left in him.","It was a dull, dry Chicago day when I received my first warning about the Thrill Jockey. I'd been ...

Unlimited EP,Soul Position,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4d9ea9e61561daa4fe7/1:1/w_160/14685ed2.gif,2002-10-23 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7368-unlimited-ep/,Rhymesayers,"On paper, Soul Position, which is the collision of Blueprint and RJD2, looks like hip-hop's next big supergroup. When he's on, Blueprint's voice wraps around beats with an aggressive elasticity reminiscent of a young, hungry Del, utilizing clever wordplay and conveying a personable honesty. He's carried an underground buzz for the better part of a year and Urb magazine recently tagged him as one of the ""next 100"". And RJD2-- do we really need to recap this man's accomplishments of late? To paraphrase the esteemed Big L: if production was a game, RJ would be MVP. Still, hype and individual talent do not necessarily equal a perfect match. And while few would dispute Deadringer's status as one of the year's most entertaining records, it's also widely accepted that the tracks which feature emcees are the album's weakest. So, the big question with the Unlimited EP is not whether Blueprint and RJD2 will bring the heat-- we all know they will-- but whether or not their distinctive styles will sync with one another. After a brief and astoundingly soulful intro track, the disc opens with the title song, and it's everything we'd hoped for and expected from this collaboration, with Blueprint declaring, ""Let's take it back to the fundamentals,"" and RJD2 backing up him with a thumping drum track laced with playful flute and booming horn samples. This upbeat and mischievous production is the perfect foil for Blueprint's acrobatic vocal delivery. ""Revolution starts with somebody loud,"" Blueprint raps, ""somebody to throw the brick into the crowd."" Soul Position have officially kicked off this record with a hundred-pound slab of sweetness. If ""Unlimited"" is a slow cruise down the boulevard of funk, ""Mic Control"" is a shuffling retreat into dark New Orleans alleyways. RJD2 provides a track that's nothing short of phenomenal: a noir piano sample is fastened to a plodding beat as a bluesy voice sings, ""Walking into this world alone..."" Over this, RJ throws down bluesy guitar and cello that reinforces the song's smoky atmosphere. And although the mood is definitely darker than the man's usual fare, he wisely injects the track with enough swing for Blueprint to anchor his taunting rhymes to. Unfortunately, the chemistry falls off a bit in the EP's second half. While there's nothing wrong with the chopped-up production of ""Take Your Time"", RJD2 should have realized that the track is a bit too slo-mo for Blueprint's rhymes. Thankfully, RJ redeems himself from this unfortunate aberration with the crackling blues instrumental ""Oxford You Really Owe Me""-- even with a screeching metal guitar sample thrown real low in the mix, this track is utterly sublime. And what makes this EP all the more impressive is that it's just a warm-up for Soul Position's full-length to be released this winter. If these two can sustain the energy they've generated for this release, Soul Position may well be on their way to great things.","On paper, Soul Position, which is the collision of Blueprint and RJD2, looks like hip-hop's next big supergroup.

"A Bottle, A Dog, Some Milk, A Bottle",Winfred E.

Winfred E. Eye is a band, not an individual. Well, it was an individual at one time, the grandfather of frontman Aaron Calvert, but as a military man, Winfred got sick of being called Private Eye so he changed the family name to Calvert. I digress. This Winfred E. Eye is a band, so if I show up at your store, this CD better be filed under ""W"" not ""E"" or there's going to be trouble. You don't want another episode like when I found Jethro Tull filed under ""T"" and went all Bruce Banner on some poor clerk's ass. Just like their name, the genre categorization of Winfred E. Eye requires a slight pause on the listener's part-- kneejerk pigeonholing, after all, makes a pigeon-knee'd jerkhole out of you and me. To most casual listeners, the hazy late night vibe this Oakland-based six-piece creates is likely to be hastily dismissed as a bad Tom Waits impersonation. There are similarities-- in fact, similarities not unlike Songs: Ohia's Jason Molina and Will Oldham. But as with Molina, listening beyond the surface reveals a storyteller on a different path. Besides, Calvert's voice doesn't just bring Waits to mind-- he also evokes Tindersticks' Stuart Staples, Ron Sexsmith, and even Dr John, delivering his words in a kind of soulful, mumbling speak-sing. And his lyrics are, shall we say, less Fellini-esque than Waits'. There are no dwarves doing cartwheels in the background of these songs, no mad scientists or one-eyed fortune tellers, though there are plenty of down-and-outs. But, in general, Calvert's lyrics are much more personal and direct. For instance, ""Rinding the Rails"", vague though it may be, seems to be about a France-bound post-grad on the Eurail fantasizing about some girl across the aisle. The fantasy, however, turns dark as Calvert sings, ""Whores can teach/ This might be true/ I've seen the depths where love festers."" Then there are three songs that appear to be about his dog (""Dog"", ""Dog's Brother"", and ""Bury It!""), and the hopelessly forlorn ""Keep the Bed Warm"", which, with its refrain ""coping with coping,"" could only have been drawn from personal experience. As for the five other members of the band, they do a great job of creating a world where it's always dusk and the sea air is blowing in, like a breezier Black Heart Procession. The best song on the album is the closer, ""Monte Rio"", which pits a distant drum loop, an accordion drone, and a simple, repetitive acoustic guitar riff against Calvert's chorus, ""Remember what I said/ Don't forget it/ Forget what I said/ Forget it,"" and his most self-loathing fare, ""No one wants to touch you... and it's starting to sink in."" Still, as songwriters go, Calvert has a long road to travel before he's at the top of his game. There are presently any number of artists blowing minds in this medium, and A Bottle, A Dog, Some Milk, A Bottle is certainly a pleasant outing, it offers little more than promise of a brighter future for this band.","Listen up record shop employees.

Etc.,Jawbreaker,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9d1ea9e61561daa709f/1:1/w_160/274cd644.jpg,2002-10-22 05:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4213-etc/,Blackball,"You know, sometimes a reviewer can just let the liner notes speak for themselves: ""Hey, at least I don't sound like a hoarse Mickey Mouse and you can't really tell if I'm on key or not."" ""It just seemed like a bad idea at the time. And it was."" ""Why did we do another recording of this?"" With enthusiastic testimony like that, it must mean another medium-popular 90s nth-wave punk band is releasing their vinyl/comp odds and ends! Which they are! They being Jawbreaker! And putting aside for a moment the usual collector-fleecing aspect of these anthologies (said obsessive having eBayed his way to a complete Jawbreaker discography, only to find the bulk reissued on fancy packaged disc anon), is it really necessary? I have loved Jawbreaker. These days, I like them. It's different now, being not 16 anymore. My fondness can't extend beyond a bittersweetly-reminiscing-about-high-school-days-and-ex-girlfriends perspective. Hearing ""Fireman"" or ""Ashtray Monument"" still gets me all smiley, but the effect today is more than 50% memory-driven. Precious few bands can be certain that their released material holds up beyond the temporal context in which it was originally heard, much less the cutting room floor scraps and early demos. So unless you're writing a thesis paper on Blake Schwarzenbach's musical evolution, the majority of Etc should be of no interest. Jawbreaker didn't even get certifiably great until five years after getting together. 1990's Unfun was cold; Bivouac was getting warmer. But it wasn't until 1993's indie classic 24 Hour Revenge Therapy that they really nailed it. As such, the first two-thirds of Etc are excruciating in every sense, as Jawbreaker reveals their younger selves as just another band with a stack of Fugazi records where their originality should be. The early, mostly demo material is above-average boom-chick punk (especially ""Shield Your Eyes"" and ""Caroline""), explaining their rise above the other worshippers at the Church of MacKaye. But it also lets some absolutely dreadful moments out of the closet, like the five-minute-plus hardcore-influenced ""Fantastic Planet"" (aren't hardcore songs limited to two minutes by law?) and a U2/Misfits/Vapors medley worthy of a junior high power trio playing the local YMCA. Alright, I'm being a little harsh; there are a few insightful moments of science-fair experimentalism-- the backwards loop at the end of ""Gutless"", the scary-voice suicide rant over ""Split""-- that foretell the band's majestic peak, 24HRT's ""Condition Oakland"". But the vocal-cord-shredding emotion and one-dimensional arsenal (see how they Jawbreakerize, and thus ruin, REM's ""Pretty Persuasion"") gets old real fast. Unlistenability comes to a head on ""Kiss the Bottle"" where Schwarzenbach sounds like the frog in his throat has founded a large frog colony. ""This was the last thing we recorded before Blake's throat surgery,"" the liners cheerfully intone. After that painful glimpse at pharynx pathology, things start to brighten as the band gets a little more tuneful and a little more polished. Revenge Therapy and even Dear You outtakes fare better than their ancestors, and the band rolls through a Psychedelic Furs cover (""Into You Like a Train"") with ease and aplomb. Penultimate track ""Friendly Fire"" even draws out a roadmap towards Jets to Brazil's Orange Rhyming Dictionary, as the tempo gets slower and the words get wordier. The album can't close without a reminder of its absolute inessentiality, however, which comes in the form of a pointless, no-alteration remake of the band's ""hit"", ""Boxcar"". ""I think the major label defense budget spending was going to our heads,"" the notes tell us. (So why not charge us $15.99 for it?) And that's why, to paraphrase ""Boxcar"" itself, one-two-three-4.2 is the score.","You know, sometimes a reviewer can just let the liner notes speak for themselves:

Is a Woman EP,Lambchop,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc8813d197565213b34b/1:1/w_160/f0fe09dd.gif,2002-10-22 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4658-is-a-woman-ep/,City Slang,"The story is supposed to have gone: ""Lambchop followed the lush-to-extravagant pomp of Nixon with the muted, cavernous saloonery of their sixth full-length, Is a Woman, and the world was underwhelmed. Some even called the album Kurt Wagner's love letter to himself, since his swooning yet sawdusty vocals (and therefore his fractured verse) formed the album's fulcrum."" What a dumb story. To anyone who dismissed Is A Woman, as I (and Pitchfork: see archives) initially did, I suggest a revisitation, keeping in mind that Lambchop is ever-evolving, and that the collective who brought you Nixon's sunroofy jams has every damn right to bring you the wintry cabin fever of Is a Woman. What Kurt giveth, he taketh away. Anyone familiar with the spoken-word or if-Gibby-Haynes-was-a-carny tracks on I Hope You're Sitting Down, or the gentle overkill of How I Quit Smoking, or the cyclical despondent profanity of Hank and Thriller, or the soul-country variety show of What Another Man Spills knows that half the fun of slapping down your American superdollars for 'Chop product is not knowing what new vein Wagner and company are going to mine/pollute: Cascading falsettos? Someone playing a lacquer-thinner can with a wrench? Covers of Dump, East River Pipe or Curtis Mayfield? Lyrics about fighting Garth Brooks or fixating on a backyard sprinkler? Background singers so white-sounding they bring to mind afternoons with Granny polishing endtables to Perry Como? Besides, the Is a Woman album sports some gorgeous, laconic looniness. The fragile, accidental tone works best at weird hours, and the tyranny with which Wagner subdues his ensemble almost suggests that the accompanying instruments exist only in the imagination of the album's disintegrating piano man-- in fact, the album leads one to picture a guy in a tux hunched over a baby grand in some department store or touristy restaurant, fed up with spewing neglected renditions of ""It Could Happen to You"", so he wraps his cummerbund around his head and breathily boasts about how far he can flick a cigarette (""Flick"") or sings confessions like ""I Can Hardly Spell My Name"". By the end of the set, the pants are off, the flask is out, and our hero is prostrate across the piano. Lambchop's elliptical songs can rewardingly be set to drum loops, and this EP will delight those who dig the big-beat remixed tracks from Tools in the Dryer and elsewhere. The album version of ""Is a Woman"" kicks off the disc, and if you forgot it (who can blame you, this anti-anthem feels designed to slip through cracks), it's a downtrodden, jazzy tapeworm of a song that busts into subtly choral, bouncy reggae-- stridently completing the full-length's comprehensive motif of intentional non-sequiturship. Schneider TM, probably the ""name"" overhauler here, deliver a frustrating take on the excellent, observation-listing ""New Cobweb Summer"". The vocals sound squeezed through some phaser, and a farty R&B; groove is propped underneath the airy original's stilts. Alpha and The Maxwell Implosion deliver the gold on each of their ""Is a Woman"" expansions. Alpha nods slightly to the mid-90s when inattentive reviewers used to call Lambchop's big sound ""lounge"", referring to the ""space-age"" retro stuff. But this loungification is legitimately forward-looking, coating the song's spine with at least four tracks of trembling keys that often trail off like a lab-bred army of exospheric moths. The Maxwell Implosion mix stresses soft drums, organ hits, and island-strummed guitars. If not for the one chorus during which it juxtaposes xylophone tones with a ""bubble"" percussion (think ""Pop-Up Videos""), this thing would be a complete part of your balanced breakfast. Also included is an animated video: a leaf drifts down a snowy river, then begins to walk and dance, which leads inevitably to a leaf parade. Yep. The art's pretty and all, but the clip is skippable if you're the type who calculates your waking hours' opportunity costs in five-minute increments. So the EP is mostly fan-fare, but of the kind that could season a mean mix CDR. Lambchop's one of the few crews who could find a poetic use for the brands they check in these songs (Sony, Sherwin Williams), and that alone can help you abide in a world where certain periodicals run creepy spreads on how celebrities eat, complete with paparazzi shots of Enrique Iglesias burger-snarfing. Three spins of the Alpha and Maxwell Implosion remixes and mastication-porn is wiped clean from the psyche.","The story is supposed to have gone: ""Lambchop followed the lush-to-extravagant pomp of Nixon with the muted, cavernous saloonery of ...

Playthroughs,Keith Fullerton Whitman,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa2113d19756521399a2/1:1/w_160/44eaad28.jpg,2002-10-22 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8659-playthroughs/,Kranky,"You probably know Keith Fullerton Whitman as breakcore maven Hrvatski, a man who played in a few bands before developing an obsession with Squarepusher and deciding to probe the most hectic beats possible on labels such as Planet \xB5 and his own Reckankreuzung, as well as falling into the Tigerbeat6 orbit. You also may know Hrvatski by his pithy electronic music write-ups for the Forced Exposure website, penned while he worked in sales for the revered distributor. But the Keith Fullerton Whitman of Playthroughs has kept a lower profile. Starting last year with the 21:30 for Acoustic Guitar EP, Whitman began experimenting with subtle music based on laptop-processed guitar tones. While he's tinkered with this approach here and there, Playthroughs is his first sustained exploration of quiet sound. If you've listened to the more drone-focused side of electronic music in the last few years, you've definitely heard the core elements that make up Playthroughs. There is no radical breakthrough in texture here, nothing to make you turn your head and say, ""What the hell was that?"" Playthroughs consists entirely of processed guitar, but the tones are light on harmonics, with many possessing an almost sine wave-level of clarity. As the thin drones hang in the air and shift this way and that, they harmonize with other drones and find themselves poked with fuzzy implements of static. Nothing terribly earth-shattering about this composition method. It's true that much of Playthroughs seems familiar on the surface, but I don't think it an exaggeration to say that this record essentially perfects this particular style of music. It's an album of meticulous balance, Zen focus, and tiny gestures that carry great force, where each individual piece of sound is carefully placed to maximize impact. The first 3\xBD minutes of ""feedback zwei"", for example, consists of overlapping blankets of clean, piercing electronic feedback that remain in constant motion, creating new harmonic patterns with each passing second. And an unexpected cloud of pink noise slowly envelops the sound field, bathing the entire track in a warm digital mist and drastically shifting the perspective. Eventually sub-bass tones provide even more glaring contrast (be sure to listen to this track on good headphones). It all sounds simple on paper, but the emotional impact of the transformation in ""feedback zwei"" is completely overwhelming, never failing to produce a lump in my throat. The five tracks on Playthroughs were designed to work together, and a similar palette is used throughout. The opening ""track3a(2waynice)"" (obviously titles are of no import) finds Whitman trying his hand with the phase techniques of La Monte Young and Ryoji Ikeda, showing how much weird tension can be created when two or three tones that don't quite match up. The style of ""fib01a"" has the easiest reference point, being quite close in texture and feel to 94diskont-era Oval, minus the CD skips and with a greater understanding of extended tones. ""ACGTR SVP"" contains the thickest drones on Playthroughs, as guitars processed to sound like organs swell and recede. And the closing ""modena"" is 17 minutes of sonic bliss, strangely beautiful electronic taps that seem to hang in the air like a handful of airborne glitter catching light in extreme slow motion. If I were talking to you about this album over coffee somewhere, I'd probably slide my copy across the table, say, ""Give it a listen and see what you think,"" and then change the subject. Everyone knows the problem of building something up to a friend-- after hearing ""You're going to love it, it's so perfect-- incredible!"" a number of times, your expectations balloon to a size that no actual experience could ever hope to fill. I'm doubly reluctant to tell you what I think of Playthroughs because of the nature of the music. When I was talking up the Boredoms' Super Ae a couple years ago, I knew it was the kind of album that grabbed the listener by the throat and shook him around the room. Love it or hate it, Super Ae had the sort of impact you could feel through your body, and I had no doubt that everyone would understand just how colossal it was. Playthroughs is an entirely different animal, with a much more understated appeal. Still, I'm writing a record review for Pitchfork here, so I have to give you my honest opinion: this is by some margin the best album I've heard in 2002, and there are only about ten weeks left.","You probably know Keith Fullerton Whitman as breakcore maven Hrvatski, a man who played in a few bands\n\ before ...

A Data Learn the Language,Mercury Program,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c436eb335119a49ed8c7/1:1/w_160/41f6212c.jpg,2002-10-21 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5233-a-data-learn-the-language/,Tiger Style,"Eccentricity's a tough trick to play. A willful refusal to obey the rules of one's genre and an urge to be different for the sake of difference can get you pretty far (where would the Flaming Lips be without it?), especially if the genre in question is particularly ossified or tired. On the other hand, eccentricity's also the cheapest ticket to Novelty City. This is especially true if your genre is, essentially, a reaction to another genre, a self-designated rule breaker; in which case, who's to say what's eccentric and what's just plain silly? For example, post-rock: what if, say, Godspeed You Black Emperor! developed a penchant for hand puppets and fake blood, and enlisted people in bunny suits to spout off about the IMF in French? I'm just afraid that the Mercury Program will, or have already, come to be known as ""the dudes with the vibraphone"". When they took the instrument up after their first album, just as they were phasing out vocals, it certainly seemed like a device for consciously distancing themselves from conventional rock. And, despite the fact that vibes were already both a quirk and a cliche in post-rock, it worked wonders for their next release, the lauded EP All the Suits Began to Fall Off. The distinct, clean tone of the vibes created the somewhat comforting illusion that there was a lead instrument (when this wasn't necessarily the case) and balanced the moments of distortion that the band had skimmed off the top of their previous sound. Still, questions remained: had the Program cut themselves too thin of a slice from the Tortoise pie? And: if they like their vibraphone so much, why don't they marry it? Three out of four band members do indeed bang the mallets on A Data Learn the Language. But even though they're on every track, the vibes don't sound nearly as prominent here as they did on All the Suits Began to Fall Off, which is a good thing, as more interesting shit tends to go down on this album. Almost all remnants of dynamics-and-distortion histrionics have been purged from the band's sound, leaving them only the dense, Venn-diagram play of interlocking patterns to work with. In the hands of a lesser band, this sort of thing can easily turn rigid; here, it often sounds just as lightweight as it is fraught. Some of the tracks positively levitate; on ""Fragile or Possibly Extinct"", Whit Travisano's cascading electric piano and Tom Reno's sea-spray guitar almost evaporate. Their touch is light but almost universally expert; even the obligatory electronic manipulation on the first track, ""Tequesta"", comes off as some of the most tastefully executed I've ever heard, subtly clothing Dave Lebleu's drums in a swarm of clicks. In fact, the band's best trick-- one which they play throughout the album-- is to convince the listener that they don't exist. Much of the time, it's hard to believe that humans are playing this music, not out of any excessive virtuosity or lack of emotion, but because of the celestial tones Reno and Travisano coax out of their instruments and the sharp focus of brother Sander Travisano's spartan bass and Lebleu's drums. Maybe they manage this because they're manufacturing this sound using the sort of conventional instrumentation that we're conditioned to accept without thought. Maybe, because of this, the vibraphones tend to stick out like severed thumbs. When the band uses them for anything other than texture, you're forced to entertain the idea that there is, in fact, a guy playing the vibraphone here. And the vibes, by being so distinctive, emphasize the repetitiveness of the patterns they're playing, while the other instruments have a back door into your brain. Some of the slightly weaker tracks in the middle of the album are hobbled by this (especially the second half of ""To/From Iceland"", which sounds cribbed directly from the ""Interval"" songs on Tortoise's TNT). The band, though, has come too far to let this stop them, and the last three tracks are proof. ""You Yourself Are Too Serious"" slowly unwinds its spiky, leapfrogging guitar and piano figures into a gorgeously simple conclusion; ""Gently Turned on Your Head"" tilts and rolls without ever going nauseous; and ""Sultans of El Sur"" ends on a decidedly forceful note, with a monumental rhythmic barrage crashing against a cathedral of echoed guitar. Obviously, the band doesn't need a gimmick; in the end, though, the fact that they have one doesn't detract too much from the music.","Eccentricity's a tough trick to play.

It's not hard to see why, though: the work of weird people is hard to figure out sometimes, and as critics often lack the patience to put forth a concerted effort to do so, they'll often offhandedly laud incomprehensible art as genius (word to Merzbow's mother). Gordon Anderson (aka Lone Pigeon) is a strange one. An erstwhile member of the Beta Band who co-wrote some of that band's most accessible material (including the certifiable indie smash ""Dry the Rain""), Anderson came down with health problems that resulted in him leaving the group, just before the critical whirlwind swept. Concubine Rice, his third full-length release and first with stateside distribution, sounds instantly familiar, like the most idiosyncratic, oddball moments on Beta Band's self-titled disc, but without any of the groove behind it. At its strongest, Concubine Rice is a tribute to the great sixties songwriters seen through the lens of an acid trip (or vice versa); at its worst-- and at its most frequent-- the disc wallows in pointless, unfocused, non-sequitur nonsense. The sycophants would tell you it's quirky genius. I'm telling you it's not. Song fragments are a staple of Lone Pigeon's aesthetic. The majority of these tracks are broken down into several fragments, most bearing little relationship to one another. Album-by-ADD can be an effective technique (see Badly Drawn Boy's The Hour of Bewilderbeast or the Beta Band's own self-titled full-length) so long as the fragments have a point and the tunes are compelling. But Concubine Rice meanders aimlessly, haphazardly wandering with little sense of melody at all. And worse: the few tracks that are memorably melodic are painfully derivative, like the Lennon-inflected ""Heaven Come Down"", the sparse, Neil Young-ish ""Waterfall"", the straight-up, ""Drive My Car""-style Beatles rip on the opening to ""Old Mr. Muncherman"" and the Beatles-by-way-of-Oasis mug on ""Lay Me Down"". Incidentally, by ""derivative"", I don't mean ""sounds like"". You can tell what the influence is, but the execution is absolutely half-assed; at times, it hits like accidental mockery. Everything on Concubine Rice is drenched in ""weird"". This is especially true of the production, which varies from in-studio digital to inner-ass four-track. This lends the album some charm but, lacking songs to back up the ambience, any charm is pointless. It's lost among his refusal to make me give a damn. Same goes for the instrumentation: just as varied as the production, using the standard folk-pop guitars and pianos, while throwing-in a healthy dose of off-center Casiotone backbeats, samples, mandolins, and some unrecognizable horn-like things. Again, charming, a little creative, but ultimately ineffectual. Also falling under the ""weird"" heading are Lone Pigeon's lyrics. He sings about elephants, chimpanzees, ""the ancient hubbard cow of bubbletoop"" (he rhymes it with ""poop""), and a chick named Catherine to whom he expresses his displeasure with saccharine and deodorant. Amusing, maybe, for the first two minutes or so, the words that accompany this mess seem to deliberately lack depth or poeticism-- not to mention anything a sober listener could relate to. Right now, the genius inside of Lone Pigeon lies sleeping, undisturbed. Several key items could awaken this genius within, including a Ritalin prescription, a good producer, the concept of ""focus"", and maybe a Tony Robbins. Implement these changes and the future might bode well for Mr Anderson. As for Concubine Rice, though, there's not much to ""get"". Nor is there much to ""buy"".","At first glance, it seems bewildering that the insane and drug-addicted would comprise such a large percentage of the world ...

Read & Burn 02 EP,Wire,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa559d034d5c69bf3e17/1:1/w_160/252cd09d.gif,2002-10-21 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8711-read-burn-02-ep/,Pinkflag,"What band could have released not one, not two, but three historic albums (in as many years), each so different from the one that came before, simultaneously spelling out the brittle aesthetics of England's burgeoning punk movement and, in nearly the same breath, eclipsing them while the rest of the pack was still busy learning to tune their guitars? What band would be willing to then walk away from the zenith of their popularity, claiming they simply didn't have another album in them, only to resurface six years later in 1987 for a string of highly dubious (but not hopeless) new-wave castaways? What band would name one of those albums Manscape? And then, what band could spend ten more years in stasis, recuperating, biding their time for their inevitable recovery, to eventually drop a set of EP's so unique, so urgent, that it's as though the band never went away in the first place? Most importantly, even one year ago, who ever would have believed that such a stunning return was possible? No one but Wire. Read & Burn 02, the second installment of Wire's new three-part mini-series, picks up right where 01 left off; that is, nearly twenty-five years after unleashing the seminal Pink Flag, Wire is continuing to make greatness look easy. In a time when so many bands are content to adapt the sounds of twenty years ago, and The Boils and The Blah Blah Blahs will be the stars of the garage-revival revival five years down the road, it's ironic (really!) that a band that was actually around in the late seventies is releasing music relevant and modern enough that they sound almost as cutting edge now as they did two decades ago. The Read & Burn series draws unavoidably on Wire's past, but the attitude and presentation transmute these fundamentals into something distinctly new. Clockwork percussion mechanisms, guttural barking, and an abrasive storm of guitars akin to a sandpaper tornado characterized 01, and it was impressive just to hear Wire back in lean, mean fighting form. 02, however, takes these elements a step further, wringing, twisting, and torturing guitars to eke out some of the lacerating, poisonous noise (going well beyond the simple distortion of 01) for which they were famous. If not for these seething tones, 02 could easily become an echo of the first Read & Burn installment, equally impressive, but redundant. Wire's not messing around, though-- naked, venomous aggression and robotic rhythms fuse momentously with six strings' worth of their patented alien sounds. The resulting blast will leave you ducking and covering. Initially, Wire's newfound rage may be off-putting to those fans whose fondest memories of the band are from pop-informed pleasantries like ""Map Ref 41N 93W"" or ""The 15th"". And while there is some historical precedent for the sound invoked by the new material (see ""12XU"", ""Brazil"", among others), it does seem to be the case that the melodic offerings they're probably most famous for have nearly disappeared. The vocal harmonies have been completely phased out, and to some extent, the vocals themselves are of tertiary importance outside of a simple rhythmic device. Behind a smiling keyboard refrain and patches of static sweeps and synth washes, the vox on ""Read and Burn"" are a distorted, screamed rally cry solely to create a martial pace rather than any discernible content. A mutilated chant of, ""Nice streets/ Nice streets/ Nice streets above,"" punctuates an intermittent burble of reverse-recorded lyrics, suffocating as they try desperately to break the surface of ""Nice Streets Above"". It's claustrophobic, antagonistic, and wonderfully overpowering. Other songs, like the incomparable ""Raft Ants"", contain what sounds like lyrics-- though I'll give you one US dollar if you can actually discern what Bruce Gilbert is breaking his lungs to shout at you. Vocal melody is rendered obsolete (again) by the bravado of ""Raft Ants""' churning guitars. Wire chooses to supply an almost subliminal sense of melody through feedback undercurrents of whole tones, occasionally diverted by ominous breaks. The dulcet tones are pounded into the background, but rise to fore stronger despite (or because of) it. The ingenious, deep composition of ""Raft Ants"" makes an embarrassment of entirely too much music, and its interweaving of their early work with their sound from the mid-80s is too impressive to overlook. Finally, for those that still hunger for the melodious Wire of ye olde 1970s, you haven't been forgotten. ""Trash/Treasure"" is their gift to you, briefly bringing to mind the drone of ""Outdoor Miner"" as the song gradually intensifies in a haze of feedback, quickening back towards the frenetic racing speed of the rest of 02, and slowly sinking the lyrical harmonies back into the mix. If nothing else, as it returns to step with the rest, it serves as a reminder that Wire is ready to move on, which is good-- to my ears this track, though excellent, seemed like an antique in the midst of such a seamless blend of new and old. Read & Burn 02 is an unqualified improvement over the excellence of 01. Be sure to stay tuned for the final chapter in Wire's latest saga; the Brit-punk legends have justified their return, and all that's left is to turn eyes toward the future.","What band could have released not one, not two, but three historic albums (in as many years), each so different ...

WACMusic,Ill Lit,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1b9eb335119a49ed5ed/1:1/w_160/215e0aab.jpg,2002-10-21 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4075-wacmusic/,Badman,"A band name best suited for a hip-hop duo. A boombox on the cover that's straight out of Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing. And, to start the album off, a deliberate, pre-programmed drumbeat that sounds as dated as that boombox looks. At first glance, WACMusic seems an unlikely release coming from San Francisco-based Badman Recordings, which has released work from the likes of Hayden, My Morning Jacket and Red House Painters frontman Mark Kozelek-- all of them devotees of an organic, subdued sound often dubbed Americana. But Brooklyn-based duo Ill Lit soon quiet any suspicions that they deviate from this tradition, despite bearing the folktronica tag. WACMusic is, at its core, a quintessentially Badman album, albeit with some technological additives. The aforementioned opener, after all, is entitled ""Diner Girls"", so it's no surprise that the mechanized beat loses out to genuine drums and a softly strummed guitar not unlike much of the work of the band's labelmates. Within this folky vibe, however, there remains a inorganic element, as this track is imbued with the welcome sounds of a whirring keyboard. The lyrics are similarly juxtaposed. ""Americans just like to French kiss,"" leads off the male vocalist, while he later sings, in a pleasant twang, ""Aliens, they're coming for us."" Ill Lit's depiction of rural America, in other words, is not just that of cornfields, but of crop circles as well. This dynamic largely pays off in a unique, though familiar record that recalls the lost highway warmth of East River Pipe, but without the dreadful isolation. And while there are acoustic ruminations aplenty-- such as the raw, tape hiss-infused ""Options""-- there's also an uptempo rocker (""Beating the Daylights Out of My Nightlife"") and a reverb-heavy ambler (""Whitewashing""). Several numbers don't quite work. ""Prestonhood"", for instance, opens with several minutes of atmospherics-- spliced piano twinkling with bursts of lapping water and distorted vocals. A pleasant but unremarkable song emerges with the always hit-or-miss male/female vocal harmonization. A line like, ""Every hip girl I know these days likes suicide,"" doesn't help matters either. Overall, though, WACMusic is an artistic success. Don't be fooled by the bandname, album art or intermittent electronics; all of these are superficial concerns. But don't take my word for it: inside the CD case, Ill Lit assures the listener, ""We are country music."" They are, indeed-- and then some.","A band name best suited for a hip-hop duo.

Electric Heavyland,Acid Mothers Temple,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ff1c0084474cd0bfa43/1:1/w_160/067d1a48.jpg,2002-10-20 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22-electric-heavyland/,Alien8,"How much is too much? This is a question that may never have entered Acid Mothers Temple leader Kawabata Makoto's head at any point during his 25-year recording career. Ryan Schreiber made a joke earlier this week that metal was the new Japanese psychedelia, and as trends go, there are some odd similarities in their holds on indie sub-cultures-- however, while listening to AMT, it occurs to me that no other genres were required if getting heavy was the objective. More than almost any other band on the planet, Kawabata's unit consistently delivers the most over-the-top, blunt-edge psyche-thrash humanly possible. It is the ""most"", in every sense of the word. Recently, Acid Mothers have stepped beyond their hairy boundaries to try their hands at other grooves: last year's 41st Century Splendid Man LP incorporated brutal prog touches courtesy of Ruins' drummer Tatsuya Yoshida; In C found them covering minimalist Terry Riley and turning it down a notch in service of the holy drone; the three-disc AMT Family compilation featured a little bit of everything, including some hippie-fied acoustic folk. Never one to be pigeonholed, Kawabata's aim with Electric Heavyland seems to have been, ""Fuck all that, I want to BURN YOUR HOUSE DOWN."" I, for one, think he means it. From the get go, it's apparent this release is going to fall squarely in line with Acid Mothers' chaotic debut. Warped vocals and sound effects emerge from silence, swirling like backwards UFOs on ""Atomic Rotary Grinding God/Quicksilver Machine Head"" (the world's most accurate title) only to crash without warning into air-raid guitar screams, hyper-dub bass and critical engorgement of the drums. Forget the ""song"", this is a jam of the nose-rape variety, with noise-levels approaching Merzbow territory. For this number alone, AMT devour the Japanese psyche legacy-- swallowing it whole and regurgitating a thousand decibels of indecency. In the middle, they bring it down for the reappearance of the alien vocals, but then, just as quickly, launch a new jam, cosmically informed by Blue Cheer, the MC5 and Keiji Haino. And it doesn't stop there. ""Loved and Confused"" wastes no time via vocals or sound effects, and drops the apocalyptic super-rock from the start. This would be close to another Kawabata project, Musica Transonic (with Yoshida and jam-kingpin Asahito Nanjo) with the repetitive riffing and overloaded (but not necessarily anarchic) mix. What distinguishes it is AMT's signature massive reverb and tunneling effects: this jam could've existed 30 years ago but it took modern-day overkill to approach tripped-up nirvana. Too much of a good thing? Is that possible? If you make it to ""Phantom of Galactic Magnum"" (world's second most accurate title), congrats: you're doing almost as well as the guys in the band. Opening with the unmistakable bubbles of bliss and just a wee bit of droning synth, the tune begins as not so much a jam, but a spin-cycle of cosmic despair. White noise and what sound like the drastically altered vocals from the first tune get thrown around all over the place, and listening on headphones is more than disorientating. Suddenly, my world explodes as the band pounces on the joint with some hell-blues, laced with sci-fi laser transmissions. Jesus H. Fuck, this is loud. There comes a point when heavy jamming and pure noise meet, and that point is tearing shit up at this very moment. After Electric Heavyland, I'm going to need some rehab, so let me leave you with this quick thought: there are a lot of bands who would strut their freakishness by all manner of devices. Some of them adopt a crazy image or pose (exhibit A: Mortiis' nose); others do strange things on stage (defecating in front of your fans doesn't count as heavy). Acid Mothers Temple need none of that because they play the real bad stuff on a daily basis. Pick this up for reference, and while you're at it, get some tranquilizers. You'll need them.","How much is too much? This is a question that may never have entered Acid Mothers Temple leader Kawabata Makoto ...

Live at Schuba's Tavern,The Handsome Family,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c04e13d197565213ba1a/1:1/w_160/10ad5773.gif,2002-10-20 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3727-live-at-schubas-tavern/,DCN,"I once saw alt-country act Handsome Family open for Andrew Bird. I can't remember what they played or how the music sounded then, but it was hard to forget their stage presence: as hipster alt-country performers go, the Handsome Family rank among the oddest. Wife Rennie Sparks was hunched slightly over her autoharp as if to suggest a spinal disorder, wearing a worn-out dress from the Dorothea Lange collection circa 1934. Husband Brett, a solid-looking fella, mostly played guitar and sang in a deep voice that hinted at a drawl. Their husband-and-wife dynamic comes through more clearly on this live album, recorded in their then-hometown of Chicago. The Digital Club Network, a website that hosts hundreds of webcasts from rock clubs around the country, taped the show at Schuba's on December 8th, 2000. Featuring Brett, Rennie, and a drum machine, Live at Schuba's Tavern has seventeen of their ""greatest hits"", with confident, if not revelatory, performances. And you also get their stage show. Between songs, Rennie and Brett tease each other and tell jokes and stories-- particularly Rennie, who picks on Brett's family, tells a fake-miracle story, and reminisces about old gigs. The first time you hear this stuff it's funny; the second time, it's already stale, like listening to a bad comedy album. But if you make it to a fourth or fifth time, the routine starts to grow on you, like any married couples' stories that you have to hear again and again-- you're used to them, or at least, you know when they'll end. During this schtick, Rennie tells most of the jokes and non-sequiturs, like the quip about how her cats want to steal her diamonds. Get it? It's funny 'cause it's weird. They're the flipside of her lyrics, the ""light quirk"" next to the ""dark quirk"" of the songwriting. Rennie wrote the words to all but one of these songs, and the morbid imagery, drunken losers and clever death scenes are as harmlessly gruesome as, say, the illustrations of Edward Gorey-- without the pointed humor. Rennie is a gifted lyricist, and the songs are full of great lines and images. ""Drunk by Noon"", from 1996's Milk and Scissors, is believably bitter: ""Sometimes I can't wait to come down with cancer/ At least then I'll get to watch TV all day."" And ""I Know You Are There,"" from last year's Twilight, where they switch off the drum machine that accompanies most of their songs, sounds pious. But it's hard to get past the strange-for-strangeness'-sake tone of most of the songs: they're about sad stuff but don't sound sad, as if talking about death is just a way to give weight to eccentricity. It's about as haunting as a Mexican Day of the Dead figure knocked over on your dashboard. In contrast to his wife, Brett is the sure and steady one. As the composer of all of the music, Brett's written some good tunes, including ""Amelia Earhart vs. The Dancing Bear"", with its dreamy imagery of Earhart's last moments and Brett's great flaming-fuselage guitar solo. But on other tracks, the yokelized veneer wears thin. The songs are so stubbornly midtempo that it makes you wonder if they jammed their drum machine. And the melodies can get stereotypically folksy, like In the Air's ""The Sad Milkman"", which cribs ""On Top of Old Smokey""; or the procession of ballads like ""My Ghost"" or ""So Much Wine"", which are individually good but cumulatively homogenous. Brett has a strong, rich voice, but you can get too used to hearing the same reverb-assisted declaiming from the plain tone on every track. But it's preferable to Rennie's. She sings lead vocals on ""Down in the Ground"", and her shrieking, slicing voice could make dead people climb from their graves to come and slap her. So as you might have guessed, an hour of the concert may be more than you need unless you're a hardcore fan. On the other hand, the best thing about the disc is the lack of editing or polish. By leaving in so much of their banter-- both funny and not-- and the occasional mistakes, Live at Schuba's Tavern feels like a night with the Sparks'. It's more intimate than a big name live album: you get to hear a married couple make fun of each other and have a good time together. Just don't forget who wears the pants in this family-- it's Rennie who gets to put all the words in Brett's mouth.","I once saw alt-country act Handsome Family open for Andrew Bird.

The King of Nothing Hill,Barry Adamson,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a008c0084474cd0bfa7a/1:1/w_160/bb1185ba.jpg,2002-10-20 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/47-the-king-of-nothing-hill/,Mute,"Have you invented a genre lately? It's probably safe to bet that you haven't, and there's really no shame in that-- not many people ever do. In fact, these days it may be impossible to even do it at all, given how much ground has been covered and how much exposure we all have to so many different forms of media every day-- chances are it would just turn out to be a subgenre of something else. Still, I'd like to posit that Barry Adamson has come pretty damn close to pulling it off. Most of you probably know Adamson from somewhere-- he first came to fame laying down the basslines for Howard Devoto's Magazine, later backing Nick Cave as a member of both the Birthday Party and the Bad Seeds. Then, after departing from the Bad Seeds in 1987, he set forth on an interesting solo career that found him diving full-force into dark, cinematic music that seemed an entirely natural outgrowth of his past work. When we last left him in 1998, he hit us with As Above, So Below, a superlative offering that found him wandering down jazz noir alleys and finding that there was actually quite a bit of room to rock down there. Four years later, he's back with King of Nothing Hill, and it's clear that all that time spent touring popular music's darkest recesses has left an indelible mark on him. The man can't even get funky without first setting an ominous tone. In short, this is what it may have sounded like had George Clinton commissioned Angelo Badalamenti and Peter Christopherson to write music for Hey, Man, Smell My Finger-- it's music that begs you to simultaneously cast a paranoid eye over your shoulder and get on the good foot. It's hard to lay your finger on it, but Adamson himself may have hit on a name for his own little subgenre in the title of opening song: ""Cinematic Soul"". The song itself is such a ridiculous combination of old-school funk's party atmosphere and creeping, electronically skewered art-rock that it almost has to work, solely on the strength of sheer inventiveness. Granted, it's awkwardly funky, and there's one moment where Adamson just loses it. (Memo to musicians everywhere: don't bring your grade-school aged kid in to sing along on any song, even for a brief moment. It didn't work for Art Garfunkel; it didn't work for Eminem; it doesn't work for Barry Adamson.) This vomit-coaxing misstep is hardly enough derail Adamson's soul train, though, as he rapidly branches out, aggressively covering all kinds of ground, from surf electronica (""The Crime Scene"") to vamping jazz noir with an insistent swing to it (""Les Matin de Noire""). He tries his hand at some genuinely soulful singer/songwriter type stuff on ""That Fool Was Me"" with great success, though he cleverly subverts it with a bizarre, inventive horn arrangement that owes a huge debt to Charles Mingus. Lyrically, Adamson sticks primarily to topics you might expect to ooze from music like this, from his first-person hitman narrative on the relentlessly upbeat ""Whispering Streets"" to the comical Barry White-throated ""Satisfaction Jackson"" persona he adopts on ""Black Amour"". Perhaps the most impressive element of the album, though, is just the sound of it-- constantly swirling and shifting textures, cut through with sweeping strings, slicing electronics and startlingly atonal bursts of piano and violin. Adamson produced it himself, and his skill at the board is remarkable; every sound fits exactly where it should and even the most bombastic moments don't feel overbearing. Adamson has managed yet another fine addition to his long career with King of Nothing Hill, a unique, gripping listen that's certainly not for everyone, but manages to carve out an appealing niche for itself. There are times when it doesn't work especially well, but these are more than made up for by the instances where it hits and Adamson truly seems to be forging something of his own. Anyone looking to fill that spot in their collection where icy noir and funk meet should be nicely appeased by this one.","Have you invented a genre lately?

The Suntanama,Suntanama,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5c5ea9e61561daa51fa/1:1/w_160/7992e73a.jpg,2002-10-20 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7594-the-suntanama/,Drag City,"Last I heard, the Marshall Tucker Band and Molly Hatchet had each been banished to their own respective state and county fair circuits, allowed to play no further than 100 yards from the nearest ring-toss or cotton candy machine. This was right and just. But apparently, someone out there interpreted their absence from the recording studio as an abhorrent vacuum that must be filled, lest the universe lose precious balance. Enter The Suntanama, who seem to be filling in for both of those bands on their self-titled debut, right down to the flute-inflected knock-off blues. They even have three guys who play guitar (albeit not always at the same time). I seem to remember, in the late 90s, everyone looking around trying to find ""The American Radiohead"", a pursuit that proved fruitless. I'm fairly certain that I never heard of anyone seeking ""The American Gomez"", but I have definitely just inadvertently discovered it. To their credit, The Suntanama focus only on one sound, tackling it with apparent feeling instead of grasping at genre-bending straws in the manner of their UK colleagues, but the result is still largely the same: limp, unpalatable blues ""rock"". At the center of a concentric ring of problems lies vocalist Darren Zoltowski, whose voice is powerful in all the wrong ways. He can project well, but in doing so, he tramples any semblance of coherence he may have otherwise had. For the sake of mathematical simplicity, let's assume there are exactly 100 words of lyric on this album. Out of that, you may be able to understand roughly 13. And of those, probably 12 of them would be in track two, ""And So the Story Goes"", where Zoltowski sings something about carrying a heavy load and something to the effect of, ""I'll benawonatyoucahh lean onaahhh"". Usually, he just wails in his gravelly way, mouthing syllables that never amount to anything you could get points off in a Scrabble match. Zoltowski is abetted by a quintet that plugs away with a remarkable lack of focus-- a decent little groove pops up now and then, but the guitars take more noodle time in a day than the whole population of Thailand. Oddly, when Zoltowski clams up at the end of ""Corduroy Lawsuit"", finally throwing the spotlight to the guitars, they shy away from playing anything that sounds too soloish, almost as if they're afraid they may actually come up with something good. The song putters to a limp close that evokes the Allman Brothers playing through the nastiest coke haze of their lives. No, scratch that-- Duane Allman could play with more conviction than this if you broke his fingers. And there you have it. Not much going on in the land of The Suntanama. Even the formidable producer/engineer combo of Neil Michael Hagerty and Brian Paulson couldn't coax any life out of these proceedings. Seriously, if you're looking to hear a bunch of white guys try their hands at some routine blues stuff, go pick up a Canned Heat album. Meanwhile, look for The Suntanama on the marquee at your next three-town fair.","Last I heard, the Marshall Tucker Band and Molly Hatchet had each been banished to their own respective state and ...

Bonus Album,The Blow,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3169d034d5c69bf2d39/1:1/w_160/9e9c9db3.jpg,2002-10-17 05:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/812-bonus-album/,K,"Not, of course, a reference to that Johnny Depp vehicle, and for god's sake, don't even think about shoving this disc up your nose. Don't suppose, either, that The Blow-- aka Khaela Maricich, one of many female voices that have popped up on records by the Microphones-- runs in the same pastoral/naturalist vein as its parent band. No, Maricich was thinking of another connotation entirely when renaming herself, and, judging from her third release, it's just about all she thinks about. More succinct and a hell of a lot more direct about her fixations than Maricich's previous touring moniker (the backhandedly suggestive Get the Hell Out of the Way of the Volcano), the name also belies Bonus Album's sometimes playfully, sometimes annoyingly juvenile approach to music-- and sex. Maricich's last two releases were primarily stripped-down acoustic affairs, but Bonus Album brings in more accompaniment in an attempt to expand her horizons. Unfortunately, there seems to be a lot of fruitless groping around for a sound here. The more minimal songs, consisting only of Maricich's squeaky but serviceable multi-tracked voice, are maddeningly solipsistic; ""She Buried Herself in the Air"" and ""Sing Like Kyle"" (as in Kyle Field of another Microphones-related project, Little Wings), are too underdeveloped and formless to make an impression, while ""The Touch-Me"" struts along convincingly but gets bogged down in retreaded automobile imagery. In ""The Moon is There, I Am Here"", the observations don't get any deeper than the title, and the affectedly awkward, clipped, Difranco-ish phrasing doesn't change that one bit. There's hope, though. Maricich's scientific side gets a better airing on ""The Democracy of Small Things"", where an interesting device (she converses with her own molecules in an attempt to get her urges in agreement) and a feverish synthesizer pulse pleasantly collide. And ""Some Chocolates"" could be a standard for weird little girls everywhere, with Microphones cohort Mirah leading an odd, insanely catchy pat-a-cake chant: ""I brought you back some chocolates/ But they weren't made of chocolates/ They were made of the shapes of my mouth when I'm talking to you."" The occasionally blatant come-ons and ""jump-rope rhythms"" recall Liz Phair, though Maricich's best shots aren't nearly as troubled or troubling as, say, ""I'll fuck you till your dick is blue"". At most, Maricich is like Phair's little sister doing anatomically correct crayon drawings for you to hang on the fridge. Ooooh, and Phil Elvrum's come to play! And he brought his drums. He deserves cookies, cookies, cookies for joining his Microphones-mate on ""Watch the Water Roll Up"", a loose, danceable rhumba tune whose fuller production (pianos, bass, Elvrum's percussion cornucopia) and unpredictable structural swerves provide a welcome change of pace, not just from the rest of the record, but from the original acoustic-and-voice version which appeared on Maricich's 2000 debut, Everyday Examples of People Facing Straight Into the Blow. . The confounding ""Little Sally Tutorial"", however, brings us right back to where we started. Maricich deadpans the instructions for a kid's song-and-dance game, and, with most of the K Records family joining in, it sounds like Summer Camp for the Prematurely Ironic. Sure, it's kinda funny to hear Calvin Johnson's basso profundo in a song you might've sung as a kid, but here, as on most of the album, a very subjective sort of nostalgia is at work.

Broken Spindles,Broken Spindles,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3b0c0084474cd0c030e/1:1/w_160/eb2aaaa8.jpg,2002-10-17 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/956-broken-spindles/,Tiger Style,"Broken Spindles is an instrumental outfit helmed by Joel Peterson. Joel Peterson is the bassist for The Faint, the one with the 80s-est hair, supposedly the perfectionist of the band, whose recalcitrant onstage sunken-Anglo concentration-face often looks like scorn for us needbags in the crowd. The Faint is that group whose first album wrapped lame lyrics around captivating guitar hooks, and whose second album wrapped wild keyboards around libidinal screeds. Their third and most consistent album further out-techs their previous work, but already sounds dated, and not for some obvious retro-reason: the industrial hellscape they conjure brings to mind too many Reznorisms and too many straight-to-video fallout movies about people in leather fighting in derbymobiles for some weird commodities like amethysts. The Faint's a blast live, though, revving up their smoke machines and waving their synth-free hands around like a bunch of dang incubuses. They're one of Saddle Creek's treats. Saddle Creek's that Omaha-centric label run by that elfin fellow with the bright eyes. I can't make fun of him anymore because I was just wowed by a performance he did with his gazillion piece ensemble, during which he kept his afterschool psychodrama to a minimum, except for a spell where he overscratched his arm in faux-torment. Joel Peterson can be spotted in photos all over the Internet rubbing or squeezing or holding his arm, too. Maybe the gubmint's testing something on them Nebraskans that's giving them a rash, and their anti-consumer stance won't yield to facilitate the purchase of some Benadryl. Or maybe Peterson's arm is tired from programming all this percussive racket for this Broken Spindles project. There's always something kind of test tube baby about laptopica, but Peterson found interesting ways to grant his record some organic textures; though a bit of the disc was composed using Reason software and sounds to some degree like what you'd expect in a Faint instrumental piece, the album benefits from guest guitarists, live bells, chimes and odd instruments, and some burbly-gurgly-crackly undertones that link several tracks, occasionally reminiscent of crinkling fabric or a palpitating heart. The disc is too propulsive to be background music, but too modest to be your evening's main event. When the songs slow down (see ""The Oldest Accident"") they unfold fluidly and not unlike patches of Tortoise's Millions Now Living Will Never Die, bringing to mind a visit to the world's hippest indoor aquarium. The slithering jackhammer ""Connection in Progress"" is the antithesis of the mellow material, with its grinding beats and frenetic guitars (listen for some Iron Maiden polish-reewwl scattered throughout). The beginning of ""Twitching and Restless"" is perfect for a watching miserable retirees and pregnant smokers trigger their car alarms in a depressing parking lot, until its last nine minutes, when it erupts into a digital slurry. Sounds like Mad Max using a Jiffy Lube's equipment to perform orthodontics in Voltron's womb. Or maybe like Chernobyl's hedges being trimmed by a 767 piloted by vomiting zomborgs having a marital squabble. So I'm getting all into the album, and a friend starts trashing it; some of her best lines were: ""Whip out the glowsticks, we're going to a Tampa nightclub""; ""This must be what plays during the gripping chase scene""; and ""Didn't Sam Prekop release this four years ago?"" Ah well. I predict that we'll lose Joel Peterson to scoring-- Broken Spindles sprang from an attempt to soundtrack a skateboard vid, and at live appearances, he's playing the music as accompaniment to a film. I think he's got a miniature monolith in him yet, though, provided Broken Spindles survives the ""Damaged Goods"" tour with Crooked Fingers, Burning Airlines, and Twisted Sister.","Broken Spindles is an instrumental outfit helmed by Joel Peterson.

Plays,Ekkehard Ehlers,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1579d034d5c69bf2932/1:1/w_160/6c5bdd38.jpg,2002-10-17 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2691-plays/,Staubgold,"Over the last year and a half German composer Ekkehard Ehlers recorded a series of EPs and singles with the same theme. Ehlers would compose two tracks that referenced the work of an artist he admired and release the results under the title Plays. The first clue that these tracks are not proper covers or derived primarily from samples comes from the fact that one release in the Plays series references a filmmaker (Ekkehard Ehlers Plays John Cassavetes) while another pays homage to a writer (Ekkehard Ehlers Plays Hubert Fichte). Only Matthew Herbert could figure out a way to work samples of a book into his tracks; Ehlers interprets. This release collects all the tracks from the Plays series onto a single CD. It's a varied set-- some tracks are nothing but ambient laptop murmurs, others build on dense drones, and a couple contain beautiful string arrangements that would do the Penguin Caf√© Orchestra proud. The music is accessible without the concept, but still, the first instinct upon hearing it is naturally to try and decipher the relationships between the tracks and the referenced artist. I know Albert Ayler and Robert Johnson best, so I dug into these first. Both of the two Plays Albert Ayler tracks are comprised of cello samples, played by Anka Hirsch and recorded by Ehlers. It might be the Rorschach effect, but I think I can hear the Ayler referencing in track 7. When Ehlers chops the samples into small pieces and strings them together, they sound to me phrased like an Ayler solo, full of abandon even as they stay anchored to a melodic center. The strings also bring to mind Ayler's band circa In Greenwich Village, when he brilliantly incorporated violin and cello. The two Plays Robert Johnson tracks make similar allusions. Ehlers plucks, samples and processes a guitar on track 9, referencing the vocal cry of Johnson's slide (and possibly mixing it with hints of the real thing). Track 10 definitely samples Johnson, with a small bit of a guitar riff added for rhythm and a compressed bit of the famous high-pitched vocals serving as a chorus. This last track is an anomaly on Plays, as the lifts from Johnson are inserted into the context of a minimal house track, giving the final piece the feel of a stripped down, easygoing Soul Center. Whatever references exist for the remaining three artists mean nothing to me. Google tells me that novelist Hubert Fichte was the German Jean Genet, exposing the Rhineland to homosexuality as a subject for literature. The tracks bearing his name are okay, but I like them the least of any here. Both are composed in a glitch style that reminds me a lot of Microstoria, with interesting noises popping in and out of the mix. In a similar style but superior is the first track of Plays Cornelius Cardew, with the warm organ chords Microstoria sometimes indulges in. The two Plays Cassavetes tracks, by contrast, are stunning. The first is an impossibly lush and vaporous swath of synth chords that should lead off the next edition of Kompakt's Pop Ambient series. The second is a string quartet playing the same phrase repeatedly over the course of ten minutes with only slight variation-- it sounds like a recipe for tedium, but I can't convey how beautiful this track is. And that's the key thread running through all of Ekkehard Ehlers-- it's so easy and so pleasurable to pay little attention to the concept and drink in the crystalline beauty of the sound.","Over the last year and a half German composer Ekkehard Ehlers recorded a series of EPs and singles with the ...

Exitheuxa,GoGoGo Airheart,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf52ea9e61561daa7a40/1:1/w_160/483f249e.jpg,2002-10-16 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3492-exitheuxa/,Gold Standard Laboratories,"So listen, it would bore both of us for me to run through the canon of British post-punk and 70s NYC rock bands to whom San Diego's GoGoGo Airheart owes some debts. The other day, I was reading a music magazine that actually started comparing new bands to the Liars, that new act has suffered under so much namedropping that you can now use them as shorthand for a whole bunch of other bands: PiL, Gang of Four, etc, etc, etc. So rather than play rock paleontologist and dig up old bands that GoGoGo Airheart reminds us of, let's look at what makes them different. You can hear echoes of many styles in Exitheuxa, their fourth full-length, but nothing undercuts their own sound. Michael Vermillion and bassist Ashish Vyas swap lead vocals; Benjamin White plays lead guitar, sometimes joined by Vermillion; and J Frederic Hough plays drums. The overall impression is of loose, easy-paced rock, back from the beach but ready for business, and injected with some post-punk to make it more jagged. It's not uptight enough to sound spastic or jittery, but at times it gets squirrely-- for example, in both singers' wavery, twisted vocals that occasionally (but only occasionally) break or yelp. And there are the guitars, ragged and raucous but locked in a firm power-sharing arrangement with a stand-up rhythm section. The album's greatest strength is its easy inventiveness. The songs go from a reggae beat on ""Witch Hunt"" to minute-and-a-half rock blasts like ""Sit and Stare""; Jason Crane's trumpet rings over the sparse guitars and bass of ""Nice Up the Dance"", and the organ on ""Meet Me at the Movies"" pastes an accordion-like sound on the song's exotic slow pace. Taken apart, it's surprising how different each of the tracks seem, and more surprising, that they fit together seamlessly: instead of throwing a dozen influences in your face, the band seems to ease into new tactics and make themselves at home. All that keeps Exitheuxa from being exceptional is that the songwriting, while solid, could use more stand-out hooks. ""Here Comes Attack"" and ""Sincerely P.S."" include some great riffs, ""When the Flesh Hits"" has a casual but catchy dance beat, and Vyas doesn't play a single dull bassline: many of his parts are insidious, especially on ""Nice Up the Dance"" and ""My Baby Has a Gang (Sign Our Hearts)"". But it's the album as a whole that sticks in your mind. It's extremely cohesive and assured-- the kind of rare disc that can justify every strange direction it takes.","So listen, it would bore both of us for me to run through the canon of British post-punk and 70s ...

Man Am I Brad,Everybody Uh Oh,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcbaeb335119a49ecd1d/1:1/w_160/5257ec46.jpg,2002-10-16 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2853-man-am-i-brad/,Arborvitae,"The scene: a sparsely populated circus tent on the outskirts of Springfield, Illinois. No one is quite sure what they're doing there, except that they had nothing better to do on a Friday night than attend some $8 showcase for ""up and coming"" area bands. Naturally, everyone is skeptical and drunk but for the ringmaster-- er, emcee. ""Ladies and gentlemen,"" he bellows out, extending his right arm, ""hailing from Champaign-Urbana... the indie-pop Mecca that brought you Braid, Wolfie, Hum, and of course, REO Speedwagon... let me introduce the hottest new band to follow in these footsteps... everybody please welcome... Everybody Uh Oh!"" Everybody in the crowd says, ""Uh-oh."" They are being funny, of course, and they laugh at their collective joke. A bold, scrappy teenager yells ""uh-oh"" again, but no one laughs, and someone tells him that ""that joke has already been done, dude,"" which, in turn, prompts a few scattered laughs. ""No, no, no."" The emcee is already frustrated with these kids, these goddamn kids who wouldn't know talent if it unzipped their pants and gave them the best fucking blowjob of their lives. ""That's the name of the band,"" he says. Everybody moans, ""Ohhhh,"" drawing it out as only disaffected teens can, or will. Then, right on cue, four guys lumber out. No one in the crowd claps or yells out. They are judging, lest they be judged. The band's debut, Man Am I Brad, is supposed to be some cross between Neutral Milk Hotel, Smashing Pumpkins, and Yo La Tengo. But as head songwriter Jeremy Keller eases into the slowcore of ""Eunice"", an observer finely points out that, instead, the band sounds ""like a cross between piss and shit."" Perhaps Keller thinks he can connect with his audience with such lines as, ""All the kids are out tonight,"" but he is wrong. As the song drags on past the six-minute mark, the hope heard in the lyrics is drowned out by the kids, who are out tonight, and for whom all hope of a good time is passing. ""Serious Mode"" is the band's attempt to liven things up. There's a peppy drumbeat and even a tambourine. Then the lead singer has to open his mouth again: ""I feel so tired 'cause I'm not awake/ You feel you need more."" Then it's all about not stopping: ""It's up to you."" And he sings this over and over until people are blatantly wincing. Everybody Uh-Oh then breaks out its drum machine, first for a inoffensive stab at a Death Cab for Cutie jingle, then for a terrible tune that shifts from Magnetic Fields simplicity to like a Hum-like thrasher in which Keller asks, ""How will they know that I'm rock 'n' roll?"" Some guy in the back quips, ""We'll be sure to let them know!"" Beer cans are being hurled by the time the band plays ""Keeping Up with the Joneses"", in which the group approximates ""Cherub Rock""-era Smashing Pumpkins, except with even worse lyrics. ""The Trees of Prentiss"" is a better Death Cab try and wouldn't have pissed anyone off if not for lines like, ""Paul says that I waste my time and kids bobbing heads is a victimless crime."" The kids don't even stick around for the remaining songs, let alone the next band. They have heard enough amateurish, repetitive songwriting for the night and they've got better things to do-- like stand in parking lots and take the long way home. Most leave without a word, but the scrappy kid, seeking redemption, yells out, ""The next REO Speedwagon, my ass!"" Everyone laughs, and he is perhaps the only one who goes home happy.","The scene: a sparsely populated circus tent on the outskirts of Springfield, Illinois. No one is quite sure what they ...

Perfecting Loneliness,Jets to Brazil,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9f55e6ef95969322aac/1:1/w_160/31cf2e13.gif,2002-10-16 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4249-perfecting-loneliness/,Jade Tree,"Having departed from indie-punk heroes Jawbreaker for the pastoral, poppier life with Jets to Brazil, Blake Schwarzenbach uncovered new potential in the energetic, ear-catching progressions of Orange Rhyming Dictionary. It was a running gag between me and my friends to dismiss the album with a simple, ""Yeah, but it's no Jawbreaker""-- but it was just a joke; the promise of Dictionary's easy hooks was self-evident. In the span of just one album, though, what began as a simple joke became a grim portent; not only was the abysmal Four Cornered Night ""not Jawbreaker"", but it wasn't much of anything else, either. Night's impossibly bland pop banality was so cautious and inoffensive, so ""common denominator"", it stood a better chance at being elected for the senate than pleasing the fans. If anyone had any doubts that Schwarzenbach blew his load on Orange Rhyming Dictionary, Perfecting Loneliness will likely only confirm your fears. It's a sad example of a few decent arrangements being recycled and regurgitated until, by the end of the album, there's nothing left but pre-chewed, partially digested gunk. There are few inspired moments, but the bright spots come mostly at the beginning, and afterwards, the album slips slowly into a seemingly infinite loop of predictable refrains and forced emotion. Try as I might, I couldn't avoid the sensation of feeling my opinion of the album decrementing in .1's and .2's with every passing track. There's a little to look forward to, though: the first four tracks alone beat the pants off of the entirety of Four Cornered Night. ""The Frequency"" opens the album on a high note with a fascinating blend of Jets to Brazil's old, melodic power-pop and a hint of Built to Spill's searing instrumental prowess. Similarly, the tuneful malevolence of the title track is genuinely refreshing before turning full-circle to a lazy forgiveness. It's a single in the truest sense of the word-- single-handedly encompassing the breadth of pop attitudes, with all the requisite emotional highs and lows, in a league all by itself. Each of those cuts swell past the five-minute mark, though even with my short attention span, it didn't bother me. What did is that Perfecting Loneliness' shameless filler material is similarly bloated with extended choral refrains and lengthy outros, ushering these weak, lifeless tracks past the realm of boredom and into true, four-cylindered wankery. ""Autumn Walker"", for example, nearly separates itself from homogeneity with an incredible grinding guitar swell and stirring chorus, but as three minutes of interest slowly drag into five minutes of broken-record repetition, its standout characteristics eventually get lost in the shuffle. Few bands can boast albums that don't contain at least some padding, but why someone would choose to drag their obvious missteps out to epic lengths is incomprehensible. To round out the tragic self-importance of these slothful juggernauts, Schwarzenbach contributes his traditionally sincere, emotive vocal stylings. Usually, he's fine; a little overbearingly plaintive at times, but okay nonetheless. His lyrical ability has fallen off some over the years, though, and when lyrics like ""God is dumb/ God is great/ Does he loves us all the same?/ Are we okay?"" (from ""Psalm"") are combined with a delivery so pleadingly earnest it could go to camp. If these faults were isolated incidents, they wouldn't be as crippling, but too often here they hit all at once like Zangief-style triple-combos. As Schwarzenbach sings on ""The Frequency"", ""When the measure of your work/ Is the measure of your worth/ Then you'd better make it work."" If Jets to Brazil heeded their own advice, they might bolster their slumping stock and try to recapture some of the invention of their debut rather than comfortably descend into pop mediocrity. Though numbers like ""You're the One"" and ""Cat Heaven"" give Perfecting Loneliness the dubious distinction of being less painful than the dental academy root-canal action of Four Cornered Night, this isn't the return to form any of us had hoped for.","Having departed from indie-punk heroes Jawbreaker for the pastoral, poppier life with Jets to Brazil, Blake Schwarzenbach uncovered new potential ...

This is Motion,Melochrome,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c42013d197565213beac/1:1/w_160/7f7aad5f.gif,2002-10-16 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5213-this-is-motion/,Loosethread,"There are certain adjectives I'm required to use when discussing a band like Melochrome. So let's just get them out of the way right off the bat, okay? Let's see: warm, hazy, ambient, spacey, dreamy, textured, soothing. Kinda sounds like a Brian Eno production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, but it sets up a pretty clear model of what Melochrome dishes out on This is Motion. If you're an especially astute listener, you can probably already call the instruments in play: heavily reverbed guitar, warbling Rhodes electric piano, whisper-brushed drums, and occasional sound effects and rattles for atmosphere. Throw in a sense of pacing learned from Low and Sigur R√≥s records and a syrupy croon like Prekop's before he met Joe Camel, and you've got yourself the downright wooze-inducing Melochrome sound. The album title and the almost-title track ""Music for Motion"" might claim ""we've got music made of motion,"" but I'm here to tell you-- it's a goddamn lie! Of course, motion isn't typically the aim of this kind of music, so despite that ridiculous assertion, we're all good. In fact, This is Motion's forty minutes do exactly what the band surely intends it to do, that being to erect the sonic equivalent of green tea, a foot massage, and a hot face towel. The quartet might not shift out of quiet vamp gear for the album's entire duration, but that just makes all the pieces of flair that much more noticeable. Take the brass punctuation of ""So We're Finally Moving On"", for instance, or the subtly tape-tweaked cymbal bed on ""Seaside Instrumental"". Like most bands of their ilk, Melochrome tends to dart back and forth across the line separating easy listening from E-Z listening. Opening their mouths usually doesn't help; ""Catalina Girls"" features a female lead vocal from the Sade school, and the hushed lullaby stylings used on ""Out Late"" may insure heavy rotation at the dentist's office. The horns are also never again utilized quite as well as they are on ""So We're Finally Moving On"", taking on a sort of unnecessary constant cascade throughout ""Stereo City"" and ""Catalina Girls"" that'll nag your thoughts for weeks as to what post-rock ditty it emulates. (I'll save you the trouble: it's Tortoise's ""Swing from the Gutters"".) So I'd recommend This is Motion, but only for certain situations. Never listen to This is Motion before 2:30pm, except on Sundays; This is Motion is for sunsets, not sunrises. If you'd like to make out to This is Motion, wait until the fourth week of the relationship, unless your date is from Georgia, in which case you should probably wait until the fifth. All mixtapes containing tracks from This is Motion should contain only sepia-toned artwork. And be sure to use at least two of the above-mentioned required adjectives when endorsing it to friends.","There are certain adjectives I'm required to use when discussing a band like Melochrome.

Chapel of the Chimes EP,Xiu Xiu,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aacd13d1975652139ad2/1:1/w_160/e4870434.gif,2002-10-15 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8824-chapel-of-the-chimes-ep/,Absolutely Kosher,"Angst. Some bands hit you with it like a blunt object; Xiu Xiu wields theirs like a supersharp wakizashi. The Asian percussion, junkyard chimes and jagged electronics that surround Jamie Stewart's overwrought vocals are so over-the-top distressed, they'll either rivet you or fray your last nerve. There are many ways to hate Xiu Xiu. You can criticize the sincerity of Stewart's performance. Nobody gets that depressed: in our culture, we experience unhappiness but we don't (figuratively) vomit all over ourselves to express it, so it's partly his fault if he seems somewhat insincere. Then there's the aesthetic problem: the piercing first tracks of their debut, Knife Play, drove some people out of the room before they even cared where Stewart was coming from. And while some would find them too noisy, noise geeks play harder stuff than this at Sunday brunch. But to sweat all that is to forget that sometimes, it's fun just to bang on stuff and shriek, and that's where Xiu Xiu excels. Their sonic palette won't make waves in the new music world, but it sounds exhilarating in this brutally expressive, and often catchy, avant-pop context. Now, only months after the release of their debut, Xiu Xiu has issued an EP, Chapel of the Chimes, and once again, they deftly mix chaos with concentration to create pieces that sound spontaneous, yet are intensely precise. And the emotional extremes are cathartic in their own theatrical, witch doctored-way. On ""I Am Center of Your World"", Stewart sings like Bryan Ferry after twelve hours of torture. It's like they just yanked the electrodes off his privates and handed him the mike. He eeks out the lyrics in a faltering voice that's strained, believable, and yet also, strangely, romantically expressive. He's helped by the music, which is darkly fragile and fleetingly beautiful. A low, rapid-heartbeat bassline runs under the song, and a staggering piano and flourishes of chimes break out of the near-silence like a burst of light before he passes out. In contrast, ""Jennifer Lopez (Sweet Science Mix)"" is blaringly loud and single-mindedly abrasive. Raw-bowed cello, a drum kit and piercing electronics burn around Stewart's indecipherable exclamations. The song's multi-layered arrangement melts down to a concise attack. But the middle tracks flag. ""10-Thousand-Times-A-Minute"", solid but less remarkable, delivers its melody through an echoed, blatting sound like farting into a cistern. Stewart again sounds pained and strained, but he's at odds with the mushy context. The next track is career-record quiet: ""King Earth, King Earth"", a thin watercolor where the different tones float through too easily. It's subtle and nearly peaceful, but too vague to make an impression. So, after all that, who couldn't use a nice cover song? Xiu Xiu closes with Joy Division's ""Ceremony"", the most ecstatic track on the album. They maintain the tempo and spirit of the original, but boldly replace the guitars and drums with-- guess what!-- harsh electronics and a crateful of percussion. Stewart, keyed up to shrieks, seems to act out everything that might have been going on in a morose Ian Curtis' head. If nothing else, it's a confident reworking. I can't speak for whether Joy Division fans would find this creative or repellant, but I think it's a raucous, chimy good time. Sure, Curtis was more convincingly miserable-- but look what happened to him.","Angst. Some bands hit you with it like a blunt object; Xiu Xiu wields theirs like a supersharp wakizashi. The ...

Nothing,Meshuggah,by: Isaiah Violante,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c44969fc7814a47cd84f/1:1/w_160/1232fd08.jpg,2002-10-15 05:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5249-nothing/,Nuclear Blast,"Alright, it's confession time. I am one of the dozens of hapless people who's purchased tickets for Ozzfest each of the last three years. Yes, I was one of the people who spent $6 on a plastic goldfish bowl full of yeast-flavored piss last year hoping to make forty-five minutes of Chester Bennington more palatable. But, aside from attracting what Bill Hicks might have referred to as America's greatest anti-culture trainwreck, Ozzfest has been the only successful metal festival in the United States. Other than boasting the weakest lineup the festival had seen in the spring and summer of 2002, this white trash cash cow was marred by everything from Sharon Osbourne's colon cancer (and Ozzy's subsequent defection), to the accidental death of Drowning Pool frontman Dave Williams, to Zakk Wylde collapsing on stage during a European stop. In spite of these tragedies-- or perhaps because of them-- Sweden's Meshuggah found themselves thrust to the critical forefront of a lineup sporting names like System of a Down, Andrew WK, Adema, and Rob Zombie. When an erroneously named metal festival suddenly cow-tows to MTV's favorite faux-angst trendkill the results promise to be disastrous. Following a mind-numbing thirty-five minutes from that M√∂tley Cr√ºe guy with a huge cock, I happened to overhear a conversation between two Abercrombie & Fitch-clad metalheads standing a few inches in front of me: Yuppie Spawn 1: ""Tommy Lee was awesome. I was, like, holy shit, he kicked so much ass."" Yuppie Spawn 2: ""Oh totally. I think those Meshugenah [sic] guys were pretty hard too."" Yuppie Spawn 1: ""Yeah, those guys were okay but they weren't nearly as hard as P.O.D are gonna be. You've seen their video for 'Youth of the Nation', right? Word. That's deep. And that Christian shit is off the hook."" Other than serving as a sweeping argument for the decline of western civilization, this conversation seems to echo the bastardization that has beset heavy music in recent years and, to an extent, forever. For better or worse, watered-down minor key riffs with coherent vocals have become a fixture of the alternative metal scene. Meshuggah fly directly in the face of the status quo where mainstream metal is concerned, albeit in a way that's guaranteed to send our Abe & Fitch pals screaming for their Paxil. Sure, Meshuggah's 2002 release, Nothing, doesn't redefine artistic parameters-- this band is not about innovation. Sweden's seminal metal amalgam has remained true to their ideology since forming in 1987, churning out beefy, intricate hard rock songs with off-kilter tempos, ample polyrhythms, and caustic vocals. Incorporating elements of Pantera, Cannibal Corpse, Immolation, and Nile, Nothing is decidedly all Meshuggah for fifty solid minutes. Refining their sound to a more relaxed musical approach than recent efforts Destroy Erase Improve and Chaosphere, Meshuggah have retained all of their muscle but with more spacious arrangements. ""Straws Pulled at Random"" spotlights the band's talent for hammering out precise cadence amidst waves of ambient eight-string guitar tonalities and slowly morphing repetitiveness. Guitarist Frederik Thordendal slips into an eerie romantic solo while drummer Tomas Haake, bassist Gustaf Hielm, and rhythm guitarist M√•rten Hagstr√∂m lock into a frenetic groove. As the rhythm section's dissonance grows, Thordendal's harmonics evolve masterfully, challenging the listener to dissociate melody from repetition. ""Rational Gaze"" builds upon a similar dynamic with the guttural sludge of vocalist Jens Kidman occupying a more significant share of the canvas, similar in style to Slayer's Tom Araya circa Hell Awaits. Although speed is sacrificed (a stark contrast to other bands of their ilk), Meshuggah relies on 7/4 tempos and muted chromatics to create a feeling of kinetic energy without deviating radically from a rigid, percussive structure. Again, Thordendal provides the melodic counterpoint with solos that seemingly deconstruct the band's groove and inject an entirely new dimension of high-frequency atonality. ""Perpetual Black Second"" pounds through a spasmodic grind of alternating buildups and breakdowns, teasing resolution. Drummer Tomas Haake is the complete opposite of many of his metal counterparts-- it's his respect for groove that keeps Meshuggah accessible. Where most metal drummers would attempt to dazzle with blistering kickdrums and heart-stopping licks, Haake is confident enough in his feel and sense to employ a minimalist philosophy, thus providing the rest of the band room to establish patterns without the threat of a drum deluge. Taking the notion of rigidity to another level, ""Closed Eye Visuals"" finds Haake exercising subtle polyrhythm against Nothing's most methodic and brutal attack. Almost as certain as the track is to test the patience of its listeners (clocking in at 7\xBD minutes), the track represents Meshuggah's most challenging offering to date. Muscling through a blitzkrieg of nuanced textures and tones, Thordendal finds himself in full Dimebag Darrell mode as the stilted rhythm throbs and undulates beneath him. Here, Meshuggah display their obvious progressive metal instincts, cementing ambient drones against a wall of seething power chords. Owing in part to the Philip K Dick-flavored lyrics, Meshuggah have found themselves lumped among the ranks of ""math-metal"" fodder like Soilent Green, Coalesce, and the Dillinger Escape Plan. There's little doubt that Meshuggah is attempting to paint a fairly bleak landscape of technology run amok. Unfortunately for the band, the banal and often garbled language detracts from their talent. On ""Organic Shadows"", we have, ""My mind resigns to defeat/ Internal razors activated/ Slashing through unprocessed thought/ The severance of self complete,"" lines that could easily have been authored by Poppy Z Brite, and the cringe-worthy ""Bitter taste/ The wombs of claws call me/ Filth rips them open/ The stillborn start to move lidless eyes twitching beneath a sheet of rot.../ They reach out, they want to kiss/ It matters not..."" from ""Nebulous"". Still, aside from the ponderous corpse paint-soaked sci-fi schlock, Meshuggah have unleashed what amounts to a viciously crafted effort without the rampant pretension of their intellectual metal brothers.","Alright, it's confession time.

Pipe Dreams of Instant Prince Whippet EP,Guided by Voices,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfbfeb335119a49ed292/1:1/w_160/78fbfb9e.jpg,2002-10-15 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3591-pipe-dreams-of-instant-prince-whippet-ep/,RockathonRecordhead,"The Bob Pollard featured in full deific glory on Bee Thousand and Alien Lanes could nearly have out-Who'd The Who, if given a chance. But we all know what came in their wake: Bob lost the magic, and ""The Captain"" entered stage left. Most people attribute that sudden decline in quality to the departing of cohort Tobin Sprout, who had been with Pollard for a good long time and is theorized to have been the only member of Bob's ever-revolving backing band with the balls to veto Pollard's duds. Pollard himself, it's suspected, can hardly tell the difference between his ""My Valuable Hunting Knife""s and his ""A Big Fan of the Pigpen""s, which might explain why this disc is actually better than Universal Truths and Cycles. But it's always darkest before the release of Universal Truths and Cycles, sports fans, and the wealth of excellent material surrounding those sessions proves that Pollard's legendary ability to trip over solid gold wasn't dead, just sleeping. Not only did the album assuage some growing doubts, but its spillover now threatens to momentarily redeem even the hilarious tragedy of the Fading Captain series. The Pipe Dreams of Instant Prince Whippet collects the odds-and-ends left on the cutting room floor in the aftermath of UT&C;, and dare I say, Bob hasn't sounded this much like his old self since ""Jane of the Waking Universe"". Why these tracks were left off Universal Truths in favor of obvious filler like ""Skin Parade"" and ""The Ids are Alright"" is beyond me. A few of these tracks have already sniffed daylight before (four, to be exact, as b-sides for the four seven-inches released as Universal Truths singles), and no doubt, someone, somewhere, is already grumbling that they're ""no 'Echoes Myron'"". Which is fine-- it's not like I'm innocent of this kind of indie codgerism-- but it's a bit like saying, ""Mother Theresa was okay, but you know, she's no God or anything."" Of course nothing on Pipe Dreams hits on that level. But there's no doubt that Pollard's recent material is on par with some of his pre-TVT stuff, particularly the better moments of Mag Earwhig!, and even certain highlights of Under the Bushes, Under the Stars. This disc is evidence that Pollard has finally, gracefully adjusted to GBV's post-Sprout period. The arena rock tendencies of recent work are softened, and soaring, anthemic choruses are largely neglected in favor of rhythmic stompalongs. But aside from the consistency and digestability of these ten tracks, what makes Pipe Dreams a stronger record than Universal Truths and Cycles is the album's composition-- this being an ""odds and sods"" compilation, none of it quite coheres. This disjointed nature is Pipe Dreams' greatest strength, and not coincidentally, that of GBV's best work. As I see it, one of the primary failings of the band's recent material-- including much of Universal Truths-- is a relative homogeneity that causes otherwise quality songs to bleed together into a mush of chiming guitars and cigarette-stained vocals. That never, ever happens on Pipe Dreams, where each track is clear and distinct from the one that comes before. As a companion piece to Universal Truths, it's easy to see where each cut fits into the larger picture, but the total effect of this record is far closer to that of early GBV classics, where bizarre, half-assed tracks like ""Yours to Keep"" and ""Kicker of Elves"" achieved a weirdly compelling power simply through proximity to plain great pop songs. Some of the great pop songs included here are the bite-sized ""Stronger Lizards"" and ""For Liberty"", which both build to sublime crescendos of power and emotion before fading away less than a minute later. These tracks bear the mark of some of GBV's best work, in that you're left wanting more, despite the knowledge that what you just heard was an autonomous unit of songcrafting excellence. These morsels, however, merely set the table for the superlative ""Dig Through My Window"" and the closer ""Beg for a Wheelbarrow."" The former is a laidback pop reflection replete with key changes and a subtle orchestral backing, while the massive three-minute closer ""Beg for a Wheelbarrow"" has Pollard shouting, ""Dig a deeper hole/ And then you'll feel better,"" over a climax of searing guitars and mounting drum fills. Pipe Dream's crown jewels are such a return to form that I almost imagined Tobin Sprout's voice among their backing choruses. This, of course, is the rare collection in a Fading Captain series which has been-- and will undoubtedly continue to be-- incredibly patchy. Still, this disc implies nothing if not potential for more of the stunning songcraft Pollard built his good name on. Bob still has ""it"", to my amazement, and some to spare.","The Bob Pollard featured in full deific glory on Bee Thousand and Alien Lanes could nearly have out-Who'd The ...

However, they also punch holes through the eardrums you know need some exercise and erode the elitist posture you've been meaning to shed for some time now. Sightings don't so much impress as oppress with their silo of riffs and yelping meltdowns. Nary a beat passes without the feedback from drums long since overdriven in the mix or frantic distortion of guitars having more in common with static electricity than even the harshest art-punk assault. Even at just 28 minutes, it's a lot to take in one sitting. Still, in some ways this is actually the forgotten sound of a bygone age. There was a time when this kind of racket passed muster in corners all around as the sound of the future. Think Lydia Lunch and DNA and you're getting there; think early Sonic Youth, Swans and even overachievers like Melt-Banana or Sightings' labelmates Lightning Bolt and you're closer. It's not that mere abrasion and disgust is the object, but presumably some semblance of ""artful purpose"" and maybe even a pinch of ye olde ""rock"" for flavor. No Wave in color? Math-punk that failed math? A whole lotta commotion? Mix them up and call it a debut. Even though singer/guitarist Mark Morgan often opts for the aged caterwaul of punk glory, some of the best stuff on the record happens when he plays it smooth. ""Wax Doors"" (at four minutes, practically an epic on this album) not only finds his voice in check, but locks into a groove that would make very, very early Can proud. The mid-tempo hacking by drummer John Lockie is wildly distorted, but unlike many songs here, there's space to breathe: little details like the off-beat guitar shrieks and the almost dub-like bass resonance come through where they might not on noisier tracks like ""Made the Menu"" or spastic opener ""Two Thoughts"". At points, as on the almost painfully raucous ""45 on the Back"", it's difficult to distinguish who's doing what to which instrument, such is the general chaos. Unfortunately, where Sightings clean up in sonic overload, they fall short in dynamic contrast. In short, all explosions and no... well, almost anything else, make for a monolithic ride. Beyond Sightings, you might do yourself a favor and check out No New York, or any number of punky dadaists from Japan. It's entirely possible that Sightings may travel down a similar path to many of those musicians, and shape their sound into something as vital, or least less haphazard.

Aldhils Arboretum,Of Montreal,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9a8ea9e61561daa702c/1:1/w_160/a2d4f050.jpg,2002-10-14 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5953-aldhils-arboretum/,Kindercore,"Everyone knows the traditional band progression goes something like this: Album #1: hotshot debut

Album #5: departure project
Album #6: rock opera Of Montreal apparently slept in on this day of Rock School, however, as their sixth album has been pegged in advance as their  Singles Album. No, it's not a soundtrack to Matt Dillon in flannel, but rather a collection of self-contained short-short stories-- a departure from their usual hyper-illustrated, album-length sugar-high epics. Of course, in hallowed days of yore, ""single"" would also imply radio play, but in today's close-minded climate of your Clear Channel monopoly and your bling-bling and... [Join Rob later today in the Crotchety Old Rock Critic chat room for the conclusion of this rant.] Accordingly, everything about Adlhils Arboretum is kept somewhat restrained compared to the Of Montreal gnomes and pixies' usual habits. David Barnes' children's book artwork exchanges rainbow explosion mini-murals for mere caricatures of band members (examples: Valkyrie, Hindu god, Napoleon) and the longest song title is a terse seven words. Also left off the roster are the calliope segues, the circus orchestra arrangements, and the twenty-minute symphonies for solo piano. Without all these distractions on board, the spotlight rests solely on the songwriting abilities of one Mr Kevin Barnes. Does he rise to the challenge? Survey says! Yes: A smattering of tracks say so, exhibiting a tasty balance between Of Montreal's lyrical world of mystery-flavor-popsicle whimsy and shower singalong ditties. Some highlights could've been dissected into two or three quality pop songs, like ""Isn't It Nice?"", with its brisk acoustic and accordion illustration of pastoral oddness, or ""Kid Without Claws"", about-- well, damned if I know, but it involves a whole labyrinth of melodic twists and a bombastic horn-fed chorus. ""Jennifer Louise"", meanwhile, is about as straightforward a composition as we're likely to ever hear out of Barnes, distant-family power-pop that borrows an engine from Fountains of Wayne. No: Of Montreal always cuts pretty close to grating, but it's somehow easy to forgive moments of excessive cartoonishness when it's set in the context of an entire animated epic. Set adrift on their own, however, songs like ""Pancakes for One"" and ""We Are Destroying This Song"" are especially hard to swallow. Also No: Turning away from their usual concept album gimmickry also exposes their underbelly of influences, which, unsurprisingly for an Elephant 6 band, seems 70% comprised of mop-top Brits. ""Doing Nothing"" cops the cluster-riff of ""I Feel Fine"" (but is still a three-quarters good song) and ""Desperately Sulking Sara"" channels ""Girl""-ish breathlessness. ""Natalie and Effie in the Park"" swipes Queen's dandy fop material, though in my opinion, more people need to rip off Queen, so I'll overlook it. Maybe: A more complex criticism would be to ask the Expos why they seem to equate ""single"" with ""guitar-driven"", as Andy Gonzales is given license to noodle all over the majority of Aldhils' tracks. While understatement has never been Of Montreal's superpower, the guitars set on constant solo setting during ""An Ode to the Nocturnal Muse"" and ""Old People in the Cemetery"" (the latter even working in some Frampton-style Talking Guitar at the end!) is distracting and less fulfilling than their last album's piano focus. Coquelicot and the Absurdly Ridiculously Unfortunately Lengthy Album Title somehow sneaked onto my 2001 list as a (seemingly) last gasp of my E6 fandom, but Aldhils Arboretum and its inverted career-path singles focus disappoints.","Everyone knows the traditional band progression goes something like this:

Enregistraur,Exhaust,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bccbea9e61561daa7566/1:1/w_160/2c09ad6d.gif,2002-10-14 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2870-enregistraur/,Constellation,"Every so often you get a gift that you can't explain. You open a box and pull out a metal and plastic gizmo with knobs and joints that looks neat and seems useful... yet you can't figure out what the hell it is. The same thing happened to me when I got Exhaust's new album, Enregistreur: it's sitting here in its drab cardboard sleeve, and I have no idea what to do with it. How does it work? If you put it in a disc player, it makes noise: a low, muddy moaning sound, with rhythmic post-rock instrumentals alongside ambient passages, sometimes becoming an almost mechanical noise, like a machine pushing down your street at night when it's too late even to wonder what it's doing out there. It doesn't come with instructions, aside from the playlist. It doesn't tell you that Exhaust is a trio from Montr√©al. Godspeed You Black Emperor!'s Aidan Gert plays the drums: he sticks to straight beats that mark the songlike sections of the music. In contrast, Gordon Krieger emits low swollen tones on bass and simple, raspy bass clarinet tones that sound like a dying vacuum-cleaner. Mike Zabitsky's staticky tapes, electronics and sound effects scribble gently over Krieger's monotony. Enregistreur works at three speeds: moribund, languid, and brisk. The faster tracks are more likeable, especially ""Voiceboxed"", wherein Gert gets his beat on as the song goes through actual transitions and betrays a real and obvious structure. But others may prefer the abstract passages like the moody ""Gauss"", or ""Ice Storm"", where Zabitsky mixes in piercing glitches-- and not disciplined interruptions, but spritzing, loose wires, ""what's wrong with my stereo"" noises. So that's what you get. But how do you use it? At first I figured it was a headphones album. But the deep, sudden bass swells need more space. And it's too slow for background music: playing it in the car made my commute feel three hours long. So I decided it's art music: I sat down in the living room, laid out some wine and cheese, and waited chin in hand while it slouched out of my speakers. But here, too, it keeps fading to slower sections that defy my efforts to pay attention. It didn't take long before I drifted off and started flipping through The New Yorker cartoons. Now that's culture! And that's when I figured it out: Enregistreur doesn't claim to have a ""purpose"". Not only doesn't it engage the listener, but it's not even trying. When Gert's playing, the songs clank along like incidental noise from a machine; the abstract sections are as faceless as tar. The whole disc is a kind of information underload. In the text printed on the disc, Gert talks about getting trapped by an ice storm, stuck sitting in the dark: ""I realized that it had been way too long since I sat on the couch and did nothing but drink a beer and think..."" Enregistreur creates that feeling, as it leaves out cues or markers telling you how to listen: it confronts you with a shapelessness that can be refreshingly head-clearing, as basic as flexing a muscle to lift your beer, and as minimal as sitting in a room by yourself. Of course, that may not be the listening experience you're looking for. As a tool for making a certain kind of sound, it definitely fulfills a function. But as music, it's not too rewarding.","Every so often you get a gift that you can't explain. You open a box and pull out a ...

Further Nuggets: Luke Vibert's Selection,Luke Vibert,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9529d034d5c69bf3c21/1:1/w_160/82d5e962.gif,2002-10-14 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8462-further-nuggets-luke-viberts-selection/,Lo,"Is wanking over production music the new outsider music craze? What sort of person finds the sonic equivalent of stock photography fascinating? Crate-digging funkoholics and hipper-than-thou trendoids, that's who. And Lo Recordings have four collections of vintage (1975 and earlier) miniatures to satisfy their monophonic analog lusts. Further Nuggets, selected by Luke Vibert, comes hard on the heels of his first trawl through the catalogs of various production music libraries. And not only is he at it, but so is Add N to (X)'s Barry 7, whose two Connections compilations (also on Lo) mine very similar veins. So is there really something more to this sound-library stuff than canned, pastiche, instant-mood snippets? Apparently, the likes of David Holmes, Beck, Andy Votel, the Beta Band, and Andy Weatherall think that this library music stuff is the shit. Lo Recordings most definitely think so, too. The label has given Vibert a second opportunity to showcase the bongo-bop-iest and Moogy-funkiest of the style. Further Nuggets draws from further afield than his first pass, which concentrated on the work of Roger Roger, Nino Nardini, and Eddie Warner, three inspired swells making a franc or two at the Ganaro studios in Versailles. This record features three more examples of Roger Roger's craft, ""Perdition"", ""Velvet Clouds"", and ""Sound Industrial 15"". The first is an eerie violin, marimba, jazz guitar, and percussion piece that promises more Grand Guignol than it in fact-- thank god-- delivers. ""Velvet Clouds"" is so chimingly cheery it could be used to induce a truly gobsmacking Fred and Ginger routine in Matt Lauer and Katie Couric. By way of extreme contrast, ""Sound Industrial 15"" is the aqua spine bubbles of Two Lone Swordsmen mixed with some sparse Sergio Leone spaghetti Western theme. Apart from Roger Roger's contributions, things get much spottier. Jack Arel and Pierre Dutour's ""Top Rally"" is a big band doing Blaxploitation funk, while their ""Bumblebees Dance"" sounds like a G-funk version of Lenny Kravitz's ""Are You Gonna Go My Way?"". Elsewhere, John Matthews' ""Electro Aggression"" borrows from Morton Subotnick, and I imagine a micro-mini'd and fuck-me sling-backed dance troupe getting all interpretive to the clavinet disco slop of Richard Demaria's ""Studio 96"". The percussive flute and wah-wah'd guitar of Roger Davy's ""Crazy Flute Happy Guitar"" can only mean Huggy Bear's in another wino-startlin', trash-can bashin' alleyway car chase through afro'd Harlem. Roger Webb's ""Exotica"" gives you three minutes to walk up to the barfly Farrah Fawcett-ish lady in a beige A-line dress, get one more Campari and soda down her neck, indicate the sugarloaf trapped your Sta-Press hip-huggers, and get her upstairs to your hotel room for a near-zipless fuck. Boosters say that production music is much more than the sonic equivalent of stock photography. They say that it's more than a kitschy guilty pleasure. It's a world free from the cult of personality where nameless, ego-less talents can express themselves. This would be true from the ass-backward perspective of compilations such as Further Nuggets. Hate to be a downer, but being compiled thirty years later by Luke Vibert probably wasn't exactly what these musicians were doing their thing for. Far from being the romantic notion of production music being a safe haven for reclusive Joe Meeks and Phil Spectors, regular production work ensured these musicians regular paychecks for composing and recording adaptable brief mood pieces for sales presentations and basement-budget TV programs. The fact that Vibert can present some unquestionable gems here is just gravy. The boosters' appeal to the absence of stardom-seeking personality is an optimist's spin on the fact that this style had to be anonymous to fulfill its primary function: unnoticeable background music. Though I'm resistant to embrace production music as the latest, greatest fad, I can't deny that Vibert's collection selects and, importantly, deftly sequences some real treasures. Vibert makes a compellingly funky case for joining the wankers.","Is wanking over production music the new outsider music craze? What sort of person finds the sonic equivalent of stock ...

However, despite the organic source material that goes into his music, he actually belongs to an eccentric breed of one-man digital alchemists like Fennesz and Ekkehard Ehlers. Hrvatski (born Keith Fullerton Whitman) might have a background in freeform guitar skronk and amplifier noise, but his methods betray a fascination with the synthetic and processed. In fact, he studied ethnomusicology at Berklee, and while that may not mean much to non-musos, it does expose the contradiction of someone who would be writing academic treatises on the importance of preserving indigenous folk music if he weren't so interested in fucking with Winston Brothers breaks. 1998's Oiseaux 1996-1998 found Hrvatski running his breaks fascination into the ground, and then some. By no means was the album repetitive, though it could be maddeningly skittish, as if his rule of thumb was to make sure no two measures of music were identical. As a result, some tracks that might have been jams in their first drafts became baroque symphonettes, perhaps more impressive than viscerally moving. That said, it was a detail freak's fantasy, and it prompted many frustrated fans to wait patiently for the official follow-up. Swarm & Dither is the result of almost four years of waiting, experimenting, writing, and more waiting. By Hrvatski's own admission, a lot has changed since his last full-length offering, and this record is a culmination of tracks record over the duration. Because of that, the sound is often reminiscent of his last record, most notably on the handful of tracks recorded just after its completion. The newer stuff uses a different pallet of sounds, but is still noticeably in his style, with restless beat-shifting and tendency for acoustic intervention in a medium dominated by computer generated blips. The opener, ""Vatstep DSP"" (a fan fave since its 1999 debut as a Kid606 ""remix""), plays a similar role as ""Routine Exercise"" did on Oiseaux: that of the hardcore jam. Beginning with an explosion of swirling hard drive-feedback and radio static, it launches into a beat at once complex and goofy-- imagine Merrie Melodies IDM. Hrvatski's speak-and-spell vocal might be the funniest thing ever to appear on a laptop-composed record, and the kitten samples are on point. Similarly, ""2nd Zero Fidelity Mandible Investigation"" manages to transcend its inherently convoluted construction and oompah beat to reveal remarkable attention to detail. Check the tambourine borrowed from the first album; watch that oozing synth patch; listen in to over-the-bar beat displacements. The only drawback-- and a minor one, really-- is that both of these tracks sound like they could have been on Oiseaux. The digital soundscape that develops into ""Paint It Black"" represents the other side of Swarm & Dither, wherein Hrvatski works in the same laptop-acoustic hybrid as fellow fusionists Fennesz and The Books. The first half of this tune is not the Rolling Stones song at all, but a contemplative guitar figure with assorted glitch effects. When the proper tune starts in, with a drastically altered lead vocal featuring dissonant auto-harmonizing, the effects threaten to overtake the arrangement but never quite do. ""Carrot (Hrvatski's Night Vision)"" uses this juxtaposition to even better effect, as acoustic guitar and electric piano act as foundation for a solemn, wistful clarinet line. The heavy loop in the background and various effects hardly detract from the general ambience. Where the record might misfire for some listeners is when Hrvatski abandons breaks and beats entirely, as on tunes like ""Anesthetize Thineself"". If you're impatient, you might miss the gorgeous extended outro with guitar and synth, because the first half is almost random distorto-glitch along the lines of particularly anti-social Warp. And on ""Echoes"", you'll need an ear sympathetic to manic piano accents as the track uses that sound exclusively to flesh out polyrhythmic pandemonium, and leads immediately to the hyperactive, sometimes jarring ""EWC4"". The record ends with a straight band version of Swedish space-rockers Trad Gras och Stenar's ""Tegenborg"". The rollicking, cheerful strains of this tune sound almost comically displaced on this record, and yet there's something to it. Swarm & Dither makes vital noise out of some very automated processes, and perhaps ending the album so straightforwardly says something about the ideas behind this stuff. You might assume most new electronic music is devoid of that old-fashioned human emotion, but Hrvatski's music offers evidence that it can be both intellectual and inviting.","Hrvatski's company in the endeavor to bring out the ""humanity"" in electronic music includes recent faves The Books, The ...

Hand of Glory,Royal Trux,by: Mike Bernstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2c29d034d5c69bf2c8e/1:1/w_160/43cc69cb.jpg,2002-10-13 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6857-hand-of-glory/,Drag City,"Royal Trux's 1990 four-song album Twin Infinitives holds an odd position in the canon of drug music. Neil ""Michael"" Hagerty and Jennifer Herrema have said that although the album itself wasn't composed while under the influence (a dubious statement to say the least), it was ""quality-tested"" while high on such colorful narcotic selections as marijuana, LSD, speed, heroin, and more. Alternately sounding like a subway ride inside a television inside an earthquake inside the end of the world and a pounding death rhythm of apocalyptic now, Twin Infinitives' greatest achievement may be its dissimilarity to any other recorded material ever. Now that Royal Trux's new joint, Hand of Glory-- really a ""lost album"" from the late 80s-- has hit the shelves, our chance to sit down and seriously inhale some fresh slowness is upon us. Though it's of the same era as Twin Infinitives, the two records are stylistically nothing alike-- Twin Infinitives was more an electronic music composition than it was a rock album; Hand of Glory is half-rock, half-musique concrete. Of course, it takes people interested enough in discovering and divulging the secrets of the postmortem subconscious, like Neil and Jennifer, to stretch these classifications to their very boundaries, but Royal Trux were nothing if not fearless. The album is cut in half by sides-- two long tracks, one segmented, one not. The first side, ""Domo des Burros (Two Sticks)"", seems a meditation on the drum machine-heavy track ""(Edge of the) Ape Oven"" from Twin Infinitives. Layering a Suicide-esque drum machine over palindromic guitars and the battling voices of Hagerty and Herrema, it initially sounds like token Trux behavior, but a closer listen reveals that it falls entirely outside of that spectrum. It speeds up and slows down, waxes lysergic, and then breeds with a harmonica, all toward very confusing ends. There's staccato piano, more staccato harmonica, and even more staccato drum machine beats-- all with confusingly dubby overtones. Trux's article from 1989 stands as a testament to the flexibility of the track. The duo repeats words, rhyme, sing, scream, and overdub overdub overdub while never succumbing to self-indulgence or straying outlandishly from what most people might call a ""rock composition"". The instrumentation listing in the liners probably says more of its sound than any journalistic approximation-- it reads: ""voice, percussion, drum machines, mechanical monkey with cymbals, Moog, guitars, violin, bottles, pump organ, radio, record player, piano, harmonica, and tape machines."" Hand of Glory's side two, titled ""The Boxing Story"", is a composition for tapes featuring recorded materials on cassettes being reversed, cut up, collaged, layered, and drenched in effects. The track has a tendency toward narrative bursts which possess subtle qualities akin to fluid movement. There are recognizable words, guitar solos, drum beats, whistles, screeches, skulls, wings, rats, blood and metal. There is literally abstraction here to the point of no return, but the abstraction has been taken to such a fine point that it can only be perceived as unified. Twenty-something minutes of internalized extrusion is capitalized and completely shredded. Hand of Glory is an example of two fine exercises of military strength and rigor. The ambling song structure synthesizes with the collage as a whole to create relations previously unconsidered in the Trux canon. It's not quite clear if this is because of their striking quality or their mere proximity, but either way, it represents an essence of artful quality, an achievement which stands to be quite rare.","Royal Trux's 1990 four-song album Twin Infinitives holds an odd position in the canon of drug music.

Power in Numbers,Jurassic 5,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1c413d197565213bc59/1:1/w_160/984545de.jpg,2002-10-13 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4331-power-in-numbers/,Interscope,"Many dismiss Jurassic 5 as suburban hip-hoppers who merely exploit the ever-fashionable old-school vibe. And it's true: their style does borrow heavily from the genre's pioneers. But one thing I've always admired about the group is that, despite their success in the mainstream, they've continued to adhere to underground values. Their audience may drive SUV's and worry about SAT's, but J5 themselves came together at the Good Life, a true-skool cafe that, for years, served as the epicenter of LA hip-hop. Naturally, their pedigree doesn't excuse their recent falloff, but it at least lends them more authenticity than a lot of other underground groups. But let's get to what you came here wondering about: whether Power in Numbers returns Jurassic 5 to that dope-as-fuck old-school revival style they came with on their debut EP, or if it's a too-comfortable retread of the ready-for-M2 formulas that turned Quality Control from what could have been one of tightest joints of 2000 into a homogenized backpacker retreat. After a brief intro produced by Cut Chemist, the album kicks off proper with ""Freedom"". Although Nu Mark's downtempo production is more than adequate, the album would have benefited from a stronger introduction that bumped a little harder. As it so happens, we don't really get anything to grab hold of until the fourth track, ""Break"", which also, not so coincidentally, marks Cut Chemist's first real track. While the J5 emcees rarely have anything interesting to say, their flows-- and particularly Charlie 2na's-- sound nice on a strictly phonetical tip, a similar dynamic to those of the old-school emcees they're clearly trying to parody. This works a lot better when a worthwhile producer's lacing the track with a fat, uptempo beat that's able to steal the focus away from the lyrics; it's when the slower tracks come up, and we're actually made to listen to what the emcees are saying and not just how they're saying it, that we run into trouble. After another brief interlude produced by Cut Chemist, a pair of old-school legends, Percy P and Big Daddy Kane, step up to the mic on the very nice ""A Day at the Races"". The bassline is absolutely smokin', and Cut Chemist lifts a tight sample from the legendary David Axelrod. Big Daddy Kane steals the lyrical spotlight as he declares that he's still ""Gucci dressin'"" and warns that ""you out of your league like Jordan in baseball"". It should also be noted that, sandwiched between Kane and Percy P, Charlie 2na steps up his game and remarkably holds his own. It's no secret that Charlie's the lyrical glue that holds Jurassic together, but he really shows improvement on this album. Unfortunately, ""What's Golden"", the album's first single, finds J5 returning to dangerously familiar territory. For the chorus, the emcees sing, ""We're not ballin' or shot callin'/ We take it back to the day of yes y'allin'."" The first time J5 expressed their desire to ""take it back"", it was dope. But they've covered this ground so many times now that I'm wondering now if they've got an obsessive disorder that forces them to repeat these sentiments ad nauseam. This formulaically old-school approach is both J5's greatest asset and worst liability. Those of you who love this trait, and aren't turned off by the group's non-threatening demeanor and positive pose, will probably dig Power in Numbers. But if you prefer your hip-hop with a little more kick, you might want to dig deeper into the still-vibrant LA hip-hop scene. Numbers isn't breaking any new ground, but it does rehash the golden age of hip-hop quite nicely.","Many dismiss Jurassic 5 as suburban hip-hoppers who merely exploit the ever-fashionable old-school vibe.

Snowing Sun,Bellini,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a265c0084474cd0c0029/1:1/w_160/9657892a.jpg,2002-10-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/641-snowing-sun/,Monitor,"For a band that worked within math-rock, which many consider to be the most limited of genres, Don Caballero never made the same album twice. Credit that accomplishment to the dual geniuses whose constant interpersonal tension powered and drove the band: drummer-cum-hulking brute Damon Che, and calc-minded guitar hero Ian Williams. Up until their final studio effort, American Don, Che and Williams continued to push and innovate upon an unparalleled brand of energetic, artistic and unpredictable math-rock. But like all good things that I never had the chance to see live, Don Cab came to a premature end, punctuated symbolically by a dramatic van wreck just before the band were to play their coda in Detroit. As they say, what burns never returns. Since parting ways with Don Cab, Damon Che has teamed up with two veterans of the noise-rock scene-- guitarist Agostina Tilotta and vocalist Giovanna Cacciola of the Sicilian group Uzeda-- and bassist Matthew Taylor to form his new band, Bellini. After adding some songs, and producer Steve Albini (who previously worked on Don Cab's For Respect and American Don, and Uzeda's Different Section Wires), the quartet had recorded Snowing Sun. And despite the noteworthy artistic legacy preceding it, the record manages to set itself apart from its history and make a compelling statement of its own. The general approach of Snowing Sun resembles the technicality of Don Cab, simplified and blended with the shrill tones and avant-garde delivery of Uzeda. The guitar/drum/bass interplay is tight, but far less painstakingly composed and complex than that of Don Cab, and far less frantic. What you have instead is something a bit rougher tonally, but easier on the attention span. Rather than seven different sections with five different riffs, four time-changes, and an unsettling morass of polyrhythms, Bellini hits you with only a few jagged, biting, hand-picked riffs. It's still herky-jerky, but you immediately get a feel for what the band is doing-- it doesn't require multiple listens to figure out. With Bellini, Che isn't quite the focus of attention that he was with his former band; although he doesn't exactly stay in the pocket, his playing is much more restrained. The point instead seems to be to lock-in with Tilotta and Taylor, which they manage with great success on tracks like ""Furious"", which warms up slowly until the band reaches a rolling, mathy-Sabbath energy. Still, Che has his own reel of flailing highlights, as on ""We Crossed the Ocean to See the Snowing Sun"", where he swiftly pounds out a double-pedaled bridge into the final closing jam, and ""The Best Song on the Starship"", which itself closes with a full-band freak-out. Much of the simplified approach can be blamed on the presence of a vocalist. After all, it's damn nigh impossible to sing-- even whistle-- along to math-rock. Not that Cacciola really sings. Hers is more of an accented, Bj√∂rkish scream-sing approach, a theatrical vector for her oblique, poetic lyrics (""That's my offer, that's all I have/ Coral, starfishes, seahorses""; ""It seems like blood, but it's the water of a flame/ It'll turn into skin and breath for my rebirth""). Because of her accent, Cacciola's bizarre lyrics are indecipherable without a lyric sheet. Oddly, though, it lends Bellini an inexplicable artistic credibility-- sort of like subtitles. Besides for the aforementioned ""We Crossed the Ocean"" and ""Furious"", ""Rut Row"" and ""Patience and Passion in Brown Gloves"" stand out as bullseyes. ""Rut Row"" opens with a sharp, treble-heavy guitar riff and rolling, propulsive drum accompaniment, leaving little empty space. The busy opening sequence sets up a syncopated breakdown, with Cacciola shouting the appropriately aggressive chorus, ""Out of here, out of his cage/ Totally naked, uncovered and insane."" ""Patience and Passion in Brown Gloves"", meanwhile, winds through an off-center, midtempo math-verse until all four musicians find a funky lock-step to drive home a cathartic set of rhythmic jabs. Put all of the pieces together, and this is one cohesive, coherent son of a bitch. Eccentric and avant-garde, with a kick in the ass courtesy of the drummer. It's an incredibly rare thing for ex-members of genre-defining bands to release records that rival the ones released by their former groups, but Snowing Sun has easily trumped anything Uzeda ever released, and it comes damn close to equaling Don Cab's earliest material. Provided that Bellini continue to refine and master their sound, they may prove to be more vital than either.","For a band that worked within math-rock, which many consider to be the most limited\n\ of genres, Don Caballero ...

A Hundred Days Off,Underworld,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8df9d034d5c69bf3b4d/1:1/w_160/3da98248.jpg,2002-10-10 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8350-a-hundred-days-off/,V2JBO,"Having a hundred days off is either a workman's fantasy or just another way of saying ""unemployment"", but either way, there's a nice mystique to it: an epic vacation, an eternity (to the shortsighted among us) of free time, all empty of responsibility, regret, and unwilled concerns. A hundred days to wake up at three in the afternoon, a hundred days of raving 'til dawn, a hundred days to revel in all the fruits of blissful slackerdom-- this is what Underworld would like to bring you, and they come damn close. But Underworld's Hundred Days is an unpaid holiday, you see, and over time, bills pile up, boredom sets in, and eventually, part of you wishes you had a job to go back to. It's relaxing, okay, but in the end, there's not much to show for it-- a souvenir, and perhaps a few points off your systolic pressure. Underworld, of course, are perfectly content to offer only this. They're the cruise ship of electronic music industry, offering clients a world of extravagant entertainment and vacuous beauty. You want to think? Get a day job, go to school. But when this vacation begins, there will be no literary references, no complex mathematical tables or equations, no world-weary insights into the human condition. With every release, Underworld-- here stripped to the duo of Karl Hyde and Rick Smith, as Darren Emerson left to pursue DJing full-time in 2000-- refine their ultra-hypnotic beats to the barest, simplest elements, each time taking one step closer to some basic internal rhythm so instantly accessible that consciousness seems optional for its perception; you could almost dance to it in your sleep. A Hundred Days Off is merely the next step in their process. It's the best thing they've hammered out since tumbling from the lofty heights of Dubnobasswithmyheadman, though given their interim releases, that isn't saying much of anything. What's interesting, though, is that they've managed to refine their sound without hardly changing it. Their music has a sort of unyielding rigidity-- no matter how much they change things superficially, the fundamentals are instantly recognizable. And on A Hundred Days Off, their formula remains pristine-- from the first vocoded (big surprise) syllable, to the final repetitive, trance-inducing pulse-- if far from perfect. The most notable improvement, as befits the album's title, is that this time around, Underworld take things a little easier. The record is far more low-key and subdued, yet holds just shy of complacency. Tracks like ""SolaSistim"" are stylish and direct, easily enjoyed by the subconscious while you relax in the local sensory-deprivation tank. Between the similarly mellow radiations of ""Twist"" and ""Little Speaker"" (the two songs bookending ""SolaSistim""), it wanders slightly off course by becoming slothful, perhaps, but all in all, the user-friendly ease of the tones and rhythms is a big selling point. The change is a subtle one, but the laid-back feel of A Hundred Days Off is a qualified improvement. ""Two Months Off"" is the one exception to the album's otherwise placid comfort-- this record's answer to their epic hit single ""Born Slippy"". Calling back the vocoding ""Slippy"" so successfully employed for an encore and an equally rousing chorus, its nine-minute run is easily the album's most powerful stretch. Although the other tracks are reasonably successful, none are so naturally anthemic. In fact, the only other song that makes such a distinct impression (possibly included to counterbalance ""Two Months Off"") is the absolutely horrendous ""Trim"". See, the great thing about the way Underworld employ vocoding is that you typically can't make out the lyrics. ""Trim"" serves as a reminder that Underworld is better heard than actually listened to; they use those vocoders for a reason, folks. I'm the last person to care what Underworld is singing about, but these lyrics make my head hurt, and the singing, sadly the central focus of ""Trim"", makes Yoko Ono sound like Nina Simone. Exceptions aside, A Hundred Days Off is enjoyably uninspired; it defines both ""pleasant"" and ""unremarkable"". Even when, during its second half, Underworld seem tempted to venture into some foreign territory, they're scared off by the alien sounds and patterns, and run off without genuinely committing to anything (though if the results of such a commitment were to be along the lines of ""Trim"", it's for the best that they stay put). Instead, they offer just enough variety to briefly snap you out of the daze that the record's first half puts you in. Still, that's not to say that Underworld, at any point on A Hundred Days Off, even approaches ""thinking-man's music"". Your body will move long before your brain does. Of course, I suppose that's the point.","Having a hundred days off is either a workman's fantasy or just another way of saying ""unemployment"", but either ...

Bridges Worth Burning,Kind of Like Spitting,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb9f5e6ef95969322c62/1:1/w_160/06f1c3b1.jpg,2002-10-10 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4434-bridges-worth-burning/,Barsuk,"Are you passionate? Ben Barnett is. Sometimes, he's too passionate for his own good, repelling the very audience he's trying to communicate with. He even opens his latest album-- incredibly his seventh full-length release in just three years-- with a song called ""Passionate"", wherein he exhorts over a ferocious, feedback-laden rock backdrop, ""Let's be passionate/ It's not like we'll get another chance to do this/ Don't be embarrassed/ Go over the top/ But come up from the bottom."" I can't think of a more apt reference point for my experience with Kind of Like Spitting than those last two lines there. My first exposure to the band came earlier this year, when I reviewed their self-titled compilation of early songs. Virtually no moment on that record could really be considered over the top-- frankly, it just wasn't very good. Barnett certainly has come up from the bottom. Helping him over the top are a cast of friends, some of whom you might recognize from Braid and Death Cab for Cutie, who quickly seem to be attaining Indie Rock Mentor status in the Pacific Northwest. Death Cab's Ben Gibbard is all over this thing, at the piano, behind the drum kit and the backup microphone, where his even, skilled singing is very welcome as a foil to the frequently caterwauling Barnett. His songwriting influence also appears to be lingering in the melodies that Barnett has cooked up here, which have only become exponentially better since those early efforts I referred to before. For his part, Barnett manages to vacillate between even, subdued singing and an overwrought wail that would make Conor Oberst blush. The middle of the album is largely filled with the former, leaving the latter to rough up the record's edges. ""Following Days"" is a mid-album highlight, with its propulsive backing (I had no idea Gibbard could play the drums so well) and concise melody. When electrified, Barnett's guitar generally has that lightly distorted tone that bands like Mineral and Sunny Day Real Estate used as their stock-in-trade at the mid-90s height of emocore, and he squeezes a little feedback from it when he has to. Things reach the height of bombast on ""Crossover Potential"", an old song that actually appears on the self-titled release that came out earlier this year, albeit in a much more spineless form. Things rise to a thundering climax as Barnett and no fewer than nine accomplices shout out the chorus, peaking on the line ""the average woe has no crossover potential"" in a display of pained mass catharsis. It's one of several instances where things get just a bit too over the top. Oddly, I think my favorite track is the last one, ""Untitled"". Hardly clocking in at fifty seconds, it's a quiet acoustic number whose brevity, sprightly guitar work, and close Barnett/Gibbard harmonies render it endearing in almost the same way that ""Her Majesty"" seemed a strangely fitting end for Abbey Road. Overall, Kind of Like Spitting have scraped together a pretty decent little rock record that occasionally veers a little too far into overblown emo territory for my tastes. It's not going to change the world or anything, but it sure is passionate.","Are you passionate? Ben Barnett is. Sometimes, he's too passionate for his own good, repelling the very audience he ...

Fade In Fade Out EP,Landing,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc975e6ef95969322e9a/1:1/w_160/8c8e131e.jpg,2002-10-10 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4672-fade-in-fade-out-ep/,Strange Attractors Audio House,"When I last reviewed a Landing record I accused them of recording too quickly. Counting their collaboration with Yume Bitsu's Adam Forkner as Surface of Eceon, Landing's Seasons was their third record in a year. Seasons found Landing experimenting with conventional song structures with some success, but the songs didn't seem quite as developed as they could have been had more time and effort put into their arranging and recording. And now, a few short months later, they've released Fade In Fade Out, a record that lasts longer than most Beatles albums (37 minutes), but which we in the digital age would call an EP. Despite the torrential pace of their release schedule, it appears as though Landing still has the touch. Fade In Fade Out is actually a return to my preferred Landing mode, that of a primarily instrumental, FX-heavy guitar band. Where the shoegazy Oceanless bled psychedelic color and frequently drifted into jamming, and Seasons found Landing trying their hand with traditional songs, Fade In Fade Out is a shift toward deeply textured drone. There's barely a drum or cymbal on this thing; most tracks are nothing more than a rich swirl of guitar and keyboard harmonics. Seasons brought Landing comparisons with slowcore bands, but Fade In Fade Out warrants a mention with Windy & Carl or Stars of the Lid. Where vocals appear, they're spare and, as they say, just another instrument. ""Against the Rain"" has the most prominent lyrics, but it's nothing that could be considered a ""song"" in the Cole Porter sense. A thudding kick drum is used for color, but most of the sound comes from a web of intertwined guitar lines with their delay pedals set on ""infinity"", as hints of synth drone shine through the gaps. Some crooned lines about rain rise and fall over the course of a minute or two, leading me to believe that this is a Seasons outtake. ""Whirlwind"" is closer to the sound of Oceanless, with ride-cymbal-heavy drumming and distant, buried dream-pop vocals by Adrienne Snow (a woman's voice is natural to this kind of sound, and I much prefer hers to husband Aaron's). My favorite piece is the 12-minute closing track ""Pulse"", a slowburn number that takes plenty of time getting off the ground but covers virtually every kind of guitar tone possible before it's done. The squeezably-soft Windy & Carl feedback is here, and so are the ringing chords, the tremeloed leads, and the harsher drones. There's no acoustic picking (Landing cover that adequately on the fine ""Constellations""), but ""Pulse"" establishes Landing as extremely skilled in the emotional application of guitar tone.","When I last reviewed a Landing record I accused them of recording too quickly.

The Richest Man in Babylon,Thievery Corporation,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a775ea9e61561daa55bd/1:1/w_160/d1c11ddb.jpg,2002-10-10 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8003-the-richest-man-in-babylon/,Eighteenth Street Lounge,"Washington DC's Thievery Corporation aren't really musicians. Like Martha Stewart and Oprah Winfrey, the duo of Eric Hilton and Rob Garza are extremely savvy lifestyle-promoters. Their output typifies fashionista mood music-- music not meant to be listened to, but to be displayed as a marker of jaded sophistication. Coincidentally, I believe Thievery Corporation's albums perfectly describe the narrow tastes of professional Washington, DC. For most readers of the 'Fork, DC means Fugazi, the Dismemberment Plan, and maybe a little go-go. But many who live and work in the city live and die by a single virtue: blandness. If you're a politico or a lawyer, nothing ensures success more than not sticking out. Look at the present Congress-- now that Traficant is behind bars, there's no one to display even the merest hint of idiosyncrasy. Thievery Corporation understand that in a city where Moby's Play is perceived as cutting-edge, they don't have to try too hard-- all it takes is to remember never to release anything that hasn't been exhaustively tried and tested, and in service for years. The duo realizes that a smattering of international elements-- a brief tabla sample here, an oud there-- will confer apparent substance on tracks that are never to be listened to, but rather to become part of the daily, accessorizing ritual that is the lives of the city's ""elite"". Professional DC agrees that it's acceptable for lobbyists, lawyers, and corporate accountants to wear certain clothing styles, but not others; to enjoy canonical works of art, but never entertain more experimental forms; to buy certain albums and not others. No surprise, then, that those obnoxious tokens of broadmindedness, the Buddha Bar and Hotel Costes compilations, fly off the shelves of area Borders and Barnes & Noble. But shame and censure await any Hill staffer found in possession of anything more exotic than Yo-Yo Ma's Silk Road Journeys. Hilton and Garza pull back the curtains to reveal their opening number, an Air-y trip-hop ballad called ""Heaven's Gonna Burn Your Eyes"", featuring Emiliana Torrini. Torrini is the quintessential Thievery Corp collaborator. She embodies the triumph of style-over-substance. The Icelandic-Italian is an exotically Euro singer who conveniently represents Bj√∂rk without any of Bj√∂rk's twitchy eccentricity. Though sound-sculptors from Fat Cat's roster superbly remixed tracks from Torrini's debut album, Love in the Time of Science, none of her remixers seems to have had an inspirational effect on her or the Thievery lads. ""Heaven's Gonna Burn Your Eyes"" is as flat as Velveeta and half as nutritious. The trap drums, oud, and violins of ""Facing East"" make Rabih Abou-Kahlil's aromatic fusion of traditional Lebanese folk music and jazz palatable for Enya fans. ""The Outernationalist"" is a dub excursion for those whose appreciation for reggae starts and stops at Bob Marley's Legend. Do Garza and Hilton really think that ""Un Simple Histoire"", featuring the meager vocal talent of returning collaborator, Loulou, will provoke awe and wonder? The beats that underpin Loulou and a sitar sample would have sounded pass√© a decade ago. Unless a Milli Vanilli revival is imminent, there's no excuse for this. Things improve distinctly with the bossa nova of ""Meu Destino"" and the Afro-Cuban son of ""Exilo"". Garza and Hilton refrain from dabbling and forcing gaudy baubles onto the performances; instead, they allow their collaborators (Patrick de Santo and Vernie Verla respectively) to be themselves and not some pre-packaged approximation. But de Santos' and Verla's authenticity goes to shit when the album returns to its ""Girl, You Know It's True""-isms with ""From Creation"", a track which features a beefed-up version of the rhythm that served as the foundation for that timeless Milli Vanilli hit, and caps it off with vibes on loan from an elevator in the ESL Building. Guest crooner Notch tries on his best Horace Andy impression for the record's title track, and Shinehead, renowned for his pop-reggae versions of Sting's ""Englishman in New York"" and Michael Jackson's ""Billie Jean"" pitches in on ""The State of the Union"" with his pal Sleepy Wonder in tow. Riding clapped-out beats identical to those of ""Un Simple Histoire"", ""The State of the Nation"" endeavors to equal Badmarsh and Shri's ""Signs"". Though Sleepy Wonder can convincingly mimic UK Apache, whose tender vocals made ""Signs"" such a memorable cut, the blatantly obvious stream-of-consciousness lyrics can't steer me from thinking that ""The State of the Union"" isn't even equal to the sum of its shabby parts. Though ESL Music has licensed some outstanding downtempo artists (Blue States, Broadway Project, Les Hommes), none of this excellence has apparently touched Thievery Corporation. The Richest Man in Babylon is a career-low for Thievery Corporation and ESL. If they keep this up much longer, even the power-brokers will lose interest.","Washington DC's Thievery Corporation aren't really musicians.

Extremixxx EP,Trans Am,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7fcb1335d7bf1699195/1:1/w_160/9911701a.jpg,2002-10-09 05:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8138-extremixxx-ep/,Thrill Jockey,"I liked Trans Am better when I was missing the point. While enjoying records like their self-titled debut and The Surveillance, I thought they were a good instrumental rock band with a love of vintage electronics and a good sense of humor. I knew there was something tongue-in-cheek about them, obviously, but I always heard some genuine affection at the core of the music. It's all about being ""clever"" now, it seems, about loosening the ties to the 80s by sending up the decade's excesses. With TA, Trans Am became the new wave Sha Na Na. Things could change, though, and I hope they do. In the meantime, here's a six-track remix EP to remind us to look forward to the band's evolution. Extremixxx is the sort of EP that really should only be available on vinyl. With two versions of ""Cold War"" and three of ""Different Kind of Love"" (including one that's just the instrumental of the prior track's vocal mix), there's no way in hell you're going to want to put Extremixxx on in the car, on your walkman, or on your living room stereo. It's either a DJ tool or mixtape fodder, nothing more. Track by track, then. Busy Chicagoan Johnny Herndon works as A Grape Dope, turning in his ""Bombs and More Mix"" of ""Cold War"". He clips the sounds and adds a jerky, stop/start feel to the rhythm, turning the song into something closer to a breakdancing anthem. It's fair. Eastern Developments glitch artist Dabrye's remix of ""Infinite Wavelength"" shifts the hectic cheeseball synth-pop of the original into a slow, slightly funky container brimming with robot soul, making the oily vocodered vocals the tune's center point. Trans Am engineer Jonathan K's take on ""Cold War"" is a bid for an electroclash DJ's crate that misses by a foot, with the beat made a little housier and the synths just a bit more goth. Kicking off the back half, The Automator adds the sort of syncopated hip-hop beat he can program in his sleep to ""Different Kind of Love"" and little else. And then the EP closes with ""Different Kind of Love"" reworked by Prefuse 73, once as a vocal, and once as an instrumental. It's fitting that Scott Herren be the only person to feature his beat on its own, because it's by far the best one here, showing that he listened to plenty of Timbaland while internalizing all that mid-90s Warp IDM. Of course, one good track in vocal and instrumental versions, and four others ranging from okay to terrible, doesn't make for a good remix EP, I'm afraid. It's not so bad if you consider how weak some of the original TA material is, but still. Very easy to sit this one out.","I liked Trans Am better when I was missing the point.

The Ligeti Project II,Gy√∂rgy Ligeti,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd0ac0084474cd0c2bf7/1:1/w_160/3bf57685.gif,2002-10-09 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4785-the-ligeti-project-ii/,Teldec,"What the hell ever happened to classical music? The answer is obvious if I look beyond my own CD rack: most people (of all ages-- don't feel guilty, starchildren) prefer other kinds of music. It's not as if the devil's rock 'n' roll up and wiped away the repressive art music which had been holding down kids-- by the 1950s, classical musicians were already knee-deep in a perception of ivory-tower innovation and snobbish dissonance. As a result (though I suspect more as a symptom of longstanding cultural shifts), what classical music was deemed safe to appreciate fit snugly in an afternoon concert, in a hall of seats that also fit snugly for blue-haired aunts and volunteer ushers from the Boy Scouts. The worst part about classical music's dusty old rep is that it's wildly inaccurate. Without ever speaking of modern composers, the history of this music is littered with rebellion, rage, depression, obsession, lust, mental disorders, joy, and enough contradictory insular logic to make the E6 bands drop out of therapy (""because, you know, it just seems like we're going nowhere""). Classical music's public dismissal just seems unnecessary. Hungarian composer Gy√∂rgy Ligeti (born 1923) has actually seen both sides of the wall between popular and classical music. His onetime mentor Karlheinz Stockhausen was a prime figure for classical composers trying to shine beyond the wing of the elitist avant-garde. Where serial (and other formalist) works were the sign of an artistic community well outside the domain of popular acceptance or even understanding, composers like Stockhausen actively broke unwritten rules of accepted artistic persona. Ligeti, perhaps less affected by the ""image"" of a serious composer than his Western peers, was very much interested in formal innovations like micopolyphony, but still managed to produce works that appealed to many modern classical listeners on more that just intellectual grounds. And then there was Stanley Kubrick. The late director bestowed pop-culture immortality on the humble Hungarian by choosing several of his pieces as the signature sounds to 2001: A Space Odyssey. Remember those weird choral clusters when all the monkeys discover the monolith? When Dave is traveling through time and space? Ligeti pieces such as ""Atmospheres"" and ""Lux Aeterna"" were the sound of tripping for many an impressionable hippie-- and still sound pretty spacy today. Teldec's ""Ligeti Project"" series actually takes over for Sony's defunct ""Edition"" series from the mid-90s. Sony got through all the choral pieces, string quartets and piano music, but none of the orchestral stuff. The pieces on this set range from very early symphonic experiments with traditional Hungarian and Romanian folk dances, to the dense, ominous 1960s works that wowed Kubrick, to 1974's fiery, episodic ""San Francisco Polyphony"". The earliest music dates from 1951, and is the premiere recording of Ligeti's ""Concert Romanesc"". According to the composer, it was very difficult to perform new music in Hungary at the time, and this piece remained obscure until now. Compared to his later works, it's actually pretty straightforward, calling to mind some of Prokofiev's lighter orchestral music, as well as the Hungarian studies of Bartok. Ha ha, had you going there, right? Anyway, it's fun, if not essential. Apparitions (1958-1959) introduces Ligeti's famed micropolyphony, which is the concept of composing music not as a melody with harmony and rhythm, but as an endless mesh of interweaving textures where no one voice stands out, and the overall effect is not unlike hearing a giant cement mixer of strings and flutes. Ligeti brought that concept to its feverish apex with Atmospheres (1961), one of the most haunting pieces of music of the 20th Century. Kubrick used this music to invoke mystery, discovery and primal fear. 1967's Lontano (also featured by Kubrick in The Shining) is not as dense, but more overtly dissonant. It features more moments of calm, and is a nice balance of Ligeti's extreme polyphony and his relatively calmer material. As far as I can tell, highbrow snobbery and intellectual masturbation is more often a by-product of critics discussing this stuff than it is of the actual music or musicians. Ligeti is great starting place for diving into the world of avant-garde classical: not as sprawlingly eclectic as Stockhausen, nor as single-mindedly consistent as Morton Feldman. And his music is just sitting here waiting for you.","What the hell ever happened to classical music? The answer is obvious if I look beyond my own CD rack ...

The music contained here is nothing short of absolutely essential, epochal rock and roll that sounds like nothing else, including the racks upon racks of albums it eventually inspired. Staggering out of industrial Manchester, England at the height of the post-punk era on a lo-fi bed of jagged, intoxicated guitar work and swaggering rhythm, The Fall were like an alternate rock and roll reality, an entire musical universe unto themselves. Vocalist and band mainstay Mark E Smith's scattershot, loquacious delivery and Northern pride put him in a league of his own, where his sneering, often indecipherable vocals ranged from shocking to hilarious to deeply political, and were never any less than absolutely thrilling. The Fall's three-year tenure at Rough Trade Records is the stuff of legend, full of rancorous label/band fighting (Smith later said he'd rather retire than record for them again), furious live shows, and music that would forever alter the course of independent music. Some of The Fall's best songs are scattered across the two discs of this set. The only other period during which the band were this consistent in their 2\xBD-decade-long (and counting) career was the one that immediately followed it, when the band signed to Beggars Banquet and released some of their best work-- including 1984's The Wonderful and Frightening World of The Fall and their 1985 classic This Nation's Saving Grace, both of which saw them incorporating more distinct pop elements into their sharp-witted, staggering cut-and-thrust. The set opens with the track it was named for, a 1980 single that later appeared on the US edition of Grotesque (After the Gramme). The song is as indicative of The Fall's signature sound as any other, but it's also perhaps one of their most accessible. First come the stomping drums, briefly recalling the opening moments of The Ramones' ""Do You Remember Rock 'n' Roll Radio"", though the similarity ends when Smith grandly announces, ""I'm totally wired,"" his voice stuttering and cracking, turning an otherwise routinely declamatory line into a frantic yelp. The band members echo his chorus, but it's during the verses that Smith drops the song's best lines: ""You don't have to be weird... uh-to be... wiiiired... and I'm always worried."" It's stunning to hear how consistent this band was in their heyday. Throughout their countless genre explorations, they never failed, and always wound up, somehow, sounding like nothing other than The Fall. ""That Man"" is old-fashioned 50s rock 'n' roll, as if the Cold War had really become the nuclear holocaust it always threatened to. ""The Man Whose Head Expanded"" hints at schlocky New Romantic synth-pop with its bleeping keyboard preset (the same one used by Trio for their Volkswagen-resurrected hit ""Da Da Da""), but Smith's rant pulls it back from the brink and the guitars send it lurching into a wandering breakdown and frenzied build-up. The mighty ""Rowche Rumble"", one of the band's defining tracks, soon follows, with Smith's sarcastic opening claim, ""Well, this is a groovy number,"" preceding the nailbomb-like explosion of Marc Riley's and Craig Scanlon's guitars into a jaw-dropping riff. Elsewhere, ""Pay Your Rates"" barrels through production that makes Vampire on Titus sound like Kylie Minogue, while ""New Puritan"" sounds as though it could have been recorded off a depression-era radio show receiving the future of harrowing, abstract art-punk mayhem. And the sinister riffs of ""Pay Your Rates"" and ""Prole Art Threat"" are designed for the sole purpose of detonation and destruction: raw pummeling with little consideration for the rest of the band. Though neither of these discs are arranged in chronological order, the second largely consists of later material than the first, focusing primarily on 1983's Perverted by Language. The album marked the debut of Smith's future wife Brix with the band, and a turn toward slightly more accessible (or at least less grinding) music, and though none of it was ever going to threaten the top of the charts, the group was opening up to a less improvisational stance that made for more direct hooks. In fact, this was the era in which The Fall would do their best work yet, balancing dissonant crunch with more rigid structures. This compilation is invaluable: it's the first time a truly exhaustive compilation of some of The Fall's best material has been made available stateside, where the stuff has long been difficult to track down. Compiling the work of a band like The Fall would be a maddening task, with literally dozens of releases in multiple formats scattered across more than a half-dozen labels. Totally Wired provides an excellent starting point for one of their best periods. Though it does stop short of the thoroughness that might make it a true anthology, Totally Wired pulls from every Rough Trade release The Fall recorded, providing a quality roadmap for where a listener might want to go next, and that's indispensable for a band so worth exploring.","If you've managed to make it this far in life without discovering The Fall, put off whatever purchases\n ...

Deli Mood Spot,K-Rad,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb5b13d197565213b08c/1:1/w_160/d3b29b4f.jpg,2002-10-08 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4371-deli-mood-spot/,Some Odd Pilot,"[This piece reprinted from ""An Interview with MegaMan"", Nintendo Power Magazine, June 2002] It wasn't easy tracking down Mega Man. His publicist said he would be unreachable until the release of the forthcoming ""Mega Man Thugz"" in 2003. So we went vigilante. After asking around Mega's usual haunts-- Gutsman's, Bombman's, etc-- with little luck, we finally ran into him outside of Dr Light's facility in Hollis, Queens, sitting on the stoop with a brown paper-sheathed bottle of Old English Steel Reserve in his hand-apparatus, boombox blasting. That's our Mega Man. MEGAMAN: Yeeeeah boy, what you got? NINTENDO POWER: Yo, Meg, Nintendo Power here. Just wondering if we could have a few minutes to catch up with you on your life, get the scoop on any projects you might be involved in, y'know? MM: Nothin' but love for Nintendo Power, 's all I'm sayin. Word is bond. NP: Thanks much. Now, a lot of people are pointing you out today as the first video game character to incorporate a ""hip-hop aesthetic"", if you will, into your image, predating even Parappa the Rapper. You were the first to use ""sampling"" technology, borrowing attacks from the enemies you defeated... MM: Yeah, I got shit from Cut Man, Heat Man, Wood Man, Beenie Man, Afro Man, Redman, Method Man... NP: Indeed you did. But that was all quite a while back. What are you into now? For example, what's this you're listening to? MM: You ain't heard K-Rad yet? These kids gonna score my next game, yo. It's a different role for me. I play this robot pimp from the year 20XX who gets sent back to the 80s. NP: Yeah, this does sound like an instrumental homage to that period-- or, as such, a throwback to the mid-90s: the simple beats, the flute samples, the quaint vocal snippets... MM: Forget that. It's all right, but check out this next shit. They did this with some old Amiga software. 16 bits, motherfucker. NP: Ah, yes, well, the sounds are very mechanical, and the style is certainly very harsh, a little closer to hardcore techno now than hip-hop. But the overall effect isn't quite the bland steel-on-silicon grind that sort of thing usually turns out to be, maybe because the structure keeps changing, or maybe because of all those submerged vocal samples... MM: Aww, just listen to this shit! This one's called ""Vous""; reminds me of the time I got together with that Metroid chick... NP: Certainly more of a relaxed funk bent on this one, which is unexpected... oh, and I like the way it just dissolves without warning into this gentle outro. But, wait, are you saying this makes you nostalgic? It sounds like they're attempting a decidedly futuristic sound to me. MM: There's no kind of nostalgia like nostalgia for the future. You sure you played Nintendo back in the day, man? NP: Well, I'm mainly wondering whether all of this futurism isn't a little misleading. I mean, there's nothing here that will really advance electronic music, this isn't anything that \xB5-Ziq hasn't done before. MM: But it ain't predictable, neither. Listen to how that synth leaps like Big Baby Jesus over a rehab center wall. These kids compose a whole new show every time they play, and they ain't even started to repeat themselves yet. NP: All right, so it's moderately intelligent dance music. MM: 'Cept you can actually dance to it. Sometimes, I just wanna dance. So do we all, Mega Man. So do we all.","**

Folklore,Sixteen Horsepower,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a438c0084474cd0c0441/1:1/w_160/cc7ff3f4.gif,2002-10-08 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7212-folklore/,Jetset,"So a couple of years ago, I was out of the city, visiting my parents in rural Eastern Connecticut. I was driving home at night, the headlights of my Camry illuminating parts of trees and branches on the sides of the road, but also leaving vast, inky swathes of shadow in which I could see nothing. It was there that I realized that, despite all the statistics and such, I felt safer in densely developed areas like my Boston neighborhood than I did in the woods. In the city, there were people everywhere-- if something terrible happened, someone was likely to see. Out here, though, there was uncertainty. You couldn't see what was out in those woods, and if anything happened to you, it could conceivably be days before anyone found you. And mind you, this was in Connecticut, which doesn't exactly have the deepest swathes of wilderness in the Union. 16 Horsepower's David Eugene Edwards seems to understand this mentality deeply and taps into it quite like no other songwriter I've heard. His music inhabits the darkest corners of the American backwoods, places where shots from the Civil War and the Western frontier still echo, where it's miles to help in any direction. The haunted, creaky music on Folklore, his fifth album with this band, calls out from the traditions of Appalachian and Scottish folk, but with a bizarre, hard-to-pin sound that suggests goth country, as opposed to Southern Gothic. Lyrically, it's practically a distillation of Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music, with themes running from the persecution of sinners by God and demons, to murder on unimproved roads, to country paranoia. It's not a bad fit with the imagery of the Civil War documentary PBS has been rerunning this week. There's a reason for this-- four of the ten songs are covers of traditional tunes that likely date back that far. Sixteen Horsepower also try their hand at the Carter Family's ""Single Girl"", which is featured on the third volume of Smith's anthology. It's one of the few moments on Folklore where the band picks themselves up out of the dirgy murk. It has them galloping along on a jaunty banjo-driven carriage, very nearly approximating that strange, almost-in-tune-but-not-quite singing that colored the original Carter Family recordings. Otherwise, Folklore's a rather dour affair, reaching its most extreme depths on the song that immediately follows ""Single Girl"", the aptly titled ""Beyond the Pale"". Electric piano, brushed drums and vibraphone create a background wasteland, through which Edwards' weary voice travels, harassed by random intonations from an acoustic guitar. ""Beyond the pale/ We keep down our voices/ For that is our way/ Lost in the backwoods/ You awoke and found me there/ Setting the woods on fire,"" sings Edwards as though struggling to breathe. The four traditional offerings come mostly from the Anglo-American folk canon, though ""La Robe a Parasol"" is a freaky Cajun waltz. The two best come in succession: a droning, desolate take on ""Horse Head Fiddle"" that sounds nearly medieval with its backing drone and moaning vocals, and a thrilling version of Nina Simone's ""Sinnerman"". The band begins the latter slowly with acoustic guitar and piano, gradually building rhythmic steam until finally breaking into a full stomp with driving drums and banjo.. Taken as a whole, Folklore doesn't represent so much a new direction for Sixteen Horsepower so much as a narrowing of focus to concentrate on their most doom-laden tendencies. The album crawls from the speakers like a stabbing victim and gives up a great moan; it's a difficult listen, but the rewards are great-- see the subversively rhythmic backing of ""Blessed Persistence"" and the band's lush version of Hank Williams' ""Alone and Forsaken"". Another album like this might prove too much, but these ten songs are just about right.","So a couple of years ago, I was out of the city, visiting my parents in rural Eastern Connecticut. I ...

I Heart Presets EP,Kevin Blechdom,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a304b1335d7bf1698617/1:1/w_160/61e16991.gif,2002-10-08 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/796-i-heart-presets-ep/,Tigerbeat6,"Kevin Blechdom is the giddy-pop half of female DSP duo Blectum from Blechdom. * I Heart Presets * is Kevin's five-track, sixteen-minute * billet-doux * not only to cheap pre-prepared sounds but also to her one-time fave guy, Miguel Trost Depedro (aka Kid 606). Kevin's got a whole lotta love to express here and she's pretty direct with it. Rather than crafting the awkward sound sculptures usually associated with her Blechdom cohort Blevin, Kevin goes straight for bargain-basement rinky-dink tunes and slaps some louche lyrics on the top. The disc sounds as though it took sixteen minutes to record. It's a no-frills celebration of tacky synth modules and crude humor. Like a surly, room-quaking fart during a business meeting, * I Heart Presets * is an antidote to the fussy high-brow IDM that garners most critical attention. Beginning with ""Interspecies Love"", a pro-bestiality ditty stomped out on an out-of-tune piano, Momus' discarded drum machine, and a spastic banjo, Kevin sings, ""Mom's going to kill me when she hears this song,"" and then gets straight to the heart of the matter: ""You've got a hard shell but your belly's soft/ I'm just trying to figure out what gets you off!"" Kevin delivers these lines in a voice that's part quivering Laura Nyro and part declamatory Siouxsie Sioux. During ""Talkin' Tech"", a 47-second distorted-funk slop Kevin acerbically rebukes the IDM community: ""I like the algorithms when they make the funky rhythms/ But most of the time techno-logy don't rhyme! You're anti-melody malady/ You're dismal, minimal, subliminal, delirious, self-serious/ You think you know/ But you really blow."" But the next track, ""Mr. Miguel"", is a raunchy love song to Kid606 in which Kevin confides ""Mr. Miguel/ We're doing just swell/ And it's only getting better/ Because my pussy's feeling wetter."" Kevin is either quite a contrarian or really digs guys who, by her own admission, blow. To orchestrate the bawdy nonsense rhyme ""Shelley Sho'nuf"", Kevin draws on Weimar cabaret, ska, and funfair organ tunes, and holds them together with a ramshackle beat. Because Kevin takes far cheaper and cornier shots than Blevin, I break out Blevin's * Talom Slalom * album more often than Kevin's EP. Where Blevin's album creeps and squirms, * I Heart Presets * struts like a savvy hooker, turning tricks in the gutter but with her head up gazing at the stars. At the very least, Kevin has made me mildly appreciative of presets.","Kevin Blechdom is the giddy-pop half of female DSP duo Blectum from Blechdom.

Light & Magic,Ladytron,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc6cabf31b7dc7155cff/1:1/w_160/664e82d1.jpg,2002-10-08 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4631-light-magic/,Emperor Norton,"Remember the future? How futuristic it was going to be? Cripes, yo, it's 2002-- weren't we supposed to have brainphones and hover-beers by now? Weren't we supposed to be able to seduce our relatives and combat Biff by time-traveling in Deloreans fueled by sewage? Wasn't the government supposed to be teleporting the homeless to Haiti while they sleep? Where are my in-foot skates? Ladytron certainly remembers the future, and they've grasped that it will be symbiotically reliant on the technological dreamwaves of the past-- namely old synth textures. As major playaz in the key-heavy, retro-progressive Genre That Hath Too Many Names, these four Brits knew that stakes was high for their sophomore slab. Anyone expecting the warm organs of 604 will be stung by this disc's stark, arch tones; the band's no longer sittin' on the dock of the analog bay. The distant, bloodless Light & Magic is club-fodder for some Kubrickian half- or post-human future in which android scum mimic the moves of the mammals they were built to replace. Those who dismiss Ladytron releases as ""More Songs About Fashion and Dreck"" get subjected to the circular logic of the Ladytron fanatics who insist that anyone who doesn't get it simply doesn't get it. Despite Ladytron's popularity (congrats on the car commercial, gang, that industry really needed more stylized fetish-marketing!), these satin-jacket-and-secret-handshakes fans act as if the group is still their hidden prize. They also claim that Ladytron are the arbiters of some savvy cultural criticism. Call me thick, but I don't hear it-- and I promise I'm listening for it, as one of the few eager listeners aware that at the peak of boredom perch those who act bored by cult-crit. But where is the sly commentary in songs such as ""Blue Jeans"", ""Cracked LCD"", and ""Black Plastic"", which are about blue jeans, cracked LCDs, and black plastic? And how, on other tracks, can these dashing primpers bemoan the tyranny of fashion? That's like self-arresting inmates, or anti-potassium bananas, or... So you're all, ""Let's 'Tron again/ Like we did last summer,"" only to realize that camp is never as good the second time around. And of course, Ladytron's camp is fussily campy. ""Turn It On"" might be daft, but it's a classic guilty pleasure, reeking of roller-rink digi-breeziness and reminiscent of certain Mantronix/Salt-N-Pepa/Herbie Hancock unmentionables. In fact, more than a couple of these tracks evoke a strange, reverbed collaboration between Yaz and Sir-Mix-A-Lot. Ladytron fans with CDR's full of ""Playgirl"" remixes had better recalibrate their ometer-ometers to withstand the shock; we're a long way from their cover of Human League's ""Open Your Heart"". I draw the kitsch line at ""Flicking Your Switch"", though-- any sophistos laboring to trace Ladytron's roots to aggro-dance greats will hopefully acknowledge that this thin riff summons only, er, (cough) Technotronic. If you're insecure about how these frozen jams polarize your mind, ask people in proximity to you for their reactions: someone whose opinion I value, who is usually tolerant of my stereo worship, demanded that I stop Light & Magic, citing the repetition and the buried vox as key irritants. A pretentious idiot told me that the album was ""post-millennial"", whatever the ass that's supposed to mean in the year 2002. (Man, that was a post-millennial ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" last night.) The non-idiot had a point: this album repeats itself exponentially. I know the songs go nowhere on purpose; that's part of the robo-statement, etc. But I promise you'll want out of this antiseptic defertilization ward unless you're planning a stasis-themed party at the old warehouse out on Cellphone Tower Ave. Mixed signals abound and obtain and endure: the album is by turns ominous and playful; for every passage that feels like ghosts haunting the intercoms at an abandoned airport, there are stretches like ""Seventeen"", which, be warned, is the only thing in the world catchier than Quincy Jones' ""Sanford and Son"" theme. I won't even type its chorus for fear of its voodoo. For every blatant genre flirtation, you get an ice-pop turn like the bouncily experimental ""Re:agents"", which lays claim to a killer flute loop and even dares to meander during its breakdown. The disc's vocals approximate Kim Deal's at welcome intervals, and some Faint-ish noise-blasts emerge, betraying the sheepish control booth. Don't judge this beast by its look-at-me packaging, which reads like one of those salon samplers you ""read"" while waiting for your haircut at 3:15 while your stylist and her 3:00 commiserate about their junkie boyfriends. Ladytron has succeeded at programming a record so distant that you'll wonder just what comprises the wind beneath their wires.","Remember the future? How futuristic it was going to be?

Amore del Tropico,The Black Heart Procession,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2e4ea9e61561daa4b5f/1:1/w_160/0a41ee6d.jpg,2002-10-07 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/763-amore-del-tropico/,Touch and Go,"Life is full of surprises, they say. Call me jaded if you will, but I don't believe it. There are twists and turns, sure, but surprises? Most of us, we work all day, whether for our own edification or for hard-earned cash. We read and watch things, and get drunk and perhaps kiss someone, maybe even fall in and out of love. Nothing too eyebrow-raising. Alright, so maybe I'm just getting caught up in the bleak world of the Black Heart Procession. The Patriots, after all, beat the Rams in the last Super Bowl. That was a pleasant surprise. And the September 11th attacks were, in a blasphemous understatement, an unpleasant surprise. But some people even saw that coming, unfortunate as that certainly is. Did anyone expect the Black Heart Procession's new album to sound like this, though? I'm willing to venture that few people who aren't in with the band expected such a departure. For one thing, the Procession have actually graced their latest work with a non-numerical title, as opposed to their first three albums: 1998's 1, 1999's 2, and 2000's 3. (Well, ok, Three was actually spelled instead of written numerically.) And then, there's the music. Now, the change from 3 to Amore del Tropico isn't so dramatic as the change from, say, OK Computer to Kid A, but there's no question that Amore is a much different sound and a very welcome progression from the dirges that graced their three previous full-lengths. The Procession was once funereal through and through, keeping the same slow pace and lonely lyrics throughout. Here, however, they've taken their march somewhere south of the border. Judging from the instrumentation and odd flourishes, the narrator of Amore has ventured to a small Central American country of beauty and intrigue. Wherever he is, one thing's for sure: things are not going quite as planned. The first track, after all, is called ""The End of Love"", a 12-second instrumental spurt that introduces the listener to what will be a 55-minute tale of lost love and vengeful murder. The subsequent titular track, ""Tropics of Love"" (in translation), opens with the band's trademark instrument, the saw. But then deft strings and hip-swinging percussion set a sexy, noir-ish scene suffused with whispering men and crooning female gypsies. ""Was it here where we left our hearts?"" sings Pall Jenkins. ""Was it here in the tropics of love?"" Something bad is coming, if it hasn't come already. Things are bit shady in Amore del Tropico's storyline, but like a good Lynch-style thriller, time doesn't clarify a damn thing. On ""Broken World"", the narrator seems to be resentfully coming to grips with his upended emotions. Accompanied by out-of-tune guitars and stumbling drums, Jenkins sings, ""I know that you are through with me/ I know that you want to get rid of me/ I know that you have a plan for me/ I know that you want to torture me."" Meanwhile, other tracks, such as ""The Visitor"" and ""A Cry for Love"", indeed don't stray far from the Procession's heavy musical past. But then there's the airy Americana of ""Why I Stay"", the head-bobbing rock of ""Did You Wonder"", and the keyboard-driven ""Sympathy Crime"", with its touches of 70s prog, which seems to detail the narrator's murder of his former lover. As possible evidence, the next tracks offers: ""You bleed, you blister in the sun/ You bleed for everyone."" (There's also a drawing of a slain woman in the album art.) Yet, in the end, the narrator reveals that he is actually the ""one who has disappeared."" Happy times, to be sure. But who would ever buy an album by a band called the Black Heart Procession and expect happiness, anyway? With this record, the band has taken a risky, ambitious leap forward, ditching the capable producer of their previous records, Ryan Hadlock, in favor of manning the boards themselves. The move has paid off in a dense, inspired musical narrative that should, dare I say, surprise fans old and new.","Life is full of surprises, they say.

Reveille,Deerhoof,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8ef9d034d5c69bf3b73/1:1/w_160/2835a6cc.jpg,2002-10-07 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2249-reveille/,5RC,"Four albums into Deerhoof's wonderful and frightening career, it's not easy to ""expect"" anything from them; that's not really what they're ""about"". But if you figured that their third outing, Reveille, would consist of more of the same synapse-frying screeches and rock-driven salvos of noise they've built their name on, you could be forgiven for being wrong. See, there's this line somewhere between ""accessibility"" and The Man, The King, and The Girl, and if Deerhoof haven't quite stepped across it with this album, they're moving in the right direction. Reveille still offers plenty of clattering fury-- just not as much as you may be used to. This time around, the gleeful chaos of their last two Christmas cards from the asylum has been tempered into something more endearingly bizarre. The record careens through sixteen tracks (most of which don't even break two minutes) whose frantic disparity is matched only by their seeming pop innocence. No track is like the one preceding-- or anything else on the album, for that matter-- and even though most of tracks make liberal use of the standard rock armaments (guitars, bass, and lots of drums), few can be so readily described. Deerhoof confounds the casual toss-off of classifiers with a boatload of additional instrumentation: bells, toy xylophones, flutes, strings, and organs, all employed in the most conspicuous way possible. But this veil of eccentricity is like the invisible paint on the stealth bomber, cloaking insidiously sweet melodies (primarily carried by much of the ""accessory"" instrumentation) past all defenses, allowing Deerhoof to deliver its payload of weird-pop hooks directly to your subconscious. Between Satomi Matsuzaki's candy-coated vocals (the earlier limitations of which she seems to have outgrown), and simple arrangements that permit the myriad elements of this album to shine, there's a remarkable wealth of gorgeous melody. In fact, the album falters just twice, and barely at that. ""No One Fed Me So I Stayed"" isn't so much music as it is the muffled sounds of a strange, tortured creature bound and gagged in a cedar chest. Nevertheless, in the album's context, it's surprisingly funny (at least, I laughed, if only out of disbelief-- hilarious or harrowing; take your pick), it just disturbs the pace of the album by being too weird, even among Reveille's other brain-damaging moments. Slightly more serious is the awkward lull caused by the eight-minute ""The Last Trumpeter Swan"". It's a pleasantly straightforward, hypnotic piece of guitar work, primarily, though the least musically engaging piece Deerhoof offer here. Of course, it wouldn't even be an issue if weren't also the album's temporal core, and the only real stall to be found amongst the general panic. It's hard to care much about Reveille's few missteps, though, when confronted with the staggeringly beautiful composition of the remainder of the album. Every cut is a true experience, uniquely inventive and sublime. From the glitch-addled guitar work on ""Holy Night Fever"", to the spacy chanting of ""Our Angel's Ululu"", to ""Top Tim Rubies"" (which was surely rescued from Clinic's dustbin), you're staring down the barrel of total awesomeness. Okay, so that oversells it a little, but not by much. Let's just say this: Reveille's scope needs to be heard to be appreciated.","Four albums into Deerhoof's wonderful and frightening career, it's not easy to ""expect"" anything from them; that's ...

The Lost Tapes,Nas,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c39feb335119a49ed760/1:1/w_160/1caee62d.jpg,2002-10-07 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5709-the-lost-tapes/,ColumbiaIll Will,"It's not easy being Nas. No matter what the man does, no matter how strong he comes, people still come back with, ""It ain't Illmatic."" It's an unfair way to judge someone's work, though you can hardly deny that statement's accuracy. After all, the 90s only spawned a handful of other hip-hop records that can even be mentioned in the same breath as Nas' 1994 classic. With songs like ""Life's a Bitch"", ""One Love"", and ""N.Y. State of Mind"", and producers like Pete Rock, Primo, and Large Professor, Illmatic not only signified Nas at his nastiest and most poetic, but it also represented the pinnacle of 90s NYC hip-hop. The falloff has been a bitch; Nas' sins include releasing what can politely be considered a string of mediocre albums, ghostwriting for Will Smith, and immersing himself in enough beefs to keep a fleet of hip-hop gossip columnists busy for years. But, after all these disappointments, we still hold out hope for the return of hip-hop's prodigal son. And The Lost Tapes does, on the surface, seem like a possible candidate for that revival. Ostentatiously released for the real headz, this collection features tracks only previously released on mixtapes or over the Internet. Hopefully, this means none of the jiggy, commercial-friendly nonsense that's really dragged down his records the past few years. The album's first track, ""Doo Rags"", finds Nas doing what he does best: reminiscing about his youth in the ghetto over a jazzy, piano-based loop. Nas namechecks Beat Street Breakers and the X-Clan while railing against ""political thugs in shark suits [who] persuade us to pull triggers."" At the end of the second verse, he raps, ""Your paper money was the death of Christ/ And all these shorties comin' up just resurrect your life/ It's like a cycle."" After the science of ""Doo Rags"", the resurrection of Rakim's only true successor seems like a real possibility. Unfortunately, Nas' return is pretty short-lived. On the next track, ""My Way"", Nas returns to his pimped-out, diamond-studded-glocks persona. He raps, ""Living my life like everyday is my last night/ Alcoholic on toilets I shit blood/ Foreign cars, models and stars, life of a rich thug."" Yeah, okay. But it must be said that Nas does add a little more to the gangsta formula than most. In the second verse of the song, he gives a vivid retelling of the death of his friend Ill Will, whose name Nas has used for his record label, and concedes that he ""still feels broke with millions in the bank."" The Alchamist (aka Primo-in-Training) provides a nice but somewhat generic beat. Ever the provocateur, Nas does take a couple of shots at his rivals. On ""Purple"", he raps, ""I don't like the way P. Diddy did Shyne with different lawyers,"" while on ""Everybody's Crazy"", he insults someone by calling them a ""Sisqo fag."" In ""Black Zombie"", Nas veers back towards black conscious, deriding the media's stereotypes of African-American as gangstas and hoes, the inequality in the educational system, and black-on-black violence. After hearing Nas spin gangsta narratives on ""Blaze a 50"" and ""My Way"", and after being subjected to the hype surrounding his long string of self-provoked beefs, it isn't hard to spot the hypocrisy in these otherwise noble sentiments. But, when you think about it, haven't the boldest and greatest of us been mired in contradictions: Lenin, Bill Clinton, Bob Dylan, Tupac Shakur... So, maybe we can forgive Nas of his moral contradictions. But what's a little harder to swallow are some of the beats on this album. The Barry White sample on ""No Idea's Original"" is nice, but it doesn't fit Nas' flow on the track. And while ""Blaze a 50"" is an interesting narrative involving betrayal, sex, and murder, the generic violin-based track almost ruins it. Despite its flaws, though, The Lost Tapes is nice. Not a return to form, per se, but possibly as close as we're likely to get. Besides, after all the years and disappointments, the expectations for Nas have finally subsided. What I'm saying is, if you can manage to forget Illmatic, you might actually like the guy again.","It's not easy being Nas.

Demolition,Ryan Adams,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fffc0084474cd0bfa5b/1:1/w_160/3b326114.jpg,2002-10-06 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/39-demolition/,Lost Highway,"Whenever I voice my concerns about Ryan Adams to friends, they cringe in preparation for a misdirected, elitist screed about the dangers of selling out-- just as you may be doing right now. So let me be upfront: I'm happy for the guy. I don't have any personal issues with him, nor do I think he's committed any brazen acts of treason toward the music community at large. Adams has been grooming himself for rock star status for a very long time, without an ounce of subtlety. In fact, he was qualified from the very beginning, when his band Whiskeytown signed with DGC subsidiary Outpost Recordings. If anything, he's overqualified now: he's prolific, talented, and cocksure, and he's got the kind of apple-cheeked, midwestern good looks (and jean-jacket) that suggest rural summer nights spent listening to ""Pink Houses"". Even before Winona, Alanis, Elton John duets, Gap commercials, MTV specials, and the incredibly fortuitous and profitable coup of releasing Gold, with its flag-bedecked cover art and single ""New York"" mere weeks after 9/11, he was as good as in. Gold, though, was a disappointment to many longtime fans, not because he was suddenly the very definition of mainstream success but because it simply couldn't hold a candle to its predecessor, 2000's stunning Heartbreaker. And yet, as uneven, flawed, and possibly symptomatic of megalomania as Gold may have been, it increased Adams' celebrity tenfold. No longer consigned to Sunday morning fodder for sentimental hipsters, alt-country purists, and aging public radio DJs hunting for latest reincarnation of Gram Parsons, Adams became so very famous that both of my parents now own at least one of his albums-- and that, ladies and gentlemen, is saying quite a lot. I once offered up the observation that Ryan Adams would be capable of churning out some of the most solid, affecting music around were he contained in a room and limited to a four-track and the fewest possible instruments. Demolition should, by all rights, be that project. Demos hold the promise of the understated songs I've always wanted to believe Adams left off his bombastic, overwrought last offering. Given what it is, though, Demolition is awfully slick. And while not, in theory, a follow-up to Gold, it's clear from the record's first track, ""Nuclear"", a radio-friendly hybrid of New Nashville and jangly college pop, that Adams intends for this record to be more than just a modest, for-the-fans compilation. The swaggering, AM-dial rock 'n' roll of Gold is recalled in ""Gimme a Sign"", a wide-open space-rocker carried off with satisfactorily crunchy guitar that gets bonus points for the Byrdsian flourishes of Rickenbacker in the choruses. But ""The Pink Hearts"", recorded with Adams' touring band, falters, and despite its roughhewn affectations, sounds mysteriously clean for a purported demo. The ballads, thankfully, fare a bit better. The Nick Drake-flavored ""You Will Always Be the Same"" features sparse accompaniment from an acoustic guitar, cello, and light percussion. Lyrically, it's pretty straightforward, and it's also one of the few tracks here on which Adams is content to be himself, rather than imitating his influences. Likewise, the near-elegiac ""Tomorrow"" features one of most subtle and perfect harmonies I've heard recently, and despite its faulty sequencing (it really ought to have been the closer), it's by far the album's best song. Of course, while Demolition forgoes the overproduction and even much of the shameless rock-god posturing that plagued Gold, Adams hasn't yet found his way out of his songwriting rut. This, perhaps, could be attributed to the nature of the record, since artists tend to save their best material for their official releases. But both the harmonica-driven ""Hallelujah"" and the highly polished ""Cry on Demand"", sound strikingly like many of the misfires that haunted Gold. Elsewhere, the pickin' n' grinnin' ""Chin Up, Cheer Up"" is a none-too-subtle rehash of Heartbreaker's ""Winding Wheel"". Such is the cost of prolificacy-- you can only write so many songs before they all begin to sound alike. Now, Ryan Adams is no stranger to wearing his influences on his sleeve, and it seems like the harder rocking tracks on Demolition want to suggest a punker spirit, despite that, for the most part, it sounds as if he's traded in his Replacements LPs for John Cougar Mellencamp. Still, it's possible that Adams may overcome the somewhat pandering nature of his last two albums to release his best work to date, provided he can rediscover his muse and find a producer that better suits his music. Talent, after all, doesn't just evaporate. And despite all my bitterness at having to stare at Adams' smug, airbrushed glare every time I drive past The Gap on Franklin Street, I like to think he might end up being more than just the guy who used to write good songs.","Whenever I voice my concerns about Ryan Adams to friends, they cringe in preparation for a misdirected, elitist screed about ...

El Naval,Mus,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c41aeb335119a49ed885/1:1/w_160/5c3cb6f9.gif,2002-10-06 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5516-el-naval/,Darla,"It's hard to avoid the faint sense of inadequacy conveyed when describing a work as a ""sketch"". After all, the sketch is generally considered a mere preliminary, an outline for a greater piece to follow. Personally, I'm not sure that dismissal is entirely justified. Comedians jot down their own sketches, for instance, as a basic guide for the action to come. The final result depends on the comic, and the best improvisers bring a scene to life in ways that might not have been envisioned on paper. In general terms, the minimal outline of the sketch has its own appeal: the interpreter gets to flesh out the details. Mus bring us their latest sketches by way of Xix√≥n, Spain, rendered in the Asturian dialect sung by M√≥nica Vacas. As a romance language, it's close enough to Spanish that you may easily translate certain words while others remain mysterious, just on the edge of recognition. Vacas, along with bandmate Fran Gayo, has crafted a fine second album, though not without the help of guests Iv√°n Palacios on bass, Luigi Navarro on guitar, and Frank Rud√∂w on drums. The band has turned away here from the pastoral psychedelia of Aida, their contribution to Darla's ""Bliss Out"" series. Though drenched in deep, midnight blue reverb, El Naval's sparse arrangements take a more realist approach. Roughly half of El Naval consists of near-acoustic piano ballads, while the other half is upbeat and electrified. The latter songs form the heart of the album. ""Embalses y R√≠os"" burns with a vibrant, melancholy bassline reminiscent of The Cure's ""A Night Like This."" Vacas reworks lyrics from Aida, issuing them in her soft, direct style as chimes tingle and a piano breakdown cues the midsection. Later, the jangling guitar introduction of ""Cuesta"" presages an angry, shambling groove, and the ramshackle drums sound all the more startling after the silence. Afterwards, ""Casi Ensin Zarrar los Gueyos"" drifts outward on a bed of synthesizer delay akin to Pink Floyd. The quieter compositions are less remarkable. ""Al Debalu"" begins the album nicely with warm guitars and the steady tick-tock of its percussion, and Vacas's vocals lower to an enticing whisper. But ""Al Oeste de la Divisoria"" allows for altogether too much intimacy, what with the heavy-handed piano form and, more notably, her sniffling intake of breath after every line. I think of it as the ""caught a cold"" song, and strangely enough, it conveys that atmosphere aptly. ""Sacramento"" fares better, with its backwards trails of acoustic guitar spun by guest Irene Tremblay of Aroah. Still, these slow, predictable etches rarely diverge in tangent. By the time ""Rencor"" is reached, the simplified music box jingle sounds like an unnecessary ode to Danny Elfman's Edward Scissorhands score. Which is not to say that Mus lack surprises. The interlude ""Caser√≠a"" uses the production's depth to its advantage, forming an organic glitch pastiche from the echoes of what sounds like a slammed door. Personally, I love the thick reverb on this album, but it's hard to deny the suggestion that overproduction often attempts to hide a lack of ideas. Though Vacas's and Gayo's reliance on the resonance of their instruments and the simple emotive framework of their plaintive rhythms is enough to get them by here, one wishes for some of the progressive songwriting the duo demonstrated on their ""Bliss Out"" volume.","It's hard to avoid the faint sense of inadequacy conveyed when describing a work as a ""sketch"".

In Streams,Centaur,by: Isaiah Violante,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a56bc0084474cd0c06fa/1:1/w_160/d1734110.jpg,2002-10-06 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1374-in-streams/,ParasolMartians Go Home,"Shortly after the stroke of midnight on January 1st, 2001, mere moments after Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric exchanged tipsy fragments of ""Auld Lang Syne"" on national television, Urbana-Champaign's closest brush with mainstream relevance terminated. Hum, the band most of us remember for a single massive pop song called ""Stars"" in the summer of 1995, spent the last two years of their existence cloaked in critical obscurity. While it was as much a coup as a measure of revenge against the corporate rock establishment of the period, a time that saw flannel and lumber turned fashionable, Hum found themselves with little room to maneuver. After 1998's Downward is Heavenward resulted in no significant increase in the band's audience (it sold only 38,000 copies), RCA severed their relationship with the band. Enter Centaur, a band composed of former Hum vocalist/guitarist/songwriter Matt Talbott, drummer Jim Kelly (Sixteen Tons), and bassist Derek Niedringhaus (National Skyline). As a veritable who's who of the Illinois metro area rock scene, Centaur began performing and writing in earnest before Hum officially dissolved. For all practical purposes, Hum came to an end after a bus accident in Canada (a fitting anti-climax) in 1999 but played two reunion shows on December 29th and 31st of 2000. With a steady live presence, Centaur began gaining momentum. Talbott also found the experience liberating as working within a three-piece structure helped weaken the opinion of Centaur as Hum, Jr. What Hum lacked in subtlety, producer Keith Cleversley (Flaming Lips, Hum, Spiritualized, The Posies) has more than made up for here with a painstakingly delicate and nuanced production that puts the overwrought and sappy theatrics of Nigel Goodrich to shame. Where Goodrich attempted to manufacture emotion through a bevy of glitzy studio fanfare on Beck's recent Sea Change, Cleversley manages to capture a tangible sense of pathos at roughly an eighth of the price. Matt Talbott's talent as a songwriter has matured beyond the turgid spectacle that marked his earlier work. Eschewing much of the sonic deluge for a simpler, more pronounced dynamic, primary emphasis is placed upon Talbott's ethereal and generally precarious vocals. In the monstrous ""The Same Place"", a simple repetitive riff builds and repeatedly undermines itself in the best possible way, eventually culminating with a mind-blowing sonic assault that captures (and surpasses) anything Hum was capable of. Steeped in textural density, we witness Talbott's favored technique of heaping layer upon layer of sound over an already sumptuous theme, but this time opting for a more tactful approach of understated melody. In the final minute of ""The Same Place"", Centaur provides so many possible thematic directions that one has the sense the song could literally explode. Yet Talbott's taste is evident as the song disconnects itself and closes abruptly while dangling on the verge of chaos. ""Placencia"" furthers Talbott's Brian Wilson fetish sans-studio theatrics through the use of gentle harmonies and distilled acoustics which provide the best example of Centaur's coherence. Bearing more than a passing resemblance to Pinkerton-era Rivers Cuomo, the lazy surf feel is briefly sacrificed about three minutes in by a series of faux-metal guitar stabs, another example of Centaur's flirtation with discord, and ultimate respect for restraint. ""Thimbles"" explores Talbott's own experience with tragedy, the death of his child and his concurrent sense of failure. ""Glimpse into forever and the empty aching arms and the breath that you could not make/ You still keep us awake,"" and, ""Ripples on the surface, drops in the sea/ We are nothing no matter how long we stay,"" echo disenchantment and alienation in a manner so rife with honesty that the song is almost too stark to bear. Little interpretation is required to realize that the album's dedication-- and the only text printed on the inside of the CD case: ""For Henry... and his Mother"")-- accounts for the subject matter of ""Thimbles"", further adding to the depressive nature of the track by providing a very real connection to an otherwise isolated rock song. As wave upon wave of subdued dissonance crash upon the sonorous drone of Talbott's vocals at the song's climax, the disparity provides an interesting counterpoint in the form of personal suffering opposite bleak, unflinching reality. In Streams stumbles in two places, namely the ill-advised Flaming Lips kitsch of ""Life Begins"", with Talbott's cracking voice rivaling Wayne Coyne at his most egregious, and the emo-core tedium of ""Strangers on 5"". As a general rule, extended keyboard interludes are best avoided in a rock setting, and ""Strangers"" is certainly no exception. The album's title track also suffers from the same synth virus but to a lesser degree. Although the Gary Numan synthline is a tad heavy-handed, ""In Streams"" is an epic track, clocking in at over thirteen minutes and fully encapsulating all of the sonic territory Centaur spent the previous 45 minutes delineating. Incorporating the alt-country sensibility of Wilco and the electronic-rock meld of Radiohead, the title track is an outright masterpiece. And while a brilliant piece for 9:05, the four-minute synth outro is an example of what happens when talented songwriters suddenly decide to become Vangelis and should probably have been omitted. Synthesized indulgences aside, Centaur have unleashed a wonderfully textured rock album. The band has galvanized the experimentation of Hum in a cohesive package, and with a significantly more tactful hand. Ultimately, the true achievement of this album lies within the absence of major label politics. Without pressures exerted by BMG Entertainment, RCA, or any other corporate demigod, Talbott was free to pursue precisely the sound he wanted at his own pace and with minimal expectations. The result is a rewarding picture of sorrow and promise from one of the brightest and oft-overlooked songwriters of the past decade.","Shortly after the stroke of midnight on January 1st, 2001, mere moments after Tom Brokaw and Katie Couric exchanged tipsy ...

Jennie Bomb,Sahara Hotnights,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3355e6ef959693205c8/1:1/w_160/609b6324.jpg,2002-10-06 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6967-jennie-bomb/,Jetset,"I think it's safe to say that Sweden has taken Iceland's place as the #1 source for hot import bands. Personally, I'm damn fascinated with this new wave of Scandinavian garage-punk, seeing as the pale and friendly Swedes have always projected an image fairly lacking in angst and attitude. But these days, thanks to The Hives, The Hellacopters, and Soundtrack of Our Lives, snow and skiing have bumped from my stereotype file on the northern European country and replaced with a mental picture of a place where Nuggets is assigned listening for schoolchildren and the poet laureate is Howard DeVoto. Book me a flight to Stockholm! Fortunately, I'm friends with an actual, genuine Swedish guy, granting me the journalistic edge on the kind of Sweden profiles that have been popping up everywhere lately. So now, in a Pitchf√∏rk Exklusiv, I can disclose the true secret ingredient of the Swedish Invasion's allure. Playing me a 1970s #1 Swedish hit with lyrics that pay tribute to the 1960s Beatles over music that sounds distinctly 1950s, my source sums it up succinctly, ""Swedish music has always been about twenty years behind the rest of the world."" And there it is, the reason why some might find The Hives more authentic throwbacks than American wayback White Strokes acts-- for Swedish musicians, the new wave really is still new, not the retro fad of Western culture. Which brings us to the Sahara Hotnights, the next Swedish band with a turn of the 80s look/sound to jump from Stockholm to stardom. Rocking a distinctly Joan Jett vibe, the all-girl foursome can't avoid the ""female Hives"" comparison, a typecasting made worse by frontlady Maria Andersson's relationship with Hives ringleader Pelle Almqvist. Following the same reissue-of-old-import-material plan as their dates to the rock prom, Jennie Bomb finds the Hotnights hoping to avoid a sophomore slump for their homeland, thus proving that Sweden is more Manchester than Halifax. Judging by the album, early signs are pretty good for the scene's longevity, if not entirely conclusive. While reports that Sahara Hotnights bring a harder sound than their countrymen have been greatly exaggerated, the band brings a comparably bratty attitude, albeit one that has had a good share of its rough edges polished off. This approach occasionally leaves the Hotnights sounding more Pat Benatar than punk, with slick production undermining in-your-face middle-fingers like ""Alright Alright (Here's My Fist, Where's the Fight),"" but can't hide the rock band songwriting chops beneath. Indeed, Jennie Bomb appears to be yet another shoe-in for radio rock airplay, with standard euphoric big-chorus format, chord progressions from the familiar-but-ear-pleasing school, shouty vocals (perfect for at-home replication) from all four band members. ""With or Without Control"", the obvious heavy-rotation candidate of the bunch, even features the old pop song trick (last-chorus key-change) employed to exhaustion by the boy band throngs, but sounding pretty refreshing in this context. Now, I'll be upfront about this: despite my groundbreaking Sweden time-capsule theory, Sahara Hotnights occasionally seem to be aware that the 90s happened, bringing to mind Sleater-Kinney influence when they're on (""Fall Into Line"", ""Down and Out"") and Veruca Salt infection when they're not (""Only the Fakes Survive""). And naturally, Andersson doesn't possess the riveting vocal talents of a Corin Tucker, so when the hooks aren't sharp enough the Hotnights can't fall back on raw sass like those white-tie-wearing motherfuckers. Jennie Bomb has also lost something in the translation from import release to domestic Jetset product: ""A Perfect Mess"" and ""Are You Happy Now?,"" two excellent songs mysteriously missing from the new reasonably-priced domestic version. All the same, it's about time a group brought some feminine influence to this garage revival game, as Meg White's learn-as-you-go drumming didn't provide nearly enough estrogen. And it's even more gratifying to see it coming from Sweden, the women of which having long been unfortunately associated in the American cortex with the beer-company cheesecake bikini team. Sahara Hotnights might not be the best all-girl rock act in the business, or the best export from their wintry homeland, but they certainly don't do anything to damage the hipness quotient of the yellow-and-blue.","I think it's safe to say that Sweden has taken Iceland's place as the #1 source for hot ...

It is everything you could conjure, juvenile and immediate, like the overblown store-bought psychedelia of Pink Floyd: mall and science museum culture. Like a proudly brandished tie-dyed t-shirt, Black Dice dances and hums its way from a Phish concert crowd straight to the Knitting Factory by avoiding the funk, amping the jams, and turning up the volume. Black Dice's Beaches and Canyons is full of spaced-out planetarium moments, drenched in high-pitched squeals and thunderous low end. ""Seabird"" is a tone poem: the repeated sound/image of flight and wings is warped until only creaks remain. Repetitive knob-turning seems to conjure animals who appear to be fighting. The frogs always win. The album generally tends to eschew pounding hardcore rhythms, employing beats in unique and clever ways throughout the compositions to keep them vital. The drums are very effective throughout in their ability to add presence to the ongoing loops, adding a pounding heart to the web of tortured sounds and affected melodies. While the violence seems to be almost entirely washed away from their previous efforts, the impressive aspect of this LP is its ability to translate the live show for which the Black Dice is primarily known into a private show-- an ideal recording. These songs seem more like juxtapositions, blueprints, instructions. With Beaches and Canyons, Black Dice fully embrace the chanting, pounding and moaning of the Grateful Dead: lovin' the jam. These songs, all of which I've heard played live in the past six or so months, are imminently changeable, fluid, and interesting. The songs reveal themselves in subtle ways, hiding their identities for minutes at a time, then briefly reappearing as themselves throughout the song, as a slightly repeating pattern or token sound. The songs go out of and back into themselves in a manner similar to John Coltrane's late-era renditions of ""My Favorite Things"": the crowd in Japan, stunned by an hour-long take on Rodgers & Hammerstein, suddenly remember what they're enjoying when the theme returns as a slurred parade of squeaked notes. ""The Dream is Going Down"" is Black Dice at its evocative best. At the end, the song breaks down, like any good trip, into its most primal elements: Hisham pounds away on the drums, Aaron hums and half-sings through thick delay while Bjorn and Eric shriek and wail on guitar, voice, and effects. ""Big Drop"" points to Black Dice's most violent impulses, spreading seven or eight grindcore melodies over the course of nearly 17 minutes. It seems to be all beach here, too-- ebbing, flowing, and following the water. The screams are balanced with falsetto moaning, which falls into itself, collapsing, canyoning, ending. ""Endless Happiness"" is a mess of recorder sounds and chiming, ring-modulated guitar, as well as the heavy bass swells for which Aaron is known. The percussion kicks in halfway through the track, and the recorder begins to sound Ayler-esque while the modulations and bass swells stay constant. The loops reach a frantic pace before dying, leaving a bed of static dry air. Air is overcome by water, and the end of the track is a thorough brain-cleaning, a nice and clear literal representation of the 'beaches' component. The collage of water samples lasts for several minutes-- a lucid translation from thought into music of a serenity Black Dice rarely acheive. Black Dice have managed to create an album that properly illustrates the changing nature of their sound. Many groups have found this extremely difficult to achieve on tape, often sticking to formulas in the studio while limiting their experiments to live shows. Beaches and Canyons is an intense document of Black Dice's evolution-- cycling through styles and equipment like they're simple and meaningless tools, eyes on the goal of reorganizing sound and transforming it through sheer volume.","New York City is a laser light show.

Eyes Adrift,Eyes Adrift,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcdd5e6ef95969322f30/1:1/w_160/484607f2.jpg,2002-10-03 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2887-eyes-adrift/,spinART,"Washing up is hard to do. Or at least that's what I like to tell myself, if only because that makes it easier to believe it's just a fluke when talent falls on its face. I mean, god forbid my heroes and idols should just happen to tank; I mean, it's not a given that musicians lose their edge along with their hair... is it?. I find it sunnier to convince myself that these tankings are isolated incidents-- at least, until the washed-up begin to accrete, forming Farm Aid-sized clots in the arteries of the entertainment industry. Then I start to worry. Listening to Eyes Adrift is like watching the fat Orson Welles play the fat Elvis (in a Quentin Tarantino film)-- which is to say, worrying. Technically, this band might as well be called the Meat Puppets, as frontman Curt Kirkwood used the name for his last album even after parting ways with the Pups of old (Derrick Bostrom and Kirkwood's brother Cris). Maybe he thought the name change would revitalize his sound, which, after the Puppets's fantastic run of albums in the 80s, had veered sharply into a sort of ZZ Top-country arena before becoming stuck in a bog of general alternativity. But Kirkwood didn't just change the name-- that alone surely couldn't improve the music... but a change in lineup? Now we're talking. Apparently, while Curt was on his first solo tour, Nirvana's Krist Novoselic and Sublime's Bud Gaugh both called him, out of the blue, intent on a quick jam before he left town. The rest, as history, doesn't need to be repeated. As members of mythical bands whose legends were cut short, you might imagine these two would have some kind of spark left to contribute. Unfortunately, as sidemen who both lost charismatic frontmen, they also tend to fall right in line behind Curt. When Nirvana, in their most magnanimous act of indie community service, brought the Kirkwood brothers on stage and covered three songs from Meat Puppets II for their ""Unplugged"" session, it sounded living, vital, and appropriate, with each group's distinct brand of nihilism rubbing up against the others. Here, however, the great potential of Novoselic's menacing basswork gets summarily steamrolled by the overall cleanliness of the proceedings, and he takes a distant backseat to Kirkwood's guitar. Even his surprise turns on vocals, which come off as goofy but just raw enough to have a shot at working, can't survive in an atmosphere tailored to Kirkwood's adopted two-dimensional singing style. And, while a reggae experiment would probably have been ill-advised (as they usually are), the band's adherence to pop/rock rhythms doesn't give Gaugh a chance to shine, either. Even on the obligatory 15-minute closing jam, ""Pasted"", Kirkwood's guitar grabs the spotlight and refuses to let go. Some of these songs, like Pasted, fail in fairly conventional, generic ways. The opener, ""Sleight of Hand"", is as thin as its title suggests, doing little more than establishing a shimmery lounge-jazz atmosphere. ""Telescopes"" goes to the other extreme, replicating the Pups's recent forays into benign metal with glibly surreal lyrics. Elsewhere, some initially promising songs are roughly strangled to death in their first minute; ""Alaska"" starts with a standard but pretty Kirkwood guitar arpeggio before mercilessly bludgeoning it with a power-chord chorus. Novoselic gives a gutsy vocal performance on the odd rockabilly number ""Dottie Dawn and Julie Jewel"", but Kirkwood, as on most of the rest of the record, can't think of anything better to do with the song than to add an effected guitar solo, this time sounding like Charlie Sexton in a wind tunnel. The album's most likeable songs are its least adventurous ones; ""Untried"" has a pretty chorus melody echoed by a fluid guitar line, and ""Pyramids"" has a mellow sort of yearning to it. But most of this stuff is middling at best, and while it could be explained away by poor production or lack of effort, it doesn't take much to tip the scale in the other direction. Enter ""Inquiring Minds"", a song that is, from start to finish, one giant convulsive cringe. Over a feathery guitar intro, Novoselic falsettos, ""They put flowers on your grave, JonBenet,"" and the song crashes head-on into a wretched ballad about the murdered celebrity child. It's not just the lyrical obsession with exhuming the girl's body that makes this so awful; it's the fact that the song isn't really sure whether or not it's a tasteless parody. At times, the band seems to (understandably) offer sympathy to Ms Ramsey-- in the form of a kind line (""You can never ask them"") or one of Kirkwood's prolific, dripping-with-sincerity solos-- only to snatch it right back with a sneer from Novoselic. In ""Solid"", which sounds like an ode to lost inspiration, Kirkwood sings, ""What I am's a plastic man.../ I could cut myself and nothing would come out/ 'Cause the blood is frozen solid in my veins."" After a few listens, you begin to realize that there's nothing in the uninspired plod of the song to contradict him. Ultimately, Curt may be expressing some sort of universal truth about fame, talent, and insatiable expectations here. But did he really have to get together with a bunch of his similarly disillusioned friends to tell it (and destroy my illusions in the process)? Inquiring minds want to know.","Washing up is hard to do. Or at least that's what I like to tell myself, if only because ...

How tempting it is, after one pass through two albums (Part One and Part Three) and their companion twelve-inch (Part Two), to conclude that the rumors are truth. The chiming synth pads, intricate drum programming, and loopy but captivating melodic eccentricity certainly point in his direction. But then, Aphex has been so vastly influential that any bedroom patcher and DSP-er at some point references his work; judging by his recent live performances of Whitehouse-like noise, the only person who doesn't want to be James is James himself. And I have serious doubts that Astrobotnia is. The two CD releases are true to the Rephlex school of sound design: geared for home-listening rather than club use, and riddled with fearsome drum machine programming and gleaming ambient chords which surf the crests of adapted jungle rhythms. Though Astrobotnia, wisely, shows delicacy with the opener to Part One, ""Lightworks"". Emerging from the far distance, echoed crackles and faint explosions of fireworks provoke giggles from children. Astrobotnia deftly morphs these firework sounds into a fragile but complex series of beats, which he binds together with a shimmering belt. It's quite the most gorgeous opening track I've heard all year. ""Hallo"" spends three-quarters of its length pitting breaks against beatlessness until Astrobotnia relents and allows the beatless to shimmer towards the final fade. By contrast, ""Everyone"" is a nagging chant (""I want to kill everyone/ Satan is good/ Satan is our pal""), borrowing the comic-demonic from Aphex's ""Come to Daddy"" and combining it with the goofball lechery of ""Milkman"". ""Acidophilus"" demonstrates how mysterious the classic 303 acid squiggle can be when hemmed within a drifting chords. Later, ""Miss June"", ""Sweden"", and ""The Wing Thing"" bring home a DMX Krew/Aphex fusion of choice electro cuts. Released on a twelve-inch, the six untitled tracks that comprise Part Two are primed and cut for clubs, recalling the intoxicating pounding excesses of Squarepusher's Big Loada. ""Track One"" is a Metalheadz rinse-out made galactic by Namlook-like ambient waves. ""Track Three"" is a Stockhausen-style noise collage that sounds remixed by Newbuild-era 808 State. ""Track Four"" samples the same snippet of Lyn Collins' ""Think"" that DJ Rob Base & DJ EZ Rock snagged for their classic ""It Takes Two"" phased, flanged, and timestretched with caustic rips and ambient nastiness. And the final track recapitulates much of the previous five, but adds a humorously dated future-sound with Astrobotnia's widespread use of retro-spacy BBC Radiophonic Workshop vibes. Part Three returns to the expansive headspace of Part One, albeit with a more malevolent undertow. Here, the elements that make Part One so lush and celebratory are curiously corrupted. ""B"" bears the same Metalheadz rhythms as ""Track One"" of Part Two but underpins them with searing blasts of distortion and clangs of spacejunk. ""Acidophilus II"" is the abrasive sibling to the ""Acidphilus"" of Part One; its 303 squiggle is downright menacing. ""Esther Calling Jennifer"" is even more disturbing: a chthonic growling reigns unchallenged until Astrobotnia releases ninja rhythms which make their stealthy ways to windswept targets. Though none of these releases breaks new ground, they are unmistakably nostalgic and exactly what I've hoped Aphex might return to. They all hark back to a time when jungle's breakbeats saved IDM from disappearing into an exitless series of ever-decreasing circles. Breakbeats liberated producers from the impositions of relentless four-to-the-floor stomping, and ""braindance"" escaped the mind/body binary opposition of electronic music-- here was a rhythmically hyper, complex genre that retained its club roots by appending fantastically supple limbs to the listener's fervid imagination. And Astrobotnia, whoever he or she is, sumptuously celebrates that music.","The Aphex-founded and self-described ""braindance"" label Rephlex released the first three Astrobotnia efforts within a month of each other, never ...

The Golden Vessyl of Sound,Yume Bitsu,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aadaea9e61561daa5c5c/1:1/w_160/c57ef49f.jpg,2002-10-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8836-the-golden-vessyl-of-sound/,K,"Portland's Yume Bitsu has been around. In existence since '95, the band has already released four albums, and divides their time between a wealth of side projects: singer/guitarist Adam Forkner makes music with drone-rock surrealists Surface of Eceon; drummer Jason Anderson leads Wolf Colonel; keyboardist Alex Bundy releases solo material as Planetarium Music. Their last album, 2000's Auspicious Winds, was released too late in the year to make most peoples' year-end lists, but was, in itself, an incredibly powerful bliss-out session that echoed Spiritualized circa Lazer Guided Melodies not just in sound and scope, but in that its spacy, intertwining jams would, after several ethereal minutes, eventually arrive at beautifully ebbing-- and strikingly catchy-- pop songs. Bubbling under their newest release, The Golden Vessyl of Sound, is an entrenched band mythology involving moth people, interplanetary craft, and the Small Towers of the Elders. There's a story unfolding here. The narrative, however, is not germane to the enjoyment of the record. As you listen to these nine tracks, which drift from classic shoegaze textures to late-60s psychedelia (with an extended stopover in the cavernous tank where Pauline Oliveros and Stuart Dempster practice Deep Listening), your mind will wander, and you'll come up with images of your own. Their press release indicates that these songs were built out of improvisations and were not titled out of respect for the sanctity of the ""the moment"". As such, Yume Bitsu would prefer I refer to the sound that appears when I hit play and then press my CD player's ""forward button"" twice as ""Song Three"", but I'd like to title this gorgeous snippet ""We'll Be Together"". These are the words Forkner harmonizes with himself, sounding something like Doug Martsch after a really good night's sleep. It's such a simple song, with the chiming Galaxie 500-esque guitars swaying between two chords and the aching purity of the layered vocal. And at two minutes, it's also sadistically short, a rare dip into brevity on an album filled with expansive jams. While Forkner's vocals make only occasional appearances on The Golden Vessyl of Sound, they're a large part of what makes it so special. Our ears have long since grown accustomed to jammy, neo-shoegaze bands burying monotone warbling between sheets of guitar feedback (""It's just another instrument,"" they like to say). So it's pleasantly disorienting to hear singing this careful and audible on an album packed with interstellar explorations. Hell, the harmonies on ""Song Seven"", a soaring track filled with moth-people imagery and punctuated by snare and handclaps, sound as tightly assembled as anything off 1970s AM radio. Still, the fact that the album is about 90% instrumental seems just right in the end, increasing the emotional impact of the vocals exponentially. Of course, as with any band with two guitarists that specializes in long, slowly developing jams, the six-string is the centerpiece, and Yume Bitsu's guitarists extract a fantastic amount of sound from theirs. The echoing, fuzz-encircled tone that accompanies the extended freakout of ""Song One"" deserves to bounce around a canyon somewhere. Combined with a primal ""eeee-yahhhh"" from Forkner and some layered trumpets, the track turns into the aural equivalent of a sunrise in Sedona. ""Song Six"" switches out a controlled feedback drone for the lead-line fuzztone, the guitars harmonizing with extended trombone drones (this fine track owes a lot to Oliveros). Elsewhere, the punchy closer, ""Song Nine"", mixes IDM-style drum programming with intertwined guitars and synths, and Bundy gets his moment with ""Song Four"", which backgrounds the guitars for his Tangerine Dream sequencers, lending an early 70s Rhineland feel. Though it has its share of dark shadings (particularly the drones of ""Song Six""), The Golden Vessyl of Sound glows with positivity, just as its title would indicate. Yume Bitsu is the sound of four men in love with sound who know how to channel their collective energy. Myths and backstory be damned, this is one of the best psychedelic albums of the year.","Portland's Yume Bitsu has been around.

A Taste of Merzbow,Merzbow,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c44769fc7814a47cd849/1:1/w_160/50c89fd5.gif,2002-10-02 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5247-a-taste-of-merzbow/,Mego,"Musicians struggle for years to transcend the context of their art. These people work hard to create works that will somehow stand apart from the rest of the product delivered by other musicians, works that will somehow instantly connect with many people at once. This phenomenon isn't unique to music, of course, but it does seem oddly, mundanely survivalist for a group of people who would be called ""artists"". The daily ritual of distinguishing oneself-- while never remaining distinguished for so long that one is surpassed by the next wave-- spans entire species, and even the most insular musicians will march alongside normal folk to this tune. However, despite this constant mutation of style, artists will occasionally emerge from their time as its representative. Nature generally allows these instances to run a short course before devouring them into nothingness. Think of those artists who overpowered the grind of their eras: Bach, Wagner, Miles Davis, The Beatles-- all of these people were consistently displaced of their time by the striking originality of their work, and yet were quintessentially ""then"". This is rare, indeed, and there is a case for including Masami Akita in such a group. Merzbow, as Masami is usually known, was born in 1956 in Japan. He studied painting and art history in college, and worked as an editor and writer for experimental art publications after graduating. From a very early point, Merzbow (named after the painting ""Merzbau"" by noted avant-garde artist Kurt Schwitters) was interested in 20th Century extremist concepts such as Surrealism and Art Brut (a principal wherein only personal impulse/delusion inform one's art, rather than external styles or works). Furthermore, his interest and reportedly vast knowledge of bondage and pornography are common visual references accompanying his music. His own releases number in the hundreds, and if any musical fabric binds them, it is that of total determination to assault listener senses. I can't say he is self-indulgent any more than I can say he is deviant any more than I can say he is a genius any more than I can say he is not. He is Merzbow, and if you have followed his journey for long, that means more than any other context. A Taste of Merzbow is his first solo release (second overall) for Austrian imprint Mego, and features many of the common elements of his work: tape loops, metallic percussion jabs, squealing feedback and drastic bursts of other unidentified noise. It is also the latest in his recent line of computer-based music. Don't let the label or his hard-drive fool you: this is still Merzbow at his overloaded best/worst, and despite the record's quaint Japanese cuisine theme (each piece is associated with a traditional dish, complete with recipe on individual CD inserts), is not the first place to go for anyone testing the waters of experimental electronic, musique concr√®te, or even noise music. Mammoth workouts like ""Turban Shell Blues"" and ""Tempura in Moss Garden"" attest to Merzbow's singular visions of radical overkill and pleasure through pain. The latter features layers upon layers of howling static-thunder and what sounds like the distorted shattering of glass, all over the insistent pulse of an electronic bass drum. After 10 minutes, it is headache inducing; at 22 minutes it is either life-affirming or suicide-coercing. Contradiction plays no less a part in the former track, wherein the opening percussion loop hints at a hidden structure at work, only to explode into a furious void of feedback, blacksmith hammering and omnipresent static. Despite sonic evidence to the contrary, Merzbow does have roots. He has spoken of his early admiration for everyone from Jimi Hendrix to Iannis Xenakis, and elaborated at length on the meaning of his uses of bondage and porn images with some of his music. On the one hand, he is merely the brightest fire in an eclectic, almost anarchic Japanese music scene. On the other, Merzbow's music shatters scenes and precedents. Masami Akita is his own context, and listeners enter that world at their own risk.","Musicians struggle for years to transcend the context of their art.

Music for a Meteor Shower,Tara Jane O‚ÄôNeilDaniel Littleton,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9de5e6ef95969322a7d/1:1/w_160/80fc6151.jpg,2002-10-02 05:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6004-music-for-a-meteor-shower/,Tiger Style,"A guy, a girl, and a guitar: like Lou Reed said, the possibilities are endless. The results are also almost always a lot more interesting than this. Apparently, Dan Littleton, the Alpha Male of the indie folk group Ida, and Tara Jane O'Neil, ex-fill-in-the-blank (Rodan, the Sonora Pine, Retsin), felt that, after touring extensively together with their own respective songs, they should take that big next step and become more-than-tourmates. So they made an album together. Sure, they knew it would be awkward at times, and that their friends might think they were weird, but you know what? You can't blame the kids for trying. Every time they sat down before that four-track, they must have gazed sweetly into each others' eyes, whispered ""no regrets"", and started banging morosely on their instruments. Actually, despite song titles suggestive of upper-crust adolescent crushes (""Juliette"", ""The Langorous Girl"", ""Sweet Neck"") and the general mood of tentativeness that these instrumentals invoke, you get the sense that O'Neil and Littleton are pretty confident in what they're playing, that each string-pop and off-key note, however random-sounding, was intentional on some level. That, however, is about the best thing they've got going for them here. Perhaps it's that grim determinism that sinks this (and marks this) as an attempt at improvised music from two singer/songwriters. Almost every piece opens with one guitarist playing a very simple figure at a mournful tempo while the other pokes around on his or her fretboard, sometimes tonally, sometimes prettily, most times not. And, well, they pretty much just go on like that. Sometimes they substitute other instruments for the guitars (murky keyboards, a vibraphone, etc), but they're basically filling the same roles. In time (unless, in the name of fragmentation, the pieces cut out suddenly in the middle, as many tend to do), O'Neil and Littleton introduce very subtle changes in the atmosphere, but ""time"" here means around six minutes, minimum. The two give themselves an awful lot of space, temporally and sonically, but they rarely do anything meaningful with it. Improvisation usually means that the unexpected can happen; here, things quickly become all too familiar. Which is not to say that the static approach never works; ""The Disembodied Juliette"" manages to swell beautifully without ever really changing (aside from the entrance of a few well-placed, distorted vocals near the end), and the hints of electronic texture added to ""The Langorous Girl"" set it apart from the rest of the general sparseness. However, when O'Neil and Littleton had to do so little to get so much more out of these two pieces, it's a wonder they didn't do the same with the rest. The oddball song, a gentle French-pop pastiche called ""Ooh La La..."", coaxes twee-as-hell vocals from both participants into a formlessly slight, sweet melody. Now, I don't pretend to speak French, but I feel vaguely like I'm being cheated; lines like ""parfait Curvoisier de montage"" sound like they could just be meaningless collages of Franglish words. Could I find deeper meaning if I dug into the song? Is this just a bunch of crap O'Neil and Littleton pasted together? Are they making little boy/girl twitters at me as I listen? The song, like the album, doesn't convince me to care either way.","A guy, a girl, and a guitar: like Lou Reed said, the possibilities are endless. The results are also almost ...

My Love is Rotten to the Core,Tim Hecker,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c096eb335119a49ed3fb/1:1/w_160/93b0dd8d.gif,2002-10-02 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3797-my-love-is-rotten-to-the-core/,Alien8,"Recontextualization is one of the oldest ideas in electronic music. Dating back at least to musique concr√®te, artists have been pulling sounds from one setting and sticking them into another, radically transforming the content of the source material. More recently, artists like Ultra Red, Terre Thaemlitz and Matthew Herbert have taken sounds and shaped them to comment on immigration (Ultra Red's La Economia Nueva) identity politics (Thaemlitz' Interstices) and corporate globalism (Herbert's record as Radioboy, The Mechanics of Destruction), among other hot topics. But as Montreal's Tim Hecker demonstrates, not all recontextualization need be so political. The emerging Hecker joins the culture jammers with this 25-minute EP, his second release under his own name. As the cover art and title make clear, My Love is Rotten to the Core is built from the processed sounds of Van Halen. Excerpts from a David Lee Roth interview open the record, and the first track, ""Introducing Carl Cocks"", is peppered with Kid-606-style cut-ups of Eddie's lead on ""Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love,"" while a series of familiar ""Hey hey hey!"" shouts appear at key points. No question, it's a fantastic, mind-warping track. As the record wears on, musical sources become harder to place and noise becomes more prominent. ""Sammy Loves Eddie Hates David"" contains more dialog and some creepily processed onstage banner by Roth, and then ""Hello Detroit"" dives into swirling digital scree. The minute-long ""Midnight Whispers"" is nothing but interview chatter fading into ""The Return of Sam Snead"", which adds several layers of voices and sets them against a quivering sound that could be a time-stretched guitar or might be a late-period Eddie synth. The lead tone on ""The Return of Sam Snead"" eventually shatters into smaller pieces, some of which spin off into little loops of their own. My Love is Rotten to the Core is a decent record with at least one great moment, but I can't help but wonder: what made Tim Hecker want to build an EP around the sights and sounds of Van Halen? Printed on the inside sleeve is the line, ""You have nothing to lose but your hair,"" so it seems reasonable to conclude that Hecker is making fun of the band and/or Roth. But the music contains almost no humor at all (the shredding of the guitar might bring a smile, but more one of recognition), and how fun could putting down Diamond Dave possibly be in any case? Ultimately, the relationship between the sources and the final tracks on My Love is Rotten to the Core is uncertain, a problem when extrapolating from such a recognizable pop culture icon. ""Introducing Carl Cocks"" is the only truly exceptional track-- I love the way Hecker twists Eddie's lead, retaining enough of the familiar tone to jog the memory only to seriously disorient it. It's such a strong track it almost makes the EP, but then the rest is merely pretty good abstract laptop music that happens to be made from guitar solos, with a few interviews thrown in. Most of it could be from anywhere, though, and I can't help wishing it were presented differently.","Recontextualization is one of the oldest ideas in electronic music.

Velocity of Sound,The Apples in Stereo,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0d95e6ef95969320053/1:1/w_160/6f254b26.jpg,2002-10-02 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/250-velocity-of-sound/,spinART,"If metal is the new indie rock, as little voices have been telling me, then children's music is becoming the new noise-pop-- just ask They Might Be Giants. Or Elephant 6, for that matter, who seem to be undergoing a gradual metamorphosis into Tin Pan Alley for Nickelodeon viewers, what with Bill Doss' Sunshine Fix concept album about the sun, Beulah's live cover of ""The Alphabet Song"", and Of Montreal's ongoing campaign to give the world's children horrific nightmares. One almost begins to think that Jeff Mangum's return to the musical scene will be a sex education concept album called Ovary & The Semen-Stained Mountaintops. Now comes Velocity of Sound by The Apples in Stereo, an album that confirms that the Colorado-based quintet has now made the full transistion to animated status. I'll admit that this impression is more than a little informed by the band's Roger Rabbit-inspired video for ""Let's Go"", a short promotional piece run constantly as space-filler on the Cartoon Network. But since Schneider & Co achieved more success than ever thanks to that song's inclusion on the ""Powerpuff Girls""' curiously indie-friendly souvenir LP, it's no surprise to find the band milking the preferences of their newly acquired audience. Of course, said audience's median age is about nine years old, meaning the band's approach might have to be stripped down somewhat to tickle the pre-teen ear. Which is what we hear. All of the standard Apples in Stereo elements have been greatly exaggerated on this outing: the tempo is uniformly set at a brisk gallop, the runtimes are shorter than ever, the guitars are more fuzzed-out and trebly, and the vocals are accelerated to make Schneider sound girlish-- and to make actual girl Hilarie Sidney squeaky like a chipmunk or elf or chipmunk/elf hybrid. And though the Apples have always been strongly confectionary, Velocity of Sound ramps up the sugar content to equal a year's worth of impulse binges at FAO Schweetz. But if you've got a sweet tooth, Velocity of Sound does provide a few irresistible vending machine snacks. Take ""Baroque"", which transforms the usual ""ba ba ba"" backing vocals into a neat Bach-inspired three-part arpeggio, and ""Rainfall"" is the first Hilarie-sung song not to be buried and forgotten in the middle of an Apples album-- rightfully so, too, as its amphetamine country drumbeat and Pixies-esque lead guitar are a sunny afternoon good time for any age. Too bad the striving for simplicity also holds back the band's efforts. Thematically, The Apples keep their songs at a sub-G-rating level, which has the potential to grate on a listener with tastes that extend beyond Raffi. Take the deep thoughts of ""Something"", for instance (""Something/ I want something""), or the hang-out-with-the-uncool-kids message of ""That's Something I Do"", which could easily serve as a companion piece to Avril Lavigne's ""Sk8tr Boi"". Musically, hyperactive songs like ""Please"" and ""Mystery"" blur into each other before too long, while influences-on-their-sleeve tracks like ""She's Telling Lies"" (which doesn't so much rip off one single Beach Boys song as it does the entire Beach Boys catalog) come off as too derivative. On an album that feels about six minutes long (it's actually just under 29), a couple highlights aren't enough to make it a keeper. But you can't necessarily count the band's new younger focus as a flaw; Velocity of Sound showcases a tight, concentrated power-pop sound that the band seemed to have lost on their last couple outings. While it might not endure for any listener that's completed the warzone that is puberty, it'd still be a pretty solid indie-cred stocking-stuffer for the training-wheels set come Christmas time.

HAIRCUT, collector-geek
CHAIN-WALLET, collector-geek
GOD, contender
DARNIELLE, deity [Setting: An abstract plane, duh. A skyline of CD cases. A tumbleweed sets itself on fire and rolls across the stage, where HAIRCUT and CHAIN-WALLET stroll and converse.] Haircut: Oh despair. How are we to describe three rarities anthologies by John Darnielle's Mountain Goats? What is left to be said about what Darnielle concocts with a paucity of ingredients: haphazardly recorded acoustic guitar, spoken-then-hyperharmonizing vocals, and of course, his tremulous soul, which he threatens to overexpose? We may as well have been asked to rhapsodize about a grilled cheese sandwich-- that treat similar to the Mountain Goats in that it is so much better than it should be, the consumption of which feels guiltless and light, despite its ominous cheesiness. But these CDs contain 185 minutes' worth of 81 songs. That's a geyser of simple sandwiches. Chain-Wallet: I too am inclined to despair. I owned these songs in their vinyl, cassette, and compilation CD formats, makeshift covers and all. I even bought a freestanding CD burner with an analog input jack to make my own rarities discs. My check to Sing Eunuchs, signed by Simon Joyner himself, is still taped to my ukulele. I even bought the original release of Protein Source of the Future... Now! and Bitter Melon Farm when Ajax originally released them in 1999. These songs have been with me too long. I feel as if I've been asked to discuss my own foot. Haircut: Dude, there's no way you had ""Going to Kirby Sigston"" because Hey Dan K never came out. What are you going to do with that archive of rarities now that these capsules exist? Chain-Wallet: That's why God made eBay. [Enter GOD.] God: Affiliate me not with the genesis of eBay. I resent the construction ""that's why God made ________"" when people just go on to cite something like flip-flops, Teddy Grahams, or condoms. My designs are much more complicated and counterintuitive-- grasshoppers, pineapples, tuberculosis. Sorry, I'm ranting. [Exit GOD.] Haircut: Perhaps the only strategy for comprehending these sacred texts would be for us to recount all that Darnielle has given us, even if we're made to feel like mere information-dispensers, or ATMs, in doing so. Chain-Wallet: Firstly, these screeds ain't chronological, yet each disc evokes its own Mountain Goats ""period."" With Protein Source of the Future... Now!, we've been offered mostly the warm, mellow, imagistic Darnielle. The songs amble through the speakers' doom-sap and analyze love's overpromises. The narrators are viziers of tiny, silly empires, and Darnielle knows it-- his liner notes indicate that they project ""near-apocalyptic weight to their petty grievances."" That's no slight; in fact, the best songs here function like slice-of-vexed-life short stories without resolutions. Haircut: Standouts include, but are not limited to, the annihilation-obsessed ""Two Thousand Seasons"", during which Darnielle is accompanied only by some kind of breezily buzzing whirligig, and ""Billy the Kid's Dream of the Magic Shoes"", a perfect example of Darnielle's singular penchant for clashing archetypes (here the outlaw-awaiting-death tradition meets a child's escapist fantasy). As the shortest of these three discs, and since it compiles several longer short projects (four-, five-, and eight-song releases), Protein plays like a mid-career full-length rather than a lost-back-catalog goulash. Chain-Wallet: Which brings us to the considerably less twilit, and less ingratiating, Bitter Melon Farm. Darnielle's notes admit that its songs are ""strays"" and that the bitterness in the title explicitly refers to how they might be swallowed. For some nebulous reason, this disc has an estate-sale grab-bag feel-- sure, you get a lot for your money, but a lot of what? Punctured hosepipes, plastic Christmas trees, and stained sweatpants? The limitations of the Goats's minimal formula are apparent here; even on the tracks that feature Darnielle's trusty boombox, the gears suggest a robo-cow chewing its robo-cud rather than an interesting no-fi texture. Haircut: Still, the listener is treated to ""Going to Cleveland"", in which the singer is tortured by his partner's big eyes, despite how dedicated he is to his arrival in that brown city of eternal afternoons. ""No, I Can't"" is included twice, and this song is representative of the Goats's knack for using material thangs as objective correlatives for emotions and temporal connections. On these songs, a gift of, say, a filing cabinet changes the giftee's life convincingly, articulating the way sheer ""stuff"" can grip us. And two stellar covers emerge: though The Commodores and Ace of Base may seem more flippant than Darnielle's standard reappraisal-fare (Chet Baker, Minutemen, Ella Fitzgerald, Robert Johnson, Steely Dan), ""Sail On"" and ""The Sign"" are solid numbers on a disc that occasionally feels vestigial. Some wool-gathering is afoot. Chain-Wallet: The muzzy attenuation of Bitter Melon Farm as a whole are nullified by the glory that is Ghana, truly the proverbial ""one you've been waiting for"". If you are among those hand-to-mouth loser-imps who only own one-third of 69 Love Songs, then Ghana is the ultimate Darnielle fraction for your fundamentally incomplete existence. The New Testament lords over this disc with fetching benevolence. As Darnielle works the underrated policies of Jesus and Paul into his purposefully un-epic tales of life-maintenance, the trademark Goats sententiousness peaks. With ""Golden Boy"", an ode to a brand of peanuts (from Object Lessons, an EP on which Franklin Bruno and the Vehicle Flips also acquit themselves marvelously), Darnielle blends his frisky materialism and spiritualism, all the while blending his claustrophobic sobriety with his absurdist wit. Haircut: My emotions are pretty much pickled, but ""The Last Day of Jimi Hendrix's Life"" sends me out to my balcony in Spanish Harlem, crying a slough of tears onto the chickens roaming the alley. The rousing history lesson ""The Anglo-Saxons"" is a gem, despite its admitted transgressions against facts. And ""Anti-Music Song"" reigns as it trashes Morrissey (whom Darnielle calls ""Maureecey"", and with whom he has since reconciled), the remaining Beach Boy, and, I'm guessing, the Counting Crows's Adam Duritz when he sings of a ""bad imitation of Van Morrison."" Chain-Wallet: The four songs fleshed out by Alaistar Galbraith are stunning. We can only hope that these violins are harbingers of the new Goats album that is days away from release, the album Darnielle insisted he'd never make, with a band (percussion-- gasp!) in a studio. Ghana is a damn relief pitcher: the capering guitars ideally suit the lyrics about introducing this manufactured world to the next, lyrics about ""heading straight to hell/ In a Lincoln Continental."" Probably one of the best and richest acoustic-only albums I own, and I own everything. All I do is own, actually. Haircut: Whew, we got worked up there. Oh well, back to our meaningless toil.

The Creek Drank the Cradle,Iron & Wine,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9845e6ef9596932299e/1:1/w_160/1c327f78.jpg,2002-10-01 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4126-the-creek-drank-the-cradle/,Sub Pop,"I sometimes wonder if musicians like Samuel Beam (aka Iron & Wine), envy contemporary ""artists"" such as Britney Spears or Linkin Park-- and not for reasons of fame or money. Spears and Linkin Park, after all, make decidedly contemporary music that, while tangentially owing debt to earlier music periods, puts little pressure on them to legitimize their backgrounds. Spears was once a teen who liked Madonna; Linkin Park were once teens who liked angst. That's about all anyone asks of them. Not so for Sam ""Jim"" Beam. He makes bare-bones music that constantly nods to musical periods long since passed, perhaps the earliest being the 1920s of Blind Lemon Jefferson. In short, Beam makes roots music with southern themes, though to end there would do him a disservice. But now knowing this, you may be wondering: What are his qualifications? Is this guy authentic? Where you come from, of course, can automatically grant you authenticity. Perhaps the best current example of this is Detroit; if The White Stripes and Eminem grew up in the most miserable city in the States, they must be for real! Beam, however, hails from the Miami area, which is not exactly backwoods Mississippi. Moreover, he teaches cinematography at a local college (an academic!) and was recently signed to Sub Pop, of all labels. Of course, issues of authenticity plagued Bob Dylan at first. Plus, isn't Neil Young a Canadian? In other words, if you exhibit enough talent, then the critics will look past whatever your background may be, and time-- the greatest critic of all-- will erase any petty misgivings. While Beam has a long way to go before joining these visionaries, The Creek Drank the Cradle is a good enough start to make you forget anything you ever knew about the man. The music speaks for itself, and for Beam's talent. The gentle acoustic plucking that ushers in the opener, ""Lion's Mane"", may not grab your attention, but Beam's delicate, hushed vocals sure will. His lyrics, meanwhile, tread familiar territory without sounding too familiar. He even tackles love through metaphor without seeming like a high school poet: ""Love is a tired symphony you hum when you're awake/ Love is a crying baby mama warned you not to shake."" As with the rest of the album, slide guitar and banjo appear throughout the first track. The folksy sound sometimes recalls Nick Drake-- that is, if the British troubadour were from the bayou instead. In the lolling ""Bird Stealing Bread"", Beam's voice then takes on a Drake-ian resemblance, as he sings, ""Did his hand in your hair feel a lot like a thing you believed in?/ Or a bit like a bird stealing bread out from under your nose?"" By the time ""Faded from the Winter"" arrives, the album has its hooks in you. Beam's overdubbed harmonies, delivered in a repetitive cadence, are spooky without being forbidding, bringing Low's early work to mind, if only in pace and tone. On songs like this one, Beam feels like an artist working in different hues of the same color-- blue, perhaps, or brown. But the changes keep coming, subtle though they are. ""The Rooster Moans"", with its layered banjos and talk of riding a rusty train to the Devil, could sit firmly in the middle of the O Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack and no one would blink an eye. The southern themes continue on ""Upward Over the Mountain"", in which the narrator kills a snake in a creekbed, but Beam's vocal harmonies are nearer to Simon and Garfunkel than Ralph Stanley. ""Southern Anthem"", meanwhile, brings to mind Crosby, Stills and Nash. But any potential writhing or wincing is soon dissolved by ""Weary Memory"", the album's simplest and perhaps strongest track. Here, Beam's voice is all his, as he stretches out his vocal cords and displays a greater range than he had led the listener to believe he possessed. As the song peaks, all guitars but one drop out for a brief respite. ""Found a photo of when we were married,"" Beam sings, breaking the last word into two. ""Leaning back on a broken willow tree/ That's one memory I choose to carry/ Weary memory I can always see,"" and he takes that ""see"" soaring skyward. The Creek Drank the Cradle is made of small epiphanies such as this. There are few guitar solos, if they can even be called that. Beam rarely gets adventurous with his voice, and the songs, for the most part, are of the same pace, tone, lyrical content. Written and performed to tape by Beam alone, the album could easily be lumped in with other home-recording talents such as John Darnielle of the Mountain Goats. But the music here has such deeps roots in a vast swath of Americana that the bedroom image just wouldn't suit Beam. And please don't be fooled by the label. Sub Pop may not be the foremost purveyors of roots music, but they've proven before-- in the case of former Screaming Trees frontman Mark Lanegan-- that they at least know good old-time country and blues music when they hear it. If indeed The Creek Drank the Cradle is only half of the material Beam submitted to the label, then hopefully there's some more Iron & Wine on the way. It sure beats more mud and honey.","I sometimes wonder if musicians like Samuel Beam (aka Iron & Wine), envy contemporary ""artists"" such as Britney Spears or Linkin ...

The No Music,Themselves,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7639d034d5c69bf37a9/1:1/w_160/be509bd8.jpg,2002-10-01 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7986-the-no-music/,Anticon,"Hip-hop has always adhered to a structural minimalism. Like a Raymond Carver short story or a Carl Andre sculpture, the best hip-hop has utilized the simplest of aesthetics to portray the most complex emotional, political and cultural dynamics. No frills, gimmicks, or masturbatory embellishments; just simple loops, lyrics, and beats that somehow manage to convey the moral ambiguity and logical contradictions that comprise life. You don't need to be versed in Eliot and you don't have to understand Stravinsky. What you do need is the courage to spit the truth, the confidence to flow, and the basic street-level inventiveness to manipulate technology. In other words, you need to keep that shit real. If this was Cambodia in the 1970s, the butchered bodies of Anticon emcees would line the streets. With The No Music, released on Anticon, Themselves has successfully mystified hip-hop to the point of almost complete obscurity. It's a horribly pointless and boring album that will only satisfy those who equate progress with soulless beats and abstract mic theatrics. Only after years of frying their synapses on DMT and regrettable grad-school poetry, could one possibly understand why this is considered by some to be ""revolutionizing"" hip-hop. When this record's beats aren't being shrouded in noise and butchered by effects, they're flimsy and disposable. Jel, who produces the albums, lays down drums that lack any visceral resonance and uses samples which, while often creative, are always utterly predictable. The song ""Poison Pit"" begins with a muffled dialogue and an elevating buzzing sound before launching into a dull beat in which a barely audible Dose One ""raps"" in a whiny voice: ""Where is the safe happy everlasting page-long candy coat?"" Another voice responds: ""Over there, draped over your black birthday black and exposed throat."" While passages such as this one may have a deep and resonating meaning to Anticon fans, to the rest of us, it sounds like pretentious nonsense that would play out a lot better on paper than on the tape. Perhaps Dose One would benefit from being reminded that hip-hop is derived from the spoken word traditions of the Last Poets and not the modernist obscurity of Ezra Pound or H. Doolittle. Another even more baffling excursion down the rabbit hole of ponderous pretense is the next track, ""Live Trap"". Over a doubled-up, pseudo-jungle beat, Dose One raps faster than anyone could possibly understand. He may be conveying the secrets of the world (although I seriously doubt that), but in his under-enunciated sing-song flow, all power is lost. I don't think anyone's trying to constrict hip-hop from continuing to evolve with the times. But when something is as purposefully obscure as The No Music you have to wonder whether it qualifies as being revolutionary or merely self-indulgent. Although not quite as often as on previous releases, there are some passages on The No Music where Dose One manages to string along some particularly evocative imagery. But for the most part, the beauty is lost in the sonic flatulence of self-important experimentation.","Hip-hop has always adhered to a structural minimalism.

45 RPM: The Singles,The The,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a75eea9e61561daa5583/1:1/w_160/298ae32f.jpg,2002-09-30 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7982-45-rpm-the-singles/,EpicLegacy,"Matt Johnson's always been a hard guy to pin down, taking his ever-shifting lineup and smart-ass bandname over a wide range of oddball ground in a career that's going on 25 years now. The The first crawled up from the periphery of England's post-punk scene, though they ultimately ended up walking territory that had more in common with acts like Oingo Boingo than Gang of Four and Wire. Johnson's first records were more oblique, though, with the debut single ""Controversial Subject"" and full-length Burning Blue Soul espousing a dark, paranoid sound run through with hissing tape collage and murky, impenetrable production. For this compilation, though, Johnson and Epic Records have opted to ignore those early recordings, and instead jumping right into 1982, when The The was already four years old and had moved into a much quirkier, more danceable sound. The production values on most of this stuff are almost painfully dated to the 1980s, with cavernous echo on the snares, thin digital synth sounds, and massed female backing vocals, but the sound is also clear enough to reveal Johnson's inventiveness as an arranger and composer. The zylimba (sounds like a drunk marimba) that opens ""Uncertain Smile"" (originally released in 1982) makes for a very off-balance intro to what turns out to be a fairly down-to-earth jangly rock song, albeit with some cockeyed little saxophone bits laid carefully around the edges of the melody. Johnson's voice is a pretty decent tenor, but there's always a slightly affected edge to his delivery that highlights the themes of isolation, war, religion and human behavior that are his lyrical stock in trade. As the decade wore on, Johnson's arrangements became more ambitious, incorporating orchestration and moving a bit away from the heavy programming that colors his early work. 1986's Infected turned up the lushness a bit, as well as the danceability quotient, though the title track hasn't aged terribly well. Ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr joined The The for a several years in the late 80s and early 90s, and his soulful harmonica played an important part in Johnson's move toward a more organic sound, beginning in 1989 with the Mind Bomb LP. The two Mind Bomb-era songs included here illustrate the extremes of the synthetic and the organic in his work, with ""The Beat(en) Generation"" playing with a rootsier (though no less heavily produced) sound and a fairly basic arrangement. But the other offering, ""Armageddon Days (Are Here Again)"", is unforgivably cheesy, an adjective that I try to apply sparingly, but just can't avoid here. The cartoonish, ""menacing"" chorus vocals, a mob of pitch-shifted Johnsons, Marrs, and a few other co-conspirators, and ridiculous lyrics like, ""If the real Jesus Christ were to stand up today, he'd be gunned down cold by the CIA,"" make for a few good chuckles all these years later. The chorus refrain of ""Islam is rising/ The Christians mobilizing"" might seem chillingly prescient in today's world if the delivery was a little less self-consciously dramatic. Also included on a second disc is a fairly inconsequential compilation of twelve-inch remixes that add little to the overall package-- most are simply longer versions of the songs on the first disc. It would have been much more gratifying to get some sort of selection of rare tracks from the band's three unreleased albums or perhaps their debut single, ""Controversial Subject"". The liner notes do trumpet a volume two to this set slated for next year, though, so it seems as though some of those holes may yet be plugged.","Matt Johnson's always been a hard guy to pin down, taking his ever-shifting lineup and smart-ass bandname over a ...

Hell, even my ill-fated all-Blondie ska band, One Way or Your Mother, came close to inking a deal with Capitol back in the day. Longing for an earlier time, perhaps, or maybe sensing the pop/punk (or punk/pop) revival that draws inevitably near as a counter-response to emo's hyper sincerity, Lookout! Records has taken the initiative and released a remastered and expanded version of the Mr T Experience's 1995 EP ...And the Women Who Love Them. They're a bit early, sure, but that's so they can say they were doing it before it was cool. ""Give us a cheeky cover of Duran Duran's 'Is There Something I Should Know?'!"", the clamoring masses will shout. ""Got it right here,"" Lookout! will duly respond. ""How about a snotty version of Elton John and Kiki Dee's doe-eyed duet 'Don't Go Breaking my Heart'?"" ""Again, got you covered."" If things keep going the way they are, we might even see a resurgence of the word ""alternative"" in pop music parlance (remember when it meant something?)-- in which case, MTX will surely be poised to end all their encores with the anthemic ""Alternative is Here to Stay"". ""Man, were these boys prescient?"" we'll ask. A veritable Oracle of Delphi, this band. Yeah, you might as well jump on the wagon early and pick up a copy of this expanded EP. After all, besides the seven songs that appeared on the original, you'll now get 18 (!) more-- contemporaneous seven-inch singles, demos and outtakes from the sessions, and various comp appearances spanning from 1993-1997-- which, for bargain-bin prices, is more Mr T Experience than you could ever possibly need. Still, taken a song at a time, this stuff's pretty damn fun. It's your basic Ramones/Buzzcocks-descended punk rock, but the lyrics are great if you've ever been dumped (""My new girlfriend is better than you/ She's got bigger breasts and a higher IQ,"" from ""New Girlfriend"") or have found a new love just as pathetic as you are (""You're much more than MST3K or D&D;/ I'm King Dork and I want you to be my queen""). So, alright, maybe you'll never want to listen to this EP straight through, but it's perfect fodder between Smiths and Cure songs on that mixtape you're making for that girl you have a crush on. She'll think it's old Green Day, and you'll appear smart when you tell her about MTX and how they came from the same scene but were first. Plus, their Mr T reference predates Inspecta Collect. You're in, dude, you're so in.","Time was, all you needed was a wacky band name to secure yourself a record deal. Hell, even my ill-fated ...

Do You Know Squarepusher,Squarepusher,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a531ea9e61561daa509a/1:1/w_160/6a71de65.jpg,2002-09-30 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7448-do-you-know-squarepusher/,Warp,"They say that J.S. Bach was obsessed with numerology and the practice of gematria, which says that each letter of the alphabet can be assigned a number. Historians point out that, in his ""Vor deinen Thron"", the first part of melody has 14 notes (the numerological value of Bach's surname), and the entire melody has 41 (the numerological value of ""JS Bach""). There's another Bach piece wherein he assigns specific notes to each letter of his name. I had heard it many times before discovering how it was constructed, and enjoyed it, which makes one thing clear: though this information is an interesting aspect of the piece, it's hardly an essential component of enjoying the music. Often, when artists have constructed a manifesto or methodology for their work, they feel it's necessary for this information to be known to people so that their music can be fully understood. But there's an ongoing debate as to whether or not anyone besides the composer needs to know what's going on at the time of conception, and despite my momentary amusement when I discovered Bach's methodology, I can't say that it's ever really informed my admiration for the piece. Squarepusher mastermind Tom Jenkinson, on the other hand, might not agree with me. And I quote: ""To make a lethal attack on, say a musical standpoint, that standpoint must first be loved, understood and accommodated before it can be assailed, and this problem is exemplified with much youth culture that seeks to destroy its perceived antithetical enemy simply by contradicting it. It is not enough to behead your enemy, they must first be invited in and made to feel welcome in order to be comprehensively destroyed i.e. they must be in some way incorporated."" Do You Know Squarepusher comes with a small text file of Jenkinson's manifesto for his work-- and apparently, for anyone who would criticize his work. What this quote implies is that I, as a critic and fan, am not allowed to diss him until I have loved him first. And just to prove that he knows what he's talking about, he later goes on to say that he's ""learned to see inside every musician's head because, in order to prevent myself from being fully incorporated into any musical ghetto, I have to incorporate every musical ghetto into myself."" Perhaps the real question, then, is ""Do You Know Yourself?"" If not, have no fear, because Squarepusher does. Well, I've got good news for Jenkinson: I have loved Squarepusher! I loved Hard Normal Daddy; I loved Big Loada; and I really loved Music is Rotted One Note. The latter was particularly enjoyable because it allowed fans to glimpse a rare ""human"" side of Jenkinson-- even if it was a cold, dark human. But if his above quote is any indication, the creation of that record also meant that he had loved, hated and somehow destroyed Miles Davis-- the worst I can say about it was that it was Bitches Brew without the solos. None of this is especially important when listening to his new two-disc release (blasphemy!), but if he's going to so much trouble to show me what a cannibalistic paradox he is, I figure I might as well play along. The first disc wisely opens with the album's only worthwhile moment: the title track, which has already become a concert fave for fans. It seems to fall squarely in line with the straightforward, melodic direction introduced with 2000's ""My Red Hot Car"". This isn't to say Squarepusher's going pop, but that this song has more in common with late-period Kraftwerk than modern-day electronica-- it's basically a pop song decked out in electronic trickery, as opposed to clicks-and-cuts with occasional hints of melody. On the other end of the spectrum are ""Kill Robok"" and ""Anstromm-Feck 4"". The former is comprised of progressively random pulse bursts, taking a block of code from the Autechre algorithm. There's a beat in there, but it's held together by tempo only-- the actual bass and snare accents are all over the place. Similarly, the latter song opens with a robo-voiced Jenkinson asking if I think I'm ""fucking hard"" (I thought he already knew!), before launching into ever-so-ordinary car-chase music. ""Mutilation Colony"" begins with some ominously pretty keyboard clusters that sound oddly similar to Jenkinson's old buddy Bach. The first few minutes of this tune are a melancholy change of pace, with shimmering chords extended and stretched until their resonance dries up. After a bit of this, he raids Stockhausen's back catalog by introducing the beloved Academic Electronic Composition. Over the course of the succeeding eight minutes or so, Squarepusher abandons hyperactive IDM for a rather pedestrian noise experiment. And as for his breathy cover of ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"", I'm guessing Joy Division were too tough a dish to love, hate and spit out. The second disc, titled Alive in Japan, documents a July 2001 show. Now, I can see the appeal of going to a Squarepusher show, but you don't get quite the same experience in your living room. The biggest thrill here, beyond hearing stuff from Go Plastic! and Do You Know Squarepusher with acoustic interference, is his periodic interjections of ""let's hear some fucking noise!"" or ""gimme some fucking noise!!"" Were Jenkinson to issue this performance as a standalone release, I imagine Warp would have had no interest in it. In the end, reading ""Tom's Manifesto"" probably isn't going to alter anyone's perception of Do You Know Squarepusher. Just like Bach, Jenkinson's best stuff gets by not on his calculated pre-production or any meta-cognitive powers of enlightenment, but because on some level, it connects with other people. By the same token, this set is disappointing not because I don't understand his methodology, but because the results simply aren't terribly engaging.","They say that J.S.

Tomorrow Never Comes,Xinlisupreme,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aac95e6ef9596932164c/1:1/w_160/089da53a.jpg,2002-09-30 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8820-tomorrow-never-comes/,Fat Cat,"Xinlisupreme are a duo from Japan, but they play some of the wildest surf-guitar instrumentals this side of 1960s USA. ""Kyoro"" kicks off with an incredibly raw drumbeat, pummeling you like countrymen High Rise at their worst. The guitar builds up sizzling feedback, then unleashes a firestorm as a blood-curdling scream tears from your speakers. It almost sounds like heavy metal, but the theatrics that follow pull the ripcord, decelerating into fun, anthemic riffage. The group manages to make low fidelity an almost religious virtue later on ""Under a Clown"", with electric surges careening around the rattling drums and the sudden appearance of an abused piano being pounded. Hailing from Oita, Japan, Xinlisupreme's dreamy synth-pop comes as quite a surprise. Yasumi Okano and Takayuki Shouji conjure up dust from dance clubs of the 80s, evoking dirty, fog-cloaked backrooms. ""All You Need is Love Was Not True"" thumps through eight minutes of flat drum machine beats, the dull thud masking the half-mumbled attempts to sing that float through the mix. The patterns reassure, never boring, just guiding the body out onto the floor. Not so with the wavering synth-static of ""Amaryllis"", but the repetitive motif creates a ritualized aura, enhanced by the duo's strange chanting. The drama continues on ""Fatal Sisters Opened Umbrella"", which drives from a gothic groove straight into the heart of the cathedral itself, with insane blasts like pipe organs soaring upwards. Think you've heard it all? Xinlisupreme make you hear it all at once. This mad twosome from the Far East cuts some of the nastiest noise-rock since the Birthday Party. ""You Died in the Sea"" begins with Einst√ºrzende beat-boxing, like anvils clanging on cold metal. Without warning, the guitars snarl, shredding the song open in a vortex of distortion and drones. The group isn't all hard edges, though; ""Suzu"", in particular, with its hazy mesh of soundwaves, will have you thumbing through your shoegazer glossary for acronyms like 'FSA' and 'MBV'. Likewise, ""I Drew a Picture of Myself"" paints perfect balance between shimmering airiness and barbed aggression, and features some of the grungiest basslines since Gish. Forget titles like 'power electronics' or 'sonic terrorism'-- Xinlisupreme rain down slabs of pure noise from on high. Keep countrymen Merzbow and Masonna in mind, but also think of Unit Records beatmongers Gridlock and Dryft. ""Goodbye for All"" matches the snowy grainscapes of the former with the latter's electronic percussion, resulting in a cyclone of pulsing stabs and shrieking pitchshifts. Like most masters of the extreme, the duo show mercy, thankfully, and the piece relents with an ambient midsection that calms before the storm ensues again. Though the sketch only lasts two minutes, ""Symmetry"" remains particularly unsettling as it builds into a thicket of piercing nettles, reminding more of the phantasmagoric clouds conjured by Ah Cama-Sotz. It should be obvious by now, but I'll say it outright: Xinlisupreme are all these things. It's become a clich√© these days to describe a band from Japan as 'wild' or 'crazy', but the evidence is right up in your face, kicking your teeth in. Don't think about genre-hopping trend-setters-- Okano and Shouji blend these styles together with demented glee. What you get is an hour's worth of helter-skelter sonic invention, lacking any coherent center. This mania is their virtue, making for one of the year's most unpredictable albums, and a damn fine debut. It's also their weakness. Am I being too critical? Imagine the Boredoms ten years back, and where they've come since. Xinlisupreme are only beginning to rock.","Xinlisupreme are a duo from Japan, but they play some of the wildest surf-guitar instrumentals this side of\n\ 1960s ...

As I type this after a grueling day sweating over some godforsaken collection of paperwork, it is obvious that all that hubbub over peace, love and casual sex was but an extended Spring Break for a generation that, while idealistic and pretty, is probably counting their blessings that nobody pulled the plug on their party sooner. I can only imagine what it must have been like to actually believe people could change the world with love. Did those kids see the darkness on the edge of town, or was a just a three- or four-year festival light? Some might argue that the hippies never actually went away, but merely retreated into various Utopian communities on the outskirts of Yucatan bungalow hideaways. The past, however, is littered with the remains of broken dreams and shattered crystals of this forgotten society. Whatever happened to the Maharishi? Where is the mystical Gaian way of life today? Can we eat the brown ones yet?? And just how did Brazil's Spectrum lose their way? Spectrum-- comprised of one-name wonders Fernando, Ramon, Caetano, Serghino and Tiao-- was formed in the late 60s by a group of local Rio de Janeiro kids who had a fondness for the Beatles and imported ideas of the hippie revolution. Most of their instruments belonged to their school (they started the band as teens), or were borrowed or handed down. They practiced at school, and were fairly popular for birthday parties and clubs. Shortly after christening themselves Spectrum, they were invited to contribute the soundtrack to ""Brazil's First Hippie Film"", Gera√ß√£o Bendita. Of course, Brazil's military regime didn't take too kindly to gratuitous hair and bandanas onscreen, so even though the movie was completed in 1971, it was banned for another two years. Spectrum couldn't hold out that long, and despite dreams of bringing the word to thousands of impressionable young Brazilians, they gradually packed it in and went back to their Rio suburb. What we have now is that soundtrack, in all its grainy glory. The thing is, Spectrum had heart and sometimes even a knack for nice group vocal harmonies like their idols, The Beatles. However, like many an aspiring psychedelic outfit, their enthusiasm didn't produce many classic tunes. Most of their music was highly derivative of late 60s legends like Traffic, The Easybeats and, of course, The Fab Four. Nevertheless, there are pleasures to be plundered here, and psych aficionados should dig it. Spectrum's best stuff is often as whimsical as that of their idols', if not quite as accomplished. ""Quiabo's"" features the wavering yelp of Fernando, some nifty harmonies and more fuzz-guitar than you can shake a peacepipe at. ""Concerto Do Pantano"" forgoes vocals entirely to bring you the gospel according to Flange, as it was told to disciples Clumpy Drums and Reverb. Spectrum even get funky on ""15 Years Old"", summoning the spirits of The Pretty Things and Jimi Hendrix. I'm not sure this music is going to awaken as many ghosts today, as Spectrum's legacy seems oddly similar to dozens of spunky psych bands from all over who simply never made it past the local rec center. Good karma says to check out Nuggets first; Spectrum will understand.","The Jesus-freaks and flower children lost, the dream is over. As I type\n\ this after a grueling day sweating ...

So when I cracked open the new Lif and discovered the aforementioned attributes in brazen attendance, it was difficult to fight back the urge to toss it into the trash bin. However, after giving I Phantom a few spins, I must say that Lif has managed to transcend the gimmicks and wankery that generally mar this kind of grand opus, and emerge with his strongest offering yet. Lif's success can largely be attributed to his focus on themes that other, more timid emcees wouldn't even touch; the album tackles the dehumanizing dysfunction of capitalism and its dramatic effect upon a b-boy everyman, including a dissection of commerce's influence upon art, family and spirituality. The phantom of the title is the individual personality/soul that has been drowned in a flood of media-fueled consumerism, empty labor, and abandoned relationships. Explaining his themes in a recent interview with SOHH, Lif commented, ""Our identity is essentially wiped out in many ways. Under the code of professionalism, you do not bring your slang or culture into a place of business... there's a code of conduct which wipes out any flare that we have as individuals."" The plot of I Phantom has four acts: an initial dream state where Lif is killed and resurrected; a second act where Lif awakens and struggles with poverty and social alienation; a third where Lif achieves financial success only to find it emotionally and spiritually bankrupt; and a final, surreal postscript where he and his friends lyrically navigate the apocalypse. As you can imagine, this sure as fuck ain't Nellyville. In fact, the album's thematic and narrative scope has more in common with Jonathan Franzen's The Corrections than it does with a hip-hop album. In the first two songs, Lif cops a gun from Cannibal Ox's Vast Aire and is killed while robbing a store. ""Return of the B-Boy"", the album's third track, finds Lif resurrected as a hip-hop messiah. ""Return of the B-Boy"" is a nearly eight-minute epic that is the most lyrically and musically accomplished track Def Jux has ever released. Beneath a noisy mosaic of turntable scratches, squealing effects and bass-heavy beats, El-P drops Guru rapping, ""Hip-hop, Im'a bring it back, hip-hop..."" Then, as the noise reaches a crescendo, the beat drops and the track transforms into a fast and funky boom bap revival, replete with James Brown grunts and an '89-style fast rap. On ""Mic Check,"" Lif declares, ""How the fuck did you figure you could interfere with a music so potent?"" ""Mortal Kombat"" style, Lif steps up and destroys the Pharisees, Uncle Toms, and Jiggas who've transformed hip-hop from a culturally relevant lifeforce to an aural billboard for excess and self-destruction. In a particularly vivid confrontation with a subpar emcee, Lif raps, ""I step to him slow and look deep in his eye/ Say the prison is within 'cuz he's living a lie."" The song ends suddenly, and a ringing alarm carries over to provide a segue to the next song where Lif awakens to find himself preparing to go to the ""slave quarters"" where he toils for a ""trifling hourly wage of $6.50."" In the spiritually arid atmosphere of ""Live from the Plantation"", Lif is confronted with the working man's irony: ""Life is a gift to be enjoyed every second.../ Yet I find myself looking at the clock, hoping for the day to fly by."" Once again, the song shifts in the middle and we're treated to a beatbox breakdown that sounds like Doug E Fresh remixed by Autechre. The juxtaposition between the b-boy heroism of ""Return of the B-Boy"" and the everyday struggle of ""Live From the Plantation"" reveals that the tensions provided by the crippling minutiae of real life are just as dramatic and compelling as any superhero theatrics. After failing at work on ""Live from the Plantation"", and being socially spurned due to his economic condition in ""Status"", Lif turns his eyes to the cash prize in ""Success"" and becomes a professional slave who's ""forced to give [his] life away while [he's] earning a living."" Putting forth the professional's mantra, Lif raps, ""Smile, don't be too proud, too wild/ You can suffer, but just don't be too loud."" Fellow Def Jukie Aesop Rock guests on the track, returning to many of the same themes he dealt with on last year's Labor Days. In a stinging chorus, Aesop raps, ""Daddy had a name tag that said 'busy working'/ Mommy had a milk carton that said 'missing person'/ John had a new baseball glove, but nobody to learn with/ The oil left the water and the water kept searching."" Over the course of the next two songs, our narrator sees his family dissolve due to his workaholism. After divorcing his first wife, the narrator remarries and focuses on having the perfect (read: fictional) family and ignores his first, unsuccessful family. The subsequent pressure to succeed causes his daughter from the second marriage to commit suicide. On ""The Now"", Lif flips the script and raps from the perspective of the abandoned child from the first marriage. It's a creative and revelatory point of view that showcases Lif's incredible narrative skills. Unfortunately, Lif abandons the concrete details of his narrative on ""Iron Helix"" and answers the question as to ""how we got here, meaning how did we [get to] this point in human existence where these types of social ills are common."" For the next song, ""Earthcrusher"", Lif provides ""a visual for the nuclear holocaust."" Um... Druids, anyone? Still, Lif's point has been made, and the last tracks' interesting, yet misguided forays into ponderous sci-fi don't ruin Lif's masterpiece. On his previous EPs, Emergency Rations and Enter the Collosus, Lif showed a lot of potential. I Phantom is the big payoff, the album that we knew Lif had in him. While there are those who accuse Lif of being unpatriotic and overly didactic, a searing social critique in this time of unchecked nationalism and media disinformation is not only refreshing, but absolutely necessary. Whether out of fear, complacency or self-absorption, there have been far too few voices of dissent to emerge from the world of independent music. That Lif is willing to be the odd man out-- especially in a time when publicly questioning the actions of our administration is considered rote, despite the fact that we need it now more than ever-- is exemplary. 'Nuff respect due.","For someone whose musical sensibilities were largely shaped by the minimalism of hip-hop, it's hard for me to even ...

Trust,Low,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd7eeb335119a49eceb8/1:1/w_160/fe49c404.jpg,2002-09-29 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4891-trust/,Kranky,"After eight years of refining and perfecting the essence of that plodding, murky genre known as ""slowcore"", Low have worked up quite a backstory. With tools provided by Galaxie 500, Red House Painters, and Spacemen 3, their first two albums, 1994's I Could Live in Hope and 1995's Long Division, drew the blueprint for slowcore as we know it today. They are the pioneers of a genre of limited variables-- where innovating artists who drift too far to the left become ""drone"" or ""psychedelic"", and those who drift to the right find themselves labeled ""dream-pop"" or ""shoegazer""-- which bloomed in the mid-to-late 90s, but now seems somewhat short on ideas. The band, of course, hasn't let this hold them back. Critics have been waiting to pounce since 1997, after their first three undeniably solid, yet painfully uniform, albums had sunk in. Then, Low switched from the Vernon Yard label to Chicago-based experimental imprint Kranky and released the unexpected Songs for a Dead Pilot EP, which saw them toying with a whole new arsenal of unpredicted elements, and greatly broadening their field of vision. But after this stark contrast to their previous releases, some fans who had been hoping Low would to continue to branch out were mildly disappointed by Secret Name, which failed to deviate much from paths the band had already explored. And some feared this would, in fact, be the end of the road for the good-natured trio from Minnesota's northeast. Yet, despite this, their songcraft remained intact-- but this in itself was also a problem: though their songwriting had never been compromised, it had never really developed much, either. Hence, their albums up to this point-- save the Songs for a Dead Pilot EP-- were virtually interchangeable, none any better or worse than the others. And then came 2001's Things We Lost in the Fire. Low, it seemed, had suddenly realized that their songwriting could not sustain with reverb alone, and hired producer Steve Albini and a group of contributors with more explorative backgrounds, resulting in their freshest-sounding album to date. One would expect this to carry over to their follow-up, the newly released Trust. In fact, it doesn't. Only now do Low seem to be struggling with the constraints of their genre. The album preserves their defining qualities: superb lyricism and powerful tension. But it's missing two key elements of Low's last outing. That is, the engaging songs and captivating production. The ever-cautious pace and utter minimalism of slowcore can make for a grindingly protracted listening experience when the songs aren't up to snuff. And on Trust, for the first time in Low's long career, they aren't. The band's delivery is dispassionate and inert, and the deep mood swings that have typified some of their best outings-- the spiritual highs and dramatic depths-- are entirely absent. To the band's credit, it's evident that they were at least making an effort: ""I Am The Lamb"", for example, attempts to draw electricity from the clunky, hollow footsteps of clattering percussion, while vocalist Alan Sparhawk provides a dirgeful minor-key melody atop the m√©lange, accompanied by a funerary chorus. Unfortunately, neither his melody, nor the building force in the percussion, ever reaches the palpable intensity toward which it was clearly aiming, leaving the song to drag lifelessly towards its obvious conclusion for an exhausting seven minutes. Later, ""John Prine"" meets a similar fate, crawling along with a languid bass drum pounding ceaselessly with little-to-no variation over roughly the same timespan. So let's talk now about what Trust actually has going for it: Low makes a welcome foray into the world of tempo-- and with some success, even-- on ""Canada"", which is about as close as Low will likely ever come to a call-and-response anthem. The tune, a wistfully poppy, fuzzed-out rock number, features Sparhawk on lead with Mimi Parker on echo, for a delightful sort of ""psychedelic-Breeders"" effect. ""Snowstorm"" tones the fuzz down a notch, but keeps the cheery attitude for a pretty pleasurable pop track. At other points, such as on the percussionless folk-lullaby ""Tonight"" and the gorgeous, gospel-inflected ""Point of Disgust"", Low beautifully revisit more of their well-worn old ground, again neither improving nor altering the formula-- just doing it well, as always. But despite Trust's striking moments, the album as a whole fails to engage. Whatever intensity might be inherent in these songs is, for the most part, left untapped by Blake's production, and the resulting soundscapes lumber along with a stoic demeanor that leaves the listener unmoved. You won't mind owning this album-- you probably won't even mind listening to it-- but if you want more Low in your collection, your money would be better spent on one of their others.","After eight years of refining and perfecting the essence of that plodding, murky genre known as ""slowcore"",\n\ Low have ...

Cut Yourself a Switch,Catherine Irwin,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b98aeb335119a49ec7de/1:1/w_160/d7adcf82.gif,2002-09-26 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4132-cut-yourself-a-switch/,Thrill Jockey,"Man, it would really fucking suck to be made of peanut butter. Not just because of the simple annoyances that sort of thing would tend to cause (everybody always trying to eat you, sticking to the roof of your own mouth, etc), but because people would constantly be attempting to combine you with other things. No one digs peanut butter in and of itself, only when it's mixed with other foodstuffs-- jelly, chocolate, you name it. You would have recurring nightmares involving Elvis, a deep fryer, and a bunch of bananas. Of course, this would wreak havoc on your self-esteem: ""Am I not good enough on my own? Why won't you love me for me?"" you would moan nightly, weeping into your sticky, sticky pillow and cursing the day George Washington fucking Carver was born. Catherine Irwin, I'd imagine, is in a somewhat similar situation. Her work with Janet Bean in Freakwater earned the band comparisons with every great vocal duo in country history, from Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris on, and Freakwater's staunch refusal to acknowledge the last 30 years of that history ingratiated them with roots purists and indie kids alike. And Freakwater did have some serious, J Lo-Affleck style alchemy going on; Irwin's morose static-crackle sobs and Bean's sweeter, brassier voice were a one-in-a-billion combination. Adulation, of course, is also limitation; what could either one do for an encore? After you've nailed (crucified, even) harmony, can you ever go back to melody? Irwin sure can. Considering the hundreds of ways a solo album can go wrong (orchestral overcompensation, rote repetition of previous band, self-conscious departure from previous band, or [ack] superstar duets and guest shots), it's shocking how right Cut Yourself a Switch sounds. While the style is no different from what Freakwater has always done, the sound shies away from the full-band approach the band had been pursuing over their last few albums. No dobros, just an occasional fiddle or accordion-- besides Irwin and her guitar, the only other constant presence here is longtime Freakwater player David Wayne Gay, whose barely-there bass adds a fullness to the sound without ever stepping on Irwin's voice. As much as Freakwater were purists, Cut Yourself a Switch represents a further distillation of what was already concentrated stuff. Which should, by all reasoning, be too much. Irwin's pit-of-sorrow vocals were maudlin almost to the point of parody in Freakwater, balanced out by Bean's more upbeat tone. Here, though, Irwin takes the opportunity to spread out. ""Hex"" and ""Swan Dive"" showcase opposite ends of Irwin's range, from almost impossibly fragile and paper-thin on the former, to sweeping and strident on the latter. She can do seductive better than ever, too; challenge me to keep my pants on during ""Power of My Love"". C'mon, you could probably win some money off of me. As per usual, Cut Yourself a Switch is about half originals and half covers. Irwin's songs stick closely to the lyrical tradition of love, death, misfortune, and Jesus, Jesus, Jesus while at the same time constantly rearranging these clich√©s. ""Dirty Little Snowman"" is a weird combination of childhood memory and debased creation myth, all wrapped up in a beautiful accordion line; ""My Old Unlucky Home Far Away"" is a more upbeat tune about vampires (among other things); and in ""Needle in a Haystack"", Irwin urges us between trusty voice cracks to ""burn the damn thing down/ And you'll find your precious needle laying right there on the ground."" While all of her songs adhere to her usual standards, the covers are uniformly fascinating. The aforementioned ""Power of My Love"", a smoldering, weirdly aggressive Elvis tune, gets a feminist makeover from Irwin and her banjo, while she gives the Carter Family's love-from-beyond-the-grave song ""Will You Miss Me"" a more standard but still impassioned treatment. Irwin's rendition of ""Don't We All Have the Right to Be Wrong"" by Roger Miller (country Roger Miller, not Mission of Burma Roger Miller) grows slightly more damaged and desperate with every chorus. For Shockabilly's ""The Only Hell My Momma Ever Raised"", Irwin actually brings out a full band, and they weave blissfully through the song like a drunken getaway car in slow traffic. The closer, though, frosts the cake. Irwin puts a perfectly scattershot slide-guitar sheen on the doo-wop standard ""You Belong to Me"", her breathy vocals transforming the original while making it sound agelessly older at the same time. Which is, of course, Irwin's great talent. Each song is a trip into an invented past, but after each one ends you come back up with something raw, real, and pure that you can't quite shake off. Like, if you will, dipping your fingers into a jar of peanut butter. I'd ask you to forgive my metaphors, but after Cut Yourself a Switch, I trust the Good Lord will instead.","Man, it would really fucking suck to be made of peanut butter.

"Trinity: Past, Present and Future",Slum Village,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a46113d1975652138ccd/1:1/w_160/28c5e5f3.jpg,2002-09-26 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7251-trinity-past-present-and-future/,Capitol,"Most know the score on Slum Village: they have great production, but their mic skills need to show some serious improving. On their previous effort, Fantastic Vol 2, producer Jay Dee laid down some nice tracks, but his flows, along with those of fellow SV emcees T3 and Baatin, lacked any vitality, focus or energy. Apparently, Jay Dilla, who has also provided production work for A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul, heard the criticism and stepped away from the group, ostensibly citing that he was tired of touring. For Trinity, Slum Village have enlisted emcee Elzhi to assume Jay's mic duties while largely relying upon T3 to take over the boards. For most, the question wasn't ""will they succeed?"" but ""how can they possibly?"" Their first single, ""Tainted"", finds Slum Village returning to familiar territory. With a chill vibe and harmonious R&B; crooning, it's more than a little reminiscent of Fantastic's ""Players"". The lyrics are clich√©d but forgivable, and although the emcees' flows are nothing memorable, they aren't obtrusive, either. Off the relative strength of that single, one might suppose that Slum Village has managed to survive the departure of their most talented member. Unfortunately, ""Tainted"" is one of the few bright spots on a very mediocre album. After a few tracks, it becomes increasingly more difficult to ignore the pathetic lyrics and boring flows-- even the production seems redundant, bland, and horribly imitative and regressive. In the song ""Disco"", the Slum Village emcees manage to fill three minutes with complete lyrical nonsense: ""Thug ass niggas want to disco,"" declares the chorus. Um, no. To paraphrase Chuck D, hip-hop was created 'cuz we never dug disco. ""Unisex"" sounds like a throw-away Neptunes beat with a weak freestyle pushed way down in the mix. Like many songs on this overstuffed 22-song clunker, it has no business seeing the light of day. Fortunately, Jay Dilla does return for three tracks. While those, along with the instrumental closer ""Fallin' in Love"", do showcase some really smooth production, it's a case of too little, too late. By this point, the album has choked on its own sour cocktail of muddled flows, mediocre beats and cheap imitations. While Trinity may not be the worst album of the year, it is one that will be forgotten very, very quickly.","Most know the score on Slum Village: they have great production, but their\n\ mic skills need to show some ...

Lucid Dreaming,Concentrik,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a63dc0084474cd0c08f7/1:1/w_160/2a17b443.gif,2002-09-25 06:01:40,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1569-lucid-dreaming/,Emperor Jones,"Tim Green started off the part of his life relevant to this review playing guitar for the now-legendary Dischord outfit Nation of Ulysses. After having his fill of D.C. hardcore, Green moved his skinny ass to San Francisco, met a couple of dyed-in-the-wool metalheads (one with actual long hair), and formed the Champs, an instrumental metal trio (later-modified to the more popular naughty name, The Fucking Champs). It was these Fucking Champs who would be heralded for the purest metal fervor. Little did the heralders know, but behind guitar number two stood a total wuss. For alas, Green, fucking champion of metal, masqueraded as Concentrick, a fucking champion of ""lucid dreaming"". I know what you're thinking: ""Pussy."" Had these ""lucid dreams"" been revolting nightmares, Green might still be in business. But listening to Concentrick's third album, one realizes that they surely are not. They are sweet dreams-- the product not of a metal rampage, but of a soothing lullaby. Addressing the oft-cited metal inquiry, ""Do they kick ass?""-- well, not in the conventional sense, no. Perhaps if you could construe meditation as ""kicking ass"" (as in ""man, that prayer circle kicked ass"") then Lucid Dreaming would kick ass. But better adjectives exist for this, Green's ambient electronic alter-ego. Like these adjectives, for example: droning, palliative, supple, futuristic, sedate, assuaging, mellifluous, elysian, balmy, resplendent. All in a Buck Rodgers sort of way. Strings and a Mellotron get the album kicking on ""Lucid Moments"". Imagine if Buck Rodgers had his own romantic chamber orchestra, and you have the idea exactly. ""Behind the Trees"" takes Buck out of his cozy space cabin and finds him wandering a spooky, uncharted space planet, replete with big orange boulders, space trees, and an atmosphere of pure cyanide gas. Buck would feel anxious, yes? So will you. ""Secret in the Shallows and the Sky"" plays like the steel drum band at a tropical island space-resort for Buck and his friends (like the totally hot Wilma Deering, aka the Ricker's dad's girlfriend on ""Silver Spoons"", aka Erin Gray). They take Buck to new, soothing adventures in his mind, as waves of liquid nitrogen splash up against his rocket-fueled titanium catamaran. ""Somnambulant"" sounds like you might reckon if your vocabulary is big enough. ""Soft Place"" keeps with the accurate descriptive naming trend, providing a downy-soft place for your ears. This soft place might be particularly welcome for burnt-out Champs fans. It drones like a coma. Concentrick evokes strange comparisons, but this does not alter the fact that Green's effort here is pretty damn super. A delightful mix of sleepy ambient elements with a futuristic touch. Relax to it, fall asleep to it, or fantasize about Wilma Deering to it.

EPH Reissue,Fridge,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be2beb335119a49ed009/1:1/w_160/0b74f059.gif,2002-09-25 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3199-eph-reissue/,Go!BeatGo!Beat,"I've become convinced that the best way of marketing an album is to make it as scarce as humanly possible. Were I the head of a record label (star light, star bright!), I'd connive all manner of misfortune to justify ultra-low press runs. ""The album was found to contain dangerously high frequencies and/or seizure-inducing strobe rhythms; we had to recall it."" ""John Ashcroft has seized the majority of our inventory and shipped it to Guantanamo Bay under suspicions of anti-Americanism."" Or maybe tell the band the album is ""too experimental"", drop them from my label, leak the music to the Internet, and re-sign them under a different imprint... oh, wait, that one's already been done. Steve Case, you magnificent evil bastard! Whichever story I choose, I'd cast it out there, wait a couple years while the hype train builds to immense speed, then BAM!, reissue the album and watch the bank account swell. I'm not accusing the assumedly fine lads at Temporary Residence Ltd of such unsavory practices, nor am I suspicious of London post-rock-ish trio Fridge. But hey, the story fits the mold, as the press kit makes clear: EPH was released in 1999 on British label Go!Beat, but only using the highly unpopular, hard-to-find, and absurdly expensive rollout plan. Now it's being reissued for all us neglected statesiders and poor people, with the added attraction of a bonus disc featuring EPs of that same pre-millennial era, plus a couple new remixes. This mini-Fridge has been converted into a Kegerator! Haw haw, thanks folks, I'll be here all week! Unfortunately, the music world might've passed EPH by while it languished in high-priced import bin obscurity. Back in 1999, when Tortoise's TNT was a mere one year old, this disc probably sounded like some fresh dope shiznit, what with its atmospheric instrumental rock sound laced with chopped-up reel-to-reel drums and a veritable genus of keyboard species. Much of the album has that movie score quality that many of the band's peers were also flogging at the time, Krautishly named tracks like ""Ark"" and ""Aphelion"" riding hypnotic grooves for upwards of eight minutes at a time. It's too bad it kinda sounds dated these days, since Fridge had the goods to be considered one of the top performers of the genre. The band excels at crafting a happy medium between organics and electronics (guitarist Kieran Hebden is aka Four Tet), with compositions like ""Transience"" and the horn-stuffed ""Bad Ischi"" maintaining a fluid, improvised vibe rather than the overly calculated constructions of other post-rock acts. EPH isn't quite past its expiration date (""Meum"" has a delicate musicbox sound that would fit right in with recent Bj√∂rk fare), but it's got just a small, distracting whiff of sourness in a genre has since proven distinctly limited. Holding up better is the bonus second disc, compiling the ""Kinoshita Terasaka"" single, the Of EP, and remixes of EPH tracks by Matthew Herbert and P Pulsinger. The single might be the highlight of the set, coupling a short piece propelled by a tentatively booty-shaking bassline with a long, trancy groove set that rewards the patient of heart... before kicking sand in the eyes of said patient of heart with a completely gratuitous outro drum solo. The Of EP features four dull versions of the EPH track of the same name, but stay tuned for the remixes, which do Fridge the favor of updating their songs to the conventions of the modern day. Herbert's take on ""Ark"" radically reconstructs the Very Serious original as thinking man's dancefloor anthem, adding minor-key piano chords and a chopped-up diva vocal. P Pulsinger, meanwhile, distorto-amplifies the bassline of ""Bad Ischi"" into a window-rattling irregular skip-hop that Scott Herren would be proud of. Too bad these two reworkings emphasize how dated the actual reissued album sounds today, when cutting edge electronica seems to have rediscovered its sense of humor while overcoming its love/hate relationship with the club scene. But don't worry your pretty little head about the boys of Fridge, as they've already moved on to more electronic and experimental pastures with last year's Happiness. So while EPH doesn't quite cause the ripples it might've caused back in '99, the record still nobly stands as pivot of Fridge's musical development. Too bad it may have been kept in the cryogenic containment unit just a smidge too long.",,6.8,
III,Moistboyz,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a191c0084474cd0bfe29/1:1/w_160/35c34b04.jpg,2002-09-25 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5372-iii/,Ipecac,"People!

I know this Ween side project is supposed to be a spoof, but the best spoofs transcend their targets. If you're going to dip down into genre-muck, you should be careful not to get any on you. Moistboyz are starting to sound the opposite of inspired, as idea-less as the sociopathic thrash pose they're aiming to lampoon. And this is coming from a devoted show-taping Weenie, who signed on with their debut and kept smiling along as they worshipped cosmic stallions and delivered doomed monologues from the perspective of children with spinal meningitis. I keep a pocket-sized carbon-dating kit handy to annoy Christians and to test the vintagicity of thrift-store denim jackets. When I played this album into it, the thing thought 2002's III was at least ten years old, with certain moments going farther back into the wanky eras of Judas Priest and W.A.S.P. No fooling, the Moistboyz concept (profane, insanely distorted chunks of standard brag-and-threat metal vitriol) ages aggressively, the same way sports highlights from a noon game look like they were filmed during the Korean War when they're replayed at midnight, isolated as they are from their only momentary significance/payoff. Fun is to be had on this disc, though: every echoed handclap is guffaw-inducing. The hellish ""Yeah!"" that opens ""The Spike"" (with its characteristic chorus, ""The spike! The spike!"") legitimately induces furniture-burning. ""The Tweaker"" is a keeper, with its authentically chaotic guitar wail and bullying tempo. The song is hilarious, if manifestly impolitic, as it chronicles people vomiting up their testicles, Satan assisting with drug acquisition, brittle penises falling off on contact, and tips to avoid being a ""hippie faggot"". The centerpiece is ""I'm Gonna Kick Your Ass"", as it flagrantly cops the second half of the riff from ""Iron Man"" and boasts lyrics such as ""Talkin' that shit-- you're mine!"" and my favorite: ""Asshole/ The shit is going down right now/ Put down the kid and run/ Daddy's gonna die/ Wave bye-bye."" But puerile thunder can only rumble so long, and ultimately, this project suggests the unfunniness of Tenacious D's valleys, or a backwards-moving Ween, as if they're over-revisiting their early work. Moistboyz just performed a show they billed as ""Retardapalooza"", and that's a clue as to just how ""Beavis & Butthead""/Spencer Gifts this album can be. The human rhythm section sounds unpromisingly like drum machine programming (a la mid-90s Al Jourgensen), which makes the rock seem strangely contained, like havoc trapped in a Skinner box. Titles such as ""Great American Zero"" and ""I Am the Reaper"" should be sufficient to communicate how tired things get. The lyrics intermittently scan as clunkily as the predictable doggerel people send in to newspapers' obituary sections. If you still go around ranking your top ten farts or playing mailbox baseball, or if you want cartoon-morbid songs about eating Mickey Moist's leavings, purchase away. Else, leave it for someone's ten-year-old brother.","People!

You'll see their vacuous smiles, but their sad eyes will betray how hollow and unhappy they really are. ""Hey,"" you'll think, ""I'm not gonna be like these soulless robots; I'm through with stolen credit cards and oxygen bars-- I'm gonna make something outta my life!"" Seriously, it'll be way touching; life-affirming, even. And the song that'll be backing this futuristic moment of clarity will be the sterling space-gospel of Polara's ""Jetpack Blues"". Spacy but heartfelt vocal effects, choir-like chorus, and reverb-drenched guitar atmospherics that would make The Edge sweat(ier) form a song more easily described with ridiculous Gernsback-infused vignettes than actual descriptors.

The remainder of Polara's latest seems content to rest on its laurels, offering solid but slightly generic rock. The six-stringers bite off giant hunks of Achtung Baby with the occasional blues riff worming its way into the rush, while the electronics and effects are nothing but ray-guns, hovercrafts, and chrome. If it were all that rosy, of course, this would be a stellar album, but after about five tracks of the same formulaic arrangements (excepting ""Jetpack Blues"", which is unique among the rest) it becomes clear that the future might not be quite as bright as it seems. Individually, these songs are solid, uptempo kernels of sci-fi sounds, but the non-stop effects-peddling that's genuinely refreshing for one track starts to suck the soul out of the album before long. The result is that the songs begin to blend together into what might as well be a single (albeit damn fine) forty-minute epic. Eventually, a numbing stillness sets in and the album passes overhead. That numbness remains until the last actual song on the album, ""The Story So Far"", a stripped-down number notable primarily for breaking the pace. Polara excels at sweeping, large-scale rock, and this track, if nothing else, makes it clear that they should stick to that. In particular, ""The Story So Far"" falls prey to the one other real flaw of Jetpack Blues, in that frontman Ed Ackerson's vocals are as often achingly cheesy as they are sincere. It's not much trouble on the grand scale of most of these tracks, but it does gets cloying on a more intimate cut like this one. This is all nitpicking, though. While a lot of Jetpack Blues might be unremarkable, it's still insanely fun at points. The massive opener, ""Can't Get Over You"", is the perfect track to pop in the tape deck just before you break the landspeed record (in sort of a good, Lance Armstrong, achievement way, as opposed to a bad, Vin Diesel, crappy-blockbuster way). And even if you don't plan on breaking the sound barrier anytime soon (loser), supersonic speeds are unnecessary to enjoy the hilariously titled ""Wig On"", which briefly reaches up from the mid-album lull to arrest your attention with Jennifer Jurgen's gorgeous backing vocals. The irony, really, is that Polara attempts to evoke oddly futuristic qualities through a synthesis of mild electronics while the music underneath owes everything to the guitar-heavy rock of almost two decades ago. Of course, that's not a bad thing; it just doesn't sound current is all. But if nothing else, when this kind of stuff has its renaissance fifteen years from now, your kids'll love it.","Next time you're sitting in an oxygen bar, sucking down O2 cocktails on a stolen credit card, I know ...

The Golden State,Mia Doi Todd,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7cd13d19756521394df/1:1/w_160/dbe63ad5.jpg,2002-09-24 05:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8091-the-golden-state/,Columbia,"It's easy to understand why a major label like Columbia would sign Mia Doi Todd. On the strength of three independently released albums, she has developed a strong cult following, and a number of influential critics have warmed up to her. Plus, she has some pretty cool admirers (like Lou Barlow, for one) and has made guest appearances for such hipsters as Dntel and Beachwood Sparks. Her songs, of course, aren't your standard major label fare: some of them have fairly complicated (if not overly pretentious) lyrical conceits. But her voice is such a distinctive instrument, able to both soar dramatically and evoke intimacy, that most listeners probably won't even think twice about the words she sings. It's also makes sense that Columbia would hire a guy like Mitchell Froom to produce Todd. With an extensive resume that includes Richard Thompson, David Byrne, and Elvis Costello, he's the majors' producer-of-choice when they need a singer/songwriter type polished up a bit for mass consumption-- though he has a tendency to overdo it sometimes (a few Richard Thompson albums spring to mind). Seeing the Columbia label on the spine of The Golden State, Mia Doi Todd's major label debut, you can almost hear the board meeting that must've taken place to discuss her Beth Orton/Aimee Mann-like crossover potential. And, that too makes sense and is easily imagined. Sadly (for me, at least), it also makes sense why they'd choose to re-record Todd's older material for her major label debut. There are a lot of good songs on those albums, so it's hard to go too terribly wrong. But to someone who's been buying her albums all along, it sure seems like a cop out. I, for one, would have liked to have seen more new material, especially in light of her recent collaborations with the above-mentioned artists. Instead, The Golden State offers updated versions of songs from all three of her previous albums. The danger with this approach, of course, is screwing up the old versions with heavy-handed production or uncomplimentary instrumentation. By and large though, Todd and Froom have avoided this. The ten-song album is top-heavy with the more spiffed-up songs, as you might expect, and the more bare-bone tracks comprise the second half. ""88 Ways"" and ""Digital"", for example, open the album in bad fashion. And though they do happen to be the most embellished songs here, it's not overproduction that kills them; they're just bad songs. Filled with postmodern catchwords like ""entropy"" and ""binary"", the self-serious and pseudo-intellectual lyrics prepare these tracks for certain inclusion on the soundtrack to the next Keanu Reeves cyberflick. ""Independence Day"", however, turns it around with a rendition subtly shifted from the original, with distant keys underscoring the song's already sinister tension. Another highlight is ""Autumn"", which first appeared on Todd's debut album, The Ewe and the Eye. Here it's given a more upbeat and carefree reading befitting its theme of breaking free from a failing relationship. Stripping the accompaniment down to just voice and guitar on a song about escaping into fantasy in the face of sexual guilt, ""Poppy Fields"" brings Todd back to the kind of material on which she built her reputation: her finger-picked guitar speeds faster and faster toward the end of the song, and she stumbles as she repeats, ""another world, another world""-- it's both disorientating and claustrophobic. It's probably a smart move for Columbia to release a reconfigured sampler of her early songs to catch people up on her talent. Yet, as an ardent fan, it's hard for me not to feel a little let down. When I got my hands on The Golden State, I was genuinely excited to see how Todd had developed as a songwriter since her last album. Sadly, she hasn't developed at all. In fact, come to think of it, she hasn't really developed that much since her debut. All her albums so far, despite their merits, have been more or less interchangeable, both in mood and maturity. Hopefully, with this ""best of"" behind her, she will be unburdened of her past and free to grow into the songwriter she's shown signs of becoming.","It's easy to understand why a major label like Columbia would sign Mia Doi Todd.

The Return of Fenn O'Berg,Fenn O'Berg,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd7913d197565213b54f/1:1/w_160/fb4d0437.jpg,2002-09-24 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3031-the-return-of-fenn-oberg/,Mego,"A trio of laptop improvisers is not a positive mental image. While the idea of watching one pale face illuminated by the glow of a Mac notebook is a little sad, a triumvirate of techie geeks in a club sitting shoulder-to-shoulder and clicking like mad is downright pathetic. It's like paying for the privilege of watching a web design startup code HTML. Fortunately, you can put this unsavory image out of your mind when listening to the second live collaboration between Christian Fennesz, Jim O'Rourke and Peter Rehberg (aka Pita). The fact that The Return of FennO'Berg was constructed live on some stage while a roomful of people with a drink in their hands watched these guys at their computers has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not you'll enjoy the CD. This here is audio, folks, and on The Return of FennO'Berg, these three opt for the subtle, let the tracks build and develop at an organic pace, and allow for the intrusion of the unexpected. The ultimate doubletake on the first collaboration comes during ""Fenn O'Berg Theme"" when John Barry's score to Moonraker struggled to free itself from the clutches of the laptop clatter. A similarly inspired track here is ""A Viennese Tragedy"". While two CPU jockeys stay busy chopping up Mac-processed fragments of static, bits of orchestral music keep popping out of the primordial stew. Finally, a long section of sweeping, romantic orchestral music is released, serving as a perfect contrast to the scattering noise. The few minutes when the strings soar above the scraping sounds of industry is just so goddamn beautiful, reminding me once again why Godspeed You Black Emperor!'s tape-heavy first album is far and away my favorite thing they've done. Time collapses completely as the track plays, and ""A Viennese Tragedy"" becomes a fluid mass of dark energy that could have come from anywhere. Nothing else on The Return of FennO'Berg quite approaches ""A Viennese Tragedy"" for me, but the record is still filled with great moments, and one-ups the first installment in terms of drama and overall listenability. ""Riding Again"" is a quivering, Vaseline-lensed pan across the lounge music graveyard, and the sound of warbling vibes and randomly firing organs dying a slow death reminds me a little of a noisier take on some of Fennesz' Endless Summer material. ""We Will Diffuse You"" ends the album on a high note when, after several minutes of a slowly gurgling bass riff, some incredibly lush guitar drones take over-- the bass anchor throb is enough to massage your solar plexus, while the soft brush of the harmonics whisper softly in your ear. Only ""Floating My Boat""-- at 5\xBD minutes the shortest of these four tracks by some distance-- is less than good. I've no idea what it was like to watch this go down in person (and who knows what it actually sounded like-- the sleeve mentions six months of editing that takes place in two cities), but there is no question that this little aluminum disc is brimming with pleasant surprises.","A trio of laptop improvisers is not a positive mental image.

Time and Tide Wait for No Man,Dame Fate,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a88e13d197565213969c/1:1/w_160/3edf0152.jpg,2002-09-24 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2152-time-and-tide-wait-for-no-man/,Lovitt,"With the current retro-focus aimed so solidly on the Reagan era, it seems like no new band can release an album that isn't immediately equated with new wave forbears-- unless, of course, they're a garage rock band. I'm as guilty of this as the next person, but pigeonholing Washington. DC's Dame Fate in a musical niche roughly halfway between The Pretenders and Siouxsie and the Banshees, not only does the listener a disservice, but the band as well. Time and Tide Wait for No Man isn't bad as far as debut albums go. Solid and cohesive, it lacks the sort of self-indulgence and well-intentioned (if poorly executed) attempts at conveying morbid insanity I've come to associate with melancholy indie rock records. And despite its candy-colored album cover, Dame Fate strive to be thoughtful, mature soundtrack artists for listeners suffering from post-breakup stress or looking for something soothing yet hip to put on the stereo when the party's over. That this particular sound is partially the creation of guitarist Melissa Farris (formerly of Tuscadero), whose previous contributions to the musical landscape sounded anything but tempered and mature, is something of an oddity. But everyone has to grow up, right? And Farris's clever guitar work is the greatest single pleasure afforded this album. The first track, ""Crisp Winter"", is promising. The spare, chiming guitars of the opening bars continually fade in and out over a fuzzy four-chord verse. The song is about two minutes too long, but a sympathetic listener could likely forgive the time lapse if its other elements didn't conspire to be catatonia-inducing. And that may be the point, as most of the songs on Time and Tide follow the same basic format as the first to the point of numbing redundancy. After about 3.5 songs, it becomes remarkably easy to predict, down to the millisecond, the moment at which the jarring crunch will strike. The best moments on Time and Tide are hidden away within individual tracks. ""River Letters"" shifts into subtle pop about halfway through the song; and the bombastic, clanging guitar on ""Stealing Hearts"" temporarily transforms Dame Fate into a swaggering rock band. Expanding on these elements, or adding more of them, would drastically improve Dame Fate's replay value. From most reports I've heard, Dame Fate's atmospheric tendencies come off hitchless when they play live, so I'm willing to chalk some of this up to production. But I doubt even the greatest studio engineers could patch up the rhythm section. Farris's guitar work is so much more adept than that of her bandmates that it genuinely frustrates. The fabric is stretched pretty thin; you almost feel Farris pulling back as the other members struggle to keep up. I could be somewhat sympathetic to this if Time and Tide Wait for No Man showed promise of a more consistent sort. As it is, I'm mostly bored and underwhelmed.","With the current retro-focus aimed so solidly on the Reagan era, it seems like no new band can release an ...

'96 Drum N Bass Classixxx,Bogdan Raczynski,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1db5e6ef959693202ab/1:1/w_160/eb044957.gif,2002-09-23 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6641-96-drum-n-bass-classixxx/,Rephlex,"If Bogdan Raczynski and LTJ Bukem went head to head in ""Shinobi"", who would kick the most ass? Does Dillinja have what it takes to dethrone the samurai math beatster as the ruler of ""Ninja Gaiden""? And if they all broke out the Sega Master System while fiddling with their laptops, just what the hell would it sound like? Why, it would most likely sound like '96 Drum N Bass Classixxx, you silly thing. Or at least, that's the scenario Raczynski has in mind, judging from this twelve-track assault of freaked-out, 8-bit, Polish-cum-Japanese rip-ups. Though described on his website as a collection of old-skool underground d'n'b rollers mixed by ""DJ Bogdan Raczynski"", what we really have here are twelve alter egos burying their teeth into said genre, mashing it between molars and bicuspids and spitting it all over the dance floor. It's a love-note from Raczynski to the likes of Omni Trio and the Metalheadz Krew, a fusing of the former's adrenalized drill-n-bass bounce with the latter's pioneering sound(s). After a brief digression into the wispy, acoustic/electronic music sound so popular with critics five seconds ago, Raczynski has returned to the fertile stomping grounds of his more beat-heavy material, ranging from the ballistic ass-shaking of Thinking of You's ""Unsatisfied Customer"" to pre-Rephlex mashers like ""30002389""-- caffeinated breaks and improbably deep bass tones that would send the balls of any raver right up into the secret pocket of their scratch-n-sniff UFOs. ""Battle Zone 1996"" alone is worth the price of admission to the party, its dark cut-ups and mighty bassline delivering on its promise to ""put the girls in heat"". Believe me, when that first bass tone rattles the window frame, there's gonna be a flood. Elsewhere, Raczynski drops a bomb under the guise of Agent 30 with ""5L45H! 4TT4CK! 3NT3R K3Y"", which pits a fuzzed-out, descending arpeggio against bum-rushing snare rolls before breaking into music from some lost level of ""Mega Man"". And ""D&D; Diabolical"" covers similar territory, rocking some raga breaks and bringing back the philosophizing narrator from his first album, Boku Mo Warakan. Classixxx is far from the serious affair that was 2000's My Love I Love, allowing Raczynski to hang loose and break new ground in a genre time forgot. Witness the liquid flow of ""Governor's Banquet"", the ease with which Amen breaks slide into mad drill-n-bass tempos before returning to their original, blunted course. This stuff is far too insane for your average jungle fan, to be sure-- any who dared to take a ride on a merry-go-round like ""Pouch Fulla Seed (Hard on You RMX)"" would find their ass face-down on the playground asphalt in seconds. But those into the scarier aspects of electronic weirdness, who like their music abstract with rampant unpredictability and personality, will be indiscriminately beat down by Bogdan's badassery.

Mistake,D+,by: Brendan Reid,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a86cea9e61561daa57ff/1:1/w_160/01c64be9.jpg,2002-09-23 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2121-mistake/,KKnw-Yr-Own,"Yessir, they sure do like to take their time in Anacortes. Why, last time I came down to call on my half-cousin Zeke he held up dinner for three hours waiting on ol' Mindy Sue, who was supposed to bring over a big sack of onions but got caught up in fixing the compost shed, seeing as the shed man couldn't make it because he was getting his hammock extended that day and the hammock man was stuck in a tractor jam on Route 20... Ahem. 'Scuse me. See, I've never actually been to Anacortes. It's probably a very nice place to raise a family or own a boat. But, suffice to say, a tiny Washington port town doesn't seem to be the sort of place that could support any sort of music scene. Against all odds, however, a pretty formidable one seems to be thriving there, based mostly on the talent and industry of The Microphones' Phil Elvrum and the patronage of Beat Happening alum Bret Lunsford, who runs both an indie record shop called The Business, and the Knw-Yr-Own label which teethed The Microphones and handles the other Anacortesian bands' releases. And of course, when he's not lending from his banks of indie cred, Lunsford also gives back to the community as principal member of D+. With Elvrum and singer/songwriter/Microphones-song-title-referent Karl Blau backing him up, Lunsford's band has the makings of a gen-u-wine twee powerhouse. Lunsford, however, also likes to take his time. D+'s last album, Dandelion Seeds, came out back in 1998, and he's been silent ever since. In the ten years since Beat Happening called it quits, Lunsford hasn't strayed much from his previous band's pop-rock primitivism, either. If anything, D+ takes the concept even farther; where Beat Happening was plain, D+ is downright homely. Lunsford's back-of-the-throat Muppet croak doesn't quite have the same charm as Calvin Johnson's wide-eyed baritone, and Dandelion Seeds attempted to get by mainly on its lazy, clumsy naivete, to mixed results. Mistake's eponymous opener injects some much-needed energy into things-- Elvrum lays out a skittery, metronomic beat behind Lunsford's Luddite growly rant about how his TV is stealing all of his friends. The song actually manages to maintain a menacing atmosphere with surprising efficiency-- a few abrupt stops, some intermittent feedback drones, and Blau's deep harmonizing on the chorus give bite to what might have otherwise been a goof. Unfortunately, D+ hasn't quite gotten the hang of intensity yet; ""God Above God"", while attempting a brooding shamble, just kind of plods, and the religious message collapses under its own weight. But it's the lazy love-pop stuff that D+ have finally, gratifyingly, figured out. ""Megadose"" fortifies Lunsford's shaky tenor with a wall of 'Phones-y harmony on the choruses, and ""What's Not to Fall in Love With"" elaborates along the same lines, spinning out a shaky, sad, breeze-thin and bleary melodic web. In the bluntly affectionate ""You're So Right"", the great lines that Lunsford scatters throughout his songs finally cohere into a brilliant closing: ""Run away from who I know I am/ Jump into someone that I can't swim/ Plant my kisses on another face/ They don't grow the way they do on you"". ""Take You For Granted"", however, beats them all-- Lunsford's tuneless a capella recitation suddenly turns into a graceful ode, layered with cellos, ringing guitars, and gauzy vocal harmonies. As much as D+ seems to be gaining momentum on Mistake, the band is still all about inertia of the negative kind-- Lunsford's lyrical landscape teems with dying stars and stalling cars. And seeing as these eight songs are just about all he's released in the past four years, he seems to be something of an expert on the matter. But if Lunsford has, in fact, run out of steam, Mistake at least provides an evocation of the sort of rural decay that can debilitate (or drive) a scene. And it'll probably pay for that hammock extension, too.","Yessir, they sure do like to take their time in Anacortes. Why, last time I came down to call on ...

Now You Know,Doug Martsch,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1daea9e61561daa48cd/1:1/w_160/646cb96e.jpg,2002-09-23 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5122-now-you-know/,Warner Bros.,"NEWSFLASH! Indie guitar godhead Doug Martsch, having grown tired of the fast-paced corporate Idaho lifestyle, has relocated to the backwoods of Lou'sana (or Mizzou, depending on your sources), and decided to re-learn his chosen instrument from scratch. To accomplish this feat, he has studied under a succession of colorfully nicknamed Delta bluesman like ""No-Toes"" Willie Green and ""Hodag"" Rufus Dillingham. Martsch was last seen wearing denim overalls and a straw hat, sitting on a log in an undisclosed swampy location, plucking on a banjo with a half-empty jug marked ""XXX"" resting by his side. Indeed, Doug Martsch has made his blues album. Since 1993, Martsch has been kicking out poptastic classic rock with his full-time unit Built to Spill, crafting crazily infectious hooks and ripping Malmsteen solos that'd fit nicely between The Who and Styx on your local oldster-demographic FM stop. In accordance with this image, it should surprise no one that Martsch has made this record-- the solo blues album is a textbook 70s move. So, those of you who've been waving those DOUG MARTSCH IS THE NEW CLAPTON signs for the last ten years can finally take your bow. Fortunately, Now You Know is a different brand of blues homagery from Clapton's From the Cradle; this isn't your usual 12-bar cookie-cutter ""my baby done me wrong"" pretend-mourning. Instead, Martsch test-drives a Delta blues sound-- a style closer to the point in musical evolution where country/western and blues went their separate, segregated ways. His weary rasp is minimally accompanied. For the most part, we're offered only acoustic guitar, on which Martsch delivers beer-bottle slides and gooey bends played dirty enough to draw a clatter-rattle from the occasional string section. Drums? Sometimes, but always kept unobtrusively distant in the mix. Electric guitar? A few times in the record's second half, and sparsely implemented even then. In short, this record is about as intimate an impression as we're likely to get of Martsch outside of the short tour he's launching in support of it. The music, of course, is strictly Blooze for Dummies-- or in this case, indie rockers-- and thus is probably best dealt with through comparison to the Built to Spill catalog. Through that lens, Martsch continues the sub-greatness trend of his recent work, releasing another record that fails to carry the weight of the canonical two-fer that lies at the center of his career. The blues outfit switches off and on from gimmick status (the thematically and sonically overweight ""Woke Up This Morning With My Mind on Jesus"") to clever twist, but never seems to be the thesis statement of the album. Nearly every track begins with bluesy intentions, but only a handful (the pace-setter ""Offer"", and the gritty faux-field recording ""Stay"") stick with that dynamic for their duration. Instead, the fretboard whines mostly serve as a contrast tool for segments that sound like, well, stripped-down acoustic Built to Spill-- and not just because Martsch's double-tracked nose-singing is too easily identifiable to allow for a complete departure. Witness the smooth segue from the almost bluegrassy hoedown finger-picking of ""Window"" into a more poppy electric segment a la ""Time Trap""; or the Casio bubbling under the Delta-flavored first movement of ""Lift"" before it implodes into gentle There's Nothing Wrong with Love-style pop. But hell, who's to bitch about Doug doing solo BTS-type stuff? Anyone who's heard the beautifully aching b-side loner version of ""Kicked It in the Sun"" can attest that it's Martsch's songs and delivery, not the raging guitars and drumkit, that gives the band's music its gladiatorial impact. And sure enough, the more familiar-sounding material is what really sticks amongst these eleven tracks. ""Heart (Things Never Shared)"" is a haunting, drumless rumination spiked with Mellotron orchestra and plunky vibraphone, while the double guitar slides of the instrumental ""Instrumental"" (straight shooter, that Doug) is a more rugged interpretation of recent BTS fare. Most impressive, though, is ""Impossible"", the first Martsch composition in years to give me that Perfect From Now On feeling, partially due to the cello accompaniment (why did he ever stop using that cello?), but mostly because of its slow build through multiple movements into cathartic, majestic guitar wank. So what do we now know from Now You Know? Well, as is the norm for the publicity-shy Martsch, very little. Only Doug would release an experiment with new influences as the first record under his Christian name (not to mention that he admits picking up said influences only recently). But judging from the album's tendency to lapse into traditionally Spill-ish moments, even Doug realizes that the restrictive nature of the blues isn't the Southern faith healer he needs to shake off his creative rut. As a result, Now You Know remains a mere temporary dalliance with the Delta sound, nowhere near as uncomfortably colonialist as the blues workouts of his guitar deity ancestors, but not a particularly bona fide new direction, either.","NEWSFLASH!

The Big Bang,King Kong,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1c8b1335d7bf1698340/1:1/w_160/edef94f1.jpg,2002-09-23 05:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4444-the-big-bang/,Drag City,"What do you do after taking part in one of the most influential bands of the past 15 years, after helping to create a whole new subspecies of rock? Obviously: you start a funk and dance band inspired by the early work of the B-52's. Hey, why not? That's what Ethan Buckler did. After Tweez sent kids to dust off their metronomes in '89, Buckler split with math-rock progenitors Slint to search for a simpler groove. And when he found it, he stayed with it. It's been ten years since King Kong's debut album, Old Man on the Bridge, and frankly, things haven't changed much, if at all, for the band. Of course, by now, it seems that if things were to change much at all, it would undermine the whole point of this group, which is to overcome you with basic beats, even basic-er basslines (we're talking three notes max), borderline moronic lyrics, a voice that sounds like David Berman's straight man, and above all, repetition, repetition, repetition. Hell, changing the formula now would just dilute it. And the thing is, it sometimes really works. Sometimes. The biggest problem facing this band is Buckler's ridiculous storylines, which have a tendency to wind on long after the initial novelty of his silliness wears thin. And after that, you're still left with half an album to get through. He seems like one of those people who gets an idea and carries it to its absurd end, no matter how ridiculous it may appear to outsiders. Thus: 1995's caveman-inspired Me Hungry and 1994's rural-life concept piece, Funny Farm. The theme this time is space, sorta. You see, The Big Bang is about a man who gets fed up with the human race, decides to leave Earth via rocketship, and then happens to stumble upon a paradise planet (the planet of Kong) which declares him King (geddit?). It ends in a natal flashback sequence (""Life"") just like in Kubrick's 2001, wherein we learn that the whole album is a big allegory for-- you guessed it-- life itself. Awesome. With the setting being space and all, you'd expect to hear plenty of ""Zaxxon""-sounding effects here, and the Kong (with the help of producer Neil Michael Hagerty, seemingly Drag City's answer to Thrill Jockey's John McEntire of late) does not disappoint on that account: lasers, tazers and long-fading phasers. Yet there's also a breezy, tropical feel to the album, in a Haircut 100 sort of way, with wooden vibes and congas, and guitar riffs so rigid they're mecha-funky. It's with the nine-minute album ""Deep Blue Sky"" (incidentally the best song on the album) that we learn of the protagonist's beef with people: ""It's the humanity/ Crawling all over the place/ It's the humanity/ Taking up so much space/ Kissing each other's asses/ You've got such bad taste/ I piss on you/ And the whole human race."" Don't take this too seriously, though. It's meant to be goofy and unsophisticated. But not. Think of it like a Ween record: a children's album for adults. The rest of The Big Bang is decent but forgettable, which puts it on par with King Kong's other releases. All of them have one, maybe two standout moments where the matter-of-fact absurdisms mesh with the remedial funk-rock to create something so primordial that it becomes temporarily compelling. Still, nobody needs two King Kongs records, and though this is no better or worse than the others, it's not worth picking up if you've already met the requirements.","What do you do after taking part in one of the most influential bands of the past 15 years, after ...

1st + 2nd,Floating Flower,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdcb13d197565213b60b/1:1/w_160/c4f1a390.gif,2002-09-22 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3106-1st-2nd/,AMT,"The tunneling: you can hear this, deeply buried under layers of guitar, tabla, wordless descants, and heavenly space-guitar in Floating Flower's music. This sound, heard in so many acidic shaman works, should be a background element, like the quaint white noise on psychedelic Beatles records or the woefully misplaced pan flutes in digital new age music. It swirls disorientingly like a funnel cloud, panned across the mix. The trick is not to think of this sound as a device of dissonance, or worse, as something to initiate your high, but merely as something to enhance what is already way out there. Of course, it might help if you were pretty far out, too. Japan's acid-folk trio Floating Flower is far out as a matter of practice. In fact, as you read this, Yuki and Kaneko Tetsuya are probably somewhere in India or Nepal, tripping into nirvana, becoming one with a mountain or two, and generally embodying all that is psychedelically true. The third member, Acid Mother Temple's Kawabata Makoto, is tying up all the loose ends: mixing their records, releasing them on his label, trying to keep ""spongers"" out of their house while they're away, though he's sure Yuki and Tetsuya don't care how many CDs they sell (if any). Floating Flower may one day make more music, but no one really knows when the other two will return. In the meantime, Black Plastic Sound's reissue of their first two albums (originally on AMT) on one disc gives me the chance to hear the results of their extended journeys into other planes. Taking the classic sound of traditional folk, adding Eastern percussion and strings, ghostly female vocals, searing (but never heavy) electric guitar solos, and the dreaded tunneling, Floating Flower make cosmic waves for anyone who wants to tag along. The simple acoustic guitar figures might fool you into thinking this was something to soothe and relax, and though that is one option, it's not nearly that passive 12 minutes into an epic trip. ""Wave Ring"" finds all the elements of Floating Flower's sound in place, as the tablas provide an omnipresent gallop for the melancholy guitar line and Yuki's reverb-laden soprano. For better than 10 minutes, the trio vamps into the nether regions of the soul. And the song would be mind-numbingly repetitive were it not for that massive funnel cloud of sound I spoke of earlier. At first, it's restrained by the more minstrelsy ensemble sound, but over the song's course, it's transformed into a raging cylinder. To make it through this music, it's probably best to let it wash over you like the incoming tide, drowning in wave after wave of sonically/chemically altered magic. Otherwise, you're likely to be as lost as Yuki and Tetsuya in Nepal. ","The tunneling: you can hear this, deeply buried under layers of guitar, tabla, wordless descants, and heavenly space-guitar in Floating ...

Be Gentle with the Warm Turtle,Kinski,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbba5e6ef95969322c9f/1:1/w_160/78ff1bde.jpg,2002-09-22 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4461-be-gentle-with-the-warm-turtle/,PacifiCoPacifiCo,"It begins as a whisper, the warm tones of cleanly plucked electric guitars, cymbals beset by mallets, and some inviting drones bathing it all in a phosphorescent glow of sound. It's the kind of music that doesn't sound like it has much of a place to go, but you hardly care, as its company is just that pleasant. And then, at about 3\xBD minutes, it begins to boil, rising up to a cacophonous, beautiful crescendo, comprised of noises that might be guitars. And then, in a flash, it's gone, leaving you again to sit with the drones until another song comes along to take you somewhere else. If Kinski's entire debut album (assuming you don't consider their 45-minute debut EP an album) were as good as that first track, I'd be grabbing you by your virtual collar, and shaking you from across the Internet, imploring you to buy, buy, buy and spread the gospel further. As it stands, it's not, but some of it does manage to come very close. The Seattle quartet has a great many strengths-- not least of which is their impressive musicianship, which rears its head everywhere while never descending to the depths of masturbatory self-indulgence. And with seven tracks hovering in at just under an hour, that's just about miraculous. Volume seems very important to the band's overall aesthetic, with several tracks featuring violent shifts in dynamics at key points. ""One Ear in the Sun"" begins as a quiet meditation before erupting in a fuzz-encrusted blast smeared with electronic noise. The similarities to Mogwai are obvious, though Kinski lack the subtlety and control that make Mogwai such a juggernaut. ""Daydream Intonation"" follows with a different approach, opening at a slow pace, and gradually ramping the tempo until the band is moving at a breakneck pace. A brief breakdown launches them full force into a wild ending choked with noise, a semblance of melody coughing out from underneath it all. ""That Helmut Poe Kid's Weird"" is a low point, though-- it's less contoured and more given to shapeless electronic noodling, and as such, some of the passion behind the playing gets obscured. Thankfully, though, it's followed by another standout, ""Newport"". Here, Kinski add vocals, courtesy of frontman Chris Martin (not the Coldplay guy, though I'm fairly certain he gets that a lot). The track proves the band not just stellar noisemakers, but able songwriters as well. Propelled by a furious assault from drummer Dave Weeks, Martin's delivery sounds far more alive than its deadpan tone might allow for in a different setting. The high-octane approach of ""Newport"" and ""Daydream Intonation"" doesn't always work for the guys, though, as demonstrated on the mindlessly fuzzy ""New India"", which feels more like a casual jam than a thought-out song, and deals the record an early blow from which it thankfully recovers. Appropriately, the album ends as a whisper, just as it began, with the quietly eddying ""Montgomery""-- a song that, while striking and powerful, doesn't quite match its album-opening counterpart. Still, despite its faults, Be Gentle with the Warm Turtle ranks as a quite an achievement for a young band, succeeding where others in the often tiresome world of instrumental rock have failed.","It begins as a whisper, the warm tones of cleanly plucked electric guitars, cymbals beset by mallets, and\n\ some ...

Low Light Dreams,Signer,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3f59d034d5c69bf2f50/1:1/w_160/b15e1884.jpg,2002-09-22 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7146-low-light-dreams/,Carpark,"New Zealander Bevan Smith adores the hazy dub of Seefeel, and his Signer project and its second full-length, Low Light Dreams, are nothing if not an adoring tribute to that band's Polyfusia and Quique LPs. This album is gorgeous to space out to, and though it lacks the intricacy of Chessie's similarly inclined Plug Research release Overnight, its gauzy drones and rudimentary rhythm tracks do manage to effectively mimic lucid dreaming, underwater sunlight, and the atomic ballet of Brownian motion. After you're washed with three-minutes of cotton-wool white noise entitled ""Light Fails Me"", Smith begins the guided tour of his crepuscular world. With soothing waves of distortion and a bass drum simulating a heartbeat, ""Building Memories Without You"" borrows heavily from Wolfgang Voigt's Gas project. Smith also pays homage to Bj√∂rk with ""Grosse Strasse"", which is how I would imagine the opening strings of her sublime ""Unravel"" might sound if remixed by Main and Force Inc's Geoff White. The delicately wavering drones and functional percussion of ""Detached Under Buildings"" turn bewitching when Smith plugs in his guitar. He repeats a simple three-chord phrase, beneath which he almost imperceptibly alters his drum machine's timbres. Elsewhere, ""Interior Dub"" is pure first-generation post-rock dub: occasional rimshots pepper a glistening synthline while Smith's bass slopes low to the ocean floor. Then, emerging from this hypnogogic zone, Smith sings indistinguishable words which recall the textural station platform announcements of Aphex Twin's ""Tha"". Though the title parodies a Spacemen 3 album, ""Dreaming About Making Music to Dream To"" is deceptively the clubbiest cut on the album. Yet, for all its syncopated percussion, the immense washes of blissful white noise (and the eerie countermelody) may force even the most cranked-up non-stop-raver to join the wallflowers. ""Night Is Blurred"" goes for a similar deception, but this time Smith keeps the white noise more surreptitious in the mix and gives greater prominence to micropercussion and a downcast, indigent melody. This track could be a ""Voodoo Ray"" or ""Pacific State"" for depressives. Low Light Dreams closes with ""Post Obsession"", Smith's first real display of uniqueness. Subverting the derivative subterranean drift of the rest of the album, Smith allows dissonant chording and mechanical clanks to disrupt his serene drones. Though these sounds remind me of Seefeel-er Mark Clifford's Disjecta project, Smith unburdens himself of overt influence here, and, I sincerely hope, points to territories he'll explore on future outings.","New Zealander Bevan Smith adores the hazy dub of Seefeel, and his Signer project and its second full-length,\n\ Low ...

Sea Change,Beck,by: Will Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a24d13d197565213883a/1:1/w_160/7815a71f.jpg,2002-09-22 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/617-sea-change/,DGC,"It's easy to romanticize Beck as the scruffy wannabe who lived on friends' couches for a year, recording a new song every day on a beat-up four-track; absorbing Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music and old school hip-hop with equal enthusiasm. The aptly titled ""Loser"", his biggest and most career-defining hit, was recorded in a friend's living room for kicks. His first live performances were on hijacked mics at other peoples' gigs: he'd just step up with a guitar or harmonica between acts and entertain while the often bemused next band set up their drums. On the homemade tapes and scrapped-together compilations that comprised his earliest recorded output, Beck cobbled together all of his influences-- noise, hardcore, country, rap, folk, grunge, R&B;, found sound and classic rock-- and melded it into his own junkyard punk. Over subsequent releases Beck continued to refine the art of juxtaposing achingly poignant folk songs with lo-fi guitar freakouts, collages of dialogue and noise, and Radio Shack hip-hop. With Odelay he managed to pull all of these disparate elements together in an artful way, blending nimble dobro guitar figures, say, with sample-heavy backbeats, vocal samples, banjo, a loop of Van Morrison covering Bob Dylan-- bottles and cans, or just clap your hands. At live shows, or on Chris Douridas' morning program at KCRW, Beck would often play never-recorded songs he'd likely composed just a few days before playing them, exquisitely voiced and effortlessly brilliant. What happened to that guy? Mutations, the genteel quickie Beck recorded on the cheap in 1998, was largely a knee-jerk reaction to the daunting task of ever having to follow up Odelay at all. His label even reneged on a provision that allowed him to release records on independents, and it's little wonder: with Mutations, shit-hot producer Nigel Godrich had crafted a slick, almost clinically glossy record, with clean guitars that never buzzed or hit bum notes. And while ""Cold Brains"", ""Nobody's Fault But My Own"", and ""Canceled Check"" are great songs, lesser tracks like ""Lazy Flies"" and ""We Live Again"" were shamelessly gussied-up with tired space-rock bleeps and whooshes-- and I won't even get into the made-for-Starbucks faux-exotica of ""Tropicalia"". No offense to Pitchfork alum Neil Lieberman, who praised the album mellifluously, but in 2002 we're up to our asses in ""futuristic roots albums"". Let's call Mutations what it was: a soft-rock One Foot in the Grave made with Pro Tools and a heart of steel. Perhaps it's telling that his seventh studio album is titled Sea Change-- for rather than the smooth, utterly inoffensive quirks of Mutations, Beck opts for abrupt changes in temperament and lush instrumentation. Recording again with Godrich and his regular band (Smokey Hormel, Roger Manning, Joey Waronker, and Justin Meldal-Johnsen) pounding out a track a day over an intense two-week period, Sea Change rightfully feels like a sequel to Mutations with no alarms and no surprises. In fact, opener, ""The Golden Age"", would feel right at home on Mutations itself, with its gentle mid-tempo strumming, lonesome wails of pedal steel and predictable space-rock flourishes. A cloud of mind-numbing melancholy hangs over Sea Change, from the world-weary grandpa-Beck voice he employs on most of the tracks to its unfailingly morose lyrics. ""These days I barely get by/ I don't even try,"" Beck sings in ""The Golden Age"", and that's just the tip of the jagged iceberg that looms ever larger in Sea Change's periscope. It's obvious just from perusing the song titles-- ""Lonesome Tears,"" ""End of the Day,"" ""Already Dead,"" ""Lost Cause""-- that the 2002 model Beck is one sad sack (and it's impossible not to armchair quarterback which of Beck's celebrity girlfriends inspired such gut-wrenching bile). But though the songs are jam-packed with typical Beck imagery (stray dogs, moonlight drives, diamonds as kaleidoscopes) there's very little here that measures up to the eloquence of ""She is all, and everything else is small."" It's pretty obvious what Beck is shooting for with Sea Change: that timeless quality that his heroes Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan and Nick Drake seemed to exude with every recording. But here, as on Mutations, he confuses lyrical simplicity and standard-tuning, key-of-C songwriting with the unpretentious directness of his idols. Too often Beck saddles these songs with half-baked cliches and easy rhymes: ""sky"" always rhymes with ""die"", ""care"" always rhymes with ""there"". He doesn't even sound like himself on many of Sea Change's more paint-by-numbers cuts. On ""Guess I'm Doing Fine"" Beck emotes in an unnatural croak that's likely the product of a digitally decelerated vocal track, but he mostly just sounds constipated. Likewise with the karaoke-honed Gordon Lightfoot impression Beck turns in on the hoary ""End of the Day"": ""It's nothing that I haven't seen before/ But it still kills me like it did before."" Elsewhere, Beck mines Mutations' folky space-rock vibe with more artful and ear-pleasing results. The chiming guitars and groaning strings of ""Lost Cause"" creak and sway like the tired masts of a pirate ship; washes of backward sound snake through the melody like restless ghosts. ""The Golden Age"", with its chorus of tinkling glockenspiels and cavernous echo, is a pleasant diversion in the vein of Mutations' ""Cold Brains."" An unnecessary remake of 1994's ""It's All In Your Mind"" is tarted up with the omnipresent synth blips and drums, but some tastefully distant banjo licks and Suzie Katayama's swooning cello lend the song a resigned majesty the original certainly never portended. But it's Sea Change's most daring tracks that are ultimately its most satisfying. Beck's father, David Campbell, contributes inventive string arrangements to three cuts: ""Paper Tiger"" is a low-key triumph, with a minimal bed of bass and drums punched up by sudden, deep string attacks-- Beck's ""Glass Onion,"" if you will; the deliciously overwrought ""Lonesome Tears"" is an uncomfortably raw display of emotion, with an unpredictable melody and unbelievably tortured chorus (""How could this love, ever-turning/ Never turn its eye on me?"" Beck questions as the song builds to a cathartic tsunami of violins and ear-splitting noise); the moody, cinematic ""Round the Bend"" cribs the cadence and nocturnal vibe of Nick Drake's ""River Man"", augmented by plucky upright bass and Beck's subdued, almost intentionally slurred vocal. But Cap'n Beck saves his strangest songs for the second half of the album, with the enigmatic ""Sunday Sun"" bathing odd, disjointed lyrics (""Jealous minds walk in a line, and their faces jade the strain"") in a Brian Wilson-inspired glow, with mixed but cosmetically acceptable results. The unsettling sea shanty ""Little One"" is a return to form, with a fetching minor-chord hook and creepy lyrics (""Cold bones tied together by black ropes we pulled from a swing"") intoned in a convincing Kurt Cobain growl. He knots it all together, sorta, with the anticlimactic closer ""Side of the Road"", which plods along awkwardly amid busy slide-guitar work and a rambling electric piano. It's a far cry from the back-porch perfection of ""Ramshackle"", but given what it reveals, it'll do. ""Something better than this, someplace I'd like to go,"" sings Beck in a tremulous voice seemingly decades beyond his 32 years. ""To let all I've learned tell me what I know/ About the kind of life I never thought I'd live."" On Sea Change, Beck sounds intentionally world-weary, but it's the songs themselves that sound labored. Is it no longer enough for Beck to write profound, genre-bending tunes that stand on their own? Does he really need the crutch of suffocating overproduction and bold strokes of orchestration to shock us into caring again? Two turntables and a microphone, man! 'Cause there was a time when Beck didn't need Nigel Godrich to space out his white-collar blues. A winter spent in Calvin Johnson's basement, an afternoon spent with a beatbox and a slide guitar in a friend's living room was all he needed to pluck otherworldly songs from the fertile Beckscape of desolated views, crazy towns, lost causes and stolen boats. Given how much soul-searching obviously went into this record, it's distressing how little soul the finished product actually has. If there's anything the self-absorbed murk of Sea Change illustrates with unmistakable clarity, it's that Beck has forgotten how to connect with his inner loser-- and it's nobody's fault but his own.","It's easy to romanticize Beck as the scruffy wannabe who lived on friends' couches for a year, recording a ...

Children of the Black Sun,Non,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c42269fc7814a47cd7ed/1:1/w_160/dfc3539f.jpg,2002-09-19 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5829-children-of-the-black-sun/,Mute,"Boyd Rice, that provocative Gnostic, desperately needs to go over the terms of his latest contract with the man downstairs-- he's getting a raw deal. After, I dunno, about a billion marginally more successful releases as Non, Rice's latest shout-out to Ol' Scratch, Children of the Black Sun, is bleak, ""cinematic"", and entirely un-fucking-listenable. I wouldn't call myself a fan of his earlier work, but before this burnt offering Rice could at least be counted on to produce albums of texture, substance, or even both-- each the absolute lifeblood of experimental music. The majority of this album, however, sounds like whatever noise I imagine might be produced by playing a vinyl record scratched to pure white. Now I know how it feels to die for my audience. I've listened to this album several times, each listen more painful than the last, in an effort to warn you as effectively as I possibly can to stay away from it. Allow me to itemize the debt (you can count the sounds on this album without even taking off your shoes): an large brass section tunes-up on a single continuous tone for four minutes on ""Black Sun""; a half-dozen extremely ""dramatic"" guitar notes are plucked on ""Serpent of the Heavens""; three vocal samples, some rain... there might be a bee somewhere! Sweet crispy Christ, at least Receive the Flame had helicopters! Regardless, these noises only account for about 10% of the album. The other 90% is an irritatingly constant hum that fluctuates between ""whine"" and ""causes brain cancer"". Oh, wait! Maybe I spoke too soon! There's also a DVD with a Dolby 5.1 mix on it! That's good, maybe the other 3.1 channels are the ones with the freakin' sounds on them. I can't wait to try this... ...Thirty-one minutes later, and my ordeal with this pile of aural leakage is finally complete. Now I can say with certainty that the only thing worse than enduring the low-level bass drone in two channels is being surrounded by it. Two channels won't confuse the basic fight-or-flight response provoked by this vacuum of an album because at least you'll know which way to run. Not so with the Dolby mix-- you won't know where to turn when this steaming pile comes at you from every direction at once! It's scarier than Jason X! But more frightening still is that someone thought this was a good idea. Rice's denser, less awful past work could benefit from this technology, but it's wasted here. Now, if I were in a really generous mood, I would give Rice the benefit of the doubt and say that he was trying to produce something along the lines of Coil's drone masterwork Time Machines. I would also say, of course, that he neglected to realize the necessity of the hypnotic elements at work below the surface of its simple, lulling sines and cosines, and attempted to generate a similar effect through random fluctuations in the constant thrum of Children. Naturally, this utterly, irrevocably fails. Without some sort of underlying organization to the drone, it resembles white noise and is readily tuned out, leaving little-to-nothing left to hold the listener. If that was Rice's aim, then, perhaps, he succeeds, but that the result is comprised of near-white noise is hardly something to smile about. But you know what? I'll even go a step further. Rather than just bitching about how astoundingly empty this Non-release is, I'll offer a positive alternative (I'm Libra, I strive for balance). Go to the kitchen and find two appliances-- toasters, cuisinarts, blenders, what have you. Hold one in each hand. Smash them together for fifteen minutes. Now you've just had as much fun (if not more) than listening to Children of the Black Sun, and in half the time. Don't say I never gave you anything.","Boyd Rice, that provocative Gnostic, desperately needs to go over the terms of his latest contract with the man downstairs-- ...

Every Day,The Cinematic Orchestra,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5d05e6ef95969320bb9/1:1/w_160/8c7bae4e.jpg,2002-09-19 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1469-every-day/,Ninja Tune,"Every Day, the Cinematic Orchestra's third full-length release, proves that occasionally it's not what you do that really counts, but whom you do it with. By enlisting new recruits to his Orchestra, Jason Swinscoe has sloughed the derivative mannerisms that marred 1999's Motion and 2000's Remixes 1998-2000-- where those two albums sounded stiff and crippled by the weight of overt influence, Every Day is both stately and loose. And by ditching his Miles Davis/Gil Evans stance and embracing freer jazz elements, Swinscoe has finally achieved a much-needed spaciousness and grandeur in his music. Much of the credit for this new openness must be given to guest vocalist Fontella Bass-- Lester Bowie's fearsomely voiced ex-wife and erstwhile member of the Art Ensemble of Chicago-- whose presence brings an immense dignity to the album. Just as David Axelrod's self-titled 2001 LP on Mo'Wax was pushed beyond its label's confines by Lou Rawls's performance of ""Loved Boy"", so does Bass's rendition of ""All That You Give"" push Everyday beyond the scratchadelic goofiness I've come to associate with Ninja Tune. ""All That You Give"" begins with harpist Rhodri Davis laying out chromatic clusters of sound through which strings and Luke Flowers's leaning drums make a steady course. After a swift key change, Fontella's august vocal emerges. The simple lyric and Bass's cooing and humming give the song an almost hymnal quality. It's as though Bass is imprecating a soul, attempting to coax someone's essence into view. Such an opener is hard to follow and Swinscoe knows it. The opening minutes of ""Burn Out"" consist of percussion and a stern bass figure similar to the one that underpinned the Irresistible Force's ""Nepalese Bliss"". Swinscoe's giving the listener time to absorb the solemn power of ""All That You Give"" and prepare for the remainder of the album. Three minutes into ""Burn Out"", sampled gospel voices intertwine before John Ellis begins an extended electric piano solo. Closely stacked horns occasionally puncture his lines, recalling the tonalities Swinscoe proliferated through Motion. ""Flite"" picks up the tempo and heads the listener into marimba-lead broken beats. Flowers' maintenance of the breaks is impressive and the other players leave him to show off through the track's six minutes. There's no sitting out during ""Evolution""-- the second track Fontella Bass brings her wisdom to. Starting off almost as a spoken word piece, with Ellis's piano commenting on Bass's words, ""Evolution"" quickly transforms into a fiery prayer with Bass hollering the title. At this point the Cinematic Orchestra really parade their skills and channel the spirit of Les McCann's cosmic jazz masterpiece, Invitation to Openness-- albeit updated with DJ Food-member Patrick Carpenter's lysergic turntable scratches. Just as ""Flite"" belonged to drummer Flowers, ""The Man with Movie Camera"" belongs to soprano saxophonist Tom Chant. He threads sharp Pharoahic lines through Flowers's cascading kicks, rimshots, tom-tom rolls until the group surges out into territory first mapped by Alice Coltrane. Then, after those minutes of mystical groove, Every Day turns back to serenity for the contemplative, doubting, restless ""All Things to All Men"", featuring Roots Manuva. For the performance of his career, Roots Manuva drops his Stockwell rudie schtick for a philosophical self-examination that never descends into navel-gazing or therapy-babble. Every Day closes with the title track, a showcase for the man who has provided the surest foundation throughout, bassist Phil France. France gets ninety seconds to bare his soul before Swinscoe brings in Flowers's delicate cymbal dance to add tonal color. The combination is cosmic drum-n-bass: Flowers and France match Fontella Bass's grandeur and forcefulness. I can't conceive of a more fitting conclusion to this incredibly commanding album. Swinscoe has escaped his influences and marked out his own genus of non-aligned spiritual music. While Every Day is often too serene to be appropriately described as ""fire music"", the essence of Coltrane and Albert Ayler are very much present. Yet, as impressed as I am by the record, I can't delude myself that this album will alter the opinions of those of you who insist that jazz is dead. Lacking the mathy awkwardness of Andrew Pekler's Station to Station or the jam-band frivolity of Medeski, Martin & Wood, Every Day lacks angles that can be used as polemical poignards. Outside of the downtempo/chill-out community, this album's even distribution of majesty and poise may work against its acceptance in more outr√© circles-- more fool those who don't embrace what is, in the simplest terms, a flawless collection.","Every Day, the Cinematic Orchestra's third full-length release, proves that occasionally it's not\n\ what you do that ...

Mclusky Do Dallas,Mclusky,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c4035e6ef9596932396f/1:1/w_160/5ec93b31.jpg,2002-09-19 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5185-mclusky-do-dallas/,BeggarsToo Pure,"Welsh trio Mclusky is compact, stocky, spastic, and duck's-ass tight. They're also giddy and utterly daft. But buzzing through two-minute power-punk tunes like teen boys who've found a landmine and can't wait to huck rocks at it, Mclusky are, more than anything, tremendous, stupid fun. And no question about it: they've got impact like knocking skulls in a bar fight. Recorded in Chicago with Steve Albini, Mclusky's second album takes advantage of his knack for making bands sound viciously loud and tight beyond comprehension, thereby trumping their interesting but unfocused UK debut, 2000's My Pain and Sadness is More Sad and Painful Than Yours. ""Lightsabre Cocksucking Blues"" kicks it off, with Mat Harding's drums rolling like hubcaps down a hillside into the power-riff bash of Jon Chapple's bass and Andy Falkous's buzzsaw guitar; they're so on cue that the only random element is Falkous's vocals, as he sticks keening wails, frenzied gibbering, and diaphragm-tearing shouts into the comic crime story lyrics. In fact, due undoubtedly to Albini's production and the erratic vocals, Mclusky have recently been compared to the Pixies: they have the same knack for taking essentially straight-up songs and wracking them with nervous energy. Of course, unlike vintage Black Francis, Falkous's vocals don't sound maniacal or out of control; they're just deftly witty and humorously exaggerated. Most of Mclusky Do Dallas holds this pace, but infectiously poppy songwriting always girds the extreme elements. This works to keep the mood varied, as the band stretches out barbed-wire guitar lines like the one on ""Collagen Rock"", or follows the easy stride and sudden fits of a song like ""Alan is a Cowboy Killer"". And frankly, American teen skater bands wish they could write a power-punk anthem as instantly unforgettable and insanely insidious as ""Day of the Deadringers"". Yet, Mclusky also admirably deliver on an entirely different level: check the stark contrast of ""Fuck This Band"", an extremely quiet track consisting of almost nothing but a bassline and Falkous's weary moans. Despite the band's tightrope tension, however, their sense of humor may be their most successful element. These guys are plain obnoxious. It's not that they crack first-grade jokes about herpes and bloodfarts-- they just have a way of combining crass taunts with awesome non-sequiturs. One track opens, ""All of your friends are cunts/ Your mother is a ballpoint pen thief."" Or the line from their single ""To Hell with Good Intentions"": ""My love is bigger than your love/ We take more drugs than a touring funk band, sing it!"" That's all good for a few chuckles, but the humor helps to lighten the harsh crunch of their mom-murdering instrumental beatdown-- their intensity is balanced by the fact that they're just damn entertaining. It gives them an outlet for the edginess and a way to take the piss out of themselves. And while it also makes them less revolutionary, it does make them more enjoyable. ""So, they're original, but are they challenging and unusual?"" Not so much. But don't you get enough of that? This is only one of the tightest, jumpiest, straight-up rock albums around.","Welsh trio Mclusky is compact, stocky, spastic, and duck's-ass tight. They're also giddy and utterly daft.

A voice asks, ""Are you too... functional? Do you get up in the morning and do what is expected of you with marginally admirable resolve? Then you may be one of millions of Americans who suffer from A-OK Disorder. Ask your doctor about Euphone. Studies show that Euphone can reduce your hectic, vervy self to a blissy, horizontal bag of fluid. Isn't it time you were lured into a prolonged, sophisticated coma? For years, Euphone has been one of the most trusted names in helping people disappear..."" And Korg have mercy if Euphone doesn't deliver the numbness you seek on this not-quite full-length, kicking out the slow jams with characteristic anti-brio. The Lakewood is less the panacea that the band's past efforts labored to be-- rather it septuple-tasks, like one of those snack samplers your neglectful careerist mammy used to shove into your lunch sack along with a frigid helping of last night' tater tots and fish sticks. Nothing here tastes like its neighbors, as the band springboards from tone to tone and from mode to mode, isolating their own divergent strains as if unraveling their own genomes. So you get ""The Lakewood Burning Bad Boy"" whose big-drum angular-fest calls to mind a juke-joint Don Cab. All of a sudden you're struck by the quiet storm of ""Tools of Love"" whose echoing, dueling foregrounded and backgrounded keys assist the breathy vocals (can't nobody call Euphone wordless no more!) to sound like a white N.E.R.D. ""The Baldwin Wipeout"" is a show-offy solo piano nugget too retro for the album's own good, as its hyperactive Scott-Joplinisms build and then fizz. ""Homodulations"" is another vocal track (!), self-consciously juxtaposing raucous axery with disparate disco slinkiness. ""Fanfare""'s delayed sticks and gorgeous bass pirate moves from Isotope 217 to eerily duplicates Squarepusher's Budakhan Mindphone. The wailing organ on the Coltrane cover, ""Countdown"", is another prime display but points to Euphone's flaw: straight jazz overhaunts their hints at groundbreaking post-jazz. The closer, ""Passing Notes"", is a tribute to Euphone's strengths, though, as it does so much with so little. People talk about impressive power trios, but this subdued three-piece conjures a staggering amount of atmosphere, especially when rooted with only a handful of syrupy bass notes. The earth-toned, streamlined digital chaos of the packaging is fitting for this release, and hell, any band that thanks James Bond and Wilco's Leroy Bach can't be too lost. Even the pristine cloudiness of the production is dead-on. Yet one wishes Euphone would get a little more recklessly inventive like the geniuses who thought up Reese's Peanut Butter Birth Control Cups and perpendicular bowling lanes. The masterful fingerwork is a tad conventional, is all. That said, The Lakewood is a variety show put on by instrument-swapping multi-instrumentalists that plays like a feeding frenzy on depressants. I dare you to set your CD player alarm to start with this electric dandelion. You won't ever wake up.","By now you've surely seen the commercials: a slightly out-of-focus couple in Banana Republic leisure-wear wander in a corn ...

2370894,Vsnares,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a93b9d034d5c69bf3bfe/1:1/w_160/6bc50602.gif,2002-09-18 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8440-2370894/,Planet ¬µ,"Mere months after dropping Higgins Ultra Low Track Glue Funk Hits 1972-2006 on Planet \xB5, Aaron Funk strikes again with this little slice of audio lobotomy. Released under the moniker Vsnares, 2370894 is, in many ways, an homage to the prevailing sounds of British experimental electronic music (which could mean a whole shitload of things, really-- I'm thinking Skam, v/vm, Rephlex, etc). The album is comprised of tracks both unreleased and left over from the sessions for other Venetian Snares releases, and is a slight detour from Aaron's usual speedbreaks assault. The dark atmospherics and menace of Printf or Doll Doll Doll has been traded for a more playful, loose vibe, but despite this being an odds-and-sods sort of album, it's amazingly cohesive, and far from your standard tossed-off amalgam of half-baked leftovers. ""Fuck Toronto Jungle"" and ""Sybian Rock"" come the closest to revisiting the established Venetian Snares sound (something like: ""See that Amen break? Stick a firecracker up its ass, it's hilarious. Okay, now eat it""). With their oddly timed, warp-speed rhythmic structures, and breakbeats more sliced and diced than cucumbers on ""Iron Chef"", both tracks are remainders from previous Snares endeavors (Higgins and Making Orange Things, respectively). ""Ornamental Grape Bone"", while managing to out-shit the Shitfuckers EP in terms of rhythmic complexity, doesn't seem fully formed, coming off instead as a rough sketch study of Funk's break-neck loop editing. But that's all that's needed, really-- Funk has already proven himself a master of that particular aural domain. And for the rest of 2370894, the mission statement seems to be: what's so hard about that? Imagine if Rephlex and Warp Records picked up and relocated to Saskatchewan. The artist himself describes his track ""Twisting Ligneous"", a number straight out of Tom Jenkinson's closet, as ""Lee Perry forcing Stockhausen and Squarepusher to do it at gun point while giving them gasoline enemas."" Premium, no unleaded, and the raga dub interlude is the cherry on top. ""Happy Morning Condom Factory"" takes off midway through with a chiming analog melody set to stuttering drum-n-bass that would make Aphex Twin proud. Hell, doesn't the title of the final track, a graceful, Selected Ambient Works-inspired slice of lazy heaven called ""British IDM Presets Fanfare (The Hawaiian Hockey Song)"" spell it out? Are ice hockey and cricket the new peanut butter and jelly? If Boards of Canada are coming to tea, they're gonna end up on a meat hook for sure. Despite all the references and italics, 2370894 can be judged on its own merits as well. Aside from the borrowing and lending, there are sounds here that are pure Vsnares inventions. ""Nobody Really Understands Anybody"" blends a strange ambient wash with random kick and high hat stabs, culminating in the addition of (and someone check this for me) a crooning, echo-laden Morrissey snippet. ""We Are Cesspools"" is listening to an orchestral jazz number on a ketamine binge, and the 8-bit hip-hop of ""Stamina (ft. Cex) (Instrumental)"" is a fresh take, eschewing the styles of many American glitch-hoppers with a more basic, stripped-down approach: electro-inspired breaks and strings that sound ripped from Requiem for a Dream. The fact that I didn't have to listen to Cex's lame rhymes only made it sweeter. So, yeah, there's lots of good stuff here. However, 2370894 still isn't up there with releases like Shitfuckers or Printf-- and most of the tracks lack the instant punch of ""Breakbeat Malaria"" or ""Skelechairs"". Still, this album is more than the sum of its parts. It's a peek at Venetian Snares on the weekend, messing around with new approaches to his sound, drinking some beers, watching TV. It's like paging through a Chris Ware sketchbook: even the rough shit is still amazing.",,8.0,
Front End Lifter,Yohimbe Brothers,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab075e6ef959693216b2/1:1/w_160/fd282e38.gif,2002-09-18 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8879-front-end-lifter/,AtlanticRopeadope,"In the liner notes to Front End Lifter, a collaboration between buzz-bin has-been Vernon Reid and Rope-a-Dope Records founder DJ logic, it actually says: ""DJ Logic is managing to continually elevate the art of turntablism."" Your reaction to that statement depends only partially on whether or not you've listened to the album first. And if you have already listened to all 56 minutes and 14 seconds of Front End Lifter, I can assure you that your reaction will be hitting the garbage can on a quest for the golden receipt. Logic doesn't so much elevate the art of turntablism as put it in Velcro shoes and stick it on the short bus. Yeah, yeah, Combustication was pretty good, sure. But have you ever heard his Day and Night cassettes? Jesus! This all goes double for Reid, and the rest of Living Colour, who all appear here in various supporting roles. It's obvious that Reid and Logic are aware of current alternative musical trends; the pseudo funk and hip-hop hybridization of ""6996-club-yohimbe"", for example, is sure as hell looking towards the West Coast whilst French-tickling the bling-bling sounds of Power 99 FM for inspiration. Problem is, it's so overloaded with half-assed rhymes (courtesy of Prince Paul and Slick Rick, among others) that the funk is utterly smothered. So yes, the Yohimbe Brothers are aware of other genres. But knowing Italian is a whole lot different than speaking the shit, know what I mean? Reid and Logic are two tongue-tied pseudo-hip motherfuckers. Reid was playing guitar on records as early as 1981, but you'd be hard-pressed to hear anything beyond mediocre here. ""Prelude to a Diss"" (did they know?) is shiftless textural noodling. For all of its Bela Fleck influences, ""Bamalamb"" proves that Logic was able to garner nothing from his guest appearances with Fleck, something that doesn't help Reid, who ties up a struggling beatbox rhythm with more useless riffing than all two hours of ""Alternative Nation"". The harmonica and violin are like two white kids jamming on Tom Petty on the sidewalks of Harlem: sore thumbs all around. And the opener, ""Ponk"", is the worst of the lot, a needless mishmash of badly mixed rock 'n' roll noise that isn't fit to lick Buckethead's middle finger. Kicking off with a fairly boring rock instrumental on a record that purports to feature music that ""may cause extreme sexual excitability"" (it really says that) and asks us not to complain about the record unless we can explain it is like painting a target on your ass. So allow me: Dear Yohimbe Brothers,
I can explain it: it's lame, you dumb shits. ","In the liner notes to Front End Lifter, a collaboration between buzz-bin has-been Vernon Reid and Rope-a-Dope Records founder DJ ...

Sha Sha,Ben Kweller,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc17ea9e61561daa73c1/1:1/w_160/9df843de.jpg,2002-09-18 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4552-sha-sha/,RCAATO,"Welcome to the Hall of Bens, young master Kweller. We've had our eyes on you for some time now, and, with the release of your debut album, Sha Sha, we felt it was time to invite you up for a private tour. At this point in time it's far too early to tell whether you'll one day earn the privilege of enshrinement into our hallowed halls, but we hope that some time in the presence of your fellow Benjamins will help you along the route towards feats as notable as those of your namely peers. Benjamin, in the Holy Bible (and Andrew Lloyd Weber's delightful hit musical), was the youngest and favorite son of Jacob, and here at the Hall of Bens, we honor all of those who accomplish greatness or public notice while sporting such an esteemed name. From Benjamin Franklin, our nation's first great scientist, to Ben Kingsley, acclaimed actor, to Ben Ali, owner/founder of D.C. landmark Ben's Chili Bowl (13th and U St., folks, don't miss it!). Ah, but I see your interest is naturally drawn by the Musician's Wing. Let us enter, and explore your ties to famous rock Bens of the recent past. Ben Lee: Funny you should stop here, as you remind me a lot of Mr Lee. Like you, young Ben was a precocious indie popster, earning attention far beyond his age and, some say, his talent. Lee rose to fame with his Australian outfit Noise Addict before making a number of barely noticed solo records. You earned a certain 10-watt glow of fame with Texas power-pop act Radish, and are now releasing the notorious solo major label debut after some cultish tiny recordings. Lee could claim friendship with the Beastie Boys and was signed under their Grand Royal imprint; you, if your liner-note thank yous are to be believed, are pals with the Moldy Peaches and Wilco. Need I go on? Make a note: slow down the hype train while there's still time. Ben Folds: Indeed, one of the more polarizing figures in 90s indie circles. Some enjoyed the NC native's tongue-firmly-in-cheek update of 70s Billy Joel piano rock; others found it too thick with irony. It's pretty clear from Sha Sha which camp you throw your loyalties behind; in fact, it's clear from the opening track, ""How It Should Be"", built around a hard-fisted piano progression and winkingly detached nonsense pop syllables. A handful of other Foldsian influences reveal themselves on your record, like ""Falling"" or the centerpiece ""In Other Words"", both of which run from tangent to schlocky schmaltz not unlike a good chunk of the BF5 catalog. Kudos to you, young sir, for balancing out the latter epic's showstopping coda with some well-utilized steel guitar and banjo, allowing for a sideswipe near miss of the syrup tanker truck. Remember what you've learned and you will avoid the mistakes of your predecessors. Ben ""Rivers"" Cuomo: Few people know that Weezer CEO Cuomo is not 'Rivers' by birth, but rather something of a self-loathing Benjamin. Few people know this because it is a complete fabrication. Nevertheless, you leave me no other choice but to mention his name, as every time you pick up a guitar on Sha Sha his thick-bespectacled visage is brought to mind. Do not worry, many have worked at Weezer forgery since 1994, and your work is among the better third. In fact, one could probably make an EP out of ""Wasted and Ready"", ""Commerce, TX"", ""Harriet's Got a Song"", and ""No Reason"", and make a small killing passing it off as the lost transition between Pinkerton and The Green Album on eBay. You've got Cuomo's self-deprecation addiction down perfectly (""I'm maxed out like a credit card,"" from ""Wasted and Ready"") and the timeless-melodies-meeting-overdrive-crunch formula is as good as recent Weezer, if not their golden age. But this leads me to my most valuable piece of advice: you must find your own voice, young Kweller, and rely less on the Benjamins who have come before you. I'm quite positive you've got it in you: it shows on ""Lizzy"", a rare, stripped-down folk-arranged ditty that puts aside the clever detachment for a rather touching Kodak moment. Right now your slightly-too-frequent derivative moments can be mostly forgiven thanks to heaping helpings of youthful earnestness, but I know you can be more than just a ""Recommended If You Like..."" cross-reference. We'll keep a spot open for you, my boy, now go do your fellow Bens proud!","Welcome to the Hall of Bens, young master Kweller. We've had our eyes on you for some time now ...

Zoomer,Schneider TM,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3779d034d5c69bf2e1b/1:1/w_160/a8952fbb.gif,2002-09-18 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7027-zoomer/,MuteCity Slang,"In 2000, Schneider TM (given name: Dirk Dresselhaus) released an EP called Binokular in collaboration with associate KPT.michi.gan. The record was solid straight through, but it received notice primarily because it contained a cover of The Smiths' classic ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out,"" re-titled ""The Light 3000"" and given a serious digital makeover, complete with robotic voices and squishy programming. Two years on, it's clear that ""The Light 3000"" will be seen as something of a landmark in the small, cloistered world of IDM. This clever cover essentially expanded the emotional range of the genre, showing that quirky, abstract electronic production could be integrated seamlessly into a pop context. By dressing up a familiar tune in vibrant electronic tones, Schneider TM showed that glitchy electronic pop could evoke nostalgia, express sadness and longing, and give the head-nodding set something to sing along to. Zoomer, Schneider TM's second full-length after 1998's Moist, finds Dresselhaus moving further along the pop path. His vocals are featured prominently on over half the tracks, sometimes sans-processing. The first thing that came to mind when I heard Zoomer is that this is the album Air could have made after Moon Safari if they'd traded in the analog gear for a Powerbook and forgotten about rock entirely. There's a kind of folksy lounginess to the melodies and arrangements here reminiscent of the French band; I believe it's the same sort of vibe that compels Air to work with Beck. But while the tunes draw from tradition, the underlying production is pure Third Millennium Germany, the sort of warm, squelchy machine music birthed by Mouse on Mars on Vulvaland and gestated throughout the 90s by kindred spirits at the A-Musik label. It's an electronic sound made for pop, as anyone who's heard Yamo (the collaboration between Wolfgang Flur and Mouse on Mars) can attest, but here it's given an even more song-oriented context, and it works beautifully. The proper songs are front-loaded on Zoomer. Of the first five tracks, one is heavily processed robotic folk (""Reality Check""), one is a sun-kissed feature for harmony vocals (""Frogtoise""), one is a jazzy croon that reminds me of The Sea & Cake (""Abyss""), one is a smiling, upbeat track that sounds like something on Nobukazu Takemura's Childisc (""DJ Guy""), and one is a surprisingly funky rap that owes a lot to UK Garage (""Turn On"", with vocals by Max Turner). After that, two instrumentals follow, thick with the glow of harmonic distortion, bubbling over with cracks and pops, and generally making a fine racket. The downcast ""Cuba TM"" ends the album on a similar note to the opener, but with busier digital production and a more melancholy feel. Zoomer is a very, very good album, but one thing it makes clear is that the songwriting aspect of this sort of lap[pop] hybrid must continue to improve. I haven't quoted any lyrics here because they're just not that memorable, and while the tunes themselves are always good, another listen to ""The Light 3000"" makes clear that Dresselhaus is far cry from Johnny Marr. Still, I love the direction Schneider TM seems to be moving in with Zoomer. When you've been listening to a lot of abstract electronic music and you're hoping for a bit more melody, this is exactly what you want to hear.","In 2000, Schneider TM (given name: Dirk Dresselhaus) released an EP called Binokular in collaboration with associate KPT.michi.gan ...

Hostile Ambient Takeover,Melvins,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c42813d197565213bebe/1:1/w_160/4243b08b.jpg,2002-09-17 05:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5220-hostile-ambient-takeover/,Ipecac,"Hostile Ambient Takeover was released a mere two weeks after Mike Patton issued Fant√¥mas' entirely non-transcendent convergence with the Melvins, Millennium Monsterwork, on his Ipecac label. My guess is that he wanted to set things straight by giving the band another show. And so, Aberdeen's own unleashed their seventeenth record (fifth with Patton's young freak organization)-- making a grand total of five albums for the band in three years. It's hard to know what's lifted the floodgate for Melvins releases in recent days, though a good guess might be that their increasing strangeness is opening new doors for their songwriting. Or maybe it's just that they now have the freedom to release as many records as they want, whenever they want. Whatever the case, on a roster with Fant√¥mas, Ruins, D√§lek, and Kid606, the Melvins' old-school molasses art-thrash seems positively quaint, if not for lack of effort on the band's part. Hostile Ambient Takeover retains the Melvins' now very familiar stone-rock pound, and Buzz Osbourne's bullfrog growl yet makes clear that having a shitload of sludge riffs and an awesome drummer can only take you so far. Furthermore, I'm not so sure that the Melvins' relatively recent flair for the overtly weird is all that great a development. Sure, Patton seems to love them, but in the 6+ minutes of ""Black Stooges"", with walls of dirty guitar, tricky time signatures and extended percussion solos, where the hell is the rock? I think it's supposed to be 'out', but it sounds too routine amongst the rest of these guys' recent material-- and the massive outro of feedback isn't funny. ""Dr. Geek"" sounds like prog-metal-rockabilly, like if Revered Horton Heat suddenly realized how cool Dream Theater was. Of course, the Melvins are supposed to be inherently cooler than either of these bands, but that just makes it all the stranger to hear them going at it like this. Similarly, ""The Brain Center at Whipples"" spends entirely too much time getting to the good riffs (takes them three minutes before the jamming truly commences), and ""Foaming"" is too much song for the one good idea it presents (in this case, the unexpected change of pace into almost pop/rock realms). It's not all depressing, though: ""The Fool, The Meddling Idiot"" is classic Melvins brainfreeze, with more broken siren guitar and super slo-mo dynamics. About two minutes in, the bottom drops out, Buzzo vomits a soliloquy of unintelligible atrocities, and before you know it, the band's right there shitting along with him. Just as the mud threatens to swallow you whole, the song transforms into something like a slow-grind piano ballad-- out of nowhere, the Melvins are playing the soundtrack to some 80s slow jam. And then, for no discernable reason, Clover lays down a quick indie-funk beat. Now that's eclecticism! But in the end, Hostile Ambient Takeover's best moment is its shortest: ""Little Judas Chongo"" presses all the right hard buttons in only two minutes, suggesting that these guys still know how to grab hold of your balls in a pinch. Skip Hostile Ambient Takeover if you want-- it's nothing spectacular-- but just remember: one day you're going to want to rock again. The Melvins and Patton's various projects aren't always on time, but Lysol, Houdini and Stoner Witch are there as refresher courses in kicking out jams. Take them as prerequisites, and hit this in your spare time.","Hostile Ambient Takeover was released a mere two weeks after Mike Patton issued Fant\xF4mas' entirely\n\ non-transcendent convergence with ...

Howard Hello,Howard Hello,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c12dabf31b7dc715659d/1:1/w_160/8a0dc291.jpg,2002-09-17 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3939-howard-hello/,Temporary Residence,"Occasionally you come across new music that you'd rather describe by its stylistic features, by the personality it exudes and the feelings it engenders, than by conventional categories like genre. It's how 60s free jazz came to be known as 'fire music', and how the hyperkinetic flux of drum-n-bass captured the sounds of the (urban) jungle in the 1990s. The music I want to talk about takes the form of dissolution-- whether of the mental sort, typified by the just-this-short-of-collapse doodling of the Jad Fair/Daniel Johnston set; or of the musical sort, found in serialist composition's note-clusters or the recent trend towards deconstructionist remixes. In Howard Hello, we have a bit of both. Marty Anderson comes to the group from Dilute, and Wendy Allen from The Court and Spark. Kenseth Thibideau was formerly with Temporary Residence mainstays Tarentel, and also plays in Rumah Sakit and Thingy. Triangulate the trio and you might have the vaguest idea of what the band sounds like-- though it won't be entirely accurate. ""Television"" leads you on at first with sensitive acoustic guitar picking, as if this might be an album of folk ballads. But then the chords pick up speed, riffling into a blur like the experimental landscapes explored by John Fahey. As the tangents diverge, a sample of found sound enters the piece, with crowd murmur and the whine of vehicle brakes. A steel drum or Hawaiian guitar burbles in the background, strangely haunting. The second track, ""Belief"", offers a more official statement of intent. Wendy Allen's angelic vocals sigh into the sustained waves of an organ, rising and falling together. The guitar spills outwards from underneath in a series of crystalline, toy-like figures. After these euphoric moments, ""Revolution"" darkens the mood. A bluesy, minor key intro gets swept up by an undercurrent of distortion, continually shifting in and out of pitch. Over this eerie backdrop Marty Anderson coos his creepy rasp of a voice, sounding more female than male, like Lydia Lunch on Quaaludes. ""The only way out of here is in,"" he insists over and over, as the fraying feedback pries apart the rhythm. What follows are a number of revisions of the three previous themes. ""America"" reprises ""Belief"" with ethereal arpeggios, intricate trails spun out onto the warm bassline. Though he doesn't sing on every track, Anderson comes in at the end here with another of his repeated phrases-- ""I couldn't say no."" ""Prozac"" follows as a serene meditation, full of contemplative pick-work chiming with echoing accents and chirpy phrases. Howard Hello have a way of sounding both busy and calm at the same time; you can choose to hear the slow pulse of the low registers, or get wrapped up in the scribbles of the high-end. ""Dream"" illustrates the differential with bluesy chords inflated by clouds of synthesizers, and the interplay between the two reminds me of Brian Eno and Robert Fripp's careful collaboration on Evening Star. Howard Hello have opened up a strange world here, a mesh of organic and synthesized sounds whose only apparent contemporary is Chris Rosenau's work as Collections of Colonies of Bees. Their music alternates between quiet introspection and frenetic peaks, from Marty Anderson's hushed, unhinged musings to spiraling fret streams, the musical equivalent of babbling glossolalia. They've found an effective technique in the twining of their strings: at times it sounds like the music is being torn apart by the tethers, while at others a whole range of new, microtonal bursts of sound are birthed out of the ultra-fast, frilly runs. Forty minutes pass without a hint of percussion, and you barely notice. I'm not sure what the loose social-awareness of the song titles is supposed to mean, but Howard Hello offer a mysterious, intriguing escape from it all.","Occasionally you come across new music that you'd rather describe by its stylistic features, by the personality it exudes ...

Songs of Mac EP,Papa M,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fe313d1975652138252/1:1/w_160/76e01417.jpg,2002-09-17 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6155-songs-of-mac-ep/,Western Vinyl,"Being a music fanatic can shock the demon-heck out of anybody with a tendency to get too settled. My sphere of approval lodges in a nifty rut, and then the universe smacks me down. I heard ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" booming from a Hooters patio this week and dry-heaved all the way home. A bouncer forcibly ejected me and my rowdy crew from a mosh pit after Hank Williams III allowed his performance to plummet from the heights of western swing into the basin of bootleg Pantera-dom. The best hip-hop is continuing to shed the worst hip-hop's old materialist and self-assured skin, fermenting into a legitimate source of new kinds of information (perhaps this phenom is a reaction to the turn-back-the-clockness of having Bush Jr hogging the free world's mic). And don't get me started on those song-blending glitch artists, because Nurse Swanson's itching to double my meds at the slightest sign of agitation. What I'm saying is: music-geekdom of late requires Promethean elasticity. People are either becoming all-approving record-store globalists, or they're splitting into camps. A few days ago, some folks bailed from the Will Oldham listserv because they realized that electronic music now dominates their tastes, and that they're no longer excited by the predictable Drag City/alt-country banter. What I'm saying is: Dave Pajo's Papa M career is a daggum security blanket for anyone whose faith in minimalist mopeyness has been shaken by the current trend toward amplitude and velocity (be it blasting from a six-string or a drum machine). Songs of Mac-- an album of renditions of lyrics by unknowns Aubrey Rozier and Mac Finley-- wears its lethargy on its sleeve, giddily approaching a style so airy and simple that it could be labeled 'no-core'. As if acknowledging that the emptinesses between stars are the biggest in the universe, Pajo shrugs off his resume's density (Slint, Tortoise, the forthcoming Zwan) and embraces his lean years as Oldham's waltz-happy co-pilot. And let's face it, you and I, Oldham's grubby digits are all over Pajo's vocal output. The Bonnie slut either sings backup, or the songs reek of his skeeter-gothic early days-- the arrangements are spookily similar (and understandably so, since Pajo was Will's offensive coordinator back in the day). This EP's ""The Person and The Skeleton,"" with its elliptical bassline, could be an ethereal outtake from Arise, Therefore, even though the tenderly plodding piano is sub-Grubbs as far as dissonant transitions are concerned. The song slithers into your psyche with the aid of a backwards loop of weirdness and a droning, digital cricket racket. Then, just when the surreal imagery threatens to implode the thing, the song chokes on what sounds like a ringtone at the eight-minute mark. Beware the trance-factor: a friend and I drove to Astoria, Oregon to this song (hell yeah, where Goonies was filmed) and almost lulled our compact car off a ravine. ""So Warped"" is a different kind of dirge altogether-- the rare downer that transfixes and inspires, to which you could jog around town and see slo-mo layers of meaning in the ho-hum machinations of mail carriers. If you've ever been pinned on a precipice between two attentive humans, neither of which were essential, then you'll love spending six minutes with the alienated speaker of lines such as these: ""One's got my mind my and one's got my soul/ But I can't tell either of them anything I know."" And as long as you aren't bothered by how this song is almost a chord-for-chord double of Smog's ""Jar of Sand"" (from the 'Neath the Puke Tree EP), you'll find that a hearty dose of desolate, uncomplicated rue can still swat the gnats away from your life's dirty bowl of cornbread-and-milk.","Being a music fanatic can shock the demon-heck out of anybody with a tendency to get too settled.

Sprung,Andrew Duke,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba2f9d034d5c69bf53de/1:1/w_160/0fac9a43.jpg,2002-09-17 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2474-sprung/,Bip Hop,"A line from the ridiculously melodramatic but still quite enjoyable Godspeed You Black Emperor! track ""Dead Flag Blues"" goes, ""We're all trapped inside the belly of this horrible machine, and the machine is bleeding to death."" You ever wondered what it sounds like inside of this horrible machine? Not GYBE!, I'll tell you that. The guitar tone is too warm, for one thing, and what kind of hemorrhaging death trap has violins? With Sprung, Canadian techno artist Andrew Duke has crafted one possible soundtrack. Duke has been around for a while, but this album for French imprint Bip Hop is his first release to receive wide distribution outside DJ circles. Duke's m.o. is midnight black, clanging machine techno of the sort Richie Hawtin crafts when he's in the mood, and that Thomas Brinkman has perfected. Heavily inspired by the sounds of Detroit, Duke shares some of Drexciya's fascination with the techno/electro crossroads, but Duke's album is much further removed from the conventions of early hip-hop. Only the opening track, ""Hell Yeah"", is really electro proper, and here Duke remains fixated on the gloomy, mechanistic attributes of the genre, like Cybotron with a dense coat of drop-forge grime. No way a joyous b-boy could pop 'n' lock to this thing. After this opening cut, Sprung takes a much more abstract turn. Most tracks are built on a series of highly repetitive loops that morph slowly over time, the patterns incorporating scrapes, hisses, and the occasional synth flourish. The recurring mental image I get when listening is the kind of comically complex machine Wile E. Coyote used to order from Acme, with dozens of dials, pipes, cords, wheels and other assorted devices popping out in every direction. With each new track, one of these massive top-heavy devices is set spinning, and as it wheezes and wobbles in place, the machine coughs up chunks of metal, fittings loosen, and fasteners give way. The racket swells and becomes chaotic before peaking and receding again. There's no mistaking how alive these death sounds are-- due in part to Duke's feel for structure. The sense of pacing is something to behold, as the tracks on Sprung remain in a state of perpetual motion, always either building or falling apart. Despite the loop-driven nature of the composition, these tracks never seem static, and as far as albums go, Sprung certainly seems fully realized. Still, despite its merits, I have to say that it's not often that I'll want to listen to something this ice cold and bleak from start to finish. In some respects, the tension inside the music doesn't quite reach the pitch it could, since the overall mood never wavers from a punishing sense of desolation. A few shafts of light might have made the darkness blacker still. But if you're in the mood to climb into the rusty innards of that iron beast, this is your ticket.","A line from the ridiculously melodramatic but still quite enjoyable Godspeed You Black Emperor! track ""Dead Flag Blues"" goes, ""We ...

Apes of Wrath,Apes of Wrath,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0c0c0084474cd0bfc4c/1:1/w_160/e7748019.gif,2002-09-16 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/221-apes-of-wrath/,Obtuse Mule,"This isn't a music review so much as it is a warning. Apes of Wrath have undertaken to redefine the term 'niche audience'. Their music, while not abhorrent, is clearly packaged to sell a minimum number of records to the fewest number of listeners. I think they actually put a great deal of thought into this sales strategy. Why would I say such a thing? Other than me being a jackass, there are solid reasons for my conclusions. What we have here is an LP ('long-player'), but in name only. Not in practice, because in practice, this thing registers fifteen tracks and clocks in at a whopping fifteen minutes. Again: fifteen tracks, fifteen minutes. Long-player. I'll do the math for you: that's 60 seconds per song. Have you guessed the genre yet? Yes, you have, because you're smart. Sure enough, these folks play punk music-- more specifically punk of the spaz-out, hardcore variety. With a dash of 'art', in that they're incredibly fucking pretentious. Mr Neutron plays guitar. Baldo plays the fucking bass. In a questionable move, vocalist/crack addict Brad Mowen takes ownership of the project and uses his real name. Vocalist is probably the right term for Mowen's approach to making noise, one which at times sounds like a small dog's cry for help. At others it sounds like a small Glenn Danzig's cry for help. Now is the part of the review where I don't tell you anything about the songs. Check that. Here's your nugget: they all sound the same. Not to minimize Baldo or Mr Neutron's accomplishments, I will disclose the following to you: I was smiling for the larger part of this album. For one, Mowen had me in stitches, his voice spanning the full spectrum of dissonant, unintelligible nonsense. And the music, however concise, isn't all bad. It certainly has volume. And tempo. Sure, they never take the time to rock completely, but I sense that wasn't exactly the point. Fifteen tracks, fifteen minutes, long-player. Not much more to this disc than that. I imagine your choice will be about as simple.","This isn't a music review so much as it is a warning. Apes of Wrath have undertaken to redefine ...

Hitting the Ground,Gordon Gano,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929beebeb335119a49ed137/1:1/w_160/879d5c42.gif,2002-09-16 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3394-hitting-the-ground/,Instinct,"The urgency of youth is not something to be trifled with. The Violent Femmes knew this, and with their 1983 self-titled debut, they tapped into that brutal life-or-death urgency that surrounds all the frantic milestones of teendom-- cars, peers, and the anatomic wonders of biodiversity. Maybe it all seems trivial (or at least somewhat diminished) in hindsight, but to someone just finding his or her legs as an adult, few things are more desirable. Other bands were competent to discuss these dilemmas at arm's length, but Gordon Gano's empathetic tales embraced them with an angstful revelry. As the frontman for the Femmes, he personified an anxiety attack; his jittery uncertainty was the sound of a man unraveling himself over a boy's problems. And it wasn't merely that Gano could relate-- if anything, he seemed like he had it worse. Well, nearly twenty years after the dizzying highs (not heights, trust me) of the Violent Femmes' career, Gordon has finally hit the ground. The concept behind this new record is stunningly simple: Gano has penned a couple of tunes for some of the musicians he's come to admire over the years, and they've agreed to sing them. Big names, too! Frank Black, PJ Harvey, They Might Be Giants... Look! John Cale sings right before Lou Reed-- that's almost like a Velvet Underground reunion! Now, surely, this all sounds great in theory, but it dies in execution. And before anyone worries that I'm going to compare this record to any of the Femmes' output, don't-- no one expects a Gano solo record to live up to the music he made with a full band twenty years ago. Besides, Hitting the Ground has plenty of problems without the Femmes' legacy towering over it. Let me first be upfront, though, about the few positives: some of these songs are, in fact, dangerously entertaining. It's great to hear Lou doing his classic monotone over the broad funk riffs of ""Catch 'Em in the Act"". Hell, this song is better than just about anything he's done on his own in a decade-- ridiculously clever lyrics involving various sexual predilections (proof that these songs were written with the vocalists in mind), smooth, slicked-back guitar lines, it's all there. ""Darlin' Allison"", as performed by They Might Be Giants, is a quirky 50s-ish crooner filled with vibraphone and spacy, ethereal solos right out of ""Blue Moon"". And let's not forget the true highlight of the album, ""It's Money"", featuring Gano and Martha Wainwright. The only true duet here, this track almost recalls the easygoing bliss of latter-day Talking Heads songs like ""Radio Head"" or ""Nothing (But Flowers)"". The point is (and you probably got this a while ago), Hitting the Ground isn't without its enjoyable moments. So what's the problem, then? The problem is this: none of these tracks are all that interesting beyond a listen or two-- even the best ones get tired fast. (And suffice to say that none of these artists are at the peak of their powers anymore.) I mean, it's awesome that John Cale dropped by to sing, and Lou Reed, and all of them, but all the PJ Harveys and Frank Blacks in the world can't hide the fact that these are singularly uninspired, repetitive songs. The only thing that's selling these tracks is the star power, and that in itself is pretty offensive. And then you've got the real scary tracks-- Cale's hammy piano number ""Don't Pretend"" and Linda Perry's languid torch song ""So It Goes"" are outright embarrassing. The title track might be the lone exception-- it's not the greatest by any measure, but the unforced ease with which Gano approximates the classic sound of the Femmes gives it a nice nostalgic appeal. Subsequent listens to this one are far more rewarding than most of the other cuts, even if it's not as immediate. Which is good, too, since it's on here twice. It makes me shake my head. PJ Harvey opens with it, and Gano closes with it. Come on! This is only a 30-minute album to begin with-- does 20% of it really need to be this song? Okay, so there's no getting around it: this shit's bland. And I get the impression that Gordo himself knew it when he slapped this thing together, too, because he's clearly attempted to compensate for it with endless genre-hopping from track-to-track. In a nutshell, what I'm telling you is that this record is, at best, not too far removed from your average various artists compilation, and at worst, little more than a novelty act. Fun, perhaps, for a once-over, but after you've got this pony's single trick down, the only novelty left is seeing how quickly Hitting the Ground gathers dust.","The urgency of youth is not something to be trifled with.

Steal This Double Album,The Coup,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a67f9d034d5c69bf3552/1:1/w_160/c6e1cba8.gif,2002-09-16 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1632-steal-this-double-album/,DogdayDogday,"Although The Coup have been making their rounds in the hip-hop community since the early 90s, they didn't garner mainstream attention until after the planes crashed in the World Trade Center last September. Before 9/11, The Coup had been preparing to release their fourth album, Party Music, with the cover notoriously depicting Coup members Boots and Pam the Funkstress standing in front of an exploding World Trade Center with a mock detonator in hand. That eerily prophetic album cover, and the subsequent press coverage that followed, bolstered The Coup's renown and provided a fitting metaphor for 9/11: America ignores voices of dissent until they become a threat. Now that The Coup has the attention of the public and the FBI, FOAD records has decided to reissue The Coup's '98 classic Steal This Album with an additional disc of live material. If you already own this album, you won't have much use for the reissue; the live disc is nice, but definitely not worth the extra dough. If, however, you are one of the unfortunate many who have yet to unearth this jewel, read on and discover for yourself the Communist-coated splendors of Oakland's finest. The scorching and west-coast-funky ""The Shipment"" kicks the album off with a harmonica-laced beat that'll leave you shaking your ass and lighting a Molotov Cocktail. If Karl Marx had this much funk and charisma, we'd have toasted those bourgeois fucks decades ago! ""Exhilarating,"" Boots declares in an elastic flow that winds around a juicy bassline, ""I accuse you of nigga hating/ And exploitating for profit making/ Don't cop a plea cause I'm B double-O T from the C O U to the P."" The best thing about Boots is that he doesn't sacrifice his clever wordplay and indelible flow in order to fit in his rather heady political concepts. How many emcees could pull off rhyming ""macrobiotic chemical colonic"" with ""political symphonic lyrical narcotic"" and not sound like a complete asshole? But for Boots it's a seamless and natural progression. As the track fades out, Coup DJ Pam the Funkstress, who plays Engel to Boots' Marx, cuts up Prince singing ""thank you for a funky time."" This is a certified banger that may be one of the greatest kick-off tracks eva. Fortunately, this is not the album's highlight; that distinction belongs to the next track, ""Me and Jesus the Pimp in a '79 Grenada Last Night"". The song is a narrative about a pimp named Jesus who, after spending 15 years in the slammer, finds himself face-to-face with the son of a prostitute he'd killed decades before. Boots spares no details as he dissects the myth of the heroic pimp that hip-hop has long perpetuated. While the song's veiled social commentary is on point, the secret to the song's success is Boot's penchant for laying down evocative imagery in his rhymes. In the song's third verse, he observes how ""the red and white lights as the ambulance flies/ Reminds me of midnight in a dopefiend's eyes."" Goddamn! On the skit ""Pizza Man"", Hiero hero Del the Funky Homosapien plays a repo man who disguises himself as a pizza delivery boy in order to enter an old lady's apartment and repossess her TV. The skit segues into ""The Repo Man Sings for You"" (also featuring Del), which is a sequel of sorts to ""Repo Man"" from the Coup's previous album Genocide and Juice. As you could probably have guessed, Boots and Del have no love for this ""agent working for the man"" whose ""manuscript[s] say you owe him for this land."" In the song, Boots is victorious as he chases the repo man away, but a twinge of melancholy lingers as Boots implicitly acknowledges the inescapable nature of modern poverty. As witnessed in this song, Boots' ability to situate his political ideology in everyday situations is what distinguishes him from other neo-Marxist emcees. He never dips into the overly didactic, and he's quick to insert humor into the songs whenever possible. While the aforementioned tracks are the ones that may initially stand out, the entire album rocks harder than a detonated dirty bomb. A live band provides the instrumentation throughout, and Pam the Funkstress really shines on the 1s and 2s. What's even more incredible about this album is how repeated listens bring out the nuances of Boots' politics and humor. The only qualm I have with Steal This Double Album is the live album which, while pretty fresh, doesn't quite justify repurchasing the CD. But if you don't already own this classic, you need to cop this now. Even if you're the sort that's put off by the album's anti-imperialism rhetoric, the skills on display here will have you seeing red-colored stars for days.","Although The Coup have been making their rounds in the hip-hop community since the early 90s, they didn't garner ...

The Bright Side,Kilowatthours,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a14b9d034d5c69bf2918/1:1/w_160/1e2ee59a.jpg,2002-09-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4428-the-bright-side/,Temporary Residence,"To call Kilowatthours' sound 'lush', as many have, is like poking holes in a refrigerator box, crawling inside and calling it a planetarium. Their shoegazing emo (shoe-mo?) goes far with basic instruments: on their second full-length, The Bright Side, their texture-focused mix of lo-fi keyboards and smearing guitars is rich, but more rough and spontaneous than polished and perfected. The band's latest line-up includes Chris Renn on guitar and barely audible, somewhat weak vocals; Ben Lord on drums; and Dan Benningfield on keyboards and piano. Thanks in part to producer Trevor Kampmann (aka hollAnd), the recording sounds loose even though considerable work must have gone into the arrangements. Renn and Lord lumber with effective repetitiveness while Benningfield layers in color-- from the vibrant, skyward-looking organ on ""Welcome to Orlando"" to the splurting synths on ""Completely Normal"". Transcendent at one turn and slogging drearily the next, Kilowatthours have impressive dynamics. If there's one thing they've nailed, it's going from quiet to loud to quiet again with the proper sense of drama. On ""Almost Airtight"", the album's most powerful track, the luminous intro sets up Renn and ex-member Ryan Compton to go supernova through the power-chord-bedecked bridge; then they shift down to quiet again, a few idle string plucks walking us into a sparse, jagged outro. And the concise instrumental ""Dancers and Acrobats"" rolls through a simple, pretty keyboard riff and Lord's intermittent bashing. But for all the style, The Bright Side falls short on substance. There's a lack of tautness and hookiness to the material that makes it bleed together; few of the pieces aim higher than 'likeable'. Though most of the tracks have vocals, Renn's voice is buried by the mix. And while this kind of indistinct singing may be a legitimate shoe-mo tactic, it doesn't make the album any stronger. The subtle melodies only occasionally break out of the clouds, and the shambling performance that sounds so fresh on the 'big' numbers can turn into sludge on the slower ones; and with so many rich instrumentals, quaint songs like ""The Only Good Thing About Pollution"" just drift off into space. Which is a shame, because stronger writing could have made this a gripping record, and not just a gorgeous one.","To call Kilowatthours' sound 'lush', as many have, is like poking holes in a refrigerator box, crawling inside and calling ...

Millennium Monsterwork,The Fant√¥mas Melvins Big Band,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd48ea9e61561daa768f/1:1/w_160/f7597496.gif,2002-09-15 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2987-millennium-monsterwork/,Ipecac,"Mike Patton is running for president. He's going to get John Zorn to be his Secretary of State, the Melvins to be his army and Dave Lombardo to kick the shit out of all the people who didn't vote for him. He's also going to slowly gather all his other fave pals and give them cush jobs at the Ipecac Centre for Intellect and Freak Metal-- and all of this in the name of balancing karma in an oh-so homogenized world. Unfortunately, it's not as easy as it sounds; President Patton can't deliver quality freak metal just by snapping his fingers. Just like other idealistic young over-achievers (Zorn, Makoto Kawabata of Acid Mothers Temple), his desire to break through the paltry provisions afforded most new music only means that he'll get an A for effort, if not necessarily for output. Alas, Patton will never be president. Though if this record is any indication, it's just as well. Millennium Monsterwork is one of the more surprising disappointments I've heard this year. Theoretically, a meeting of last century's most notorious sludge thrashers and one the most promising groups bringing experimental metal into the new century should be guaranteed goes-to-11 gold. Wrong. The ""Big Band"" runs through a repertoire of Melvins tunes and songs from Fant√¥mas' most recent release, The Director's Cut. But the problem here isn't the material; it's the execution. Chiefly, despite a valiant effort by the principal players, the sound is so muddy that it's almost as if it was recorded by an audience member; what energy there might have been is strangled into second-hand perfunctory 'wackiness' and indistinct bashing. Even the audience sounds worn out from the tedium by the time this disc clocks out. The concert starts with the guitar warning sirens of ""Good Morning Slaves"" and seems poised to takeoff, only to run headfirst into a monolithic wall of cloudy drums (a serious offense when Dave Lombardo and Dale Crover are on the thrones) and annoyingly non-essential Patton (as he seems throughout) accents. Even the good stuff, like the potentially intense rave-up ""Ol' Black Stooges"" and the spooky, just-experimental-enough-to-be-interesting ""Me and the Flamer"" are stripped of much-needed fire by the bootleg ambience. It's probably unfair to lay all the blame on Patton for this record, though it's very tempting because: 1) it came out on his label (more than a year after the actual show, I might add-- when the most noteworthy thing about a performance is its date, is an album really required?) and Faith No More pension aside, I wouldn't figure he has lots of room for non-essential discs; and 2) it takes some doing to turn a show with Fant√¥mas and Melvins into something so, well, lame. Studio records and boots will have to do until the next round, which will hopefully include a better mix and something to keep Patton busy.",,4.9,
Remission,Mastodon,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3d469fc7814a47cd73a/1:1/w_160/addb6661.jpg,2002-09-15 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5142-remission/,Relapse,"Mastodon seems like a kickass metal name until you realize that the now-extinct American Mastodon was a hell of a lot like a manatee with legs. A member of the Proboscidea family (like its cousin the Wooly Mammoth), the mastodon stood almost ten feet tall and weighed in at roughly five tons-- surely a big beast by any measure. Lacking the killer instinct of its contemporaries, the Sabre-Toothed tiger and the Pterodactyl, the American Mastodon was content to browse, trolling the plains for tasty morsels of shrub. If you look at artist renderings, most paleontologists seem to think the good-natured Mastodon even enjoyed smiling! But as meek and mild as this beast was, its placid demeanor and limited diet-range rated low on Darwin's survival scale, and it thus perished once and for all in 800 A.D. The implications may be benign, but it remains that the name 'Mastodon' still sounds pretty badass-- certainly more badass than 'Manatee'. And I suppose it imports a metaphor that fits quite nicely for the band Mastodon, an Atlanta, GA-based quartet that has heavy-music lovers everywhere shitting themselves naked. For, like their namesake, this Mastodon represents something utterly imposing, primeval and oppressively heavy. Mastodon, like pioneering heavy acts Botch, Isis, Converge and Dillinger Escape Plan, prefer to mix their metal with some hardcore, albeit with the strong emphasis on the 'metal' part. The others place a premium on virtuoso musicianship and highly technical song structures, and while that also figures prominently into Mastodon's music, these boys slather it all up in a special sauce that I like to refer to as 'classic sauce.' I'd like to give the credit for this sauce to heavy music √ºber-producer Matt Bayles (Isis, Botch, Blood Brothers), but who really knows the sauce-source? What the hell am I talking about? I explain: I'm talking about the tight-jeans, Dodge Hemi, ""Starsky & Hutch"" production quality, that's what-- the perfect complement to the prehistoric riffing featured all album long. The recording sounds deliberately rustic and antiqued, like that milk-stained fake money you'd buy at the museum. (Admit it: you loved that shit.) But production is not what prods Mastodon. What stimulates this band's formidable corpus are four super-proficient veteran musicians, two of whom (guitarist Bill Kelliher and drummer Brann Dailor) cut their tusks in Today Is the Day and Lethargy. It's Dailor, though, who takes home the MVP award on Remission; if drummers are action figures, Dailor carries both a rapid-fire uzi (the toms) and an erase-all, double-barreled bazooka (dual-bass drums). I guarantee, he will brutalize you. Like their metal peers, Mastodon sport some mathematics. But where Meshuggah get deep into calculus and Dillinger Escape Plan prefer trigonometry, these guys enjoy the more accessible stuff-- we're talking pre-algebra here. They drop in just enough to keep the arrangements flavorful, but not so much as to overload the vintage guitar riffs with Dream Theater-like complexity. And then they counterbalance it with some nice, old-fashioned, Sabbath-style metal attitude: guitars crunch, wail, and burn. The complete package sounds timeless, but in that unbelievable way that you've never heard before. Maybe there exists a parallel world where the mighty mastodon kept on walking. And maybe, just maybe, that mastodon met a sabre-toothed tiger and maybe they had kids (work with me here). And those kids crossed over into our world, became human beings, moved to Atlanta, and formed a band. A great band whose raging, sodden hellfire now beckons you to warm yourself at its side throughout the impending winter months. A band whose crushing, odiferous, sodomizing blade dices like a Popeil cuisinart and runs you through with gruesome exactness until you beg for Remission. This band is Mastadon.

Avanti,G-Man (aka Gez Varley),by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bed3abf31b7dc71561e1/1:1/w_160/0c8a3400.gif,2002-09-12 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3370-avanti/,Force Inc,"Gez Varley's second album for the Germanically austere techno label, Force Inc, is as solid a collection as his previous, Bayou Paradis. Though released under Varley's G-Man moniker, Avanti follows the same pattern as Bayou Paradis-- clinical machine funk for purists. Varley's G-Man pose came to prominence with Quo Vadis, the lead track on 1995's G-Man EP. Seven years ago, Quo Vadis sounded to be way ahead of its time. I found the sparse hypnotic moves that Varley performed to be coolly uncomfortable next to my daily rinse-out with Underworld's Dubnobasswithmyheadman and Autechre's Tri Repetae++. Quo Vadis was dancefloor functionality at its apogee; its form unmistakably followed its function. Varley intended to provide rudimentary syncopation and Quo Vadis delivered in an immediately satisfying rush that Richie Hawtin's far brainier Plastikman releases couldn't. Capitalizing on the demand and kudos for Quo Vadis, Varley's G-Man released the full-length Kushti (London slang for 'alright' or 'okay'). He roped in former Hawtin collaborator Mark Gage to sequence two hours' worth of new and previously released EP tracks into two half-hour long tracks (or 'zones', as the sleevenotes called them). At the time, Kushti was the benchmark for minimal techno. Then came microhouse. Avanti, like Varley's previous release, Bayou Paradis, conspicuously neglects microhouse, the style for which Force Inc has become renowned. This neglecting of current trends makes Avanti sounds either dated or ageless, depending on how charitable a mood you're in. The steely ""Lollipop"" hovers like Vapourspace's ""Gravitational Arc of Ten"" mixed with the furrowing drones of Spiritual High's ""Up!"". ""Lime (Face)"" pulses like a electrocardiogram and ""K.7"" (here remixed by microhouse champs MRI) glowers like a petulant and ignored catwalk queen. With a smattering of granulated echoes and chromium flashes, ""Azur"" connects the listener with the characteristic grit of Berlin's Basic Channel. But to prevent the cut from becoming a soundtrack to a po-faced art installation, Varley stirs get-downs with an irresistible late-80s Chicago jackin' baseline. ""Franz Blau"" reinforces my conviction that Varley has never once lost the funk, as an infectiously syncopated and mutated cowbell keeps my ass moving despite the song's heavy, whooshing ambience. ""Pistazie"" contains more electroclash-friendly blips and Linn Drum snap claps than an entire night out with Fischerspooner-- but perilous as that sounds, with a solid grounding in the redemptive power of pure Detroit techno, ""Pistazie"" never succumbs to imitating Soft Cell. Elsewhere, Varley comes closest to his LFO past with the industrial clank of ""Grape""-- though even that mechanical sound is mitigated by his application of a delicate sheen over the abrasions. Though offering no innovation or head-turning, ear-bending moments, Avanti is unmistakably an album created by a master of the style. Varley is one of the foremost producers of pure techno. And while his pioneering days may be over, Avanti proves that he's not lost his gift for making soulless machines resonant with approximate humanity. It has, however, taken me many listen to get over lamenting Varley's lack of experimentation-- I doubt he'll ever try his hand at Detroit-inflected ragatech, which is a crying shame. But I now look to the positive aspect: Avanti also demonstrates that Varley seems unlikely to descend into nu-jazz broken beat hideousness.","Gez Varley's second album for the Germanically austere techno label, Force Inc, is as solid a collection as his ...

The Wigmaker in Eighteenth Century Williamsburg,To Live and Shave in L.A.,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7c1c0084474cd0c0c83/1:1/w_160/b971c415.gif,2002-09-12 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8078-the-wigmaker-in-eighteenth-century-williamsburg/,Menlo Park,"Replay value is commonly accepted by music critics to be one of the primary qualities of a great record. By this logic, if you can't see yourself listening to an album, say, six months down the line, it may be a 'good' album you have on your hands, but not a great one, not transcendent, not a classic. I have a problem with this yardstick because many of my favorite works of non-musical art have little 'replay value,' so to speak. Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev is probably my all-time favorite film, but I just don't have what it takes to watch it more than maybe once or twice a year. Likewise, Hans Holbein's painting The Body of the Dead Christ in the Tomb is one of the most affecting works of art I've ever seen. I have no doubt of its greatness, but it's not something I'd want hanging in my living room. I'm not saying that all art forms should be judged by the exact same criteria-- but why should replay value be so important when it comes to music? Sure, everyone wants the most mileage for their money, but isn't there something to be said for one-time-only (or so) art kicks? With this question in mind, consider The Wigmaker in Eighteenth-Century Williamsburg from Miami-based sound-rapists To Live and Shave in L.A., a truly great album that, quite possibly, has less replay value than anything since Metal Machine Music, though the stakes with this release are considerably lower. If I ever put this double-disc set on again it's because I'm playing it for a curious friend, or I've sunk so deep into a bout with self-loathing that I want to cause irreparable damage to my nervous system. The Wigmaker sounds as if, somehow, your stereo was broken in such a way that all the radio stations on the dial jumped through the speakers all at once. Jarring electronic squalls, squealing oscillators, bass rumbling like the earth shifting underfoot, and all imaginable sorts of computer-generated sound, found sound, and salvaged radio snippets pile up and stumble over each other, stopping and starting (nearly) at random. Still, there are songs here, of sorts, albeit buried under a mountain of sonic debris. They bear brilliantly ridiculous titles like ""Nor Swollen-Bellied Comet Blown"", ""New Poem Dramatized for Lux Cudgel"", and ""Is This Good for Vulva?"". The lyrics, meanwhile, deal in psycho-sexuality, religious hallucinations and nightmarish flashbacks to A.P. American History class. Employing language that is purposefully stylized and mannered, it reads something like a perverse Lewis Carroll. Here's a sampling from ""When My Rifle Went Sour with Preposterous Headdress"": ""Shit, the house was always Nazarin vibe, cuffs/ An unknown pinfold, fringe whore, licking its lips."" Yeah, I'm mystified, too. But it makes no difference because you can't make out the words, anyway, what with all the racket going on and a vocal style that sounds like a deadpan version of Prince. All you know for sure is that whatever this guy is saying (his name is Tom Smith, by the way), he really, really means it, and this is his only way of saying it. Which is exactly why The Wigmaker is a great album. It is totally convinced of its own necessity and is complete in its absurdity. From the perplexing cover art to its utterly indigestible length, there is no wink or nudge to suggest this is an elaborate put-on, no window left open to the real world. To Live and Shave in L.A., however, does declare this album ""pre-""music, as distinguished from ""post""-this-and-that subgenre classifications. And yes, it is an absolutely pretentious concept, but I admire Smith for making a bold claim and not pussyfooting around. Plus, true or not, it adds to his completeness and conviction. In a way, he's right: once you get past its admittedly high threshold (it took me about three or four attempts to build up the fortitude to make it through more than a few songs in a row), The Wigmaker does seem to take on a certain quality of necessity and ""pre""-ness, though I'm not sure where one goes from there.

Urban Renewal Program,Various Artists,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a770b1335d7bf169905b/1:1/w_160/766149e2.jpg,2002-09-12 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1862-urban-renewal-program/,Chocolate Ind.,"Chocolate Industries is a Chicago 'undie' label whose releases run from low-key hip-hop to producer-oriented instrumental records, and this Urban Renewal Project compilation is one of many fine steps in their rise toward national status. It's also something of a big love-in with Def Jux artists and Scott Herren's Prefuse 73, whose sonic fingerprints are all over everything. Which is great, really, not only because Herren is the shit but also because he does a good job of tailoring his own sound so that it's flattering to other people's-- and because a lot of these guys could do a lot worse than to use his style as a jumping-off point for undie production in general. To wit: Urban Renewal Project even starts with a reworking of the Prefuse record's lead track-- only this time the radio chatter being cut up has local DJs talking about this very record. There's your premise: a manifesto for an implied groundswell, a myth being built of some perfect backpacker radioland of dope subway beats and bespectacled hip in gloriously unawkward harmony. Verdict forthcoming. We'll start with the MCs: feel free to scroll down if you only want to know about the Tortoise track. (Go on, I'll put it in bold so you won't miss it.) The 'dope subway beats' are courtesy of the Def Jux contributors, obviously: first up is Aesop Rock, once again doing the sarcastic tough-talk parody he does so bitingly. I'm in love with Aesop Rock, a fan-boy sentiment I hope makes it past our editor. Unfortunately, Aesop has Def Jux honcho El-P producing, and while I'll walk admiringly beside that guy's bandwagon, I can only listen to so many scrubbed-out, jacked-up beats a week: Aesop needs to stick with Blockhead, notwithstanding El-P's production on his own ""Deadlight"" being a highlight here. Chicago's own hip-hop, on the other hand, is less gritty and more vibey, all smoothed-out soul samples and sleepy flows. The notable Chicago MC on here is Diverse, last seen by this reviewer trying, unsuccessfully, to convince a crowd of indie kids to put their hands in the air. ""Wylin Out"", Chocolate Industries' bank-account single, teams him with Mos Def (as in the Mos Def who gets full-page photos of himself in The New Yorker) and Herren (who leans straightforward with his beats to accommodate)-- but for a marquee single it's actually a bit tepid. He also shows up solo, with the Chicago sound in full effect-- only there he's swallowing his words and getting disappointingly messy. I have no idea why I like Mr. Lif: he's stiff and hokey like an overenthusiastic Roman Civ lecture, and it takes a better beat than the one on ""Wanted"" to distract me from his over-literal and not-as-philosophical-as-he-thinks rhyme clunkers. I also have no idea why I'm not digging Souls of Mischief, who sound good here with RJD2 beats-- beats like little tread-wheeled robots in turtlenecks and berets-- but suddenly they sound weirdly forced about their Tribe-style mic-passing. But on to the non-MC tracks, the best of which has Miho Hatori from Cibo Matto gloriously transforming herself into the Ashanti of the Chocolate Industries world. Herren's producing once again, casting a sprawled-out soul spell like you wouldn't believe. And it sounds great-- it has a vibe, a sunny-stoop East Village feel that somehow manages to pull this entire comp together around it. It also acts as the perfect segue into the comp's other indie contribution, this one from Tortoise, as part of their surprisingly successful efforts to break around the prevailing mood of ""pfft, post-rock"" and stay fresh. It's not hip-hop, obviously, but their ""CTA"" fits the aforementioned 'vibe': John McEntire drums behind some sunny electro-tone programming, the bass comes in all sprightly, and something new emerges from the bubbly fusion bath of Standards-less dramatic groove (more shuffle and slice), and only Jeff Parker's guitar seems to have missed the memo detailing this plan. The remaining contributors face the unenviable task of competing with Prefuse in the production game, to varying levels of success. That statement excludes RJD2, who turns in the most surprising track here: a big, rocky, storm-summoning gallop with string punctuation and guitar tomfoolery. It does, however, include While, who loses, and DJ Food, whose abstracted, graffiti-themed instrumental-- something like Squarepusher in a crate-digging mood-- is engaging enough to keep one's mind off of that version of ""Radio Attack"" at the start. Caural's ""Our Solstice Walk"" is a mixed victory: sighing flutes, warm organs, and more of the rainy-day, blissed-out head-nodding that this comp is, in the end, all about. The beat bulks up into a hand-clapping shuffle even as the samples stay downtempo, and it's a beautiful groove even when it feels a bit too much like shopping in a designer boutique. The record runs out with a ten-minute appearance for that most deliberately 'progressive' undie axis, the Anticon crew: Jel and Dose-One, as Themselves, start off with signature blues-slide languor, lay in a lengthy sound experiment of rising hum and chatter, then break out into what's possibly the prettiest and most soulful thing on this comp. Which also means that it doesn't quite fit properly-- its opaque, babbling murkiness is an odd choice to close out the clean, sparkling precision of Chocolate Industries. And what such label sampler has ever been anything but a mixed bag? What amazes me here is that I'm even thinking about this as a unified record, a sturdy and potentially even important one: the Industries seem like they're trying to make a case for themselves, and they also seem to be succeeding remarkably. I can think of a lot worse things to be nodding one's head to while skimming along on Chicago trains, and so far this week I haven't remembered much I own that's significantly better for it.","Chocolate Industries is a Chicago 'undie' label whose releases run from low-key hip-hop to producer-oriented instrumental records, and this Urban ...

Your Majesty,The Anniversary,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0a69d034d5c69bf278e/1:1/w_160/9333c890.jpg,2002-09-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/198-your-majesty/,VagrantHeroes and Villains,"I'm sitting here trying to write about Your Majesty by the Anniversary, but I have an acutely sore tummy. Made five-alarm chili the other day, with three kinds of beans and many, many hot peppers. I think I used too many beans. Three songs have passed on this, the Anniversary's sophomore LP. My belly remains pierced in the throes of agony. I cry to the heavens for help, for my incontinence is more than flesh and blood can bear. But hark! In this moment of weakness, a revelation! It is no longer the nefarious beans, agents of mortal grief, which trouble my guts. My G.I. tract faces a new and daunting enemy. Its name: emo. Signed to Vagrant Records, The Anniversary is emo by default. Sharing a label with the Get Up Kids, Saves the Day and Dashboard Confessional will do that to you. But even if The Anniversary switched over to Relapse, they would, without question, still be emo-- it's in their blood. Not to mention in their lyrics (from ""The Siren Sings""): ""And tonight may never shine/ If you never open your eyes/ I keep this heart right next to mine."" This is saying nothing of their music, which, while pretending to be candy-coated pop-rock, shares all of emo's key indicators, including melodramatic vocal delivery, seamless production, and shameless overambition. Did I mention they're awfully cute? I've come to realize that this review could consist solely of lead singer Josh Berwanger's self-important and unsophisticated lyrics. To boot, from ""Husam, Husam"": ""Turn as the earth, and be free/ Weep in the well, and be free/ Drink mother's milk, and be free."" Note to reader: see supra paragraph two. Drink mother's milk and face the consequences. Honestly, there's nothing I could do to make those lyrics worse. Continuing on, from ""Peace, Pain and Regret"": ""I've known a lot of funny people/ The ones who make us laugh/ I've known a lot of lonely people/ Calling from the past."" Funny people definitely make me laugh. That's a pretty good point. As for all of these lonely people calling from the past? I have no sympathy. This is why God invented caller ID. Thanks to track nine, ""Devil on My Side"", I am now saddled with diarrhea. Like it was on purpose, they follow that up with ""Death of the King"", appropriately enough the soundtrack to diarrhea (replete with extended-moan fade-out). ""Follow the Sun"" closes the record like it's important or something. It's not, really, especially not the wild attempt at a cascading, Beatlesque vocal-varnish. What do you want, a closing paragraph? Something to wrap it all up, tie everything together? Fuck you. Don't buy this.","I'm sitting here trying to write about Your Majesty by the Anniversary, but I have an acutely sore tummy ...

3fold,Wauvenfold,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9d99d034d5c69bf3d18/1:1/w_160/894d8237.jpg,2002-09-11 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8590-3fold/,Tiger Style,"File this collection of three EPs by England's Wauvenfold in the 'it doesn't have to be original to be good' category. Noel Murphy and Tom Hill are two guys who more than likely have quite a few Warp releases in their collections, but hell, don't we all? After all, you could do a lot worse for musical inspiration than Autechre, Aphex Twin, Boards of Canada and Squarepusher. Wauvenfold draw from the techniques and textures of each of the Million Pound Quartet at various times, but the sound design never falters, and the beat programming never fails. So while you've heard something like 3fold many times before, it sounds nice to put it on again. I'm not being totally fair here, actually-- Wauvenfold have a style that rises above mere mimicry. Consistently elevating each of these fourteen tracks above the clones are the pair's ear for melody and sense of musical humor. Instead of recording and presenting their electronic music as a cryptic language informed by experimental mathematics, Wauvenfold are inclined to just kick it and have fun. So the choppy hip-hop beat of ""Stab"" is paired with an overdriven jungle-style bass tone so ridiculously fat and deep it seems silly. Barely heard above this all-encompassing bottom are some whining horrorcore synths that could be lifted from Dr. Dre's production on ""Natural Born Killaz"". ""Stab"" is first-rate cruising music. Further evidence of Wauvenfold's playful nature comes from the versions of ""Clip"" that bookend the record. The opening take is a quickie, full of goofy fish percussion, power drill hits, and what sounds like a lot of drawers being opened and closed. It all happens in such an organized and subdued fashion that, when combined with the tinkly keyboard melody, it sounds like Romper Room electronica from a school for gifted children. The closing track is ""Clip (Clopt)"", recorded live on BBC radio. The pace is quickened by 10% while Wauvenfold add all sorts of tweaks. Cartoon drum-n-bass pops back into the mix, with exaggerated bass and snare rolls, giving the track a slight whiff of genre pisstake, but then the whole thing is so melodic and fun it's easy to just stop analyzing and listen. Consistently great melodies are the other thing Wauvenfold has to offer, and here's where the BoC comparison is most apt. Tracks like ""Selenium Pulse"", ""Pixel Stitched"" and ""Slightlyoutofocus"" (is that a Boards title or what?) combine skittery electronic percussion with hazy, dreamlike keyboard melodies in a way that gets at the 'comfort in being sad' Cobain sang about all those years ago. Given its considerable virtues, it's easy to forgive 3fold's slight lack of vision. This album is so stereotypically 'IDM' it can almost make you cringe, but the uncomfortable sense of recognition is offset by the quality music.","File this collection of three EPs by England's Wauvenfold in the 'it doesn't have to be original to ...

Hold Tight the Ropes,Elk City,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc495e6ef95969322def/1:1/w_160/fab6ca14.gif,2002-09-11 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2751-hold-tight-the-ropes/,Warm,"Bands! Say no to the devil! Resist the temptation to put your chiseled, contemplative mugs on your album cover! See, otherwise, you force consumers to imagine you prepping for the photo-- trimming facial hair, arranging jewelry, symmetry-checking your collar, flossing, etc. What are the two Elk Citizens in the back supposed to be glaring at with such rock-deepness? Is there an awesome, awesome fern on display just outside our view? Are they pretending not to know about the camera, like the accident-injury lawyers whose commercials always begin all 'impromptu' while the attorney is mid-study in his library? ""Oh, sorry, hi. Have you or has someone you know been the victim of neglect?"" Meanwhile: Elk City has tweaked their special blend of 80s and 90s influences to sound like more than a murk-rock rehash. In fact, half the material on this release is downright buoyant, with half of that stuff approaching the realm of the anthemic. Hold Tight the Ropes ends up being a very diverse record, as songs linger, then burst, then echo, then leap, then recoil, then howl, then jaunt. As Peter Langland-Hassan and Renee LoBue call-and-respond, all over the place loom shades of Lou Reed paired up with the sometime-vamps of Blondie, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Mekons, Mazzy Star, and Cowboy Junkies. But: this mix often doesn't supersede its roots (or its stereo-time competition), leaving the listener with the feeling that they've just gorged on some casserole-flavored casserole. The disc gets better as it goes, revealing some interesting dynamics that, methinks, serve as testimony that this band ain't yet found itself. For example, Peter sounds a lot more sultry (without trying) than Renee (who is trying). I got more: the band is hard to take seriously when they're striking a 'serious' enraptured pose, yet when they ease up on the drama they convey legitimate emotion and urgency missing in their self-consciously emotive/urgent 'look out, world' offerings. Therefore, Hold Tight the Ropes gets much, much better toward its end, when weighty wanna-bes such as ""Once and For All"" and ""Don't Fight What You've Become"" yield to more mundane (and ironically, more effective) songs called ""Football"" and ""K-Mart"", both of which boast supernal organs, smooth percussion, and Pavement-toned fuzz-plosion solos. I'd even go as far as to say that ""Summer Song"" is a damn classic, proving that this band can have fun, as they call to mind a Bizarro-world radio-ready Sonic Youth. Elk City do their thing well, but even the ho-hum photos of their pedals and equipment remind music junkies that this stuff's been done before. I recommend this disc for those iffy days without zeniths or nadirs when you can't tell the avatars from the minions. Warning, though: anyone driven crazy by vague ""it""'s that don't modify anything had better get ready for lyrics such as ""The way it seemed to go/ It was time.""

The Remote Part,Idlewild,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1abea9e61561daa7e09/1:1/w_160/cfd456f6.jpg,2002-09-11 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4061-the-remote-part/,EMI,"I remember when people thought I was going to be the next Radiohead. From morning to night, I was tailed by writers from NME, Mojo and Uncut, who shouted questions from fast-moving vehicles about my favorite soccer players, who I was dating, and what Joy Division meant to me. I spent a day in Trafalgar Square as part of a photo spread with Coldplay's Chris Martin, Travis' Francis Healy, and Placebo's Brian Molko. Then they found out that my guitar skills never progressed beyond ""Blister in the Sun"" and my falsetto closely approximates the frequency that causes everyone within earshot to lose control of their bowels. Before you could say ""Manic Street Preachers,"" my own personal media circus had left town. So I can kinda empathize with the boys of Idlewild, who've had to deal with their own fair share of R-head comparisons and Yorkeian accusations. Never mind the fact that the Scottish quartet doesn't sound like anything Radiohead has produced since the anthemic days of The Bends; they're from the UK (Scotland, to be precise), and that's all that it takes to be thrown into a compare-and-contrast table by my limey colleagues. The superbly named Roddy Woomble and his humble bandmates don't want to change the world or open peoples' minds to foreign electronic soundscapes; they just want their songs to be used in episodes of Seventh Heaven. Because let's get right down to it: Idlewild is a radio band, writing and performing pop/rock songs that are negligibly challenging and designed to be hits. Standard Pitchfork policy says I should therefore spend the next 800 words using my considerable skills in the art of the mock, but you know, I'm not really feeling that salty today. So instead I'll dust off my trusty mainstream listening helmet... let's see, I think it's crammed under my bed here next to those Soundgarden and Oasis discs I couldn't sell back... there it is. Alright, let the popist perspective commence! Mainstream listening helmet or no, I have to admit that The Remote Part contains a lot of potential alt-rock hits, to these ears. It's one of those albums where each and every song could be a single, be it driving guitar salvos like ""A Modern Way of Letting Go"" and ""(I Am) What I Am Not"" or purty falsetto-slide ballads like ""American English"". Idlewild also has that particular shapeshifting ability to sound like a gaggle of popular bands at once, be it Sugar or Matthew Sweet in their more uppity moments, to Wheat or occasionally-- and unfortunately-- the (sigh) Goo Goo Dolls when they get all sensitive. Thing is, Idlewild are just too good at what they're doing to get out the critical brass knuckles. The Remote Part might strip away a lot of the instrumental variety of their last take-home product, 100 Broken Windows, but even that album was pretty kiddie-pool shallow when it came to experimentalism. Besides, directness suits Idlewild well, be it the taut melancholy ""I Never Wanted"", the near-Velveeta-but-not big chorus of ""Live in a Hiding Place"" or the top-down abandon of the crunchy ""Out of Routine"". Now you're probably wondering why, if I'm so high on elements of The Remote Part, the rating still resides in decidedly lukewarm point-system territory. Well, it's not a desperate indie-cred preservation move, honest. No, really. Scout's honor. The point dockage is due here because the album starts to wear thin by the homestretch, with ""Century after Century"" and ""Tell Me Ten Words"" shooting past my tolerance for drollness. Blame it on the album being more a collection of singles more than a cohesive whole, kind of like Jay-Z's The Blueprint (world's first Idlewild/Jay-Z comparison, ding!). But the fairly standard fast-song/slow-song dichotomy of the album has serious luster-degrading effects, even over its brief forty-minute runtime. The Remote Part still makes it up to the sunny side of 5.0, however, if only because a good third of the album has been stuck in my head throughout the rigorous Mitchum listening analysis. Idlewild falls into that select group of rock acts that wouldn't provoke a reflexive stab for the 'scan' button if it came on the radio, and I wouldn't be surprised if ""American English"" has already hit a few alternative-demographic playlists. Perhaps it's not an album for the more staid, discerning listener (or for those without a mainstream listening helmet), but it's a strong fort in guilty-pleasure territory for those who enjoy a few straight-up, no-frills sticky melodies now and then.","I remember when people thought I was going to be the next Radiohead.

"TKO from Tokyo 12""",Knifehandchop,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbdeabf31b7dc7155bb4/1:1/w_160/f8fc91f2.gif,2002-09-11 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4496-tko-from-tokyo-12/,Tigerbeat6,"Japanese Man: Oh heavens, what is that? Police Officer: I do not know... but don't you really wanna dance like fuck right now? And have a blunt while we're at it? Japanese Man: Yes. Hell Yes. Ladies and gentleman, Knifehandchop has awoken. Spewing raga and atomic gabber madness from the Canadian wilderness and sending the hot jams straight down the back of your throat, Knifehandchop has quietly been building towards world domination. This kid actually gave Bounty Killer cred, by mixing some of the guy's wack-ass rhymes from the Blade soundtrack into his Dhyana Records debut, ""Bounty Killer Killer,"" a track so hot it'd make your grandmother throw down on the dancefloor. And it was Knifehandchop's copyright-burning, radio smashing ""Dancemix 2000""-- a song that makes Eminem the target of a teen-princess gangbang, with samples of Pink, Destiny's Child and the sad little boy from Detroit thrown all over fuzzed-out four/four breaks and the Vengaboys-- that got recycled by Kid606 into his latest album. Knifehandchop (aka Billy Pollard) is from the same neighborhood as Venetian Snares and the Tigerbeat6 posse (Kid606, Lesser, DJ/Rupture), but probably spends most of his time inside getting high and watching BET. And writing some of the phattest boombonic tracks ever heard, too. But with so much going for him, it's sad that only about half of TKO from Tokyo, his second release on the Tigerbeat6 label, is concrete proof of it. Comprised mostly of remixes by other Tigerbeat6 artists, TKO is bland in spots and brilliant in others, exposing both the strengths and limitations of his sound over the course of seven tracks. The opener, ""'Taking the Soul Out of Music' vs 'Vertical'"", mashes up two other Knifehandchop tracks: the throaty ragamuffin rhymes of ""Vertical"" cuts seamlessly with the insane raver bounce of ""Taking the Soul Out of Music""'s air-raid siren percussion. The track is a fresh reworking of Pollard's material, and its sources fare much better than ""Bounty Killer Killer"", which is the subject of two remixes on this record's b-side. The first, by Kid606, does little more than pitch-shift and transpose the vocals, eventually slowing them to a crawl before the track peters out. The kid also lays down an interesting new drum pattern as the track opens, but it doesn't even match up to the vocals, and the whole track ends up sounding like something I wrote with Audiomulch drunk. The following remix, this one by DJ Aneurysm, works better, starting off with some jazzy hi-hats before morphing into fuzzed-out hip-hop breaks. This is Def Jux territory-- abrasive hip-hop structure with an emphasis on the noise-- but it never really takes off. Even Venetian Snares, whose contribution ""Not for the Billy"" wraps the source track's synthline around some typical Snares crack-your-spine breaks, doesn't get much done. So it's up to Knifehandchop to steer this record out of the sea and headlong into the fleeing masses. Aside from the opener, he's responsible for two other tracks. The first, a blunted remix of his newest single, ""Hooked on Ebonics"", is a-list party material. Dig that loping bassline, the bling-bling MTV catchphrases throughout, the Atari bleeps. Hell, even Ja Rule hollas on this track (that motherfucker is everywhere). It's no surprise that ""I Hate Your Fucking Face"", the second of Knifehandchop's solo cuts, sticks with the hip-hop-- Knife knows how to bend the genre to his will. Utilizing elements from the RZA's Bobby Digital in Stereo jam ""Domestic Violence"", Knifehandchop constructs a gabber piledriver that, after a few listens, sounds downright poignant. A tell-tale piano line, low in the mix, backs a looped RZA rhyme (""Your pussy ain't shit/ Your ass ain't shit/ Girl, you ain't shit"") as the drums pound it into dust. It's a standout piece, and even as the rest of the record sags and falters, it reminds you why you bought the damn thing in the first place: because Knifehandchop is fucking ace.","Japanese Man: Oh heavens, what is that?

Personally, that sounds a bit condescending to me. After all, isn't it unfair to have one set of standards for males and another for females? Another reason why this is insulting is that the qualifier isn't necessary; Jean Grae may be a little rough, but when she spits she can stand toe-to-toe with the best of 'em. Witness ""Love Song"": over a slow and slinky beat supplied by the Beatminaz's Evil Dee, Jean weaves a bittersweet tale of one-sided relationships. It's a sensitive, emotionally raw narrative that trudges through betrayal and disillusionment. ""I thought it was gold when it was only gold-plated,"" she raps at one point. When the chorus states, ""But this is still a love song,"" you're not sure whether it's victorious, resigning or both. One thing that is certain, though: the track displays an emotional honesty and complexity that's rare in any genre, and particularly underground hip-hop. Another lyrical standout on the album is ""God's Gift"", where Jean sardonically affects the voice of a misogynist male rap star. Over a string sample, she intones, ""Another day, another hustle/ You're not different/ I'm not the daddy to your children... Listen, the only position you fill is pussy gettin'."" Two interposed samples serve as the chorus, declaring, ""Bitch, play your position."" Hearing a female spit these typically misogynistic lines is both revelatory and humbling. It elevates the objectified female and gives her a voice, and then spits the offending words back at you like a dagger. This isn't the only place where Jean drops serious knowledge; the song ""Block Party"" is anything but. Over a cooing female vocal sample, Grae paints a bleak picture of asbestos-filled classrooms, virtual ghetto imprisonment, and shallow materialism. Considering everything that works on this album, I'd like to give it a higher rating than 6.9. Unfortunately, much of the album's production barely reaches mediocrity. In the liner notes, Jean acknowledges that the mixdown is horrible (due to noise-sensitive neighbors) and apologizes for it, but great albums aren't built on apologies. And even if the tracks were better mixed, a good number of her beats still wouldn't pay off. There are exceptions, but often the production is repetitive, flat, and generic. With that said, Grae shows a lot of potential. If she can tweak out her sound a bit, and put a little more effort into her flow, she'll shine for years to come.","While snooping around the Internet for some info to supplement what I already knew about Jean Grae, I kept running ...

And I don't just mean asking where the bathroom was or where I could find the nearest autobus stop-- I was full into verb tenses and could actually understand the soap operas on Telemundo (shocked when it turned out Juanita's baby was actually Raul's). This was all in high school, and years of disuse and neglect have made my Spanish skills rustier than a Gary, Indiana steel mill. My vocabulary has dwindled back down to words like 'agua', 'gato', and 'burrito', and I'm supremely frustrated looking over the tracklist on this Migala album. I know I've seen these words before, but I can't remember what most of them mean. As it turns out, I don't really have to. Perhaps as a writer it might be useful, but as a listener, it's irrelevant-- these six Spaniards make music that could crush you if you had never known any Spanish at all, and on the occasion that frontman Abel Hernandez breaks out his dusty baritone, he does it in heavily accented English for the edification of the monolingual majority in the world's largest music markets. This particular album is an odd beast from a marketing standpoint, playing like something of a best-of, as the band have taken the time to reexamine their back catalog and give some of it another go. Restos de un Incendio (Remains of a Fire, as in ""ashes""-- love those BabelFish translations) consists of songs from the band's first three full-lengths, re-recorded and rearranged by a more skillful, confident band. As a result, it's not as unified or focused as last year's stunning Arde, but it's the boldest sounding record they've yet released, and a pretty damn fine introduction to their early work. Whether they're playing instrumentals or vocal songs, Migala's music develops slowly, unfolding in ecstatic waves of sound, adding a droning accordion here, a gigantic Sergio Leone guitar there, and building each song to a beautiful climax. The unbelievably passionate guitar work of ""Aquel Incendio"", layered against a man's speaking voice that sounds recorded off the television provides what might be the single most wrenching piece of music I've heard all year. ""Tiempos de Distastre"" gathers intensity in its opening verses before finally giving way into a drenching rush of accordion, drums, cymbals, and wildly strummed guitars that effectively sweeps away all the anxiety, before returning you to the final verse, which in turn builds to another rapturous climax. The somber organs that introduce ""Intrucciones Para Dar Cuerda a un Reloj"" recall the elegant melancholy of early Tindersticks, before a man's voice intones what sound like a set of instructions in Spanish. The use of the man's clinical cadence only heightens the emotion of the band's playing, as they gently build and recede, ultimately fading out. Restos proves the men in Migala to be masters of the melancholy strain and deft tuggers of emotional strings. The only beef I've got with it is that, in maturing skillwise and revisiting their old material, the band have lost some of the sonic adventurousness that made Arde so brilliant and effective. With any luck, that'll be back on their next release, and an older, more adept Migala might even top their work on that record.

Scissorgun,Crispy Ambulance,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6a5c0084474cd0c09f1/1:1/w_160/cb5d89ca.gif,2002-09-10 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1668-scissorgun/,Darla,"It's a sad fact that reunion tours spawn reunion albums, records where bands that may well put on good oldies shows write new songs despite the fact that they have nothing new to say. Back in the early 80s, the ill-named Manchester band Crispy Ambulance made a minor splash with some singles and one album, The Plateau Phase. They were a solid second-tier band, or, to put it in perspective: they didn't make it onto the soundtrack for the period flick 24 Hour Party People, but they opened for many of the bands that did. The Ambulance were frequently dismissed as Joy Division imitators at the time, but they were also influenced by Magazine and, well, Hawkwind. Honing a post-punk style that included gothically bleak keyboards, quick-strike guitar strumming, and martial drumbeats-- plus moody interludes and atmospheric synthesizers which bought them the damning 'prog' qualifier-- the boys were signed to Factory Records, but broke up soon afterward. And now they're back with Scissorgun, their second record after a mysterious 20-year hiatus. There's only one problem: while the Manchester scene may be hot again (catch it now at the local art house!), the kids today are armed and preoccupied with boxes of reissues and new post-punk bands like... well, have you heard of this band called Interpol? They're all the rage right now, and frankly, they cop Joy Division better than Crispy Ambulance ever did-- or ever will. But that's not to say that they should be put down like a crippled horse. These guys sound even tighter and more focused than on their early work, and singer Alan Hempsall-- whether you like his voice, or find the swagger and intimations of growl off-putting-- also sounds in top form; age hasn't hurt him at all. Plus, with production by Graham Massey (808 State, Bj√∂rk), they've recorded an album that sounds genuinely alive: on ""Step Up"", the keyboards blurp and throb like lights when you're speeding through a tunnel, while the guitars crank in, dark and foreboding. ""Slip 'n slide, slip 'n slide,"" Hempsall sings warningly, as if he's telling you something important, and bell-like synths chime early-80s-style behind the verse. On the next song, album highlight ""Loupgarou"", Hempsall almost sounds giddy with the ""eeeeyyyyyowwww"" that he bellows over the generic but exciting guitar lines. After two tracks, though, there's nothing much to offer. The album can't escape the problem that felled Emerson, Lake & Palmer's Black Moon, or the one that brought down the Yes retirement fund project Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe: the new material doesn't add anything. It copies their older style, down to the last tic and gimmick; they take no risks, and most of the tracks drag. ""Parallax"" is leaden-- the catchy melody gets swamped by turgid guitars-- and the taut repetitiveness of ""Re-animator"" quickly wears thin. They churn through the same template on ""The Drop"" and ""End Game"", plus the two pointless, anticlimactic instrumentals that wrap up the album. Fans may enjoy getting exactly what they expected, but this won't have anyone reassessing the band.","It's a sad fact that reunion tours spawn reunion albums, records where bands that may well put on good ...

Songs for the Deaf,Queens of the Stone Age,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1bb13d19756521386d5/1:1/w_160/33c86983.jpg,2002-09-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6606-songs-for-the-deaf/,Interscope,"Self-proclaimed prehistoric royalty Queens of the Stone Age are back from the desert wastes of California, and they're putting the 'rock' back in 'blowing shit up' (in a healthy, non-terrorist kind of way). Now, it's no secret that, when it comes to rock's metal edge, these Queens want badly to be kings; you need look no further for proof than 2000's blistering, thuggish Rated R, on which frontman Josh Homme's searing guitars and theatrical vocals brought the band close enough to their goal to sniff the fleurs de lis. That, however, is history, and with Songs for the Deaf, the Queens have hit a new peak in their development: the sound is more massive, the chaos is more calculated, and with hired gun Dave Grohl at the kit, the band has an unprecedented drive that leaves them poised for their strongest bid for power yet. ""You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar, But I Feel Like a Millionaire"" embodies the greatest strengths of rock at its hardest-- stunning riffs, breakneck speed, and guitars that churn and spit like a threshing machine. It's riddled with decades-old metal cliches, but the Queens know what their audience expects, and they use this knowledge to continually twist rock stereotypes into a vicious full-nelson until they beg for mercy. It's fantastic, and this is just the first track. ""No One Knows"" changes Songs for the Deaf's pace by sliding into an easy groove, sleazing its way across a dimly-lit bar, half-drunk and reeking of cheap cologne, to put the moves on your girlfriend (or, you know, you, depending). This is four-to-the-floor slime of the highest quality, folks, and it's the second installment in this album's triad of genius, completed subsequently by the next track, ""First It Giveth"". ""Giveth"" brings the drama like a champ, with Homme singing in pained falsetto over punishing riffs during the verses, and opening up into aggro-overdrive for the appropriately apocalyptic chorus. But along the path to greatness, there are pitfalls, and one Homme often falls into here is the old ""chamber of lost souls"" effect (made popular by Alice in Chains on some of their later albums), which he uses to fill out the backgrounds of some of these songs. The multitracked Hommes aaah'ing melodramatically in undead unison make slogging through ""Hanging Tree"" and ""Go with the Flow"" a pretty grim endeavor. It doesn't help that these songs churn along interminably long after their riffs have run dry, either. And worse still, the band has quit winking at their metal excesses entirely, toeing the line between mindless fun and xFC-metal gothery. Fortunately, this is only a temporary decline, but that these two tracks hit back-to-back in the dead center of the record makes for a much steeper dropoff than if they'd been sequenced farther apart. There's also the issue of the between-song skits. As skits go, these are pretty tame, but that doesn't make them any less obtrusive. The album even opens with one: the sign-on of KLON (that's ""clone"") radio, ""the station that sounds more like everybody else than anybody else."" It's a broad parody of the Clear Channel wavelength empire, and while admittedly pretty fucking funny, the target is a bit obvious-- especially given that PS2's ""Grand Theft Auto III"" beat them to the punch two years ago and pulled it off expertly. My biggest problem with these interruptions, though, is that they do little for the aggregate effect of the album-- after a couple playthroughs, they only serve to stifle the momentum QOTSA manage to develop. Yet, this same biting cleverness also pervades many of the songs, lending an air of spontaneity and plain good times-- there's a fake stop in one of the early tracks that's so ludicrous I laughed out loud. And there are even better moments to be had elsewhere: the wavering surf guitar on ""Another Love Song"", or the good old-fashioned brain-sickness of ""Six Shooter"" and ""Mosquito Song,"" the latter played lovingly by what sounds like the orchestra of the damned. When these guys are on, it truly is the wrath of the righteous. However, Songs for the Deaf vacillates constantly between soaring heights and mind-numbing lows, making for a true hit-or-miss affair. But even if they can't have it all, the guys do offer as real a showcase of metal-tinged panache and stellar songwriting as anyone might hope for from a band labeled 'stoner-rock.' Besides, if the entire album was as strong as the first three tracks, it'd probably burn you alive. As it stands, Queens of the Stone Age settle for attempted murder. And that ain't bad at all.","Self-proclaimed prehistoric royalty Queens of the Stone Age are back from the desert wastes of California,\n\ and they're ...

Mastered by Guy at the Exchange,Max Tundra,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3e95e6ef95969323932/1:1/w_160/2b2d2d95.jpg,2002-09-09 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5160-mastered-by-guy-at-the-exchange/,Tigerbeat6,"So many synths, beeps, beats, glitches, horns, hooks, voices. It shouldn't work. But it does. Perfectly. And it's all because of the enthusiasm and sheer joy that electronic artist Max Tundra (n√© Ben Jacobs) puts in every note of his second album, Mastered by Guy at the Exchange. Jacobs comes across like a dry, witty Englishman mixed with a three-year-old on a slowburn sugar high. He seizes every strain of pop music and every instrument he can think of, wrapping them in layers of synths and drum programming. He namechecks a Yes album on one song, so it's not surprising when he overdubs himself into a Rick Wakeman who has eight hands and good taste; the flurry of keyboards on ""Fuerte"" blows through like a swarm of candy-coated insects. Which isn't to ignore the subtleties of the accordions, guitars, trumpets, and other live instruments mixed into the album-- all of them played by Jacobs himself. Genre-hopping may be old hat by now, but Jacobs' music is so disorienting that the abrupt cuts on, say, ""M.B.G.A.T.E."" are still startling and bizarre: where did that club beat suddenly come from, and what's with the horns? But there's another reason he keeps catching you off-guard: Jacobs is ostensibly writing pop songs. Under all the chaos, these songs are straightforward and brutally catchy, just about every one of them anchored to a great hook and an intriguing voice. Jacobs' first album and singles were instrumentals, but here, all but one of the tracks has vocals-- mostly by Jacobs, whose high, mellifluous voice resembles Scritti Politti's Green Gartside or, uh, Prince. But he also invites his sister, Becky, to sing. No offense to Ben's work, but where his voice fits into the music, Becky's soars on it; though not exactly a diva in power or emotional range, she has an attractive voice that adds the right amount of warmth to the electronics. ""Lysine"", the first single, starts with just her and the most basic possible melody before Ben gradually adds glitches and stuttering keyboards; and she's beautifully nimble singing the arching melody of ""Acorns"", overdubbing her own harmony while Ben adds a shuffling rhythm track and airy (well, weak-lipped) brass. Since this is his first time as a lyricist, it's forgivable that Jacobs' words aren't as striking as the music. He confesses, ""I only sing about things that happen to me/ I never learned to fill my songs with allegory,"" and it's true that the songs aren't rich with subtext. But the music's already so busy that it all works out fine-- you don't jam a drumstick in a turkey club sandwich-- and anyway, the unassuming way he writes about himself is fun. It's great, for example, that the song ""Gondry"" is just a plea to videomaker Michel Gondry (Bj√∂rk, Radiohead, Massive Attack) to direct one for him. Or that his other verses are so autobiographical-- girls he's loved or loves, complaints about his day jobs-- all strewn with Britpop references and clever rhymes. But more importantly, he knows how to mesh the words with the music, texturally-- he has a good ear for words and rhymes-- but also narratively. The last track, ""Labial"", is practically an aria. The lyrics follow a simple hopping melody, telling the story of how Jacobs stole his best friend's girl. Bonus points to Ben for having his sister sing it, making it sapphic. The music dramatizes the words-- much like he'd do with an orchestra, he uses different tonal colors to underline different lyrics-- but here it's the acoustic strumming on the first verse, the giddy keyboards on the next few, and then the abrupt cut to a gnarly, grinding electric guitar. After the bridge he fades to a low, pulsing bassline that underscores the conclusion, and then the music explodes in a wave of keyboards, a massive stretch of sustained chords, making a finish so big, it's this close to being raw, stinking cheese. Yet, its boldness and, if nothing else, utter uniqueness, is what makes it so beautiful. And that may be the key to the album's success: that it can take the unfamiliar and the over-the-top and tie it to what's recognizable, hitting normal targets with the most creative means Jacobs could imagine. This record shows the breadth of his creativity, yet it's accessible, catchy and brilliantly simple. A massive achievement.","So many synths, beeps, beats, glitches, horns, hooks, voices.

Opus Pia,Takagi Masakatsu,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3c6eb335119a49ed7bf/1:1/w_160/dd53d23d.jpg,2002-09-09 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5128-opus-pia/,Carpark,"Think back to the video of the bag in American Beauty; I'll wait. Okay, so is a plastic bag fluttering around in front of a camera truly a ""tiny miracle in daily life""? The bag does seem, almost inexplicably, to have freed itself from the bonds of gravity, possibly with the aid of something called 'wind', but I'm pretty sure that doesn't count as a miracle. Regardless, the pot dealer in American Beauty really got choked up on this stuff (and eventually scored with whatshername because of it, so what do I know?), and video documentarian Takagi Masakatsu digs on these little wonders, too. One's fictional, of course, but no doubt most of you are more familiar with his work than with Masakatsu's real-life video collage, Opus Pia. The fifteen minutes of vignettes from around the world contained in Opus Pia showcase Masakatsu's passion to capture the simple beauty of the everyday. It all smells faintly of patchouli and old Birkenstocks, and you may question whether shots of Asian children laughing in the rain or trees racing past a car window really constitute the splendor of nature (at least, I did). Masakatsu, however, doesn't question it for a second, and his thoughtful confidence in the understated glory of Opus Pia's whirlwind is thoroughly convincing. His original score for Opus Pia only enhances the effect by creating a lighthearted but contemplative atmosphere in which to more fully appreciate the film. If only it held up so well on its own. Believe it or not, this isn't a video review-- unfortunately, what's at stake is merely the Opus Pia companion CD, and I'm here to tell you that you probably shouldn't waste your money or time. Naturally, as Opus Pia's original soundtrack, ""Opus Pia"" is the central feature here. Masakatsu's score is a delicate lattice of piano and other tonal percussion, digitally processed until it nearly sounds like synthesized tones, though it never fully loses sight of its organic roots. The composition is truly amorphous, fitting brilliantly with Opus Pia's haze of imagery by offering a sense of narrative and connection between scenes, and the electronic air to the score lends a clever point of comparison with the predominantly natural scenes upon which Masakatsu focuses. When the imagery is removed, though, the once complimentary composition is reduced to barely more than a formless mire of sound with no underlying cohesion. It's pretty, though, in a vapid sort of way, and appealing enough to briefly overlook its free-floating lack of depth. In fact, the original soundtrack by itself isn't so bad. The real problem is everything else. The next two tracks to pad out the disc are a pair of remixes that are laughably redundant. The idea of 'remixing' something that is essentially without form or any sort of developmental impulse is like trying to juggle water (it's a stupid analogy, but then, that's sort of the point). ""Re Pia 2"" demonstrates this by sounding almost exactly like ""Re Pia 1""-- which in turns sounds almost exactly like ""Opus Pia"". These are nothing but filler in the most blatant way imaginable. They do maintain the pleasantly pixilated fog of the original, and that's more than can be said for the drippy ""Everything Came From Here"", which sounds a little like something Yanni once played at the Acropolis. The digital editing used to sublimate the new-age-y sap of the score into breezy beeps is wholly absent on this track, leaving only heavy-handed faux-emotional piano. And then there's ""Harmony"". ""Harmony"" is simultaneously the best and worst of this CD, and as such, it's hard to come to grips with. Masakatsu's travels have obviously provided him with a wealth of sonic baggage from the locales he's frequented, and he's finally gotten around to unpacking his suitcases. These fragments of indigenous noise, the backdrop of everyday life, are assembled into a 28-minute travelogue of just background: cars, wind, passing conversations, etc. It's as good as any of the truly ambient noise work out there, and slightly ingenious with regard to Masakatsu's vision. It certainly does bring prominence to the constant hum of everyday life that so many of us take for granted. But... it's 28 minutes of unspectacular noise, and more than any other track present, it takes a great deal of work to appreciate, for better or worse. So much work, in fact, that you might not have the strength to wade through to the final (and only marginally impressive) track, ""And Then..."" Not that you'd be missing anything you didn't already hear on ""Everything Came From Here"". In all, this is mainly an album of ideas, not music. 'Harmony' is more impressive to consider than actually listen to, and similarly, the soundtrack is wonderful-- as long as it's heard in conjunction with the film.","Think back to the video of the bag in American Beauty; I'll wait.

ThirdShiftGrottoSlack EP,Jay Farrar,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd54c0084474cd0c2c93/1:1/w_160/fcc61177.jpg,2002-09-09 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2997-thirdshiftgrottoslack-ep/,Artemis,"Jay Farrar has been on a long losing streak. It's been nearly a decade since his genre-defining band Uncle Tupelo split up, and despite a memorable debut album from his post-Tupelo band Son Volt, the man has long skated by on past glories. With each new album, it's getting harder and harder to justify his continued relevance. The last two Son Volt albums, Straightaways and Wide Swing Tremolo, were largely monochromatic and lifeless, and that the gravel-voiced Farrar seemed to have run out of things to say and has appeared content to dwell upon the same sad-sack mold he'd been carving out for years isn't helping any. Last year, though, he took a step in the right direction. He put Son Volt on hold (possibly for good) and released an album under his own name for the first time. Sebastopol was a good idea in theory; all but the most hardcore Farrar apologists had to admit it was time for a change, and Farrar did, in fact, seem a bit rejuvenated by the sessions. The only problem was with the songs themselves. It's as though he thought simply changing his cast would solve the problem-- that he could continue get by on writing the exact same songs he's been writing all along. In hindsight, the album comes off as a missed opportunity at a fresh start. So how does ThirdShiftGrottoSlack-- a five-song EP essentially made up of outtakes from the ho-hum Sebastopol-- reverse Farrar's downward spiral? Well, it doesn't really. But it does hint that there might still be some hope yet. It shows Farrar is at least willing to try something new (again) before he jumps back into the relative safety of Son Volt. The results are mixed, but at roughly 20 minutes, it's hard to accuse this EP of redundancy, my main complaint concerning Farrar's last couple releases. Taken individually, Farrar's songs have always been above par; it's only when one tries to digest 40+ minutes worth that they become tedious. The high point here is a Tom Rothrock (Beck, Elliot Smith, R.L. Burnside) remix of ""Damn Shame"", which originally appeared on Sebastopol. Although it sounds like a horrible idea on paper, Rothrock loops the drums and pumps up a slide guitar to create a smooth, soulful groove that sounds a lot like the white-boy funk of Little Feat. Farrar has never sounded less stiff as he hums the melody line, his scruffy baritone descending as he sings, ""It's a damn shame, damn shame, damn shame..."" It's exactly what he needs right now, to loosen up. Elsewhere, however, it's Farrar as we've unfortunately come to know him in recent years. ""Greenwich Time"" is a stripped-down acoustic song that's tolerable only if you don't pay too much attention to vague, semi-political lyrics like, ""Ballot box open, temperature rising, and all the cloning nonchalance."" ""Station to Station"" (not the Bowie song) is a pleasant enough piano-led track, while ""Kind of Madness"" (featuring Steve Drozd of the Flaming Lips) is morbidly humorous as Farrar gives a deadpan freak show role-call which chronicles (among others) a guy who chops off his arm so he can ""save it for later."" Sadly, the song is bogged down by careless lyrics like, ""Stripmalls of road rage are bringing us down."" It's the kind of thing I'd expect from recent Ryan Adams. And ""Dues"" finally rounds out this mixed bag with an upbeat rocker colored by slide guitar and organ, which still fails to leave much of an impression. Of course, it's too much to ask of an EP to single-handedly turn around the career of a near-legend who's fading fast-- ThirdShiftGrottoSlack doesn't even come close. It does, however, hint at the possibility that there is still magic left in the man-- just enough of a hint to postpone writing him off completely. I'll give you one more shot, Jay. Just one.","Jay Farrar has been on a long losing streak. It's been nearly a decade since his genre-defining band Uncle ...

The album beckoned sweater weather as it sloped and cooed, sounding as though it had been recorded in the world's sexiest public library. Their new release, a remix EP whose only flaw is its flirtatious length, indentures the soft touch of Know by Heart to huge beats, resulting in some of the flat-out whitest hip-hop remnants this side of Third Bass. Let's talk about what remixes say about authorship, about the crises they present. Bands are willing to stick their name to material that is technically barely theirs-- in this case, AmAnSet is hocking a project that's mostly the work of Her Space Holiday and Morr Music electronicist Styrofoam-- and about half of these renderings are so cut-and-paste that there's no central text left to eulogize. So this EP's most obvious misshapen cousin is Low's Owl Remix Low, since it's the most vivid example of what happens when tiptoe-core is turned into turbo-bump, and at least three of these 'updates' (as if they're meant to replace outmoded originals) are insanely similar to those. The slurred loop of American Analog Set's ""Desert Eagle"" matches the Robitussin booyah of Low's ""Anon"". The overhaul Know by Heart's title track begins as an ethereal, fragile scritch-scratch of vocal samples (a la Tranquility Bass' take on ""Over the Ocean"") and bursts into a raving, cyclonic scritch-scratch of vocal samples (a la Jimmy Sommerville's take on ""Words""). A recurring motif on the rest of the EP is a 'blown' sound, like equipment failure, that aims to grit up American Analog Set's hypoglycemic poppiness. Another golden crutch the disc flaunts is to juxtapose a high track of busy, busy drum splatterings over a low track of a straight, time-keeping backbeat. Rather than risk being upstaged by its source material's exotic tones, this disc often reduces American Analog Set's initial arrangements to ambient or old school three- and four-note twinkles. ""The Postman"" sounds like a street brawl between Republic-era New Order, an oscillator, and a caravan of tricked-out Mustangs pumping Miami bass. Who knows how well this treat will age? Certainly remix albums rank among my CD collection's Golden Girls, or worse, play like bonus features on a wack DVD. But enough textural clashes are chronicled here to keep your attention, and the bombast draws AmAnSet's coyness out of its shell, resulting in a perfect soundtrack for them hours when you know you should be sleeping. Instructions: (1) Get a house with a fireplace for this one, (2) stock up on Duraburn starter logs, (3) flatter a worthy partner, (4) reap the benefits of these ghost-written rave-ups.","On last year's Know by Heart, American Analog Set let the lease run out on their droning, 24-hour Farfisy ...

A Rush of Blood to the Head,Coldplay,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a61bc0084474cd0c089e/1:1/w_160/1db5227a.jpg,2002-09-08 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1538-a-rush-of-blood-to-the-head/,EMICapitol,"Though my hopes were briefly raised by a frazzled Christopher Lloyd in 1985, it's painfully obvious now that time travel doesn't exist as a human technological capability. This being overwhelmingly the case, I will try my best to transport with words, and paint a picture of another time-- a time ever so slightly more innocent, when terrorism wasn't being used as an excuse to crush civil liberties and drop bombs on mustachioed megalomaniacs. So, drag that bottle of Orbitz out of the back of the closet, put X-Files on the VHS, and journey back with me to the year 2000. It was a wondrous time-- we were still fascinated by the three zeros that had signified the birth of the new millennium, and many were relieved to have escaped judgment from an infinite, intangible being. Then, toward the end of the year, we began to hear rumblings from the many-headed hydra of UK rock journalism that some amazing new music had come to usher us into the New World. This music was deemed fascinating, uncompromising and utterly prizeworthy by our English brethren, who spoke in hushed tones of how it was to be the coming of ""the next Radiohead,"" or perhaps more tellingly, ""the next Travis."" This new music was produced by a band of four affable blue-collar lads from Europe's island neighbor who called themselves Coldplay, and before you knew it, there was no escaping their lead-off single, ""Yellow"", as it burned itself into the national consciousness via extensive radio exposure and ABC promotional spots. I, myself, was never too taken with that single, though I openly admit to enjoying the album it was culled from, Parachutes. It was innocuous, to be sure, but it was also honestly rendered, and the opening three songs, effortless and hummable as they were, were hard to deny. Two years and a veritable avalanche of press later, A Rush of Blood to the Head has Coldplay taking a second shot at it, and to be perfectly honest, what they throw at the wall doesn't stick quite as well. I will credit them where it's due: they've admirably eschewed cloning their debut album, a path that would have been all too easy to take given that record's critical and commercial success. But while the sound of this album is more expansive, the influences a bit less obvious, and the approach more varied, the guys forgot to tote along their initial strength: the songs. Atmospherically, a couple of these tracks are remarkable-- particularly ""Daylight"", with its swooping guitar and synth lines. Even its strings, which echo melodies from Suede's last album, lend a sense of drama to a song that otherwise wouldn't hold much. Midtempo non-rockers ""Green Eyes"" and ""Warning Sign"" stretch the most obvious thread back to Parachutes with their lovelorn lyrics and slightly more developed melodies. And there are also a couple of ""memo to listener: we can rock, too!"" moments, specifically ""A Whisper"" and the lite-apocalypse of opener ""Politik"". The latter essentially takes the blueprint of ""Yellow""-- namely, the slamming, repetitive strumming of clean electric guitar-- and builds a more spacious song from it, one with more rattle and hum, but less melodic substance. Martin's double-tracked vocals hover curiously low in the mix and the band thrashes earnestly, but all the listener really comes away with is a nebular dustcloud and the sense that Coldplay want to break out of their box. Part of the blame for moments like these rests on producer Ken Nelson, who doesn't seem to know what to do with the band's expanded sound this time out. He alternately dries up the quietest passages and drenches the louder sections with Martin Hannett-sized reverb tides. It takes a lot of discretion to handle that sound, and the folly of Nelson and the band (who co-produced) often comes at the expense of the vocals, which frequently get lost in the haze. And that's a shame because vocalist Chris Martin has improved since the band's not-so-humble beginnings-- his voice is dramatically fuller than in the past, and he falters less on the higher notes. But, of course, he's still far from foolproof: at times, his attempts to broaden his palette don't pan out, such as during the regrettable midsection of ""Clocks"", where he barely bothers to add a melody to the central lyric ""nothing else compares."" To his credit, he does manage a pretty good verse melody here, but then he oddly shies away from what should be the hook at the end, tentatively trailing off as though he's not sure it's good enough. That could very well be the case, too, as it's been widely posited that Coldplay nearly didn't make this album at all, fearing that they didn't have the depth to provide an adequate follow-up to their debut. I'll avoid the obvious cheap shot there and instead offer that they indeed still might. Parachutes proved that Coldplay have at least a nascent songwriting capability, and A Rush of Blood to the Head shows them testing themselves musically, so it seems logical that if their third album were to combine those strengths they might finally start to sound like the band the UK press is always going on about. After over a half-dozen listens, I still haven't taken anything away from A Rush of Blood to the Head (by contrast, I recognized Parachutes' ""Don't Panic"" for the relatively tight song it is after hearing it once), and my girl, who was much more a fan of Parachutes than I was, sums it up as ""boring."" She's pretty much got it right.

Dreams,Otomo Yoshihide's New Jazz Ensemble,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaf213d1975652139b16/1:1/w_160/ac095711.gif,2002-09-08 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8860-dreams/,Tzadik,"From the looks of albums that make it into Pitchfork's review archive, you'd think jazz was an obscure music available only to strange elitists, if occasionally interesting to normal folk. ""Jazz is dead as a popular art form,"" was the comprise I agreed to, wincing all the while, in a recent exchange with a conscientious objector. I'm not sure I totally agree with that statement, but it was the only way to make my point of jazz's continued relevance without conceding that it is, at best, an interesting sideshow to the popular, rocky main attractions. Yet, jazz is vibrant, as long as you're willing to flip past the Billboard top 40 jazz records and delve into the 'marginal' sides of truly new music. The biggest problem I see with jazz is not in its unfamiliarity to most rock listeners, or even with the art's own hardliner traditionalists (paging Mr. Marsalis, Mr. Marsalis, please pick up a white courtesy phone)-- the greatest hurdle for jazz is that it's seen as antiquated, eccentric dinner party music; something to take a few samples of so it can make your record collection look nice, and prove that you ""gave it a chance."" That's a shame, because a lot's happened to jazz since Kind of Blue and A Love Supreme. In the case of Otomo Yoshihide, you might even be hard-pressed to call it 'jazz' at all. Where the crusty old regime might lead you to believe that swing beats and long, wanky sax solos were required, this incredible Japanese experimentalist forgoes the traditional for the extreme, post modern and ironic. In many ways, Otomo is similar to American John Zorn, though rather than flighty sax skronks and hardcore backdrops, he favors the turntable, the guitar, and the raw, romantic impressionism of free jazz. Of the literally hundreds of releases he's been involved with, the most famous was his legendary avant-rock collective Ground Zero (sort of a more colorful, Japanese version of Zorn's Naked City). His New Jazz Ensemble, which plays here, features many of the same musicians, but makes a jazz noise where GZ rocked. Dreams is Yoshihide's second record with his jazz band, though the first was billed as the New Jazz Quintet. The first record saw Yoshihide struggling to strike a balance between modern electronic improvisation and traditional hard bop. This one is altogether different, most notably due to the presence of female vocals, provided by Phew and Togawa Jun. Phew is no stranger to fans of experimental Japanese music, and her earthy voice turns many tunes that would be straight-ahead jazz ballads into introspective tone poems. Jun, meanwhile, doesn't quite possess Phew's command of atmosphere, but adds a less weighty compliment to the music nonetheless. Tunes like ""Yume"" and ""Good Morning"" are gentle ballads, and help make a case for 90s extremists like Yoshihide being more than just noisemongers. On the latter, trumpet, sax and guitar accompany Phew's vocal, often leaping into boisterous, atonal solo figures, though never overpowering her frontline melody. ""Yume"" begins with a childlike trumpet introduction, keeping an omnipresent sine wave in the background, and ushering in the flute, guitar and saxophone. Phew again delivers a well-worn vocal here, but instead of being a vulnerable ballad, the song reaches near-epic heights of post-rock torch song. Her more aggressive side can be heard on ""Hahen Fukei"" and the amazing ""Teinin Pushiganga"", but her voice seems tailored for the calm before the storm. The centerpiece of the record is a mammoth, 16-minute version of Jim O'Rourke's ""Eureka"", featuring Jun and Phew. The song begins as a bawdy funeral march, but quickly returns to the familiar ballad strains of the earlier tunes. However, about five minutes in, the sound of waves crashing on a beach take over, and soon the sine wave returns. When the vocals re-enter, free percussion and bass, and double-tracked saxophones playing the melody join them. The ensemble crescendos to a fiery climax that sounds completely in the tradition of post-Ascension free jazz. Yoshihide's band, following the hallowed jazz model of reinterpretation, has taken music seemingly outside their realm and played it like it could never have belonged to anyone else. It's this kind of creative ambition (and the ability to pull the music off) that should inspire non-believers to take a closer look at new jazz. It's as good as it ever was.",,8.3,
Low Pressure,Spaceheads,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4f1ea9e61561daa500f/1:1/w_160/40a1213d.jpg,2002-09-08 05:00:01,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7388-low-pressure/,Merge,"Today's topic: ""The Trumpet: Still Relevant?"" It's an instrument that's been in use for hoary centuries, but one that ran out of new territory sometime around the mid-70s. I'm not saying the trumpet has lost its usefulness in today's musical environs, but as far as new voices and sounds go, the old brass horn seems pretty tapped out, with only the rare blowhard able to break free from the usual comparison glossary: smoky film noir soundtracks, the six or seven phases of Miles Davis, and Bacharachian flugel-syrup. In all likelihood, a reviewer at Jazzfork.com is saying the exact same thing about the guitar right now, but hey, that's relativism for you. Not that Andy Diagram, hornman for Merge duo Spaceheads, doesn't give instrument resurrection the old college try. Virtually every sonic character the trumpet has ever assumed makes an appearance on Low Pressure, from scratchy archival footage sputtering toots to fusion-era wah-wah squawks to legion-of-overdubbed-Diagram big-band recreations. It's an impressive encyclopedia of trumpet sounds-- which is why it's all the more disappointing that they're not put to very many compelling uses. Because Spaceheads has a clinical case of technophilia, a distracting over-dependence on loops, electronics and programming pervades Low Pressure. And thanks to the trumpet at center stage, it's hard to classify the twosome as anything but a jazz act. But if nothing else, at least they're a jazz act trying desperately to update the form by soldering in some serious laptop percussion. Maybe blame can be placed on the fact that the album contains three remixes (two co-manipulated by drummer Richard Harrison), but all too often, the machinery overwhelms the humanity, anime-style. This effect is most notable with ""On a Clear Day,"" where Harrison and co-remixer Mick Routledge pile on layer upon layer upon layer of percussion track to build up a dense club grind lacking all but the barest of melodies; the result is intriguing, if not unforgettable. Melodic droughts are the biggest shortcoming of Spaceheads, as Diagram prefers slow slides and harmonized blasts to repeated themes and discrete note packages. The duo obviously prioritizes texture over songcraft-- a noble calling, to be sure-- but the environments created don't have the consistency to sustain the album. Low Pressure features too many jarring moments to be ambient (like the almost guitar-like trumpet slashes of ""Storm Force"") and too many drawn-out contemplative segments to be a groove session (see the 10-minute long synth swells and arrhythmic rattlesnake maracas of ""Red Shift""-- not my cup o' ambient tea). Occasional successes show up to the party, like the beach-cop TV theme songs set amongst sinister electronics of ""The Lugano Affair"" and ""The Hut"", with its uncustomary focus on a single groove throughout. But most tracks simply stretch too long and change gears too often to hold interest or stake out long-term memory territory, coasting along in a low-pixel blur that obfuscates where one track ends and the next begins. Even while Spaceheads' aims don't necessarily jibe with my listening preferences, it's apparent that the content of Low Pressure is inferior to same-ballpark artists like Isotope 217 and Chicago Underground Duo. The trumpet might yet be revived from its current state of throwback purgatory into newfound relevance, but Spaceheads don't seem to be the act holding the defibrillator.","Today's topic: ""The Trumpet: Still Relevant?""

We Were Young and Needed the Money,Idaho,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1a75e6ef95969323737/1:1/w_160/031465b4.jpg,2002-09-08 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4056-we-were-young-and-needed-the-money/,Idaho Music,"To some, Idaho's entire catalog might as well be a compilation of unreleased material. In a world where the general populace would consider the records that make Pitchfork's year-end top 20 obscure, a band that, after ten years and six studio albums, fails to receive props even from slapdash websites like ours begins to redefine and reshape the term 'unknown.' So it goes with Idaho, one of the more underappreciated 'great' indie bands in America today. And, just like all the others, Idaho's entry in the unreleased comp-camp was simply a matter of time. We Were Young and Needed the Money is 60 minutes and 17 songs of unreleased Idaho material. In theory, every review of a compilation like this could be a positive one: if the compilation is packed with wholesome goodness, the artist receives accolades as one with the Midas touch; if the compilation is a shit-sink, the artist could be heralded for exercising restraint and discernment on his full-lengths and saving the dreck for a singular, catchall dumping session. To borrow from Gump, We Were Young and Needed the Money is like a box of chocolates-- though more a Whitman's sampler than a delectable selection of Lindt, as sometimes you get the ambrosial, luscious pleasure of that nugget with the caramel and the nut clusters in it. On We Were Young, these lip smackers come early on-- notably the first six tunes, including ""Teeth Marks"", an ethereal alterna-rocker recorded in 1995, and ""Flat Top"", another hard-rocking entry that puts lead Idahoan Jeff Martin's feedback guitar and production talents to ample use. Conversely, We Were Young does feature some significantly bland, backloaded shortcomings, even if the record never delivers a slab of repulsive pink-nougat, or 'cherry-in-the-middle' surprise. The style on ""Teeth Marks"" characterizes the feel of the entire album; most of the material was recorded before 1999, when Idaho was still a true-to-form rock 'n' roll act. Thus, like the aforementioned ""Teeth Marks"", ""Come Over"", an overdriven, mid-tempo, bitter and bluesy track, would feel right at home on Three Sheets to the Wind or This Way Out. Sad rockers beware, however; there's nothing on We Were Young approximating the delicate, glowing slowcore found on Idaho's last two studio discs, the brilliant Hearts of Palm and the highly enjoyable Levitate. This stuff is mostly Martin with his full-band Idaho posse of old. With all the strong tracks up front, though, the disc's tail end suffers somewhat: the dull melody on the downtempo ""A Second Chance"" is a good example of a wise omission from a full LP. ""Stayin' Out Front"" has its charms, including a conga drum/arpeggiated guitar bridge and some sampled, distorted vocal parts, but fails to come together as compellingly as Martin's strongest work. And the drab baritone delivery and hackneyed lyrics on ""Drown"" are a pretty ill-advised way to close out the album. Still, We Were Young and Needed the Money stands as a worthwhile purchase for fans of the band, even if, in terms of a starter album, it understandably lacks the stylistic diversity, top-shelf songwriting and exceptional studio polish of some of Idaho's proper albums. In short, a Whitman's mix of the Midas touch and the discerning song selection, with the decided edge going to Midas.","To some, Idaho's entire catalog might as well be a compilation of unreleased material.

Blue Skied an' Clear,Various Artists,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7b65e6ef95969321044/1:1/w_160/eedbe9ee.jpg,2002-09-05 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1940-blue-skied-an-clear/,Morr,"Critics always use this simile where music-making is like geographical exploration. This pegs the tricky thing about musical innovation: you can set out boldly in search of liberation, set foot in uncharted realms, and stride back shouting ""look at what we've done,"" but five years later, your new hinterlands will likely have lots of cute little condos on them with families living inside. This is exactly what's happened with IDM, which is terrific. Our bold adventurers led us into The New, and their successors camped out there. So, now that an IDM 'sound' has been established and we've put in the ranch homes and the post office, what do we do with it? Tigerbeat6 and Morr Music, though not strictly IDM-based labels, seem to have the most compelling answers to that question. Tigerbeat's is: now that the homes are built, let's live in them-- muss them up and fill them with dirty and jokes and dirty jokes instead of treating them like museums. Morr Music is even less of an IDM label than Tigerbeat6-- many of its releases run toward minimal techno and electro. Nevertheless, they too have an answer. They've rightly decided that living in this new frontier constitutes some difficult cerebral challenge: drop the hard-living pose, they say, and let's decorate. Morr's artists take the sounds and techniques of IDM, techno, electronica-- the textures, the relentless formalism-- and fashion them into something that often points toward pop music. Which is why it's natural that the Morr crew have put together this two-disc tribute to shoegazer messiahs Slowdive, a band whose whole focus was the tension between elaborate textures and vivid pop. We'll skip how tremendous Slowdive were and how brilliant the Morr stuff is (though the short answer is 'very'). Thus, it's with deep regret that I must announce that the first disc of this comp-- the one with the actual Slowdive covers-- isn't all that great. Even the M√∫m track. Especially the M√∫m track. Here's the thing: Slowdive's Neil Halstead is a good songwriter with a distinctively languid, narcotized feel running through most of his work. But Slowdive's various walls of woozily swelling guitars weren't just ornamentation; they were integral parts of the songs. ""When the Sun Hits"", from Souvlaki, crawls through its first verse on a high-hat tick, bass pulse, and guitar echo. Halstead tosses off, ""It matters where you are,"" and an oceanic gale of guitar and synth kicks through. Get it? It matters where you are. ""When the Sun Hits"" gets covered twice here, first by Solvent and later by Kom√´it. The Solvent version points to problems. The Morr cadre is devotedly minimal, exercising great skill in letting two or three really compelling sounds do the work of seven or eight mediocre ones. So Solvent kicks off well-- subtle, condensed, robotic. And then ""it matters where you are,"" but... nothing. None of the cathartic swell which was part and parcel of Slowdive's songs. No one on this disc even tries to tackle it, not with noise or glitch or giant synth pads. Nothing. Which is slightly different from the standard complaint of the guy who can't tolerate anyone reinterpreting the originals-- it's not that they're taking liberties here, it's that they're occasionally skirting the songs' purposes without introducing new ones. Some tracks do okay nonetheless, creating enough of their own dynamics that they don't miss Slowdive's. Lali Puna's ""40 Days"" uses just a bit of texture over steadily shifting and mounting drum programming; B Fleischmann and Ms John Soda turn ""Here She Comes"" into a minimalist invocation; Styrofoam makes a lovely chiming drift out of ""Altogether"". And while you'd think someone would fare better with the tracks from Slowdive's last record, which itself dropped the full band and dipped into ambience, that is sadly not the case here. Ulrich Schnauss turns in what's basically a mild remix of ""Crazy for You"", and the usually promising Manual runs uninspired through ""Blue Skied an' Clear"". It all sounds really great, though it doesn't seem like much of a victory, given how epically perfect this whole thing could have been. But here's why you should buy it anyway: there's a second disc, a proper Morr comp except occasionally ""inspired"" by the Slowdive theme. And it's Morr in fine form-- gorgeously structured, exquisitely assembled, cerebral and beautiful, clean-lined and melodic, and somehow leagues ahead of the interchangeable 'organic' IDM records anonymously littering store shelves. Most striking is Guitar's ""House Full of Time"", the first imitation of Loveless (perhaps they got their shoegazer bands mixed up) that I'm tempted to say is actually better than a lot of the original. Next most striking is Ms John Soda's ""Solid Ground"", a sunny progress of sine blips, pizzicato strings, vocals, and sparse drumming that works the song-based accessibility angle as well as Lali Puna and the Notwist do. Elsewhere, Ulrich Schnauss redeems himself with a motorik workup to some float-by vocals and stunning drum shifts. Styrofoam gives us a drum program and an emo ballad (this is a good thing), Manual concocts something that sounds like Slowdive covered by smooth-jazz enthusiasts (this, too), and Kom√´it dresses up as the Kings of Convenience (we'll have to think on that one). Plus, Solvent teases us with the instrumental for a track from his forthcoming electro vocal project. Any dissipation of faith in Morr that occurs during disc one is obliterated. Begin with exploration analogy, end with pun: Morr, Morr, Morr.","Critics always use this simile where music-making is like geographical exploration.

Cassia Fistula,Brendan Walls,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9c713d1975652139900/1:1/w_160/e53acaeb.gif,2002-09-05 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8573-cassia-fistula/,Idea,"Dearest Diary, Everyone likes to skip down to the corner record shop, pocketful of chore money and gaze at the strange, thrilling new titles with the colorful jackets. Oh, what a time we have gazing at the covers that must have come from halfway across the world to excite us in the music shop. And when we select our favorite one from the never-ending stack of delights, handing over the hard-won money from a month's worth of gutter rinsing and pipe-hosing, and take home our prize, there is no warmer satisfaction than to hear the magical melodies from the disc fill our rooms with sweets and light. But wait, not every record is there for us to enjoy. Some records-- usually the ones with the shifty computer images and decadent coloring-- only deign to scare us. These records, they weren't made to fill our rooms with smilies, but with headaches and contradictions. Why did the record store offer these, when there were plenty of nice records to choose from? I recently brought one by this Brendan Walls home, and let me tell you, it's not something to play for normally happy people. It's full of very angry noises and mechanical screw-ups. Well, it is! And then, here's what I found out about this Walls character. Apparently, he's from Australia, where I understand people walk on their hands and eat hamburgers for breakfast. It makes sense, because everything about this music seems backwards! Brendan Walls makes his music using only instruments and electronic gadgets that he created himself. So, you won't hear any orchestras or harmonicas on this record. The boy at the record store said that I shouldn't buy this unless I already liked some other weird people like O-to-mo Yoshy-someone, or a lot of guys from Germany who use computers to make songs that sound like they don't know how to make songs. Anyway, Cassia Fistula definitely sounds like he doesn't know how to something right. The record starts off with the decidedly off-putting ""Section One"". The man couldn't even think of a decent title, and he's not from Iceland, so you can't say he doesn't know the language. Of course, it wouldn't really matter because it's simply 16 minutes and 48 seconds of computerized burping. I'm sorry, but that's what it sounds like to me. It starts off silent, and then goes right in to the burping drone noise, and only gets louder. At one point near the end, it actually gets so loud I have to turn down my player. I think people should learn to make music that doesn't make you turn down your players. Anyway, once I listened to this, and it made me think of terrible things like my dog Thurber who died one summer when I was away, and also of smashing mother's mirror, so I don't ever want to play it again. ""Section Two"" (is he ever going to stop with these titles??) starts out with just a moan, like what I hear when the fish tank battery is going out if I stick my ear right up on it. There's a lot of echo and a little tone sliding up and down, which also kind of reminds me of small fish. If you listen to this, you're going to be confused like me. Sometimes it sounds like those fish are howling, like wolves, and I know that should not be. Why does this Walls boy insist on filling up so much space with spacy sounds? It's nutty if you ask me. But one time I played it when mother was gone, and I was staring at the wall, and it felt like when I was sick and had to take codeine. I think my eyes started having hallucinations, because the wall looked like it was smearing, and I couldn't feel my legs anymore. I guess... well, it was okay. The last song is the most scary. It's just a big rumbling at first, like being on a plane when everyone else is asleep. It makes my little hairs stand up. As it goes on, it gets louder and louder, and at first I thought my little speakers had given out, but that's really just the way it sounds. The funny thing is, the more I listen to this (I lied, I've played it every day since I got it), the more I find that I'm not as scared as before. I think if I played this for you, you might think I was crazy, but maybe this Walls boy doesn't want to frighten me as much as he just wants me to pay more attention. Oh sticks, mother's home, so I better stop. I don't want her to think I've been listening to records all day.","Dearest Diary,

Out of the Woods,Seelenluft,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a214ea9e61561daa4958/1:1/w_160/c67df9e4.jpg,2002-09-05 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7061-out-of-the-woods/,Klein,"Having apparently exhausted all of his native Switzerland's freakiness when he completed his music for a Zurich-based synchronized swimming team, Seelenluft's lone operator Beat Soler took himself off to Los Angeles. As numerous portrayals have documented, L.A. is one helluva bizarre place. From Nathaniel West's The Day of the Locust to David Lynch's Mulholland Drive, the city has proven itself the world-leader in disturbing fakery and creepy superficiality. So you'd think L.A. would be Soler's kind of town, seeing as how he often adopts the persona of a trumpet-playing bunny/human hybrid called Silvercity Bob. Out of the Woods, however, with a couple of exceptions, is a rather conventional downtempo offering. The album begins with a paean to the female residents of the city. ""L.A. Woman"" is not a cover of the Doors' lugubrious drivetime staple, though Soler's song has similar ambivalence towards its subject. In contrast to the underwhelming opening track, the second, ""Manila"", is as unexpected as an honest cop stationed in Rampart. Apparently, Soler found the song's guest vocalist while walking the sun-kissed, cap-dappled streets of Compton. Yes, a white Swiss man in a bunny suit would have walked free and easy, with nary a care in the world, through zones abandoned by all but the Bloods and the Crips. Perhaps the gang members recognized Soler's Swiss neutrality and allowed him uninhabited passage, or maybe he was really being a door-to-door salesman, offering Compton's residents a great deal on a new cuckoo clock. Whatever his true purpose, Soler did discover 12-year-old Michael Smith, who provides ""Manila"" with his atrocious-but-utterly-charming mic skills. The kid clearly can't rap-- he has fits instead of flow-- but he does have charisma. His spoken word bit about being on a plane bound for Manila and asking for curried chicken as the pilots lose control is delivered in a series of herky-jerky inflections and with enormous relish. You can hear how proud he is of himself-- especially when he nearly shouts that, whilst in tailspin, he encourages all the passengers just to dance. His enthusiasm and joy-in-the-face-of-peril is truly remarkable-- and that Soler chose to include this unique song (and release it as a 12"" single with a feisty Manitoba remix) proves, if nothing else, that he knows when he's on. The remaining ten tracks unfortunately fail to build on Smith's exuberance. The upright bass and vibraphone of ""Echokiller"" immediately connect the listener with Seelenluft's Synchronschwimmer EP, but the song lacks the kitschy glee that pervaded that record. Each time Soler and his Silvercity Bob Orchestra repeat the head, it sounds more and more labored. When Soler steps up to his Rhodes to take a solo, it's more like a talented amateur comping than a meaningful elaboration on a musical theme. ""Air Condition"", bucking on a series of perpetually breaking beats, stabilizes somewhat when guest vocalist Lara Stuart delivers Soler's equating of a relationship cooling-off with the efficiency of her recently overhauled 4000 BTU Trane window unit. Orchestra member Christian Fischer resurrects the tenor sounds of that ancient instrument, the transverse flute, for ""Boobsie and Pepsy"". Lacking any real substance, this instrumental is only noteworthy because of that breed of flute's slightly irregular appearance. A very youthful (and probably highly Botoxed) 83-year-old introduces ""Dancing Grandma"". Soler takes the sine-wave bass and almost-two-step percussion patterns of DJ Zinc's ""138 Trek"" and adds dapples of Rhodes piano. Again, in contrast to ""Manila"", the track is unremarkable. When Lou Barlow made his move out west, he summed up his ambivalence to L.A. with the processed vocals of ""E.Z.L.A."" Soler took note of Barlow's trope and processes Christian Fischer's vocals on ""Piano J"". The result is as blatant a knock-off as the Kate Spade handbags sold on street corners. Despite beginning promisingly with analogue filth, ""The Evil Frog"" soon lapses into familiarity when Soler cut-and-pastes a preacher's sermon on the reach of Satan and the money's power to corrupt. Much of this is righted, though, when Soler cut-and-pastes the gorgeously alien voices of a duo called the Saigon Sisters into the upright bass and vibes of ""Yoa Gongla"". Out of the Woods is a pretty big disappointment for me. I've adored Seelenluft's previous releases and imagined him to be one of the few acts that would push downtempo away from the conservative humdrum of mass-market Chill-Out Lounge comps. But this album leaves no one satisfied: the Dido and Moby massive will find it too awkward for dinner table background music, and those of us who desire more innovation will find it simply lacking in distinction.","Having apparently exhausted all of his native Switzerland's freakiness when he completed his music for a Zurich-based synchronized swimming ...

Ten Songs,Friend/Enemy,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be2cabf31b7dc71560e3/1:1/w_160/167d79f9.gif,2002-09-05 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3200-ten-songs/,Perishable,"How did Tim Kinsella get to be such an indie pincushion? People pay to be at his shows so they can shout insults at him; reviewers have written of their desires to smack him around. I'll readily admit that he's flung some inscrutable splorp into record store bins, and that he needs to have that Pubescent Perry Farrell DNA extracted, but his last two unctuous, rewarding freak-outs, recorded under the guises of Owls and now Friend/Enemy, lead me to ask: what does Kinsella have to do for people to take his afflicted noise seriously? Commit suicide? Be Japanese? In addition some of his usual collaborators from Owls, Cap'n Jazz and Joan of Arc, the twelve contributors to Ten Songs include members of Califone, Need New Body, and 90 Day Men, among other acts. The story is that Kinsella and Joan of Arc's Todd Mattei first developed the vocals and guitars, and then the rest of the merry ol' gang were brought in to add coils of organ, banjo, drums, pedal steel, bass, marimba, etc. Look ma, four pianists! Even without prior knowledge of the project's genesis, listeners can deduce that this album is a collision of premeditation and improvisation, of composed pieces and spontaneous seizures, of the ripe and the rotten. Every libertine musician here is destroying the village in order to save it, and the resulting songs contain mega-spectrums whose shambles hunch beside their pristinery-- imagine Gastr del Sol with a mean low end. Festering chords (weird, open, and minor) bulge from capillary riffs-- imagine Mick Turner overdubbing Slint while a toddler twiddles the pitchshifter. The feedback on ""Cough Soft Cock Rock/How Do You Explain Me to Your Mom"" seems manufactured from something organic under duress, maybe the old slats of a marina creaking. The drone, strum, and keys of ""Out at the Inner (Dark)"" blend impossibly with clamorous drum rolls that sound studio-years away. I could go on and on about how willingly and edifyingly this music can dovetail, collapse, and spaz, how Zappatrocious it is, how jawdroppingly the organs roam, how the upbeat moments sound like Canned Heat with botulism, or about how the escalating jazz-punk of ""I'd Rather Be High Than Get Laid/Fucked Any Day of the Week"" is flat-out bitchin'. But that'd overlook how the lyrics step up as well, imagist and longing. ""Teeny Comealong"" ends with a propulsive catalog of discarded standards: ""Feeling is too easy/ Leaving is too easy/ Quiet is too easy/ Esteem is too easy/ Dead is too easy/ Easy is too easy/ Jealousy is too easy/ Friends is too easy/ Keeping is too easy/ Responsibility is too easy/ Escaping is too easy/ Ending is too easy."" Absurdists can only laugh so long until the horror paralyzes them, and lemme just say that Kinsella's ripped yelp of ""I hate my thin top lip!"" during ""Do the Stand on the One Foot Dance to the Radio Rodeo"", for all its superimposition, puts the faux-trauma of Bright Eyes' photo-opera to shame. One gets the feeling that Kinsella couldn't give a green damn about his haircut. Friend/Enemy is not so much a step back from Owls as it is a cryptic lope away. And yes, there are some wince-worthy moments (a friend, proving the abundance of haters, described it as ""extravagant crap""). But the band's failures are failures of restraint, not of imagination. If you come to this website to find out what Ryan Adams is up to, this crotchety album's not for you. Ten Songs is the opposite of pop. Pop strives for frozen moments, not this album's long thaw. Pop's a pacifier, offering us an unremarkable assortment of distractions from death; this album is excited about decay. Ten Songs isn't a demographic-making commercial for anything; it's a distillation of uncanny arrangements with almost no sense of audience. Hell, the last time I saw Kinsella live, he mini-lectured about the Middle East while the crowd called him gay and unemployed. This stuff's what plays in the lobby of a unicorn abortion clinic, except for the almost traditionally pretty but equally complicated ""Just Like Ann E.

C'mon,Town and Country,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7edb1335d7bf169916f/1:1/w_160/93e11ad6.jpg,2002-09-04 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8122-cmon/,Thrill Jockey,"C'mon, indeed. ""C'mon"" while you wait for an eight-minute exercise in tragic monotony to develop into anything at all (it never does). ""C'mon"" when you realize that the next song is exactly the same. ""C'mon"" with cautious optimism as you search frantically for some of aspect of Town and Country's latest splur to justify the twelve bucks you were (hopefully not) forced to pay; a search that becomes more fruitless with every track. ""C'mon"" as you wait for the wreckage of this album to stop smoldering in your CD player after forty-four minutes of nothing but wasted time. Post-rock, at its best, is utterly transportive-- no longer relying on the limitations of traditional form and instrumentation frees the genre's arrangements to navigate soundscapes unreachable by most practitioners of the verse/chorus/verse rock dogma. Unfortunately, Town and Country is less like post-rock and more like pre-interesting. C'mon rejects the most unique and dynamic aspects of the genre in exchange for numbing repetition and structures as rigid and monolithic as a bomb shelter. And finally, after being reconciled to the poverty of C'mon's musical value, there's not an emotion to be found in its clinically detached artiness. I'm not trying to criticize Town and Country for failure to adhere to the post-rock party line; change is good-- just not when it's a giant step backwards. The idea of challenging genre convention is fantastic-- in retrospect, much of Tortoise's early work looks like aimless tail-chasing after being contrasted with the sweep of Standards' heretofore-unseen grandeur. But, of course, that sort of vision is difficult and in short supply, so the question that Town and Country asks is, ""Why bother issuing a challenge when it's so much easier to retreat?"" And, out of politeness, C'mon serves as its own answer: lacking any dynamism, complexity, or invention, the relentless drone of most of these tracks is a shallow, reactionary statement to the progress of the post-rock genre, and completely unedifying. This is more of a technical study than an actual album; less than a thought is given to emotion, drama, or anything else that might be even remotely compelling to the listener. Any impact these tunes might have is accidental spillover from their titles, making them little more than hoaxes; listen to ""Going to Kamakura"", and sure, it sounds to be (very) vaguely of Japanese descent, but listen to it without a tracklist and it barely qualifies as Muzak. These little trips to nowhere are designed to be studied (since you can't get close enough to the music to truly enjoy it); call it Music to Smoke Cloves By (to broadly paraphrase my esteemed colleague Mr Sirota's critique). As a unit, C'mon borders on being entirely indigestible. The closest it comes to listenability arrives at the beginning and the end of ""The Bells"", which, as the name implies, is a lengthy trumpet solo. The cloying vibraphone, bells, and feathery acoustics that populate the rest of the album are mercifully absent, and the melody actually approximates a real human emotion (fond regret, perhaps?). But it bookends three minutes of a single trumpet note being blown in steady rhythm, unintentionally invoking another human emotion: anger. I don't know what I'd prefer-- an album so mechanical and uninspired as to be almost robotic, or one so frustrating that it makes me swear at my speakers. Wait, that's right; neither.","C'mon, indeed. ""C'mon"" while you wait for an eight-minute exercise in tragic monotony to develop into anything at ...

Evil Heat,Primal Scream,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a130b1335d7bf16981c8/1:1/w_160/b7364692.jpg,2002-09-04 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6475-evil-heat/,Columbia,"Primal Scream's hallelujah chorus of a breakthrough dance track, ""Loaded"", may not sound very fresh to young ears these days, but when it first dropped in 1990 it epitomized the sound of a bold new era in which old-school club kids, shoegazers, and college students could unite under the common aim of getting wasted at dance parties without having to deal with the Happy Mondays. This formula earned Primal Scream a certified classic with 1991's Screamadelica, but the band, for whatever reason, seemed dissatisfied with their burgeoning reputation as rave rangers and reinvented themselves. Twice, in fact: first as Stones-influenced retro rockers on 1994's rightfully maligned Give Out But Don't Give Up, and then as a dubbed-out electronic pop band on 1997's more successful Vanishing Point. In 2000, the band took another sharp turn, though one not quite as outlandish as their previous two, with the stunning XTRMNTR, an abrasive, industrial grinder dense with concentrated, caustic production and raging political antagonism. Aided by a bevy of celebrity producers including Kevin Shields, the Chemical Brothers and The Automator, XTRMNTR vacillated between the hyperbolized fury of political punk bands and the breathless crunch of a cavernous dance club on Halloween. It wasn't pretty, and that was the point. Yet, detracting from the impact of the music's nuclear decimation stood singer Bobby Gillespie's hit-or-miss lyrics. At times spot-on, and at others painfully cliched, his observations could either make or break the band's riotous assaults. This, of course, led to reservations, so despite XTRMNTR's moments of glory, I filed it away and crossed my fingers awaiting its follow-up. After all, Primal Scream may be known for a lot of things, but consistency of style is not one of them. Evil Heat follows a similar course to XTRMNTR. Its anger and righteous indignation, though tweaked a bit in the post 9/11 aftermath (""Bomb the Pentagon,"" for fear of seeming cruelly redundant, was rewritten and retitled ""Rise""), comes off largely affecting. And the band's employment of outside talents doesn't hurt, either: Two Lone Swordsmen's Andrew Weatherall co-produced (hearkening back to his work on Screamadelica), and the increasingly ubiquitous, if invisible, Kevin Shields lent at least his name, if nothing else. Unfortunately, the rather untalented Kate Moss also shows up, playing Nancy Sinatra to Gillespie's electrocuted Lee Hazlewood in one of the most off-putting remakes of ""Some Velvet Morning"" I've ever heard. But the biggest detractor here is the band's lack of focus. The record is downright messy at times, even if the thick, murky quality does, in some instances, work to considerable effect. ""Deep Hit of Morning Sun"" builds out of simple, eerie synths into a muddle of distorted buzzes and beeps, fuzzed-out guitar, and the creepiest chorus ever to back that age-old British lyrical prosaism ""shine on me."" The clamor congeals beautifully, seeming like a perfect marriage of the album's diverse (and often divergent) sounds, and it's a rare moment on an album that otherwise tends to either pummel you or hold you at arm's length. Likewise, the Krautrock-inspired ""Autobahn 66"" and ""Skanner Darkly"" (both of which unite Weatherall with his Two Lone Swordsmen ally Keith Tenniswood) are clean, nearly dreamy respites from the turgid tracks that surround them, despite the former's seeming destiny for use in a Volkswagen commercial. Interestingly, Primal Scream also include two swaggering garage-rock songs, perhaps to offset the record's preponderance of electronically manipulated noise. ""City"" trumps the Stoogesque roar of any current Scandinavian-flavor-of-the-month by actually doing the apparent source material justice. And the entertaining, if gratuitous, guilty pleasure ""Skull X"" features Gillespie's best Bob Dylan impression over a blustering rock squall. Sadly, these songs are the exceptions. The rest of Evil Heat has forgone the creative noise collage that saved XTRMNTR from the depths of quasi-industrial whining, and given in wholesale to generic Nine Inch Nails knockoffs. I wish I could tell you that ""Miss Lucifer"" shared only its name with your local venue's teen goth night, or that the inadvertently hysterical ""Rise"" (lyric sample: ""Sweet 16 dehumanized!/ Death's head factory suicide!"") maintained any of its initial threat to post-9/11 National Security rather than reveling in neutered ""Head Like a Hole"" artificiality. I wish I never had to consider listing Stabbing Westward as a point of reference. But fate, as it just so happens, is entirely too cruel, and that goes double for Primal Scream who, at this late stage in their careers, find themselves in desperate need of yet another revision.","Primal Scream's hallelujah chorus of a breakthrough dance track, ""Loaded"", may not sound very fresh to young ears these ...

Immortality Lessons,Cul de Sac,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6b6ea9e61561daa5414/1:1/w_160/aa8f59a7.jpg,2002-09-04 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1684-immortality-lessons/,Strange Attractors Audio House,"Cul de Sac rose up in the early 90s in Boston. The press surrounding their efforts always commends them for avoiding the grunge scene ascendant at the time, as well as the more staid course of their post-rock contemporaries in the years to come. But despite all their Eastern song titles and instrumental tunings, it's doubtful the quartet fell that far from the proverbial tree. They've always been the rock-n-roller's improv band; regardless of the number of bassists and drummers they've gone through, the rhythm section generally perseveres as the frame on which guitarist Glenn Jones and electro-wizard Robin Amos weave their psychedelic tapestries. In recent years the band has seen an ill-fated collaboration with John Fahey, and 1999's justifiably praised Crashes to Light, Minutes to Its Fall. The music on Immortality Lessons was also recorded in 1999, at Brandeis University as part of WBRS' live music series ""The Joint"". As the story goes, the band arrived in the midst of a stagnant, humorless summer day and proceeded to set up haphazardly, not expecting much from the cramped foyer they were to play in, nor the college radio DJ. Upon playing back the tape weeks later, however, they discovered that the performance was remarkably well preserved. According to the liner notes, you'd think the band had stumbled on a milestone of modern mathematics, but a few listens reveals all they could have hoped for: a nicely balanced, warm tone that captured the fluidity of the set. As a document of the Cul de Sac experience, it stands better than their previous collection of studio outtakes, I Don't Want to Go to Bed. The vaguely Eastern explorations of Glenn Jones' open-tuned guitar begin the set. Robin Amos issues an undercurrent of electronics from his synthesizer, rustled up by Jon Proudman's cascading rolls and cymbal-showers. He provides the transition to ""Enhoft Down"", a brief percussion interlude, and it's surprising how resonant the drums sound for a live recording. The title track brings us back to a signature Cul de Sac move: wrangling speed bumps out of the bass, unleashing the guitar to skid across the surface. The band sounds a little taut here, as if their enthusiasm got away from them, but bassist Michael Bloom's vibrant scales guide the group back down. ""Tartarugas"", Bloom's composition, contrasts a busy beat with the slow howl of synthesizers and his bass. All the elements seem to settle and the band really begins to groove by the fifth track, ""Frozen in Fury on the Roof of the World"". Jones' intricate fingerpicking uncoils in spirals, finally coalescing into one of the few melodic motifs offered in the set. The desolate electronic landscape in the background returns in ""The Dragonfly's Bright Eye"", one of the album's highlights. The ten-minute epic starts off with just the gentle dribble of the guitar, but soon it ascends rapidly, prying open a Pandora's box of swarming synthesizers and electric burble. It's a shame the fidelity wasn't high enough to capture this maelstrom perfectly, but the lo-fi sound adds an appropriately blurry edge to the inspired ""Liturgy"". Amos samples a muezzin-like call-and-response chant and carefully feeds it through a delay pedal. ""Blues in E"" closes, an eleven-minute lullaby, more patient and restrained than much of the band's work. The dusky ambience reminds me of the liner notes, where Glenn Jones opines that ""ours have always struck me as evening ragas-- music for after dark."" Cul de Sac may not offer the eternal enlightenment implied in the album title, and these guys aren't exactly comparable to John Zorn and other gods of the improv scene, but their ecstatic instrumentals will definitely appeal across lines, from space-rockers to jam-band enthusiasts. As with most of Cul de Sac's recordings, a slightly sentimental tone pervades, somewhere between forward-looking and backwards-glancing. And occasionally, that's all the uplift you need.","Cul de Sac rose up in the early 90s in Boston. The press surrounding their efforts always commends them for ...

"Stevie, Vol. 1",Yesterdays New Quintet,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1bab1335d7bf1698321/1:1/w_160/f5e688b5.gif,2002-09-04 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4177-stevie-vol-1/,Stones Throw,"Those of you from the 80s may find this hard to believe, but there was a time when Stevie Wonder couldn't be touched. If you don't accept this as an irrefutable fact, turn off Ghostbusters, put down your New Coke, and go buy Innervisions, Fulfillingness, and Songs in the Key of Life. Believe me, you won't be disappointed. If you're already familiar with these classics, then you can imagine the uproar caused when word leaked out of the Stones Throw camp that hip-hop/jazzbo extraordinaire Madlib had covered 14 classic Stevie Wonder tunes. It all started innocently enough; recorded between 2000-2001, Stevie was never intended to be officially released. After Madlib, who was then recording under the guise of jazz band Yesterdays New Quintet, realized that he had an entire album's worth of Stevie instrumentals, he compiled them onto a single CD and presumably set them in the same stack as his other 12 unreleased Yesterdays New Quintet albums. Close friend and Stones Throw guru Peanut Butter Wolf saw the disc, made a copy, and passed it around the Stones Throw office. Within a week, clothing line Triple 5 approached Stones Throw about doing a limited pressing of unreleased material for promotional purposes, PBW handed over these tapes, and the hype steamrolled from there. Although it would be nearly impossible to replicate the soul-tagging genius of Wonder, in part because no one has a voice like Stevie's, Madlib is able to add his own special twist to the songs. His success can largely be attributed to his understanding the strength of the source material. There are minor electronic touches, but Madlib has too much reverence for Wonder to butcher his songs with unnecessary hip-hop pyrotechnics. In fact, while hip-hop does inform Madlib's interpretations, he sprinkles the mix with a dab of jazz fusion, a pinch of samba, and just a touch of lounge to make this a slinky, 70s-infused affair. For ""Too High"", Madlib digs into the track's ultra-funky opening groove before dropping the chorus' familiar keyboard riff. On ""Superwoman"" Madlib busts out the vibes, pounds away at the keys, and tweaks the beat, resulting in a sublimely spacy breaks fest that's going to have loop diggas salivating until 3k. Although Madlib pays mind to the tracks' melodies with some pretty stellar key work, the focus of almost every track is the rhythm section. ""Visions"", which is the track most significantly altered, is given a funky rev up and would sound at home in a Melvin Peebles movie. Other highlights include scorching versions of ""Superstition"" and ""You Got It Bad, Girl"". Unfortunately, when the compositions are slower and more involved, as is the case with ""Send Out Your Love"", Madlib stumbles a bit and the music tends to meander and drag. And also be warned: the album has a mellow vibe, and if you're the type who's repelled by anything that even approaches being 'smooth,' you probably won't dig this much. These are minor complaints to me, though, as I find these tracks to be interesting reinterpretations of certified classics. Stevie Wonder has long been an inspiration to hip-hop, and his repertoire has been sampled by numerous producers. Hopefully, this album will make the connection explicit and turn an entire new generation onto the man's sweet sounds.","Those of you from the 80s may find this hard to believe, but there was a time when Stevie Wonder ...

'Black Letter Days' and 'Devil's Workshop',Frank Black & the Catholics,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2f813d19756521389a9/1:1/w_160/80e0bf22.gif,2002-09-03 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/783-black-letter-days-and-devils-workshop/,spinART,"Fearing that what can soberly be said about Frank Black's new double-release would be too predictable to bear, I had the following discussion transcribed from a s√©ance during which I asked my spiritual trainer Skye-Wraith Higgins to conjure the 15-year-old me and spin the new Frank Blacks for both versions of us: Crusty Reviewer at Current Age: Frank's back, twice, and he's pissed! Sort of. When he's not striking a world-weary geetar-schlub pose, I mean. But it's about time he started stomping around in response to how every loud band since the 90s has been paying their bills with his dynamic chops. I remember once when I's working in a record store and 'the guy' from Better Than Ezra, one of the poppiest Pixies pilferers, came in and bought R.E.M.'s Murmur and the first Smiths album. We can only hope they were backup copies. Virginal Reviewer at Fifteen: I know R.E.M.! ""That's me in the corner... That's me in the spot... light..."" Hey, what's the music playing now? Sounds like a less well-produced Black Francis. Crusty: He's been Frank Black for a weird while now. He released two stellar CDs eons ago on 4AD, which eased us into his solo career like a parent slowly explaining a divorce. But then he came out with a CD on American Recordings that had Microsoft Paintbrush cover art and took two years to get into. Then he birthed a merely okay handful of records with a backup band named the Catholics. Virgin: Catholics... is he religious now? Singing about wafers and commandments? Crusty: Well, the word has other meanings, but at the time it was a kind of interesting choice. Retaining the name now, I guess, requires a nugget of moxie. Virgin: Why? What's up with the Catholics? Crusty: You don't want to know. The backup band the Catholics has been stalwart, but Black's albums with them have been kind of monotone, with lengthy, invasive solos that seem to provide loaf-breaks for Black. And the cover art has been, and still is, heinous. I don't want to sound petty, but those 4AD Pixies covers seemed three-dimensional even on cassette inserts. Black's current lame packaging is the worst on spinART. These albums look like the homemade tour-comps of an unsigned band. Virgin: This can't be Black Francis playing. It's too... conventional. The Pixies were like astronaut-punk. This is like that Costello crap that those rich jagoffs at gifted camp loved. Crusty: I wouldn't go that far, but then again I'm just a you who's been compromised by time. These two albums contain exceptional verse-chorus-verse songs, and the distance from great track to great track is never farther than a few minutes. Black's the rare elder statesman who occasionally remembers how to rock-- he's a not-boring Mould/Westerberg! I mean it, he comes alive on these albums, sounding passionate and bothered in ways he hasn't in a while, reminding us that he can still be heard haunting some great modern work by Modest Mouse and the White Stripes. Virgin: Who are they? Did Nirvana ever do anything after Bleach? Crusty: Shhh. Let the adult talk. The 65-minute, 18-song Black Letter Days showcases all of Black's known skills and even hones some new ones. It opens and closes with different version of Tom Waits' ""The Black Rider""-- one's a Satan's-cruise-ship ditty; the other's a surf-organ nightmare. Then, halfway through, Black tosses country in the mix and songs emerge with Gibb Brothers falsettos, Van Morrison beltings, even Paul Simon pluckiness. ""I Will Run After You"" could have been a Doolittle b-side. And try escaping the bouncy ""Chip Away Boy"" or the balladeering ""Cold Heart of Stone"". Virgin: Since when is sounding like the Gibb Brothers or Paul Simon a good thing? This stuff is stale. What the hell happened to this guy? Just last night the Pixies hosted Postmodern MTV, pretending to be telepathic! They just smiled at the camera during prerecorded vocal segues. They premiered the ""Here Comes Your Man"" video... and this trad-poof is all Frank Francis can muster now? Crusty: I hear you. But if nothing else, Frank's 33-minute Devil's Workshop is the punchy record that should have followed Teenager of the Year. It's full of that ching-a-ling radio sound he debuted a few times on The Cult of Ray. ""Out of State"" is sweet and driving, and ""Modern Age"" is a close-to-complacent shout-out to surrealism and post-70s rock. Virgin: Ching-a-ling don't cut it, there, Ace. Why hasn't he taken more chances with the recipe? This is what old people listen to on their way to work in the morning. Crusty: Old is how you're gonna feel when the indie-crop is too green to have bought a Pixies album when it was new, or to have even gone through an ex-post-facto phase. Be glad you're getting a taste of Devil's Workshop. The set's so unilaterally catchy that your head becomes like a bus station crowded with singing schizophrenics. The solos are incorporated into the songs' structures instead of being these ham-jammy interludes where the song stops for some reeeooowwll. Who besides Frank Black sounds cool when he whines? Virgin: You sold out or became a drunk if you dig this tame dross. Crusty: 'Dross...' I like that. Getting ready for the SAT already. No wonder only the stepdaughters of bible-study leaders liked us. But back to Black: the problem-- the big hence-my-rating problem-- is the production. The listener wishes that Frank and his posse (of six on Days, four on Workshop, with cameos by Joey Santiago and ex-Wall of Voodoo frontman Stan Ridgway) were more patient and gave these albums a semblance of a soundscape. Some guitar separation or cavernous drums, something besides the straight-to-stereo/mono crank-out. They robbed themselves of foreverness. Just listen to the difference the shimmery pedal steel makes on ""Valentine and Garuda"" and ""Southbound Bevy"". Virgin: Turn off that country shit. Crusty: That 'country shit' is going to help you through many a night, chum. I want you to buy an album by a group called Palace Brothers as soon as it comes out. And start doing sit-ups now. We've inherited Pappy's subtle man-boobs and they're getting harder to fend off. Virgin: Plus, you've got student loans and ex-wives and you're not a kickboxer. The future sucks. Crusty: The modern age may not be as dandy as Frank Black proclaims it to be, what with the brink of global catastrophe and all, but these at-least-solid platters save us from having to watch E!'s ""The Pixies Curse"" Special right after the one about ""Family Feud"".",,6.9,
Good Night Sleep,Nod,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c41b13d197565213bea2/1:1/w_160/06517e9e.jpg,2002-09-03 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5823-good-night-sleep/,Smells Like,"While it might seem an inappropriate modifier, the word on the tip of my tongue for describing Nod is 'endearing'. Might have something to do with how this jazzy lo-fi trio on Steve Shelley's indie label creates music that has been, to me, inappropriately categorized as both funk and bluegrass (depends on what you read). I think this sounds a hell of a lot like latter-day Coctails without all the bells, whistles and Archer Prewitt. The Rochester-based trio's fifth album, Good Night Sleep, is an apt soundtrack for taking the long way home. Fully loaded with slightly fractured jazzy chords and vocals just this side of falsetto, it's pretty low key, save for occasional forays into uptempo material like the opener, ""The Old Hotel"", with its dissonant take on the blues, and ""Border Song"", which alone gels the Coctails comparison and features an occasionally compelling, but largely pointless bass jam about three-quarters of the way through. Some of the best songs on this album are the instrumentals. The closing ""Universal Bonus Trac"" features a simple, repetitive guitar line meandering around a backing cello. And without the inherent structural conventions that spring up with the introduction of lyrics (sort of gratuitous for this band), the song has a nice trance-like quality. Likewise, the airy, fingerpicked ""Space Whale"". I suppose we could define this as cracked minimalist lounge music, but even with the minimalist tag, that infers a level of instrumentation, for better or worse, that is sorely lacking on this album. A better analogy might be a fairly sophisticated band's practice session if they were missing half their members and the PA. On the plus side, the production quality is dynamic to say the least-- it lends Nod an enviable level of intimacy (it quite literally sounds like the band is playing in the corner of your living room), which can be a more than a little disconcerting. Like listening to a concert without applause. Unfortunately, this also serves to exaggerate their shortcomings. I'm usually a vocal opponent of bands determined to 'make it bigger' whatever the cost, and I can't help but think this band could have used a little more studio time and some musical thickening here. There's a nice sophistication to the music-- everything seems intelligent and premeditated-- but the chosen aesthetic prevents the album from going anywhere. As a result, it flickers and fades, and its charms ultimately fall short of its seeming missteps.","While it might seem an inappropriate modifier, the word on the tip of my tongue for describing Nod is 'endearing ...

How Animals Move,John Parish,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ff19d034d5c69bf25c4/1:1/w_160/1d16912b.jpg,2002-09-03 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6167-how-animals-move/,Thrill Jockey,"John Parish has stuck five years of recordings on this record, and there's no single thread or tactic here except-- and this could just be the title-- it sounds like music about animals, or specifically, music for an animal documentary. I'm picturing one of those shows on PBS, with birds pecking around or turtles going at it. The music has elegance, though like those shows, it can be too staid or staged: it needs more violence, like a good alligator/hippo fight, or some cheetahs to chase the gazelles. Long story short: it's pleasant, but not always striking. Parish first won me over in 1996 with the blues/noise music he wrote for PJ Harvey's psycho road lyrics on their joint album Dance Hall at Louse Point. That record was the raw edgy nerve next to Harvey's electronica and trip-hop phase, and its music was the highlight from her Is This Desire tour a few years back. Parish has since worked as a guitarist and producer for bands like the Eels, Giant Sand, and Goldfrapp, but this is only his second record under his own name, and he crams several projects into its thirteen tracks. The fact that it has any continuity is due partly to Parish's production-- which is unified and gorgeous-- but also to its prevailing mellowness: from Clare Mactaggart's solo violin on ""Absolute Beauty Is an Absolute Curse"", as slow and stately as a preening flamingo, to Pat Macdonald's loping, atmospheric harmonica on ""El Merreon"". Several tracks feature Parish's big band, a dozen-strong ensemble with a brash sound centered on brass, Fender Rhodes, guitars and percussion. Parish takes the band through the soaring ""Westward Airways"", which could be the highlight of the album; but they're less successful on the title track and ""The Florida Recount"", which are loud and hammering-- the arrangements are less nuanced and the songs less enjoyable. By contrast, the small-group tracks-- and solos like Parish's Fender Rhodes piece ""Lord It's a Happy Land""-- are pretty, but they drift by like so many interludes. So it's refreshing to hear the songs that use vocalists, where Parish gives a looser and louder performance. On ""Bernadette"", the band rocks along beneath singer David Donahue's monologue with sharp guitar lines and a fleeter, less oppressive climax. That track's energy carries into the next song, ""Spanish Girls"", named for the young ladies whose singing-- captured on the beach with a cassette recorder-- haunts the melody and draws out Parish's rowdiest playing: this ain't no serenade. He also uses Donahue on ""Stable Life"", where the guitar effects and Aaron Dewey's shadow vocals turn a basic pop song into a shuffling, multi-layered piece. The bulk of the album is so stately that the last track barely fits: Parish pulls in latter-day Captain Beefheart member Eric Drew Feldman (on ""fake harmonica"") and PJ Harvey on vocals, to cover ""Airplane Blues"", a textbook 12-bar blues with some fun innuendo: ""First he turns me over, then he starts to loop-the-loop/ Takes a long time 'til his wings begin to droop."" Harvey eats it alive, but it's so odd to hear Parish let his hair down this far that it feels like a throwaway encore. And that last track demonstrates again that, although How Animals Move has solid arrangements and melodies, Parish is at his best when he mixes hard work and detail with spontaneous, rough-edged playing. It's not that the slow stuff doesn't work; it's just not as exciting or even as inventive as his rock music. If he can have so much fun behind singers, why does he get so studious on his own?","John Parish has stuck five years of recordings on this record, and there's no single thread or tactic here ...

Peanut Butter Wolf's Jukebox 45s,Various Artists,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7ef9d034d5c69bf390b/1:1/w_160/d5aed9ff.gif,2002-09-03 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2001-peanut-butter-wolfs-jukebox-45s/,Stones Throw,"Stones Throw embodies everything that is right about hip-hop today. Peanut Butter Wolf, who founded the San Francisco label and oversees its daily operations, has assembled a tight-knit group of like-minded artists who adhere to the cratedigger's ethic of vinyl archeology. But perhaps more importantly, Peanut Butter Wolf understands the commercial limitations of his label's focus and never allows expectations of profitability to muddle the Stones Throw mission to saturate the planet with the dopest beats possible. Case in point: the Jukebox 45s series. Not only are a large number of the 24 releases reissues of ridiculously obscure garage funk from the 70s, but their mere format (on old-school seven-inches formerly used for jukeboxes and edited radio singles) precludes any sort of crossover potential. And what's even more appalling from a business standpoint is that many of the other seven-inches are exclusive material from the label's most marketable artist, Madlib. And just why has PBW stuck his financial neck out for 45s, you might be wondering? Well, as he explains in the disc's liner notes, he made a promise to himself that when he got older he ""would eventually buy a jukebox for my home and have only hip-hop songs on it."" Sounds good to me. After all, hip-hop, from the act of sampling to the black artists' refusal to be tagged with their slave names, has always focused on reclaiming and reinterpreting a collective or personal past. And this desire for reclamation not only dictates the medium of the initial releases of the Stones Throw 45s, but also extends to the track selection and their placement on this compilation. If you look closely, you'll notice that an old-school soul number such as The Highlighters' ""Poppin' Popcorn"" is sandwiched between hip-hop emcee Medaphor's ""Place Your Bet"" and a new-school breakbeat track supplied by √ºber-funksters Breakestra. Placing these musical cousins side by side is a perfect example of the dynamic between influence and art that PBW is attempting to achieve with the Jukebox 45 series. The hip-hop songs on here are built upon the spirit of the funk/soul tracks that are included, while modern day bands like Breakestra and Yesterday's New Quintet are reinterpreting that funk through the lens of hip-hop. It's a circular, symbiotic relationship that is unique in the music world and results in a seamless mixture of sounds both educational and dope. Which leads us to what really matters: the music. Having been in this game for over a decade, Peanut Butter Wolf knows hip-hop, and he knows that Madlib makes good hip-hop. With the exception of the Charizma track, all of the Jukebox's traditional hip-hop songs are produced by Madlib, which is by no means a liability. Madlib's hip-hop tracks on this album can be divided into two different strains: the first consists of slightly off-kilter and jazzy productions coupled with a novel and often conceptual approach to the lyrics, while the others tracks are more straightforward, aggressive and funky. For the remix of Quasimoto's ""Microphone Mathematics"", which belongs squarely in the latter category, Madlib supplies a bassline that springs off the beat like a funkified yoyo. A chorus anchored with a sample from De La Soul's ""The Bizness"", which finds Pos scolding emcees who ""try keeping it real, yet you should try keeping it right,"" nicely complements the beat. Of course, you already know that Lord Quas keeps it right, declaring that his intention ""elevate styles beyond explication, turn up the mic [and] increase the amplification."" While it's hard to improve upon the original ""Microphone Mathematics"", this remix does at least match the original. On the quirky jazz tip, there's Dudley Perkin's ""Flowers"" and Lootpack's ""On Point"". The Dudley Perkins track was improvised and originally intended as a joke, but its ghetto pastoral fabulousness renders it too sweet to be written off as mere novelty. Although Perkins probably shouldn't quit his day job as blunted-before-breakfast emcee Declaime, his kitschy rasp on ""Flowers"" fits the track's lovely piano sample like an astral glove. The Lootpack cut, ""On Point"", features a similar, piano-based sample, although this one is a little loopier and not quite as infectious as ""Flowers"". For the vocals, Madlib literally spells out his very alliterative verses in a dizzying display of skills that will either leave you breathless or very confused. Although Madlib's brand of hip-hop has become a trademark of sorts for Stones Throw, the most intriguing tracks are the garage soul/funk reissues. The Ernie and the Top Notes' ""Things Could Be Better"" is by far the most soulful and technically accomplished. The music, with a rhythm section that displays a refrained funk while a bluesy guitar line doodles on top, captures the transition between the soulful swagger of 60s Motown and the funkadelic strut that dominated the 70s scene. Whereas ""Things Could Be Better"" conjures a late-Motown sound, the Stark Reality's ""Rocket Ship"", released in 1970, is more akin to the garage psych of Captain Beefheart or even Syd Barrett. With serrated dissonance and chanted vocals, whether or not you like this will depend upon your tolerance for lo-fi noise. While the Yesterday's New Quintet and Breakestra songs shine, Captain Funkaho's ode to the Atari 2600, ""My 2600"", takes the prize for the best nu-funk/jazz song on the album. Perhaps the most fitting way to describe this song would be to mention that it was recorded in the back room of an actual working Laundromat in Oakland. With its cheeseball vocals and rolling basslines, it perfectly captures the ghetto-dirty-laundry vibe that its setting demanded. On a side note, Bay Area indie scenesters should remember the track's female singer, Robin, from her days as a lead singer for the Lookout! Records punk group Black Fork. Over the years, Stones Throw has forged through the trends, resisted the pull of commercialism, and along the way churned out some classic material. If nothing else, their success should prove that it's possible to maintain a very personalized vision of music and run a successful record label. Although this isn't likely to endure as the quintessential Stones Throw release (that distinction, for the time being, belongs to Quasimoto's The Unseen), Peanut Butter Wolf's Jukebox 45s best captures the label's perseverance and vision. If you sleep on this, you may as well step out of the game.","Stones Throw embodies everything that is right about hip-hop today. Peanut Butter Wolf, who founded the\n\ San Francisco label ...

Denali,Denali,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b961ea9e61561daa6f9b/1:1/w_160/9b7fd92b.jpeg,2002-09-02 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2276-denali/,Jade Tree,"I feel unusually qualified to write this review. Ordinarily, Herr Schreiber tosses shit towards my desk that only the bands and their parents know exist. And, not one to disturb a happy stasis, I'll generally pen a review that ensures that things remain that way. This time, though, there are names I actually recognize: namely, bassist Keeley Davis and Mark Linkous, who produced two tracks. Keeley Davis plays guitar for Engine Down. I had the pleasure of overrating their most recent release, Demure, a couple months ago for this fine weblication. I don't know if Denali counts as a side-project or what, but one thing's for sure: Mr. Davis didn't intend the same guy to review both discs. Not a chance. It would be like submitting the same paper to two classes with the same prof. Or two of the same paper with different names to the same prof for the same class. You get what I'm saying. The point is, effective plagiarism requires cunning; repackaging Engine Down with a female singer and weaker songwriting is neither cunning nor enjoyable. The surrogate lead for Denali is Keeley's sister, Maura. She pulls that time-tested sultry, tremulous thing all album long, evoking, in her better moments, memories of Portishead's Beth Gibbons. Her melodies match the melancholy mood of her vocal timbre, using protracted, dirge-like lines for an effect that may initially seem haunting, but eventually gets pretty old. All in all, a fairly solid package from the vocalist, if somewhat repetitive. But the band? Well, from a strictly technical standpoint, they're pretty tight. They benefit, as previously noted, from the production work of Sparklehorse frontman Mark Linkous on two of the album's ten tracks, both of them sporting a few more ambient quirks than the others. Engine Down's lead guitarist and frontman, Jonathan Fuller, is particularly proficient on drums here, too. However-- and this is a big 'however'-- the band's playing sorely lacks ambition. All of Denali consists solely of minor-key electric angst, with languid orchestration and predictable compositions. No crescendos, barely discernable choruses, a dearth of interesting dynamics. The result is stagnancy, kids, and it kills the album. Denali aim for angst and melancholy. Problem is, the music is supposed to communicate angst, not cause it. Music that heads nowhere, remaining in a state of suspended animation, brings depression and anxiety to even the most emotionally stable. The result is a long, arduous, and yep, angstful listening experience. If Denali were to wake up tomorrow with some better song ideas, you never know what could happen. But they're gonna need some variation if they ever expect to make a worthwhile record.","I feel unusually qualified to write this review.

O.S.T.,People Under the Stairs,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a02d13d1975652138305/1:1/w_160/b3a1a4f3.jpg,2002-09-02 05:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6226-ost/,OM,"In the liner notes for O.S.T., People Under the Stairs producer/emcee Thes One provides a well-articulated manifesto where he defines the duo's sound as ""just good old hip-hop."" He further goes on to say that ""somewhere along the way it seems most critics decided that just making hip-hop was not good enough, and praises were hailed upon those who were 'experimental' and 'progressive'... [and] underground hip-hop became a symbol of suburban rebellion across the Internet."" This is an interesting point that reflects a growing divide within the independent/underground hip-hop community. Although hip-hop has never been aesthetically homogeneous, the curtain rift between old and new threatens divide the genre into two distinctively different sounds: The artists associated with Anticon and Warp Records' hip-hop imprint Lex press hip-hop's sound forward at an unrelenting speed that has critics heralding the emergence of a new era. While these artists wage war with their machines in suburban basements, another faction within the hip-hop community is solely dedicated to preserving the culture's heritage and, by extension, the musical fundamentals that it was built upon: deep groove samples, dope breakbeats, and simplistic, on-the-corner emceeing. With O.S.T., their third album, People Under the Stairs have made a musical tribute to these basics. And while it may not break any ground or shift any paradigms, the album is a testament to the enduring strength of straight-up, no-frills hip-hop. Thes One is so dedicated to vinyl that even his bathroom is decorated with classic soul and jazz albums. His nostalgia for the classics is pervasive throughout this record, and you can smell the 80s scent of linoleum, blunts and vinyl as he brings the rare grooves on song after song. And not only do Thes and Double K, the other member of People Under the Stairs, dig deeper than almost anyone else, they also have a great sense of how to reconstruct their samples to illicit some soul-piercing sounds. On ""Empty Bottles of Water"", they place a relaxed, rippling key line over an upbeat drum track as Thes One raps, ""I travel to the beach where each and every wave sounds like ultimate breaks and beats."" On ""Acid Raindrops"", Thes One appropriates a sample from David Walker's cover of ""Lay Lady Lay"" while guest MC Camel raps about a day-in-the-life of a So-Cal b-boy. Although People Under the Stairs flirt with soul, reggae and jazz, the key here is the funk. ""The Hang Loose"" is an old school, roller-rink jam with a funky disco bassline. Thes and Double affect an old school, Sugar Hill Gang flow and namedrop Dr. J, Kool and the Gang, and ""What's Happening""'s Rerun. On ""Tales of Kidd Drunkadelic"", a loungy keyboard bounces on top of a classic boom-bap drum track as a flute blows beneath the sample. With the seamless ease that Thes and Double K weave their samples together, their life-long obsession with their music is apparent and infectious. Unfortunately, lyrics aren't the duo's strong suit. The lyrics generally revolve around their obsession with hip-hop culture, their love of alcohol/herb, and the (often uninteresting) minutia of their daily lives. But given the celebratory funk that the music conjures, the relatively light and redundant subject matter isn't much of a liability. After all, this isn't music for wannabe Lyotards twiddling their thumbs and worrying about some linguistic apocalypse; this is music for playing dominos and sipping on 40s. This is for those lazy days wasted on blunts and lounging by the pool. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.","In the liner notes for O.S.T., People Under the Stairs producer/emcee Thes One provides a well-articulated manifesto ...

Pajama Avenue,Zelienople,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab3fb1335d7bf16997e9/1:1/w_160/fff71f24.gif,2002-09-02 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8943-pajama-avenue/,Loosethread,"The quality of a record doesn't always correlate very well with the amount of stuff that can be said about it, which might prove an issue here. But it seems-- both journalistically and morally-- sort of just wrong to set a critical land speed record talking about an album as solid-but-not-brilliant as this one is, so we'll try to give it some thought. Zelienople are a pretty good band from Chicago, and they've released the very badly titled Pajama Avenue on Loose Thread Recordings, a label that's been taking care of the city's spacier bands for a few years now. They're not really a post-rock band, or a slowcore band, or a shoegazer band, but they sound like a lot of each, and also like a lot of those damned good 'lost generation' bands-- bands like Bark Psychosis and Disco Inferno, and records like Slowdive's last one. They're equally likely to remind you of a less gritty Crescent, a less earthy Movietone, a more abstracted American Analog Set, or a sleepier Bedhead. Or the big clumsy tag we'll all follow: Yo La Tengo's And then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out. Only turn down the sweetie pop and crank up the steely eyes. All of which is to say that Zelienople are infinitely mellow, spacy and subdued. Drums sketch out hypnotic heartbeat rhythms and build splashes of cymbal; bass pulses steadily along; guitar echoes and swells in cushy pads and drones; organs hum; sometimes a heavily reverbed clarinet winds meditatively through. A significant percentage of Zelienople's instruments are filtered through delay effects, and one of their many skills is near-perfect coordination between the blissy major-key bits of this and the more darkly hypnotic bits, which keeps a helpful internal tension running through each of these tracks. More to the point, though, they've settled on a workable sound and they use it quite effectively. For some of us, you understand, it's difficult not to like this sort of thing in the first place: it's a beautiful and massively rewarding trick of scale. Sounds move by in such contemplative slow motion that the slightest bits of texture seem like revelations-- every sound accrues this layer of determination and intensity around it. The whole thing can drift peacefully by, but a little attention reveals an immensely dramatic topography of texture and movement. The songs pulse and plod so subtly onward that when things click and shift within them, it can seem like an earthquake. And Zelienople, despite their embarrassing album-naming gaffe, are really quite terrific with the execution of this sort of thing. Which is what tempts that aforementioned critical speed record: yes, they're good, no argument. If you like this sort of thing, you'll be anything from pleased to outright captivated. If you don't, move along. The other possibility is that perhaps you do like this sort of thing, but have burned out on its creeping growth through the indie underbrush-- in which it's my considered opinion that you'd still quite enjoy this but should maybe take the cue to move on anyway. Personally, I'll be keeping this one around: it'll come in handy some night when the indie stoners are over.","The quality of a record doesn't always correlate very well with the amount of stuff that can be said ...

Son of Evil Reindeer,Reindeer Section,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a24dc0084474cd0bffee/1:1/w_160/efbcca52.jpg,2002-09-02 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6746-son-of-evil-reindeer/,PIAS,"Melancholy is the primary fuel source of indie rock, the emotional petroleum that drives the creative engine of a thousand guitar-wielding Droopy Dans and Dianes. To extend the metaphor, the most oil-rich region of the world is undoubtedly the United Kingdom, with Scotland serving as the Saudi Arabia crown jewel of resource surplus. I've never set foot in the land of kilts, bagpipes, and Groundskeeper Willie, but I've watched enough British Open television coverage to know that sun is an exceptionally rare commodity in this squall-laden territory. One can almost imagine Scotsmen harvesting bushels of gloom from beneath their many moors, a candidate in its own right for most depressing environmental feature. So then, it's no surprise that rainy day rock royalty Belle & Sebastian hail from Scotland, as well as many lesser members of the genre's nobility: Arab Strap, Mogwai, Astrid, Eva, and so on. All of the above have sent representatives Parliament-style to back up Snow Patrol's Gary Lightbody and his Reindeer Section project, first last year with the decidedly un-British-sounding Y'all Get Scared Now, Ya Hear! and again with the shiny new Son of Evil Reindeer. For the second album, Lightbody adds even more countrymen to his stable, signing up Cobain idol Eugene Kelly of the Vaselines, Idlewild's Roddy Woomble, and Teenage Fanclub's Norman Blake. Guess we'll have to wait until album #3 to get the Bay City Rollers. Unfortunately, it's a telling fact that, despite all these, um, famous names, the most compelling track on Son of Evil Reindeer is ""Where I Fall,"" the one track stripped down to just Lightbody playing folksinger solitaire. It's not that the contributions aren't competent, but for such a varied cast of characters, the arrangements are surprisingly familiar. Only B&S; trumpetman Mick Cooke, who provides typically playful and catchy horn flourishes throughout, and vocal contributions from Kelly, Arab Strap's Aidan Moffat, and Eva's Jenny Reeve register as anything more than just session work from the carefully assembled starpower. It's the vocal combinations Lightbody seems most concerned with, though, and the guest appearances provide a bit of a palate to choose from for the task of coloring in his song sketches. Most of the male mic-men (Lightbody, Blake, Woomble) bring similar shades of buttermilk croon to the table, but Moffat shines with a disinterested thick lilt over the minor chord piano swirls of ""Whodunnit."" Reeve's harmonies make already plush songs all the more pillowy, combining with Lightbody for a half-thawed Low sound on ""Cartwheels"" and ""Budapest"". Still, there's very little on Son of Evil Reindeer to perk up the ears for anyone with more than a couple Jeepster products in their Case Logic. Its twelve songs all chart somewhere between the low point of dullish (drum machine snoozer ""Who Told You?"", the uncomfortably anthemic ""You Are My Joy"") and the high point of pleasant (frown-pop gem ""Strike Me Down""). All too often Lightbody's compositions resort to textbook dynamics, most commonly of the soft-acoustic-pluck-gradually-changing-into-string-and-brass-laden-lush-peak sort (consult ""Grand Parade"" or ""Cartwheels"" for context). All the same, at the Nick Drake Memorial Melancholy Pop World Championships, the Reindeer Section is a tough Dream Team to beat, with only the equally rain-soaked Northwest U.S. squad the Long Winters able to match up. And while Son of Evil Reindeer could be pretty easily interchanged with the day job projects of any single member participating, the fact remains that the Scottish do this kind of mostly cloudy ambience better than any other autonomous region, and a sampling of their near-best talent provides just about exactly what you would expect. Like a rainy Sunday, it's soothing in small quantities, but may induce restlessness over extended periods.","Melancholy is the primary fuel source of indie rock, the emotional petroleum that drives the creative engine of a thousand ...

"As Heard on Radio Soulwax, Pt. 2",2 Many DJs,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8589d034d5c69bf3a0f/1:1/w_160/36a17fd7.jpg,2002-08-29 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8228-as-heard-on-radio-soulwax-pt-2/,PIAS,"Bootlegs! They're not just Maxell XLIIs with fuzzy recordings of that acoustic Smashing Pumpkins Tower Records appearance anymore! Bootlegs! Compilations of which are finding their way onto even the most esteemed criticos' mid-year best-of lists! Bootlegs! Their pissing-on-copyright-laws approach poetically mirrors-- and is, one might argue, made possible by-- the wonders of digital file-sharing! Bootlegs! Quasi-anonymous 2 Many DJs are the kings of the bootleg mountain. Otherwise known as Soulwax, the Belgian duo (brothers Stephen and David Dewaele) has released some of the genre's most popular MP3s, many of which sprang to notoriety after being posted to Boomselection, the web's primary resource for this new music. As Heard on Radio Soulwax Pt 2 is their first full-length release as bootleggers (they actually started out as a rock band), but genre classification aside, the album is really just a very cohesive, hour-long DJ mix. This incarnation of the 25-year-old artform, however, seems to be kicking up quite a bit of fuss amongst those 'in the know.' But what's the big deal? According to my analysis, four incredibly deep, insightful conclusions can be reached from the album's content: This has been the manifesto of the bootleg movement from day one, or at least since the Freelance Hellraiser's ""A Stroke of Genius"" started making the Internet rounds. Effortlessly merging the biggest hits of Christina Aguilera and The Strokes played a galactic prank on the hipsters of the world, showing that their latest pet band was just a few mouse clicks away from being the latest teenie pop sample loop. Nothing on Radio Soulwax is quite so subversive, but the integration of the thick-glasses crowd's favorite bands-- the Velvet Underground, The Breeders, The Stooges-- into what's basically a club house mix might ruffle some feathers. Who would've known ""I'm Waiting for My Man"" was just a Sly & The Family Stone tambourine away from being a party anthem? Who'd've thunk ""No Fun"" or ""Cannonball"" wrapped so perfectly around aged rap tracks from Salt N' Pepa and Skee-Lo? Nobody, actually, and that's part of the fun. Beyond this valiant mission, the dexterous wrists of 2 Many DJs appear to strive for even higher, more artistically lofty accomplishments with their mix. Witness, for example, the middle 20 minutes of the album, a movement largely devoid of mainstream-recognizable tunes. Dropping music from the household-name likes of Funkacise Gang, Alphawezen, and Zongamin, the duo slaps rhythm against rhythm in calculated haphazardry, creating new sounds sure to earn ever-more-arcane classifications from the self-appointed genre taxonomists. You might argue such experimentation is instant death to the album's boogie-boogie purpose, and is even  a bit middling. Or you might argue that I and others are convincing ourselves of this objective's presence in order to wax intellectual about a pop music collection. On certain occasions, I'd be obliged to agree with you. Because really: Dolly Parton into Rokysopp? Early New Order vs. house sleazeballs Detroit Grand Pubahs? These are combinations designed to provoke disbelief and mirth on the first listen-- which they do, admirably. But thereafter, as with the vast majority of DJ mixes, the Law of Diminishing Entertainment Returns applies more readily-- these krazy kombos are certainly worth the download-time to hear at least once, but the audio trickery wears out fast. Compounding the problem is the inclusion of fairly pointless pre-processed kitsch, like the techno covers of ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" and ELO's falsetto favorite ""Don't Bring Me Down"". Choosing to include the electro-fied versions of other mixing board pranksters is surely an odd decision, and resembles smirking in a hall of mirrors, with all the fun-or-headache debate that implies. So what's the real, overarching √ºber-purpose? And hell, don't assume from our web address that I think there's anything wrong with a little self-promotion! 2 Many DJs show off their renovatin' stuff on Radio Soulwax, and their stuff ain't too shabby. Witness Destiny's Child's TRL fave ""Independent Women Pt 1,"" transformed into a 70s lite-funk groover by the addition of 10cc's ""Dreadlock Holiday."" (Mere coincidence that Beyonce's movie-driven first solo step had similar funktastical leanings?) The duo also definitively proves that nothing goes with the gleefully self-aware over-the-top house of Basement Jaxx like the hilariously oblivious prog of Emerson, Lake & Palmer. The hybridization of ""Where's Your Head At"" and a live take on ""Theme from 'Peter Gunn'"" has got BANG!-- you can already envision Pringles' ad execs riffling their Rolodexes. Despite all my hypothesizing and yelling about stuff, I concede that Radio Soulwax is a good time. I don't know that it's groundbreaking, beyond the fact that whatever this bootlegging craze is the start of could eventually yield fantastic results. At this point, though, all I hear is a temporary house-party enhancer that, while fun for a while, isn't the kind of thing you're going to come back to in five years (or even two) to find that it's withstood the test of time. Enjoy it while you can.","Bootlegs! They're not just Maxell XLIIs with fuzzy recordings of that acoustic Smashing Pumpkins Tower\n\ Records appearance anymore ...

This Is My Ampbuzz,Ampbuzz,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a08aea9e61561daa45b7/1:1/w_160/224e3d8b.jpg,2002-08-29 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/171-this-is-my-ampbuzz/,Strange Attractors Audio House,"On the one hand, the name of this project by Kinski guitarist Chris Martin tells you a lot. The mere mention of the words 'amp' and 'buzz'; next to each other is a Pavlovian bell causing salivation in DroneOn list regulars, and Ampbuzz delivers on the promise of its name, with plenty of long, extended chords to be savored. And yet, if you were to venture to guess what kind of drone music you'd expect from a band going by the name, you'd probably think of something subdued and quiet, with tones only slightly less uniform than the ones emitted by kitchen appliances. Not so with This Is My Ampbuzz. Instead, this is dynamic, varied head music that looks back to the dawn of instrumental psychedelia for inspiration. Something about the vibe throughout the record seems very early 70s-- back when the Floyd and a few German pioneers were launching the longhairs into orbit. The retro vibe is apparent in the first minute of the album, as ""Bubbles"" opens with some heavily flanged keyboard squiggles that sound as though they come from a wire-ensnared black box the size of a small living room. The primitive nature of the synthetic devices on this track has a pleasantly historic trippiness that reminds me a little of Norwegian organist Bo Hansson's bent imaginary soundtrack to the Lord of the Rings. Insofar as Ampbuzz is ambient, it's definitely on the darker side. The last three songs-- titled in sequence ""Diving Instructions"", ""Welcome to the Ocean Floor"", and ""Underwater Bomb""-- hint that this isn't going to be a ""let's drift gently through the clouds"" sort of ride. ""Diving Instructions"" is a slowburn track, as guitar feedback and cymbal clashes gradually merge into some kind of death rattle. And then ""Welcome to the Ocean Floor"" is claustrophobic with endlessly pulsating echoes, as guitar groans and synth pulses (there has to be an ARP 2600 in their somewhere) evoke a pea-soup thick tension. It takes me back to the first Experimental Audio Research album, another dense drone classic that sounded out of step at the time of its release. The closing ""Underwater Bomb"" does not detonate as promised-- instead we get a yearning keyboard drone coupled with some melodic, Ash Ra Tempel-style guitar leads on top. In a world of anal-retentive ambient laptop music, where each sound seems meticulously designed to seem 'alien' and difficult to place, Ampbuzz records an evocative instrumental album where all the sounds come from gear designed for making music. Guitars and assorted modular synths do the bulk of the work, I imagine, and the sleeve indicates that everything was recorded to \xBD-inch tape. I'm not sure if it works in spite of its throwback nature or because of it, but these frayed and slightly crude tracks sound damn refreshing.","On the one hand, the name of this project by Kinski guitarist Chris Martin tells you a lot.

Weird War,Weird War,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9f35e6ef959693214d9/1:1/w_160/7ee2b029.jpg,2002-08-29 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8617-weird-war/,Drag City,"Lock up your leftover dignity and break out the chain-link chastity-thongs, because that squirrely lust-gospel demigod Ian Svenonius (Nation of Ulysses, Make-Up) has extended his career-long tradition of prestigious-label-hopping and released the first-ever party album on Drag City that works. Forget the learning-disabled dance-thud of King Kong or the road-to-nowhere splack of Chestnut Station; forget the omnipresent Drag City insincerity smirking up the fun-- this disc'll have you blaring its hits out of your Cutlass and smoking non-filtereds in the parking lot at Barely Legal Wings & Biscuits. Weird War, which includes the Make-Up's Michelle Mae and Royal Trux's Neil ""Michael"" Hagerty, debuted quietly on last year's indie rock opera Colonel Jeffrey Pumpernickel alongside Stephen Malkmus, Guided by Voices, Black Heart Procession, and a host of other crop-creamers. So the band's name isn't purposely a reference to the current geopolitical clusterfuck (nor do I detect any references to the comic book Weird War Tales). The song ""Weird War"" is, in fact, a lovely, folky Mae ode to doomed romance that calls to mind the best Kim Gordon cool-downs of the 90s. The other twelve 2\xBD-minute songs, however, constitute some of the finest frenetic slop-rock of the year, a beefed-up cousin of the Make-Up's singles batch I Want Some. The band holds a guitar clinic for chunky-style licks, unafraid to cop 'boogie' tones and throw crystalline pedal-fests-- you might think Svenonius has hijacked your local moldy-classic station. ""Burgers and Fries"" is a big-wad juke-joint take on the riff from the Beatles' ""Come Together"" (aka Chuck Berry's ""You Can't Catch Me"") that refrains the ugly bumper sticker ultimatum ""ass, cash, or grass/ Nobody rides for free""; ""Ibex Club"" boasts warped horns and a recorder-jam, as if Sonic Youth was conducting a frumpy Veterans' Day Parade marching band; and punk come-hitherings like the raucous ""Pick Up the Phone and Ball"" sure enough don't grow on trees. Elsewhere, the phased-to-oblivion guitars of ""Who's Who"" burst into a bass-and-banjo bridge, and ""FN Rat""'s sashaying chords are simply pimpier than anything on the slow-burning Save Yourself. Ian still wields his panic-attack howl, just shy of annoyingly, like he could way back on the Make-Up's fake live album when they were the only group on Dischord sporting silk shirts, and the lyrics still disguise pleasing him as a privilege: ""Don't kiss me on the mouth!/ When you can kiss me anywhere else."" As with the Make-Up's catalog, Weird War's packaging is just as entertaining as the disc. Here you get a horrible cover collage that looks like one of Daniel Johnston's hellscapes: look closely for the fascist hedgehog with the tommy gun, General Sherman, and God getting a sensual massage from a lamb. The notes are an ""interview"" from Hype Hair magazine (consult your newsstand) in which this band perpetuates the Make-Up's velveteen habit of overcontextualizing their rump-shakery as heralding an anarchist revolution. The manifesto is hilarious and informative, providing clues to Weird War's spontaneous song generation (the band professes to have followed the ""Texas Instrument Calculator theory of minimal circuitry and isolated components"") but also analyzes the Beatles' militarism and punk's emergence as ""an attempt to frighten Jackson Browne."" After the White Stripes cashed in with similar retro-riff enthusiasm and schticky uniformity, and Arthur Lee's freedom dulled the Make-Up's anthem ""Free Arthur Lee"", I feared Svenonius's future would lead to inane preciousness, or worse, Ian sounding like Arsenio Hall's sketchy reverend in Coming to America-- an elated husk of himself playing shows advertised as ""An Evening With..."" But with Weird War comes new, escapist life. The rating above is no slight; it's exactly what this unambitious high-stepper was aiming for. You're going to need to borrow some of the A*Team's chloroform after playing this one for your guests.","Lock up your leftover dignity and break out the chain-link chastity-thongs, because that squirrely\n\ lust-gospel demigod Ian Svenonius (Nation ...

Lion Destroyed the Whole World,Track Star,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7f0c0084474cd0c0cf4/1:1/w_160/c064dd9b.jpg,2002-08-28 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8126-lion-destroyed-the-whole-world/,Better Looking,"Hey, is there a name for that approach that's sort of like minimalism but not really minimalist? Like, your conventional pop material is there, except that's all there is-- everything is stripped back to clean, functional lines, like a more elaborate version of a Mondrian painting. Is there a term for that? Because that's what Track Star do. You might know Track Star's Wyatt Cusick from indie-pop darlings the Aislers Set, whose The Last March he played bass and sang a couple songs on. Track Star is sort of 'his' project, and they don't sound a whole lot like the Aislers: less frilly, less twee, and they don't go for the Byrdsy ""San Francisco sound"" the Aislers do. If they sound like anyone from the area it's Imperial Teen, who use the same trick-warm guitars, songs clicking or jangling along on just a few chords, every melody very deliberately meant as a hook, mood going from bratty to precious by turns. Imperial Teen do it more flashily and interestingly, but the odd thing about Track Star is that it's precisely their lack of being interesting that makes them charming. I honestly mean that. Their first album was called Communication Breaks-- I've just realized that its cover really does look like ""a more elaborate version of a Mondrian painting""-- and it was this great, slow sleeper: not a lot seemed to be going on in it, but it made excellent company. Bits were whispery, bits were punkily fizzy and speedy. Mostly, it had a casual quality that could break amusingly forward-- one track was just unison shouting and acoustic guitar abuse, and another got through a verse worth of pop-hit material before the guys decided to try on their metal yells. Even the lyrics had this weird charm-- deliberately conventional, bald-faced, and almost cleverly just-there. It started like this: ""There are three ideas in my head/ One's to suck on fumes til I'm dead/ One's to cover the city in flames/ And one's to run to the roof/ And then shout out your name."" Whereas this album is, like, mature, which at points is a shame and at points is commendable. The same process takes place: the songs start off seeming massively boring-- like by-numbers paintings done only in primary colors-- but gradually reveal themselves to be pretty fascinating on some near-subliminal level. And the newly 'sophisticated' writing-- meaning 'still less sophisticated than most bands'-- sometimes works itself into a rigidly arranged sweetness that's reminiscent of recent Ladybug Transistor, with hooks that originally seemed a bit lame eventually seeming near-brilliantly subtle. On the other hand, a lot of the hooks really aren't as good, even the ones borrowed from the last record. And Matthew Troy, who has a very poor voice indeed, is given a really unconscionable amount of space to inflict it upon us. Thus, a lot of the moments which make Track Star sound like more than just a side project-- ""The One We Play"", which fills in for prime Kleenexgirlwonder now that Graham Smith's gone dumb, or the terrific tag-team of ""Goodbye to the Dream"" and ""Something to Do""-- get balanced to zero by plodding drags like ""Amy Tell Me Why"" and ""Cross Country"". At points, Track Star seem as likeable as Unrest. At points, they make me feel like a chump for having typed that. Regardless, I keep throwing both this and Communication Breaks on. Casually, between things I actually want to listen to. And I keep being interested in something in there, something about an indie-pop band that doesn't seem to be trying anything at all. They might be the best sneakily boring-sounding band in the world-- and so long as I can't quite figure out whether that's a compliment or not, I'll probably keep listening.","Hey, is there a name for that approach that's sort of like minimalism but not really minimalist?

Missionless Days,Kepler,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb7eeb335119a49eca4e/1:1/w_160/03e219fe.jpg,2002-08-28 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4402-missionless-days/,Troubleman Unlimited,"Some emotions are easy to put your finger on. That girl at work you've had your eye on agrees to get a beer with you, you're happy. That same girl, after seeing you regularly for a few months, decides she's not attracted to you and tells you so, you're sad. You find out this girl, the one you saw for a while there, was lying to you and actually found someone new but didn't have the guts to tell you, you're angry. You wake up the morning after hearing this terrible news in a dried pool of your own vomit, with a CD by hair farmers Junkyard blaring on repeat, you feel disgust, wondering how in the hell Brian Baker used to be in Minor Threat. We've all been there. Then there are the moments where a few different feelings tug at you simultaneously, and you feel uncertain and confused. This discordant state is at the heart of these Kepler songs. Ottawa's slowcore maestros, who opened for Godspeed You Black Emperor! on a European tour earlier this year, find that kernel of doubt in the happy moment and the edge of comfort in sadness, and blow the swirling mess up to billboard size. These songs are brimming with such internal conflict. ""Let Us Rest as Mutes"" has the kind of songwriting focus I'm talking about. It's a weary plea for sleep addressed to the girl at the narrator's side, begging her not to pay attention to his bitchy quips: ""Darling, I implore you to ignore my foolish taunts,"" he sings. ""The words I speak are nothing but decoration for my wrongs."" Anyone who's ever launched into a stupid fight at 1:00am can relate to the closing line, ""Tonight I'm begging, baby, let us rest as fucking mutes for one last time."" The very spare and Low-like ""A Workhorse,"" is another lament for rest, with nuggets of surreal detail like, ""Walking up my street, I catch the 22-hour nightspot on siesta: waitresses asleep on tables and floors."" On Missionless Days, Kepler sounds paradoxically both more careful and more confident. The melodies and arrangements are meticulously constructed, with instrumental touches like piano and organ now fully integrated into the two-guitar/bass/drum sound-- yet they never sound fussy, and the songs seem to fall in place naturally. Kepler's secret weapon is John Higney, who contributes gorgeous lap steel to a handful of tracks, lending an airy, high lonesome sound to Missionless Days. The record breathes. Esteemed Pitchfork editor Ryan Schreiber concluded his review of Kepler's last effort on Troubleman Unlimited Fuck Fight Fail by saying, ""...the boys have got promise, and their next album will likely shock this one into submission."" He was on the money.","Some emotions are easy to put your finger on. That girl at work you've had your eye on agrees ...

Recordings of Music for Film,Vincent Gallo,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bee2c0084474cd0c2f5b/1:1/w_160/71076999.jpg,2002-08-28 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3385-recordings-of-music-for-film/,Warp,"If you know Vincent Gallo at all, it's probably from his work in film: he's an actor, and he directed and starred in the minor indie hit Buffalo '66. But Gallo also has a sketchy music career that predates his acting. Check out the bio on his website, where you can laugh at his feeble attempts to 'shock' you with his casual slurs against blacks, Jews, and redheads. (""By the way, did you ever notice the smell of redheads? I think that's why a lot of redhead girls have Black boyfriends. They smell compatible."") In New York City in the '70s, he played clubs like CBGB's in a band with Jean-Michel Basquiat. But that band broke up, and to quote Gallo, ""a month later [Basquiat] was a millionaire art star. Sometimes it's good to be Black."" Yeah, and having talent doesn't suck, either. This new release on Warp Records sells Gallo's music on the back of his film career. Recordings of Music for Film includes the soundtracks, written and performed by Gallo, from four of his movies: The Way It Is (1978), If You Feel Froggy, Jump (1979), Downtown '81 (1981), and the only one you'll find at the video store, Buffalo '66 (1998). I don't make a habit of listening to film scores any more than I sit around flipping through set design books or looking at lighting plans. Too often the music can't stand on its own, and it expects us to cut it some slack because we know it's a subordinate work. Gallo's scores are a textbook example: they're made of successfully moody background music that's just awfully tedious on an hour-long disc. It's been a while since I watched Buffalo '66, yet I still remember the flat, grey shots of that grim city, whose last renaissance died on the slogan ""Buffalo Has Wings!"" Recordings of Music for Film's only strength is that it achieves the same dreariness, assisted by the lo-fi recording (it sounds like it was mostly mastered from vinyl) which rubs any brightness from the sound. But moodiness can't carry the album. The pieces each sound dully repetitive-- it's as if Gallo found a way to make each instrument sound creepy and just stopped there. The playing meanders-- a loosely strummed guitar, woodblocks clacking, synthesizers sustaining, and the occasional horn, like the whistling tea-kettle sax sound on ""Ass Fucker"", or the more graceful clarinet on ""Her Smell Theme"", one of the few pieces with a melody. The tracks from Buffalo '66 are the most inventive, including the dreamy synth layers of ""A Wet Cleaner"", and the muffled bump-and-grind ""Drowning in Brown"" that could have been recorded in an alley behind a nightclub. The singer on ""Lonely Boy"" sounds mortally creepy, sounding dazed as she wanders through the cracked lyrics: ""Daddy, you sure eat a lot of snacks..."" This is Gallo's album, so he leaves out the movie's best song-- ""Heart of the Sunrise"" by Yes-- but at least he cribs from ""Roundabout"" on ""With Smiles & Smiles & Smiles"": he copies (but dumbs down) Steve Howe's acoustic intro, and hearing it is like listening to some guy down the hall who practices the song over and over and over again but never gets it right. And that's the biggest problem with Recordings of Music for Film: it sounds like a home studio project, a whole album of ideas that sound almost-clever but go absolutely fucking nowhere. Nothing's compelling, the performance is, when at its best, average, and although the atmosphere is as thick as muddy slush, that gets old fast. Gallo may have cred in the movie business, but as a recording artist, he's still just ""that guy who was in a band with Basquiat.""","If you know Vincent Gallo at all, it's probably from his work in film: he's an actor, and ...

Wiretap Scars,Sparta,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a503b1335d7bf1698ad5/1:1/w_160/376b70f3.jpg,2002-08-28 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7404-wiretap-scars/,Dreamworks,"'Accessible' is such a loaded word in the music world, as you generally hear it in association with bands who have compromised their artistic integrity to appease A&R; men and ""move units"" of their latest releases. But sometimes, a band is just plain accessible-- no compromising, no 'selling out,' no conspiracy. And face it: there are days when La Monte Young is just too extravagantly post-modern for your mood and Acid Mothers' blacklight psychedelia simply freaks you out. Sparta, friends. That's all I'm saying. Jim Ward, Paul Hinojos and Tony Hajjar have kept in practice since At the Drive-In called for an ""indefinite hiatus"" last year, and their debut album as Sparta, Wiretap Scars, seems out to prove just that. Their aesthetic, of course, is somewhat different than At the Drive-In's; where ATDI was a surge of fried distortion and frayed, twisted nerves communicated through ruthless aggression and synaptic attacks, Sparta are (you guessed it) more accessible in every department: their music bursts with solid hooks, their production has been given a good shine, and, with the spotlight turned away from Cedric Bixler and Omar Rodriguez, they even look more like standard-fare indie everymen with nondiscript t-shirts and normal-guy haircuts. True, Sparta probably doesn't stand a chance against ATDI in the originality department-- their sound is, frankly, like At the Drive-In crossed with pretty much every guitar-centric group fortunate enough to make it past the Clear Channel family-filters. Yet, despite this, they've managed to broaden the nervous-tic angst-rock of their previous band into something more readily adaptable without reducing it to mealy-mouthed pop regurge. Because of this, Wiretap Scars does lack some of the screamy immediacy of Relationship of Command, but it's certainly more balanced. That Ward's frantic guitar lines haven't changed much since the last time he went down on record won't make any headlines, and since his guitar sets the tone for the majority of the album-- well, you Young Sherlock Holmeses have probably already solved that mystery. Sparta's real 'film at eleven'-sized surprise, however, isn't the musical similarity to their parent group, but how closely Ward's vocals stick to Cedric Bixler's signature formula. Now, I love me some ATDI, but I never much cared for Bixler's, uh, vocalizing, and Ward refines Cedric's style to more of a ""quiet/loud/quiet/gyaaaah"" sort of thing that sits a bit better with me. His throatly howl skirts along the edge (arms flailing, pebbles falling, toes over the edge-- that close to going over) of the dreaded precipice of ""emo"" or ""screamo"" or ""just someone please put a fucking bullet in my skull""-- whatever media whores like myself are calling it these days. Fortunately, Ward avoids full-on cord-shredding, so even the shouts keep hold of the melody. But back to the instruments, shall we? I might have browbeaten this ATDI vs Sparta bit enough by now, but I'm just going with what's applicable-- and just as the vocals sound like a more melodic (yet equally intense) take on The Drive-Ins, the music has been filtered through about 50 kHz of radio bandwidth. That is, the bass pounds a little heavier, the skins hit a little cleaner, and the guitars are a bit more direct, and all in the most unobtrusive way possible. But the biggest change is that Sparta are less concerned with noise and screeching feedback-- Wiretap Scars is straightforward, nervy rock, and its delicate, tension-fueled atmosphere doesn't leave much room for ATDI's poised-on-the-brink brand of unsteadiness or ultra-dense structures. Still, all this traveling lighter comes at a cost of its own, leaving Sparta somewhat lacking at times. Of course, music that pushes boundaries or challenges the listener tends to have more staying power, and Sparta most assuredly do neither. You're likely to hear any number of these tracks (notably ""Cataract"" or ""Sans Cosm"") riding the questionable coattails of such crowdpleasers as Nickelback and Mest on ""Total Request Live"". But this, magically, fails to diminish Wiretap Scars, since there are still a few tracks 'difficult' enough to never hit the major media outlets. ""Cut Your Ribbon"" is simply splintering, power-hungry rock, showcasing the record's most memorable vocals, and the immediate follow-up, ""Air"", employs languid electronic backing tones and a strong contrast of moods before building to a breakneck chorus. Scars seldom slows its pace, receding only a couple of times for a mid-tempo breather, and, to put it in as direct terms as possible, it's damn fun. Sparta have made what seems to be a conscious decision to forsake innovation in the name of refinement, and they handle it well, never coming off like the almost-ran ATDI retreads they had such potential to. And come to think of it, Wiretap Scars isn't even particularly unchallenging-- the band just chooses to issue their challenge to wind instead of smashing their listeners in the chops. Which, at last, proves the age-old adage that music doesn't always haven't to bust your jaw to get your attention.","'Accessible' is such a loaded word in the music world, as you generally hear it in association with bands who ...

Guess Who This Is: A Tribute to Dom Leone,Various Artists,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcdeea9e61561daa759a/1:1/w_160/5844843e.gif,2002-08-27 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4742-guess-who-this-is-a-tribute-to-dom-leone/,Two Ton Santa,"Do you know Dom Leone? I'm just coming to terms with the man myself, though I will report steady progress on that front. After years of discovering the ins and outs of life and music, and more than my share of mistakes with both, I had come to a point where I thought I was prepared for just about anything. That is, until Ryan sent me this CD, and I found out that not only had I been caught unaware of the songs, I hadn't really ever known Dom Leone at all. In this case, I thought it best to start fresh with an introduction to the guy. As much as I'd have liked to say I got a CD of my own music reviewed at Pitchfork (written by myself, in a double-reverse coup of the site's integrity), I must admit that Guess Who This Is is actually a tribute to the late co-founder of eclectic folk-rockers Ed's Redeeming Qualities. Leone died of cancer in 1989, shortly before the band released its first full-length, More Bad Times, on Flying Fish. Judging by the songs on this set, his quirky brand of folk, incorporating aspects of country, rock and lots of humor (as well as kitchen-sink instrumentation) found lots of ways to inform the sound of the band. Guess Who This Is collects performances of family, friends and bandmates playing several of Leone's songs, and makes the case that he might have been one of the brighter spots in 90s alternative music-- especially in light of the popularity of bands like Uncle Tupelo and Wilco. Now, we all know that tribute albums are usually no good for two reasons: 1) they're comprised of b-list bands performing third-rate versions of songs by artists who were probably dead in the public consciousness long before they got their tribute; and 2) the performances, already of little interest to anyone but hyper-fanatics, rarely stand any chance of elaborating on original versions. Guess Who This Is is able to withstand those criticisms almost in spite of itself: the bands are most likely completely unfamiliar to anyone but each other, and the tributee only slightly less so. So, you could think of this as Dom Leone's debut record. Leone seemed to have specialized in the mundane observances we take for granted, and spun them into short, poignant vignettes. ""More Bad Times"", performed by Curtis Harvey (of Loftus), laments having not enough tragic moments to a gentle country waltz. Harvey's wobbly whine suits the easy protest perfectly, and accordion, slide guitar and plaintive piano lend the tune an elegant veneer. ""Guess Who This Is"" offers a similar listing technique, but applied to the details of several different people (or perhaps several sides of one person). Its loosely defiant tempo and balladeering, modern folk style is handled expertly by The Buckets (featuring Early Butter, who played with an early version of The Breeders, who in turn covered the Ed's Redeeming Qualities tune ""Drivin' on 9"" on Last Splash). Where this disc is likely to fall short with newcomers to Leone's music is in the occasional lapses into over-preciousness. Music Night's performance of ""My Apartment"" is cute the first time, but the singer's monotone vocal and the goofy steel drums get a bit over-precious after a while. Similarly, the horn-driven ""Song Nancy Hates"" and ""Sweater"" seem more kiddie-show silly than merely whimsical. Dom Leone never got a chance to hear these songs performed in front of a wider audience than his local New Hampshire fans. For those people, this release will undoubtedly be a warm reunion with a clearly inspired observer. To the rest of you strangers, feel free to make yourself at home. This music isn't likely to set hearts aflame with incendiary passion and drama, but for a summer evening on the back porch, it could strike your chord.","Do you know Dom Leone?

One Beat,Sleater-Kinney,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a452ea9e61561daa4e9e/1:1/w_160/63cc1809.jpg,2002-08-27 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7237-one-beat/,Kill Rock Stars,"I have issues with women in rock. Not so much the actual act of female human beings playing that rock n' roll music, but the entire media concept of in-quotes ""women in rock."" I'm tired of Rolling Stone double issues, the VH1 theme weeks, the Tower Records special displays. Condescending, patronizing bullshit, all of it. Now, I won't get into the issue of the built-in misogyny in the rock criticism phrasebook; partially because I wouldn't want to endorse a paranoid shift towards excessively vigilant political correctness, and partially because I myself am guilty of occasionally over-using the adjective 'sultry.' No, at hand is a bigger fish-- namely, that far too much writing about female musicians gets caught up with the idea that the artist must be saying something about the 'female experience.' Rather than accept these acts as just plain musicians, being a woman playing rock music is automatically assumed to be a declaration of activist intentions. Other than the obvious double-standard (when was the last time you read a review about an all-guy band's songs reflecting the male experience?), this allows the Y chromosome-dominated rock press to focus on gender while still coming off as enlightened. But what of those girl bands that just want to rock, without all that role model jazz? Consider, for example, indie-rock darlings Sleater-Kinney, just coincidentally the subject of this review! To date, Sleater-Kinney has, in my professional opinion, been a good but not great band with a solid back catalog of energetic but slightly homogenous releases. To the majority of my esteemed colleagues, however, S-K is the three-headed coming of the woman Christ, The Great Female Hope, the band that proves at long last that, hey, girls can rawk too! Never mind the fact that girls are, after all, evolutionarily engineered to have fingers for making chord shapes and strumming, just like boys. Saddled with such a heavy label, and with unrealistic and undeserved expectations, the three women of Sleater-Kinney could just keep on making the same album over and over again, pleasing their tiny, rabid loyalists and the leather-patched elbow crowd in the press box. Hey, the life ain't too bad for a cult band these days. But, thank god, the Kill Rock Stars trio isn't content to forever meander in that habitat. With One Beat, Sleater-Kinney have turned in an album that absolutely, positively OBLITERATES the gender card, an album so colossal that all prefixes to the label 'rock band' must be immediately discarded. From the opening, off-kilter drum pattern of the title track, One Beat takes you on a log flume ride through a forest of monumental riffs-- a log flume ride, people! Witness the fretboard slides of ""Hollywood Ending"", the cocky strut of ""Step Aside"", the mighty, fist-pumping second half of ""Combat Rock"" (to which I'd like to just give a premature Forkie for Best Riff of the Year right now). Also, be forewarned that the drumstick-twirling coda of ""Far Away"" has been shown to provoke sudden miming of snare hits and windmill strums in laboratory animals. Now, you might be hearing a lot of crazytalk from longtime S-K supporters that the new album is their most disappointing to date. Ignore it; fanbase discomfort is a common symptom of the breakthrough album, proving that the act has tweaked their formula far enough to piss off the vets who want their pet band to stay predictable. Kinney's definitely changed up the recipe (as they had already begun to do with All Hands on the Bad One), but all changes are positive, foremost being a new understanding of how restraint and scaling back can allow for exponentially increased rockage. ""Combat Rock"" and ""The Remainder"" stutter along a single riff, teasingly refusing to explode before building to a tantric peak. ""Light Rail Coyote"" and ""O2"" both come out with all engines blazing, but retreat to valleys of uncharacteristically subdued hush. Also helping the cause is an increased singing role for Carrie Brownstein, who sounds more confident than ever sporting a fully developed hiccupy vocal character that plays off Tucker's wail like lime flavoring on Tostitos. For anyone of the opinion that Tucker's banshee act occasionally got out of hand on older S-K material, Brownstein's participation is welcome news for your fragile eardrums. The latest model of the Janet Weiss percussion-cyborg sings a bit, too, but her main contribution is her incredibly melodic drums, strident and full-bodied as ever. Meanwhile, the band breaks out the required fifth-album accoutrements: horn section, strings, occasional keyboards. It might be predictable timing for the band to expand their sound, but it's handled delicately by producer John Goodmanson, who never allows the spice to overwhelm the dish (er, sonically speaking, of course). The slip-and-slide Moog on ""Oh!"" drives home the song's oh-woah-woah playfulness, ""Step Aside""'s marching band brass lends its revolution beckoning an epic quality, and Sam Coomes' theremin on ""Funeral Song"" fulfills the FDA requirements for any tune that mentions haunted houses, demons, and Halloween. So except for a closing track (""Sympathy"") where the bluesy over-emoting reminds me of everything I used to dislike about the Sleater, One Beat is an uncompromising, energetic monster of a record. Most of all, it's just accessible (pardon my French) enough to be exactly what the rock world needs these days: the Trail of Dead for those put off by the Danzig-esque lyrics and relentless drum-rolling. It's a dive-headfirst-into-an-empty-pool, take-the-subway-to-Queens, snap-into-a-Slim-Jim, forget-to-bring-back the-library-books, tire-pressure-dangerously-low, sneaking-fireworks-across-the-Illinois-Indiana-border kind of album. That it's performed by three persons of the female gender is entirely beside the point, to anyone who's really listening.","I have issues with women in rock.

Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9d45e6ef95969322a60/1:1/w_160/1b7a3b90.jpg,2002-08-27 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2385-optometry/,Thirsty Ear,"There's a revolution coming and DJ Spooky's at the front line! Or so say the folks whose job it is to shovel coal into the ol' hype engine. But then, there's this tendency in the music press to judge DJ Spooky not for the music he makes, but for that music's effect on some large yet ephemeral scene, the whereabouts of which no one seems capable of putting their finger on. Of course, being the intelligent, sophisticated music nerds we are, you and I know that's just plain silly-- just as it would be silly to pan Optometry because it never quite accomplishes the lofty goals it aims for. The latest in Thirsty Note's Blue Series (an ongoing attempt to both sell the concept of jazz to a young crowd of would-be hipsters too busy prodding at their Powerbooks to pay attention to jazz, and to sell the concept of electronics + jazz to a grizzled bunch of old fundamentalists who see no place for computers anywhere near a stage or a studio), Spooky's Optometry borrows its concept, and most of its players, from another Blue Series release: Matthew Shipp's recent Nu Bop. While both records place Shipp and his fellow New York jazzhounds (William Parker, Guillermo E. Brown) alongside New York electronic scenesters, Optometry's results are a bit stronger. Though Nu Bop had its fair share of solid tunes, it often seemed like the electronics were tacked on as an afterthought; on Optometry, Spooky plays the role of bandleader and producer. (And turntablist. And bassist. And guy in the studio with a kalimba.) As a result, the mix is a bit more evenhanded. Not that you'd guess it from the first couple of tracks. Optometry's opening ten minutes fits the Nu Bop mold pretty well. Shipp, Parker and a couple of pals burst in with their usual aplomb. There are quick flourishes of these ee-leck-tricks I keep hearing about-- buzzing or a hint of delay here, field recordings of trucks passing there-- but Spooky doesn't make his presence fully felt until the third track, ""Variation Cybernetique: Rhythmic Pataphysic (Part I)"", where Daniel Bernard Roumain's violin weeps over a long ambient soundscape built from processed piano. This is the first of two intermissions, and it signifies a move from the ordinary to the adventurous. Spooky opens the next segment with ""Asphalt (Tome II)"", a collaboration with Pauline Oliveros (how's that for cred?) and spoken word artist Carl Hancock Rux. A finger piano is struck and a glitchified soundscape that sounds pilfered and processed from the preceding track unfolds. Shipp adds a repeating piano phrase and Brown drops a standard hip-hop boom-bip just as Rux's velvet-smooth voice appears in the mix. ""I got two turntables and Coltrane,"" he says. ""And not just Blue Coltrane. And not just Monk and not just Miles. I've got a million musicians playing over my head, a band of angels responding to the percussion of stomps and hollers. Heads don't even know what's happening to 'em; they just know something's happening to 'em."" Soon the jam's transforms into a hip-hop chorus, a wailing saxophone, a furiously scratched record, a storm of ambient whooshes. And then there's that boom-bip again. And a bassline. And Rux's voice. Later, Shipp and Parker interact over an ambient portion that sees all the song's components breaking down into something entirely new, entirely different. So is this jazz? Spoken word? Hip-hop? Sound collage? I sure don't know. And if you asked any of the artists involved what they'd call this music, my guess is they'd shrug and mutter, ""Who the hell cares?"" The world has more than its fair share of closed-minded individuals who care about things like genres, who scoff when they see a laptop on stage, who openly equate turntablism with plagiarism. But this record wasn't made for them. Optometry's intent, it would seem, is to celebrate the meeting of new worlds-- not to appease those who would rather see them remain separate. The title track opens with abstract drumming and an assortment of synth burps, the newness of which is countered by the ancient mutterings of Roumain's violin. Shipp and tenor saxophonist Joe McPhee join in, though their simple and repetitive parts arise suspicion. Are they playing live or is Spooky constructing a jam that never happened out of pieces of tape and long strings of ones and zeroes? The pre-recorded breakbeat which fades in and out of the proceedings only adds to the uncertainty. But uncertainty is, of course, the point. In the album's liner notes, Spooky rambles about sampling, rearranging, and reinventing music, reveling in the new doors opened by new technology. He wants us to question whether we're hearing 'the real thing' or not. And after that, he wants us to wonder why it really matters. Rather than just make an album that merges a few different techniques or genres, Spooky has made a point of calling attention to it. This self-awareness casts Optometry as a potentially significant album, acting simultaneously as its Achilles' heel. Ultimately, Spooky casts himself as ringleader to a revolution that fails to happen-- after the initial bustle of a few extremely strong tracks, Optometry wanders blindly for far too long. For someone so obsessed with his own place in an ongoing transformation, Spooky too often seems reluctant to jump into the swimming pool. Closer ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World"" bursts open with a maelstrom of saxophone loops, glitched-out samples and feedback. Shipp and friends try repeatedly to kick out the jams, but Spooky keeps interrupting, garbling waveforms, fucking with minds. Optometry needs more tracks like this, and fewer tracks like ""Rosemary"", where Spooky's sole input seems to be the creation of an ambient canvas for the other musicians to paint on. Granted, Shipp's quartet here are fine players. Granted, their improvisations are pleasing to the air and musically quite sound. And granted, there's something to be said for subtlety and respect. But all this talk of new sounds has me anxious to hear more lines being crossed. It's not that I dislike what I'm hearing; it's just that I've heard it before. Optometry is certainly an adequate fusion, and its taste lasts a lot longer than did Nu Bop's. When it works, it's actually quite fucking stunning. But Optometry will not ignite the metamorphosis it threatens to. It will not send the world's jazz purists scouring the IDM lists in search of new collaborators. Nor will it pull too many heads from the stale paper smell of the record crates or the eerie white glow of their laptops. What it will do is entertain open-minded types who don't expect too much from it. Call it intermission music for the revolution.","There's a revolution coming and DJ Spooky's at the front line!

Under the Same Stars,The Prom,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a141c0084474cd0bfd89/1:1/w_160/80cac668.jpg,2002-08-27 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6491-under-the-same-stars/,Barsuk,"I have complained about The Prom in the past. My senior one, to be specific. Said prom was planned by a girl I will call 'Dance Team' (because she was on the dance team). Irony of all ironies, Dance Team would soon merit the alias 'Lazybones'. Due to her sluggish planning regimen, when she finally got around to booking a venue, all local hotels had been reserved for potential prom weekends. What that meant was Sunday night prom in the auxiliary gym, three weeks before graduation. Not exactly a night to remember. Sunday prom in the 'aux gym' raised a massive ruckus with two distinct groups. First, there were the Mormons, whose parents would have allowed them to attend a Sunday event, but only on the express condition that they refrain from 'having fun' (fun is verboten on Mormon Sundays). Then there was me and my not-yet-gay but very effeminate best friend, who were pre-committed to compete in Quiz Bowl nationals. Out of a sense of injustice and a disdain for Dance Team/Lazybones, we joined forces with the Mormons and complained our asses off. But to no fricking avail. Prom happened, it sucked, and we went out a week later with 12 of our closest Mormon friends and a party van. Eight years later and I'm back at it, complaining about the Prom, but this time without Mormon assistance. The Prom of which I speak today is an indie pop group from Seattle, Washington. Like Mormon Sundays, this Prom lacks the fun quotient. Melancholy pervades what ought to be the good-time formula of piano, drums, and bass. It sounds like Ben Folds Five, minus the virtuoso piano and bass ability, and substituting Elliott Smith for Folds on vocals (albeit with a bit less talent in the melody department, and a bit more talent in the lyrics department). ""Guarantees Aren't Easy"" features a tense, punchy and dramatic bassline, playing off an insistent piano arpeggio, to distinguish itself as the most affecting and profound song on the album. ""Ink on the Paper"" is another of the more dynamic tunes on the album, employing strings and flute to throw a nice closing hook in your face. Beyond that, however, The Prom offers a bunch of glimmers and sparkles, but can't seem to put a complete song together. With the instrumentation fairly basic and the orchestration consistent, the onus is placed on the dynamics of the songs and the quality of melodies. The Prom occasionally capitalizes on a solid sense of song dynamics (as on the aforementioned ""Guarantees"" and ""Ink on the Paper). Unfortunately, they can't boast the same about melody. The Prom's lack of facility with the catchy vocal hook, or even a catchy piano hook (piano is truly fertile ground for them) is painfully evident, and ultimately weighs down their debut. It's most obvious on the more naked slow tunes, like ""A Note on the Kitchen Table"" and ""Brighter than the Moon"", each of which feels laggard and bloated. Moreover, the lack of melody further continues the fun drought. Add sad lyrics and you're in sad shape all around. Melancholy minus hooks equals drab to the boringth power. Like I said, not exactly a night to remember.","I have complained about The Prom in the past. My senior one, to be specific. Said prom was planned by ...

Blacklisted,Neko Case,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1069d034d5c69bf286f/1:1/w_160/29d0c40e.jpg,2002-08-26 05:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1323-blacklisted/,Bloodshot,"""Sit down, son. We need to have a talk, a serious talk about the evils of Country Western music. Don't give me that innocent look; I found this Neko Case CD in your room, and I know, you're probably thinking, 'But, dad! Neko doesn't even play country!' True enough, but this is how it always starts. There's trouble in Ms Case's witchy, alt-country siren-song, mark my words. Boy, I've seen the best minds of my generation lost to Garth Brooks and midget rodeos, and I'll be damned if I'm gonna let it happen to you. Sure, today it's a little bit of Neko Case, but pretty soon you'll be listening to 'Folsom Prison Blues' on the weekends, then before you know it you'll be twanging up every day after school and buying CDs by anyone named Travis or Loretta. And by then, it'll be too late. I'm confiscating this copy of The Virginian for your own good. You're barely passable as sons go already, so be a good kid. Stick to Shellac."" A few years later, I'm listening to Neko's third full-length, Blacklisted, and I finally understand what my dad was worried about. I'm not about to run out and buy Alan Jackson's back catalog or anything-- a healthy dislike of Kentucky Fried Music has been bred into me. But even to my yankee sensibilities, the subtle influence of the old South on this album is charming, even beautiful. Beneath its jangle and melancholy, a faint country soul gently simmers, occasionally bubbling to the surface. Maybe it's just the barest hint of a Southern drawl in the Virginia-born Case's dusky, breathless vocals (the accent is still detectable though she was raised primarily in Tacoma, WA), or the twangy banjo and steel pedal melodies, but it's in there, and goddamnit, I just can't resist. Tensely picked banjo and twelve-string guitar open ""Things That Scare Me"" with that timeless trademark of the most haunting western balladry: the sinister vibe of imminent danger, a distant peal of thunder before the sky falls. But the foreboding here is merely a ruse-- nothing comes but the slow, sad rain of ""Deep Red Bells"", whose backing ""ooh's"" and echoes of steel lend an air of deep longing. This song's clouds part briefly in a moment of silence when Neko plaintively intones, ""Where does this mean world cast its cold eye?/ Who's left to suffer long about you?"" Later, the refrain is followed by a sparkling bridge like a glimpse of sun before the rain returns. With instrumental assistance from notables like Giant Sand's Howe Gelb and his Calexico counterparts Joey Burns and John Convertino-- as well as Chicago alt-country crooner Kelly Hogan and Canadian singer/songwriter Mary Margaret O'Hara on backing vocals-- Blacklisted's accompaniment is roundly excellent and evocative, but Case's voice is what really sells the record. Her opaque wail is more confident here than ever, topping even her sturdy melodic blasts on the New Pornographers' now-legendary ""Letter from an Occupant."" But where she simply belted that tune out to gloriously compliment the band's snapping power-pop, her performance on Blacklisted is dense with emotional heft and more richly expressive. Her rendition of Aretha Franklin's ""Runnin' Out of Fools""-- reworked ever so slightly to match the tone of this record, yet remaining largely faithful to the original-- is the best evidence of this, conveying ecstasy and loss with an elastic buoyancy so full of eloquent depth that you feel as though it could swallow you whole and spit you out on another plane entirely. I've stayed off the C&W; ever since my pop had that little talk at me, but when its influence is employed as beautifully and flawlessly as it is on Blacklisted, it makes me wonder what other experiences could be lying in wait for me. Blacklisted is gorgeous heartache, my soul be damned-- and ""Folsom Prison Blues"" ain't too shabby, either. Dad, if you're reading this, I know that you listened to my copy of The Virginian even after you warned me about its gateway effects; I saw you. So if you see me a few years down the line in a rusted-out pickup with a bumper sticker that screams ""Never Forget!"" in neon reds and blues, and you want to know who taught me how to really fall for this C&W; stuff... it was you, alright? I learned it by watching you.","""Sit down, son. We need to have a talk, a serious talk about the evils of Country Western music. Don ...

Short Careers: Original Score for the Film 'Ball of Wax',Eric Bachmann,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1ed13d197565213874b/1:1/w_160/34e51769.gif,2002-08-26 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/517-short-careers-original-score-for-the-film-ball-of-wax/,Merge,"Oh man, that was sassy back in 1995 when Robert Pollard sang on Alien Lanes: ""I write music for soundtracks now/ That's what I wanted to do anyhow."" One could imagine that he was referencing a random jetsetter, or perhaps even Randy Newman, who went from making controversial concept albums in the 70s to being a Disney schmaltz-slut. Here we are in 2002, though, and Stephin Merritt, Jeff Tweedy, Belle & Sebastian, Air, Will Oldham, Badly Drawn Boy, Tom Waits, Public Enemy, Bj√∂rk, and Yo La Tengo (to name just a few) have all done scores for films of varying magnitudes. I had a dry, academic, insightful, philosophical theory about this trend-- the kind of gesture that typically earns me great letters from our UK readers-- but the Pitchfork bossman says for us to forego the dry, academic, insightful, philosophical bent, and keep things short and funny. So forgive me, my British friends, and hey, who farted? (lol) Now, the ever-ascendant ex-Archers of Loaf and current Crooked Fingers mastermind Eric Bachmann has tried his giant elastic hands at soundtracking Ball of Wax, a film in which a talking dog (voiced by Chris Tucker) uses the World Wide Web to defeat a gang of sexy homeless vampires. Okay, I haven't seen it. The movie's website, which is good enough to link to our recent archived interview with Bachmann (in which he expressed a desire to develop more scores), says it's about how ""an evil baseball player turns the game into a blood sport by pitting his teammates-- the Carolina Devils-- against one other in violent competitions."" So I was close. Thing is, Bachmann's already released a tremendous, spooky-soundtrackish album, his 1995 team-up with Ben Folds under the name Barry Black. That album's soothing, lasting grumble-and-buzz gets unfairly maligned as sounding Latin Playboys-esque and Waits-ish, as if they own the patent on trombones and vibraphones lurching across transplanted Eastern European/South American graveyards. Only this album's ""Jimmy the Enforcer"" and ""Aspirin and Arsenic"" revisit that mood, but they do so to microwave-gothic winsome effect. Before I'd heard this CD, I was weighing whether or not to make those weird concessions that reviewers grant for these kinds of projects (""give'm a break, this ain't the real thing, it's movie-goop"") when my adopted son Svelgph asked, ""Father figure, if takes up as much mass and time as a regular CD, and it costs as much, why treat it otherwise?"" Short Careers is coherent enough, though, to survive the test wrought by Svelgph's untainted vision. Except for the still-good-but-tone-breaching ""Reach Out and Touch Someone"", which gets interestingly dissonant but is inhibited by its role as the ""tense climactic scene"" piece, this album is a satisfying suite whose every number expertly juggles two conflicting and complementary themes. The stilted lilt of ""Good Morning Sleepyhead"" is worth the asking price, a cartoon-triumphant march that suggests colossal innocence. When the track erupts into crowd noise, its significance as a wordless entity manifests. Only the brief ""Nosebleed"" is equally Fingular. The rest reveals another side of Bachmann, replete with ominous pianos and icily melodramatic strings. He never creeps into Corky Elfman territory, and he keeps the proceedings from getting too chambery by layering everything with those repetitive digital undercurrents he's been toying with since 1996's All the Nation's Airports-- occasionally even seasoning the mix with some industrial turbulence or echoing valves. But while Bachmann's compositions never evoke a climate of first-day-with-the-new-cellist, they aren't as blazingly original as his work elsewhere. ""The Mysterious Death of Robert Tower"" comes close to lifting a line from a famous piece of classical music that my high-cultureless self only knows from a jewelry commercial. The pregnant, plaintive plucking of ""Finding the Wholes Filling the Gaps"" is reminiscent of Angelo Badalamenti's self-consciously downhome soundtrack for The Straight Story. The pained, galvanic mainline of the score, which undergoes several revisitations after one first hears it on ""A Diamond Is the Devil's Eye"", cannot help but summon Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet's actuating, tragic accompaniment to Requiem for a Dream. By the luscious, balmy, slothfully sweeping closer ""Ty Cobb,"" however, you won't have a care in the world except for how this record exacts sweet vengeance on the extracurricular junior-high band experiments committed to tape by Rachel's. Like so many instrumental efforts, this burnished opus is excellent for studying, bundling, and watering the cacti. I can't wait to see what M√∫m whip up for American Dink, that new Adam Sandler movie about the horny misfit jock.","Oh man, that was sassy back in 1995 when Robert Pollard sang on Alien Lanes: ""I write music for\n ...

The High Exhaulted,Copywrite,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a65c5e6ef95969320cfc/1:1/w_160/ed08e841.gif,2002-08-26 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1600-the-high-exhaulted/,Eastern Conference,"The first thing you need to understand about Copywrite is that he's a punchline emcee. His lyrical priority is in developing good battle rhymes to drop on opposing emcees in a freestyle cipher (i.e., ""I don't blame you for being wack, I blame your fans for feeling you""), and as such, his subject matter revolves around how he's the best, and that a generalized 'you' really, really sucks. While punchline emcees are great when can witness the physical manifestation of their verbal jabs onstage, they often fall somewhat flat on full-lengths. Part of this limited appeal can be attributed to the fact that, in a freestyle cipher, the joy comes from hearing the emcees' takes on their immediate environment, whether that be an opposing emcee's demeanor or dress, or just something that's happening in the audience. On record, though, punchline emcees can't draw the audience in with these references. The better battlers either expand their thematic palette or use quirky wordplay to compensate, while the less talented often rely upon offensive cliches and endless boasts to draw their audience into the song. Unfortunately, Copywrite falls into the latter category with his debut, The High Exhaulted. A big problem with The High Exhaulted is that there's little lyrical distinction between songs. Line after line, verse after verse, we're bombarded with testimony regarding Copywrite's lyrical skills. After several spins of this disc, the only thing I know about Copywrite is that he's the greatest (because he's told us so) and that he really likes to fuck 'bitches.' He doesn't sprinkle his rhymes with astute social observations and his tone is generally more aggressive and insulting than it is humorous. While Copyright does reel off a few lines that entertain in a shocking, out-of-leftfield manner (as when he claims that he's ""6'4"" and [will] fuck the shit out of a midget!""), the vast majority of them are adolescent, overly misogynistic, and obvious. Consider this little jewel: ""Fuck swallowing my nut, I make bitches gargle my piss."" This isn't ""The 700 Club"" and I'm not Tipper Gore, so we're not even going to approach that line on a moral tip; but, that aside, aren't there better ways to capture your audience's attention than relying on these sorry shock tactics? What about expressing something original about yourself or your surroundings, and not repeating the stale platitudes of your machismo rap persona? The High Exhaulted's production, supplied by the incredibly hot RJD2, The High & Mighty's Mighty Mi, and Def Jukie Camu Tao, essentially makes this record a tolerable affair. And it must be said that Copywrite does successfully break through his braggadocio veneer briefly on the song ""June"" (previously released on RJD2's Dead Ringer). But it's the only occasion, and even that winds up feeling more like a teaser for what should've been. It's also of interest to note that a good portion of The High Exhaulted has been previously released on either singles or compilations, and it generally clicked better in that format. In short spurts, the humor can work; it's just that over the course of an album, the subject matter quickly grows redundant, and as Copywrite's boasts pile up without much proof to back up his claims, they become meaningless.","The first thing you need to understand about Copywrite is that he's a punchline emcee.

Water's Suite,Nobukazu Takemura,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a71c5e6ef95969320eca/1:1/w_160/bfcd7ee8.gif,2002-08-26 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7917-waters-suite/,Extreme,"After moving in a pop direction with the Sign and Mimic Robot EPs, Nobukazu Takemura returns with zeal to the noisier, more abstract territory of his Thrill Jockey debut Scope. The material on Water's Suite was originally recorded near the time of Scope, back in 1998, and as Takemura sets out in the liner notes, he had specific goals in mind for this project. The particulars are difficult to parse, due in equal measure to my middling grasp of MIDI gear and Takemura's only slightly better command of the English language. From what I gather, Takemura programmed a series of melodies and harmonies in MIDI, and then inserted randomness into the equation by heavily riding the scrub control when playing back the programmed sequence through a Yamaha MU15 sound module. Obviously, this is going to be a serious departure for those who hopped on the Takemura Train with the cutesy videogame pop of ""Sign."" There are no robot voices here, no Nintendo chord sequences, not even a single drum machine hit. Instead, Water's Suite is a dark, dense world of sound where, as DC Berman would say, random rules. Though you can tell that the tones on Water's Suite are in the same key and bear some relationship to each other, patterns beyond that require some downright scientific listening. It's fun to don the lab coat once in a while, though, right? Here are my findings: ""Part 1"" is probably my favorite music here, because it's by far the most focused. Opening with a slow fade up, ""Part 1"" is based around a whining drone comprised of an unsteady group of mid-range tones. Behind these drawn-out notes is a constantly flickering bed of noise, little clicks and pops that give a hint on how all the music thereafter will be constructed. It's an evocative piece of nervous atmosphere. When ""Part 2"" comes in, the template suggested in ""Part 1"" is realized: It's an endless cascade of notes from a percussive synth patch that sounds a bit like a xylophone. Earlier Takemura reference points are Scope's ""Icefall"" and Funfair's ""The Cradle of Light"", but this is far less musical. From the start of ""Part 2"", the stream of tones is so fast as to remain uncountable. There are probably something like 1/512 notes, thick enough to fill the space completely. Periodically, the onslaught takes on another form and a section of feedback replaces it, or else bunches of quick notes will cluster into larger patterns. This, my friends, is not an easy listen. Water's Suite is devolutionary music, sounds freed from ordered perfection. Takemura hints at this in the liner notes, where he describes being inspired by the earthquakes in Kyoto: ""The strange waves of sound at that moment seem to have a rule, but there is no rule at all."" Takemura's title provides another clue as to what's going on: the endless variation of water flowing over rock is another apt metaphor. Things are less hectic on ""Part 3"", as the rush of notes slows to a trickle and the opening drones make another appearance. Still, any possibility of relaxation is obliterated by sharp, repeating jab of a synth note that sounds like a suffering computer saying ""baaap!"" The 22-minute ""Part 5"" is the album's 'centerpiece,' I suppose, but it's mostly endless reworkings of ideas expressed earlier. While the notion of constructing a small, detailed ecosystem of sound is interesting enough, the core elements of that world have to exert some kind of tug to pull the listener in. All the way through Water's Suite, I'm intrigued by the complexity of the album's patterns, but I feel suspended on the surface, gazing in from afar instead of feeling immersed. It's an interesting album, but sometimes music this abstract still manages to carry emotional weight (I'm thinking here of something like Ovalprocess). Water's Suite is one for the musical physicists only.","After moving in a pop direction with the Sign and Mimic Robot EPs, Nobukazu Takemura returns with zeal to the ...

At Sixes and Sevens,Jason Loewenstein,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd38ea9e61561daa7671/1:1/w_160/9667752a.jpg,2002-08-25 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4828-at-sixes-and-sevens/,Sub Pop,"I've always been a big fan of the blokes who keep a lower profile in a band. Call it the George Harrison Rule, as the Quiet Beatle perfectly represents what I'm talking about: a couple songs per album, contributions more instrumental than vocal, rare appearances in the publicity circus. Every era's got 'em, from John Entwistle to Richard Manuel to Mick Jones to Lee Ranaldo to Tobin Sprout. As a properly quiet and shy indie rock guy, I can't help but have a soft spot for such shadowmen, who never seem to get the credit they deserve until they're gone or, in the case of the first two, found dead in hotel rooms. Unfortunately for Jason Loewenstein, the Harrison Rule does not automatically apply. In fact, I stopped caring about Sebadoh right about the time Loewenstein started contributing close to the same number of songs as uneasy frontman Lou Barlow. Perhaps Barlow all too easily remembered his power struggles with J Mascis back in those sepia-toned Dinosaur Jr days, and compensated by allowing his own dictatorship to slide into editor-less democracy. Whatever the behind-the-scenes situation, when the hushed beauty of choice Barlow melancho-llege rock tracks like ""Beauty of the Ride"" were lost in juxtaposition to Loewenstein's sack of power chords and ""whoooaaaa baby I'm not a MIND readahhh!"" bellow, I lost interest. Now that Sebadoh seems to be retired and nearly eligible for a bronze bust in the Indie Hall of Fame, Loewenstein's taken his latest batch of mood-breakers and collected them for a debut solo album. Sorry to say, At Sixes and Sevens shows little-to-no evolution from his makeout-session-ruining songs on Harmacy. While the record might have had some throwback potential (seeing as Loewenstein has yet to move on from Seattle circa 1993), the contents are nowhere near quality enough to kick off that grunge revival we'll all know is right around the corner when ""That 90's Show"" premieres on Fox. Loewenstein's problems seem to spring from a penchant for textbook hard rock and an almost astonishing lack of range, failings that are amplified by his choice to record all of At Sixes and Sevens' instrumentation himself. Track one, ""Codes"", is reasonable enough with its thick guitar chug, canter speed, and what might be the obligatory kiss-off lyrics, but after ten more variations on the same theme, even a brisk forty-minute album starts to drag. For a time-killer, you might internally debate which is more unremarkable: Loewenstein's double-tracked flannel shirt vocals or his close-to-uniformly forgettable melodies (""Circles"" being the sole exception). The rare deviation does indicate much growth potential, as the less distortion-pedal reliant ""I'm a Shit"" (hey there, Tad, where you been?) and ""More Drugs"" come off as Acme-brand imitation Barlow. Meanwhile, the instrumental ""H/M"" is just about as pointless as Harmacy's ""Hillbilly II"", and the hyper-Latin of track six made me scrawl ""sounds like drunk Santana"" in my mental notebook before finding out the track really was called ""Crazy Santana."" Could've been a Signs-like holy phenomenon, of course, but I'm more inclined to think it was creative laziness. Or creative limitations. Either way, At Sixes and Sevens makes the case that Loewenstein is best suited to a role as a sideman-- the completely silent kind.","I've always been a big fan of the blokes who keep a lower profile in a band.

Lost in Space,Aimee Mann,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c396c0084474cd0c34d7/1:1/w_160/c945f070.jpg,2002-08-25 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5083-lost-in-space/,Superego,"You've probably heard Aimee Mann's story a dozen times: how, after releasing albums on Geffen in the 90s, she quickly became dissatisfied with the label's treatment of her records, and soon decided to buy back the tapes for her third full-length, Bachelor No. 2, and put it out herself. Just another long-haul pop talent that the majors have signed and then foolishly refused to make time for. So we can all root for her success story: she managed to move 200,000 copies of Bachelor No. 2 by herself, and now has a second album-- her fourth overall-- on her own label. The story of her business life is worth retelling because it's so close to the themes of her songwriting: she hits bad times, but never mires herself in them. And it's easy to see why P.T. Anderson wrote his film Magnolia loosely around her songs: she understands the people who struggle through their work and love lives on the fringes of show business. As an industry veteran she seems to have learned to turn the highs and lows into a day-to-day routine, and in that spirit, she's learned to explore the most depressing themes while transcending the self-pity so associated with lovesick laments. Lost in Space is the first album Mann has made solely under her own guidance and for her own label. And as with all her work, the craftsmanship is impeccable-- three- or four-minute pop songs with arching, lilting melodies, and arrangements where every detail is in place, from the succinct but grinding guitar solos, to the subtle keyboards and embellishments that back her up. And then there's the centerpiece: the rich tone of her subtly expressive vocals, a voice that's so even and melodic that the slightest crack speaks volumes. Her hooks grow subtler with every album, and though it can take a couple listens for some of her better tunes to catch hold here, her ballads have only become more striking: ""This Is How It Goes"" and ""Invisible Ink"", both opening with just Mann and her acoustic before swelling into orchestration, may be her most heartbreaking yet. More so than with her previous albums, every song on Lost in Space sticks to the themes of need, strife and desire, filtering them through her own relationships and career while maintaining a narrative loose enough to apply to the listener's own experiences. Mann excels at writing lyrics that use specific imagery but carry general meanings. She talks about ambition (""The moth don't care when he sees the flame/ He might get burned, but he's in the game""), and the aching chorus of ""This Is How It Goes"" outlines a story while remaining unlimited by precise details: ""It's all about drugs, it's all about shame/ And whatever they want, don't tell them your name."" Sure, this is all far from chipper, without even one bright or hypercatchy song to mix things up, but the consistency, for the most part, is tight enough to warrant it. For the most part. While Bachelor No. 2 felt more disparate and less powerful, the tracklist was varied and inventive. Lost in Space leaves you feeling that she's already covered this terrain-- even played variations of some of these songs. I find myself liking the sum more than its parts. But it's hard to fault Mann for repeating a formula that works this well, or for making a record this focused. Her fans will certainly adore it regardless, though if you're new to her work, Bachelor No. 2 may be a better place to start.","You've probably heard Aimee Mann's story a dozen times: how, after releasing albums on Geffen in the 90s ...

Straight From Your Radio EP,Gold Chains,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf57ea9e61561daa7a49/1:1/w_160/697991b1.gif,2002-08-25 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3497-straight-from-your-radio-ep/,Tigerbeat6,"Got a copy of Straight From Your Radio a couple weeks back from the Tigerbeat carriage, which rolled upon the street majesterically, parking violations stickered to the canopy and Chains himself whippin' them lectro-steeds. Pulled up to the drive, sed somethin about somethin about STRAIGHT FROM YA RADIO SOMETHIN BEATS SOMETHIN SOMETHIN GOLD CHAINS SOMETHIN SOMETHIN BLOWIN OUT THE STREETS MUSIQUE CONCRETE MCs AT MY FEET SOMETHIN ALL AROUND ME SOMETHIN WHAT IS ONE TO DO! He really said some of that! And then, whap, horses runnin, people scared. Gold Chains and carriage banished from even peripheral sight. A disc materializing within the sweated palms of my hairy hands. Flames up the street, license plate spinnin. I ran to the Sony CDP-CE525, yelled something at it, then gently, calmly, rationally fed it the compact. And then, from this dream I awoke me-- to the sound of my bedside alarm. I have tuned it, just so, between the local Lite-FM and New Countries, lest I be soothed back into Tigerbeat dreams by an experimenting college DJ. I remember only moments of this vision, something involving a lost soccer shoe and a vegetable garden. But I wake with ""Straight From Your Radio"" bounding all up and around the skull, a song whose wicked wonderment I have experienced but a singular once. I put my fingers to my temples, begin shaking intensely, my nose bleeds, and a disc materializes within the sweated palms of my hairy hands. No one knows Gold Chains is a white guy cause he sounds like Ja Rule. Ja Rule, though, see, he's very sensitive to the needs of the ladies. You don't get that with Gold Chains. You get: ""Get dat cootchie over here I want to fuck it aww yeah, get dat cootchie lookin tight I want to lick it all night."" To which a fine, upstanding citizen such as myself can only respond: ""WHOA! GOLD CHAINS!"" But that's his whole thing. And then the bass enters, throbbing like bursting genitals, a kickdrum as sturdy as any kickdrum these ears of mine could hope a kickdrum might be, an electronic ascending zwwwooop, the tch'ing hi-hats. And over this megadecibal dubby madness a sudden rhyme: ""I treat ya cootchie like a maze, com, plex, turn ya page,"" as though Rudy Ray Moore perchanced to freestyle a moment upon Chicago's dance beat, B96. Urban contemporary chart-attack: the Tigerbeat krew loves this sound, as exhibit #A (the Kid606 Action Packed Mentallist CD) and exhibit #B (the Knifehandchop EP with remix'd DMX) vividly display. Is there great shame in this? Some indie sockheads would say that indeed the krew is young and has been fed the demonseed by evil Dr. Clear Channel and His Two-Or-Three-Song Orchestra. Select indier-than-thou characters, I am coming to accept, are just too freegin uptight. I had a revelation last fall, see, and it was called ""What About Us"" and it sounded like Massive Attack doin' anal with Bj√∂rk. SOLD! A stream of revelations, a whole fuckin' John 3:16 of 'em: ""We Need a Resolution,"" ""Jumpin, Jumpin,"" ""What's Your Fantasy,"" *""Who We Be,"" ""Break Ya Neck,"" ""Shake Ya Ass,"" ""No More Drama,"" even Mya-- *Mya-- singing ""Case of the Ex,"" baby, I fess! That's why I respect Gold Chains and Tigerbeat alike. The indie rock, bless its heart, it's my little sweet pumpkin and I kiss it all the time and bring it candies. But goddamn there's somethin so so fine 'bout them gritty-azz beats detonating crunkly out the Eskyalade. Tigerbeat's like old rock n' roll without the surfing. It desires only fun, enjoyment, thrills and automobills. Fed through the intestines of triplesex urban pop and elitist electronica, thugged out for pretend, ironic and beautifully sincere. A Hallmark to Miss E, cc'd to Squarepusher and sealed with Kraftwerk stickers. Gold Chains, smooth as the silken dollar, plays the striking cobra to Peaches' nubile cameltoe, and when he's not talking explicitly about dick action, which is just about never, he's going off about them ""mountains of coke up in the V.I.P."" and cheek-tonguing an Eric B bit about his superior mic skills. Straight From Your Radio, though: limited replay value. I like it cause it does not judge me, but other Tigerbeat lovers play me better and don't make me think about Ja. But Chains is good. He's good for one night. Honey that's all you need.","Got a copy of Straight From Your Radio a couple weeks back from the Tigerbeat carriage, which rolled\n\ upon ...

Everything After the Bomb Is Sci-Fi,Arco Flute Foundation,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0f7b1335d7bf169813d/1:1/w_160/02381aa8.gif,2002-08-22 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/280-everything-after-the-bomb-is-sci-fi/,Cenotaph,"I suppose you could bow a flute if you wanted to. I'm not really sure what kind of sound it would make, or if it would make any sound at all. Hence my confusion and amusement at this band's name. In musical notation, 'arco' means 'played with the bow,' as in a violin, bass, viola or cello (or maybe a guitar for you adventurous types). I'm sure it's just meant to be a joke on the band's part-- for one thing, there aren't any flutes within 500 miles of this recording-- even if the music they make isn't all that endowed with humor. I mean, just check out that album title: Everything After the Bomb is Sci-Fi. Heavy. Wait, let me rephrase that: heavy? And the music isn't much of a picnic, either, as it resides mostly in a chaotic, formless realm where indiscriminate noise is monarch. That said, the music also isn't nearly as apocalyptic as the album title might suggest-- instead, it finds a sort of middle ground between cold distance and actual emotion that, while never particularly upbeat, abstains from becoming all that dark or foreboding. Three Foundation members also spend time post-rockin' with fellow Pittsburgh crew Meisha, and the Foundation are at their best when the music veers closer to the more controlled, structured approach of that band. Most of opener ""The Myth That Became Jimmy Palm"" sets churning guitars to a persistent rhythm that rises and falls before succumbing to some overlong electronic entropy, and the overall results are fairly satisfying. The contour of the song from order to disorder isn't exactly revolutionary, but the change is gradual enough not to be obvious on the first couple of listens. ""The Mean Egyptian"" is the best track of the seven present, heating from a basic repeated guitar phrase and simple rhythms to a boil of crashing cymbals and slowly morphing melodic guitar motifs. Not coincidentally, this track is also one of the shortest, veering abruptly out of its groove and leaving only a glowing trail of guitar and keyboard noise behind to form the basis for the opening of ""Captain World's Apprentice."" Now, to be perfectly honest, not much of interest goes down in the middle of this album. Captain World's apprentice seems to have forgotten his training, giving up the ethereal drones he came in with for formless, aimless static that drags on for several minutes before being overtaken by a series of buzzing drones that proceed nowhere. ""It's a Symbol Like the Word 'And'"" follows with some swelling, seemingly malfunctioning synth that seems interesting at first, but quickly loses its appeal-- as the clock ticks ever onward, the synth remains stubbornly stagnant. Static and a bit of noodly guitar caught in a loop occupy the track's midsection, while a subdued drum groove provides a bit of lift at the end for the sliding, heavily delayed guitar sounds moving overhead. ""The Bastard Son of the Earthquake Choir"" opens with some striking guitar harmonics, but eventually caves to the band's overused tactic of giving noise a beat and letting it ride for too long. The dirty guitar riff and charging drums that open ""The Lizard Christ"" are initially fairly clear, but the track loses its shape somewhat as it progresses, due largely to a lack of any kind of real melody to give it contour. The Foundation then dumps you into the closer, ""Seymour Uncle Billy,"" which offers freeform percussion played under a constant, unchanging drone. The piece really only takes shape when the percussion congeals into a rhythm, pounding the drone along, and offering the disc's most intense moment-- unfortunately, this only lasts for about one-fourth of the nearly ten minute song. Everything After the Bomb Is Sci-Fi does has its moments of sonic interest, poking up out of a stew of sound. But those who come expecting strong compositions or something viscerally gripping will likely be left at a loss when the disc stops spinning. The ingredients for something good are certainly there, but the Arco Flute Foundation needs to focus more compositionally and strive for a more palpable mood before I can truly recommend them.","I suppose you could bow a flute if you wanted to.

Original Pirate Material,The Streets,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5859d034d5c69bf32fb/1:1/w_160/2d006a2e.jpg,2002-08-22 05:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7531-original-pirate-material/,Warner Bros.,"Hey, did you hear? Hip-hop is a world phenomenon now! Yes, spend some time poking around your favorite music magazine's website and I'm sure you'll find a heavy handful of hip-hop-gone-global thinkpieces. Read profiles of angstful teenagers rapping about life in Israeli-occupied Palestine, Cuban kids protesting the oppressive state police in rhyme, even Greenland b-boys composing bouncy anthems about caribou and snow. So it should come as no surprise that the British, notorious for chewing on our music before spitting it back over the Atlantic in a shiny, new form, have also turned their sun-starved faces to the arena of hip-hop. There's just one small problem: simply put, British accents just don't sound particularly right in the context of syncopated rap-speech. To put my tweed linguistics jacket on, the American tendency to cheat on pronunciation fits in perfectly with the wordplay of hip-hop, while the stubborn British habit of perfectly enunciating every syllable makes things sound rather, well, formal. Or to put my Degrassi Jr. High pop culture jacket on, British rap can't help sounding like the dope flow of the immortal Murray Head on ""One Night in Bangkok."" Which is why the first time you put on Original Pirate Material, you might find it awfully hysterical-- especially if the name had you assuming it was going to be another Strokesian garage act. The giggles will eventually give way to a bit of discomfort at the slightly awkward delivery-- the words here are jammed into measures like an overstuffed couch. You'll wince at a chorus like, ""Geezers need excitement/ If their lives don't provide it, then they incite violence/ Common sense, simple common sense,"" bursting at the seams of its tempo. Then, about 48 hours later, you'll realize it still hasn't left your head. One-man MC/DJ package Mike Skinner has an obvious talent for forging damn sharp hip-pop hooks that supercede his inherent verbal handicap. Unashamedly revealing a taste for 80s soft rock, the smooth-sung chorus and reverbed Rhodes of ""Has It Come to This"" is highly reminiscent of fantastically hair-styled pop giants Hall & Oates-- and believe it or not, I don't mean that as a putdown. ""It's Too Late,"" meanwhile, features a sugared melancholy duet with a dreamy British lass between the verses, and tracks fortified with more canned orchestra than a late-period Flaming Lips album. All of which would leave things a bit flaky, if it wasn't for Skinner's flair for nervous, metallic beats (The Streets' percussion is inventive enough for the album to be erroneously labeled as 'electronica' in the critic's bible All Music Guide). Whether changing speeds or dropping out unexpectedly beneath the ominous strings of ""Same Old Thing,"" trampolining playfully in ""Don't Mug Yourself,"" or rolling along completely oblivious to the piano loop rhythm on ""Weak Become Heroes,"" they're catchy and inventive enough to make one forget the accent for a bit. It's not all successful (the slow-reggae bounce of ""Let's Push Things Forward"" is, ironically, pretty backward and tired), but it usually is-- and even when it's not, it's at least trying to be. Which leaves us with the lyrics, tales of English street life provided entirely by the very proper-sounding Skinner. Now, if the phrase ""English street life"" makes you bristle, hold on a sec-- anyone who's ever read an Irvine Welsh novel (half-credit if you've seen Trainspotting) should know that life for the British working class is hardly Buckingham Palace. So while the lingo takes some getting used to ('geezas' instead of 'niggaz,' 'birds' not 'bitches,' etc.), it'd be incorrect to write off The Streets as either poseur or gimmick, and in a genre where unique lyrical perspective is especially important, the UK vibe is an intriguing element. Plus, let's face it, Skinner's race and nationality will probably earn The Streets a spot on the ""safe hip-hop for indie rockers list"" this year, possessing, as it does, that certain unplaceable, familiar aura that appeals to mild hip-hop-ophobes such as, well, myself. As such, I'm not real sure where it would fall along the critical spectrum according to a genre expert (paging Sam Chennault, Sam Chennault to the OR, please), but Original Pirate Material seems to be remarkably solid. And given the fact that it does, eventually, manage to overcome the horrific-sounding concept of British hip-hop, it seems pretty reasonable to give it a recommendation. Bloody good show, I say.","Hey, did you hear? Hip-hop is a world phenomenon now! Yes, spend some time poking around your favorite music magazine ...

Pixies,Pixies,by: Ryan Kearney,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a088b1335d7bf169803c/1:1/w_160/ffb0155d.jpeg,2002-08-22 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6314-pixies/,spinART,"I think it's safe to say that, ten years after their demise, the Pixies have finally been given their due. Those of us lucky enough to have been fans of the band during their too-brief, five-year lifespan know all too well how they never quite got the respect they deserved. Sure, local and national rags praised these caustic Boston geeks from the day they first arrived on the scene, but the Pixies' profound, lasting impact on both underground and popular rock music would take years to truly register. But this is, after all, how these things often go; true greatness is usually recognized after the fact, if only because it takes time for the ripple of influence to reach shore. Kurt Cobain brought some attention to the band's radiating importance by quipping, in his typical self-deprecating fashion, that ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" was a Pixies ripoff. It was, in fact, an homage. But even then, at the height of the 'alternative' boom, the Pixies were only considered very good or great; not recognized, as they are today, as one of the best American rock bands ever. So it pains me to give this album anything less than a 10. As one might expect, the nine tracks on this 18-minute album are outstanding, though most of them carry an asterisk. So let's backtrack. In March 1987, after forming several months earlier, the Pixies recorded a 17-song demo cassette at Boston's hallowed Fort Apache studios that came to be known as ""The Purple Tape."" The cassette attracted the attention of many, including Ivo Watts-Russell, head of England's influential 4AD label, who issued eight of the demos as the band's debut EP, Come on Pilgrim. Perhaps I'm biased, having heard that EP long before the demos here, but for the most part, he chose the right songs for Pilgrim. This isn't to say the tracks here are worse, but later in their career the band recorded better versions of most of them. Consider the opener here, ""Broken Face."" Once you've heard the version on 1988's Surfer Rosa, the full-length debut recorded by Steve Albini, there's no going back. The demo is much tamer all around, and it doesn't have that breathless cut in Black Francis' opening line, where the end of the word 'face' is lopped off, and he screeches again, ""I got a..."" Similarly, ""Break My Body,"" just doesn't have quite the edge it has on Surfer Rosa, though they're practically the same note-for-note. And the same could be said for ""I'm Amazed"" if not for one critical difference from its Rosa version-- an odd, euphonious bridge that recalls later 4AD-ers His Name Is Alive. Some might call this bridge a nice breather, but, like a speed bump in the Daytona 500, it kills the track's scorching momentum. A cover of Peter Ivers' ""In Heaven (Lady in the Radiator Song)""-- listed here simply as ""In Heaven""-- is also disposable, as the band's live version on the ""Gigantic"" single and the Complete 'B' Sides compilation has more raw emotion-- which, to be blunt, just means that Francis' screams at the end of the song sound better. ""Down to the Well,"" meanwhile, would be more compelling than its slicker cousin on 1990's surf-rock-inspired Bossanova if not for Francis' screaming on the version found here, an irritating dog howl. But there are some positives. For those of you who were always turned off by the bouncy pop of the ""Here Comes Your Man"" heard on 1989's Doolittle, the version on Pixies is like sugar-free gum-- in a good way. Also, the original incarnation of ""Build High"" is without the slight irritation that mars its successor, which ended up as a b-side for 1991's Trompe le Monde (and appears on the aforementioned compilation). The demo cut of ""Subbacultcha"" is also preferable to the Trompe le Monde version, as it contains a part musically similar to ""Distance Equals Rate Times Time"" that befits the song's ambling, storytelling technique. Most of you-- those who aren't completists, that is-- should ignore everything I've just written. Because all you really care about is the one track that hasn't been officially released until now: ""Rock A My Soul."" Is it worth buying the whole album for? Sorry, no. It is, however, a stellar track with a chorus in which Francis' titular plea is punctuated on drums and guitar by brutish stop-and-starts. It would have fit in perfectly on Pilgrim or Rosa. It is truly amazing that these songs were the first the band ever laid to tape. Removed from any context-- namely, the later re-recordings of most of these tunes-- they're better than most anything released this year. But these demos were born 15 years ago, and then were essentially locked in the basement for years. Now, freed of any restraints, they can't just enter daylight, show up on peoples' doorsteps and expect to be loved.","I think it's safe to say that, ten years after their demise, the Pixies have finally been given their ...

We Are Science,Dot Allison,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0515e6ef9596931ff03/1:1/w_160/fc9c42ce.jpg,2002-08-22 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/119-we-are-science/,MantraBeggars,"And three years later, Dot Allison returned with an album that finally lived up to some of the hype surrounding her flacid debut, Afterglow. Afterglow, you might recall, collapsed because Allison played by record exec rules; she was Dido, albeit with more than just a simper to call 'talent.' Fortunately, the largely successful We Are Science shows Allison as a far more secure vocalist and, more importantly, more confident of her experimental inclinations. Allison was once one-third of One Dove, the Andrew Weatherall-produced band who were all set to out-bliss Primal Scream's Screamdelica. One Dove's only full-length, Morning Dove White, combined Balearic chill with Neil Young folkiness and arcing feedback. Toned down by the good MBA chaps at FFRR, the publicly released version of Morning Dove White was an emaciated shred of what One Dove and Weatherall originally handed over. Nice. The hands-off heads at Mantra Recordings, however, as well as her collaborations with Death in Vegas (""Dirge,"" from The Contino Sessions) and Glaswegian pure-techno addicts Slam (""Visions,"" from Alien Radio) have bolstered Allison's self-assuredness. She's also shown more than just loyalty by asking the other half of Two Lone Swordsmen, Keith ""Radioactive Man"" Tenniswood, to mix, program and co-produce half of this album. And though former influence Weatherall is physically absent from duties here, his amalgam of electro and headspace dub is ubiquitous. We Are Science begins with the crunchy electro of ""We're Only Science"" which sounds exactly as you'd imagine an Allison/Tenniswood collaboration. Tenniswood opens the front door and in lurches the greebo-ist of basslines-- one that lives alone in a trash-strewn trailer, who never changes his leather pants, has breath that peels paint, and the social skills of a snakehead fish. Allison's response is simply to repeat the title. But rather than the blank delivery of Miss Kitten or Adult.'s Nicola Kuperus, Allison's delivery has more of a Sheila Chandra inflection. The song's countermelody also supports the Chandra comparison, as it's remarkably close to the melody of Monsoon's ""Ever So Lonely."" ""Substance"" scores by integrating electroclash elements (stabbing squiggles, chugging analog bass) with nu-breaks feistiness. The swirling Farfisa-ish organ line and straight-ahead rhythms of ""You Can Be Replaced"" connect the song with the druggier moments of Afterglow. Yet Allison's vocals are far less fey here-- she never goes so far as to attempt a Morissette level of ersatz earnestness. Rising from a slow burst of deep bass bubbles (a very Weatherall technique), ""Performance"" marks the lone appearance of one of IDM's forgotten masters, Beaumont Hannett. Using similar production techniques as the ones he employed for Lida Husik, Hannett surrounds Allison in a transcendental layer of strings and analogue confections. It's the brooding production that William Orbit has longed to master. Allison, of course, knows that nothing should distract from Hannant's production. She relegates her vocals to a few brief interludes during these stunning, celestial seven minutes. Coming on a like a female-fronted Lo-Fidelity Allstars, ""Strung Out"" is the first of two tracks recorded with Mercury Rev's Dave Fridmann and Grasshopper. The song is classic radio-pop, albeit tempered by gruff distortion and enhanced with Tenniswood's silver box trickery. And ""Lover,"" the closing track and second of the Fridmann/Grasshopper productions, is the best of the bunch. Though floating along on the stylistic tropes of country (slide guitar, languid drawling vocals), it reminds me more of the machine euphoria of Underworld's pinnacle moment, ""Rez."" The push/pull of these two styles affords the song a potency it would surely lack if either constituent were absent. The only real misfire on Afterglow comes with ""I Think I Love You,"" a song only the most damnably loyal Fischerspooner aficionado could love. Over a generic electroclash rhythm, Allison repeats the title with less conviction than the average hormonally imbalanced twelfth-grader recites the Pledge of Allegiance. Perhaps our Dot will say anything to secure a quickie in the bogs. After the limp meandering of Afterglow, We Are Science is unquestionably a leap in the right direction. ""Lover,"" ""Substance,"" and ""Performance,"" in particular, prove that the right co-producer at the controls can achieve spectacular feats. Yet for all this record's strengths, I'm not fully convinced it's the one to crown her career. All the elements are present, sure, but not always in the right place.","And three years later, Dot Allison returned with an album that finally lived up to some of the hype surrounding ...

Though mere teenagers, the Searcy, Arkansas-based group was lauded for their prodigious skill at mangling the blues and channeling classic rock through a decidedly riot-grrl filter. Stylistically, the group veered toward the seedier side of blues-infused rock and roll, but coming, as they did, from a middle-of-nowhere burg, their sound seemed somewhat less of a contrivance than that of their like-minded peers. Which is not to say they do it better, just that it seemed a bit more authentic. And now we arrive at their follow-up, Arkansas Heat, the results of which are mixed but still largely entertaining. Pitchfork policy demands that I review the CD version of this EP, though I suspect the mangled sounds of Arkansas Heat would be pleasantly exaggerated if played on an terminally fucked turntable. It's that kind of music, with shades of classic rock subversion permeating each dense guitar blast, and Beth Ditto's growling, vaguely feline vocals perfectly compliment the rough-edged sensibilities of guitarist Nathan Brace and drummer Kathy Mendonca. The record's first five tracks pummel at near-lightning speed, with songs like ""Rules for Luv"" magically evoking both the Rolling Stones and Gang of Four, and the exuberant, driving chorus of ""Ain't It the Truth"" coming so strong it nearly redeems the track's blatant self-consciousness. These eventually build to ""(Take Back) Revolution,"" a 10+ minute-long fractured jam that has Beth Ditto singing, ""Okay, this is for the kids/ So I wanna hear you loud, and I wanna know/ You want revolution/ And can you feel it?/ Are you ready/ Take back!/ Revolution!"" Putting aside my personal qualms with bands who namecheck 'the kids,' it's a coy maneuver to resort to these Huggy Bear-like ideological theatrics over a rousing Howlin' Wolf-style guitar line-- especially since the former helped to complicate rock music's sexual politics, and the latter can be used as a tool to effectively silence conversations about sexual politics if played in the right context. Of course, there's always been a political undercurrent in The Gossip's vintage juke-joint; their friction between sound and lyrical content is like Kathleen Hanna reading the Riot Act at a Delta Blues festival. Which is kind of fun, so long as the message doesn't overwhelm the music. You see, Arkansas Heat does, however subtly, mark a shift towards Olympia's trademark scene, which, if not properly restrained, could compromise the essential 'fun-having' factor in the their blues-rock equation. Fortunately, they're still in the clear this time out. Still, if they want to remain unalloyed amongst the ever-growing cadre of rock and blues revivalists, they'd better keep their collective heart just west of Memphis-- in Searcy.","I remember The Gossip.

Gradations,Electric Birds,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc30c0084474cd0c2a26/1:1/w_160/90455c93.gif,2002-08-21 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2727-gradations/,Mille Plateaux,"It's becoming clear that the first Electric Birds album was something of a one-off. With Gradations, sole member Mike Martinez is now four albums into the project, and he shows no signing of returning to the debut's eclecticism. In a way, the records following have been more cohesive statements, with Martinez choosing to explore with a given side of his musical persona over the course of an album: Panorama reflected his experiments with percussion and more rhythmic sound; last year's Strata Frames was more vaporous and ambient. While I've enjoyed these records to varying degrees, I can't help but pine for the debut's sense of unpredictability. After releasing the first two albums on his own Deluxe label, and Strata Frames on the fledging French imprint U-Cover, Martinez moves to the celebrated Mille Plateaux for Gradations. Mille Pleateax has lost some prestige since its late-90s peak, but massive respect is still due the whole Force, Inc. network for being at the center of the most interesting developments in electronic music over the last ten years. And there's no question that where Electric Birds are now fits with the label's aesthetic. What's surprising about Gradations is the amount of gritty funk Electric Birds adds to the usual mix. Actually, to clarify, when I say 'gritty' I'm talking about the stuff that gums up the rollers in a laser printer, not the dirty sweat that slides down from an armpit to a waist. Still, no other word but 'funk' could possibly describe the momentum that builds through ""Astral Traveling,"" as the customarily gorgeous keyboard drones join forces with a shuffling beat and the tiny blip of a slap-bass riff. Also noteworthy are the guitar accents that give ""Cyclist"" and ""Painted Rooms"" a satisfying organic counterpoint. ""Painted Rooms"" is particularly affecting, as the bassy acoustic guitar picking imparts a dark force that forms an interesting contrast to the glowing, cheerful synth pattern that dominates the tune. ""Painted Rooms"" and a number of other tracks work the now-ubiquitous microhouse beat into the equation, but Electric Birds' attempts at punchy rhythms feel much more satisfying here than on Panorama. Martinez seems to have developed his ability to make the right beat work with each piece. The title cut, easily the most dub-influenced track to date for Electric Birds, matches the hard panning and phasing effects with a faint, steady kick drum, giving the unpredictable foreground a steady base to work from. Taking a slightly different tack, ""Rian"" combines eerie sound effects with a click + cut variation on the two-step beat. Still, despite the rhythmic progressions evident on Gradations, deep, textured synth patches remains Martinez' bread and butter. It really is difficult to get to the bottom of why the gurgling clusters of sound in ""Nightriders"" and ""Radia"" are so moving. Maybe it's me, but Martinez' way with a heavenly drone is almost unmatched these days, equaling the raw sound construction of Windy & Carl. The complaint I have with Gradations is a familiar one with Electric Birds: a few tracks just go on to long, and don't have the variation or development to justify the repeated loops. But the good stuff here makes these moments of tedium well worth sitting through.","It's becoming clear that the first Electric Birds album was something of a one-off.

Millions of Brazilians,Dianogah,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b97cea9e61561daa6fd6/1:1/w_160/cc8d1db2.jpg,2002-08-21 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2303-millions-of-brazilians/,Southern,"""It's like James Brown [cough] threw up on post-rock."" I'm not one to cite the post-party morning as an opportune time for musical insight, but there's something to be said for the lack of pretense found in those hardcore attendees still crashed on your couch, whose only certainty about the preceding evening was whether or not the music you played befitted their wanton 'groove-makers.' They're not drunk enough to be taken with a grain of smelling salt, yet not sober enough to allow inhibitions to deter them from stating their honest assessment. So, when I instituted my routine survey amid an early morning clean up last week, I was surprised to learn that: Beta Band were ""slamming the stanky on the hangdown"" FC Kahuna should return to their chosen place of exile: my discman (fuck off, that record is choice!) Dianogah sounds like the Godfather or Soul arranging the boys in Tortoise Fair enough. When your band's comprised of nothing more than two bassists and a drummer, you'd better know how to funk shit up royally, and these guys most certainly do. But beyond that, they just make such great accompaniment to hipster throwdowns. Your indie-antagonist guests want to have good, clean fun, but all within the confines of an emotionally viable environment. So, boy, you'd better reacquaint yourself with the subtle introspection of Dianogah. And get the hell off my couch! Millions of Brazilians, Dianogah's third proper release, finds the group marrying the more textural work of their aptly titled debut, Old Material, New Format, to a formerly unseen layer of structural sophistication. Nowhere is this better evidenced than on ""Flat Panda,"" a wide-eyed exercise in dynamic that showcases a few clever tremolo effects and the band's innate sense of melody. Elsewhere, as on the brilliant opening cut, ""Wrapping the Lamb, Sir,"" or the thundering ""Maria, Which Has Got Her Heart Completely Fucked Up,"" the band manages to breathe new life into even the most tired post-rock clich√©s. And that's saying a lot, considering the number of instrumental artists who still believe that a modicum of sonic climax in every song is all that's necessary to create quality music. (In a word: no.) That said, it's tough to overlook the obvious limitations of a two-bass setup. While Millions of Brazilians is easily the most potent and concentrated effort Dianogah has yet to produce, it still lacks tonal variation. Bringing in production wizard John McEntire to add flourishes of warm, bubbling synthesizer was indeed a wise decision here, and the record is made that much better for his involvement. But even the crispest production or smartest compensatory synth can't squeeze blood from a stone. Dianogah have done what most artists in their situation never could have: escaped 'novelty.' Achieving greatness, however, will prove much tougher.","""It's like James Brown threw up on post-rock.""

OOOH! (Out of Our Heads),Mekons,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c4155e6ef9596932399a/1:1/w_160/01b761ae.jpg,2002-08-21 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5203-oooh-out-of-our-heads/,Touch and Go,"Screw the Pistols: 2002 year marks 25 years of Mekons. They've been slinging their backwoods punk cowboy music more-or-less steadily for over two decades. Sure, their last record, Journey to the End of the Night, sounded a little mellow, like they were growing resigned to their age-- from its slow tunes and gloomy title, you'd think they were picking which belongings to take with them to the nursing home, and getting ready to put the cat to sleep. But suddenly, here they are with an anniversary record that, while not quite as wild as the ones they made in their prime, sounds raucous and brutally alive. Recorded in their adopted home of Chicago, the ill-titled OOOH! is a return to textbook Mekons-- from gracefully shambling country to deep-beating tribal rhythms, by way of good, clean rock 'n roll. Susie Honeymoon's fiddle whistles and squeaks as she opens the album; Jon Langford and Tom Greenhalgh share roadhouse guitars, and Steve Goulding's drums crack the floorboards. And it's full of detail: the birdlike vocal harmonies fluttering over the end of ""Take His Name in Vain""; the thick moans of ""I am a stonehead"" that open the last track; the squirrely guitars and violin on ""Bob Hope & Charity,"" and Sally Timm's strange narratives and poetry. Singing lead are Langford, vocal cords still sounding like twisted roots on a stunted tree, and Timms, who's especially great with her weary vocals on ""Hate Is the New Love."" But they also make everyone else sing: up to a dozen people, including the whole band, plus local country chanteuse Kelly Hogan and pop queen Edith Frost. Every big chorus kicks off with a raucous singalong or choir-like swells, and hearing everybody in the studio bellow together may be the best part of the album. These eleven songs-- all new, aside from old-time weeper ""Lone Pilgrim""-- cross straight rock and country with shambling performances and weirdo primitivist lyrics. The band opens with the stomping, militant ""Thee Olde Trip to Jerusalem"" (""The seed of the devil lives on in men""), and then switch religions to the voodoo weirdness and ritual-rock guitars of ""Dancing in the Head."" And ""Winter"" lumbers happily along with lyrics about all the crazy pagan shit you can do in the shut-in months: ""I saw the belly of the beast/ It was warm and open/ Blood lay all around/ I crawled inside."" Yeah, those Chicago winters are a bitch. But the Mekons do just as well at slower tempos, with aching ballads (""Hate is the New Love"") and the warm country tones of ""Stonehead."" And unlike many bands in their later years, when they do choose to slow down a little, it doesn't detract from their delivery-- they still come off powerful, angry, and inventive. Not many of these new songs are likely to make the band's canon (though none are less than solid); there's nothing new, crazy or different. It's just their best record in years. And if they continue to inspire each other at these levels, the next quarter-century should treat them well.","Screw the Pistols: 2002 year marks 25 years of Mekons.

Home: Split EP Series Vol. IV,Bright EyesBritt Daniel,by: Brandon Wall,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a39dc0084474cd0c02e1/1:1/w_160/d13609db.gif,2002-08-20 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/940-home-split-ep-series-vol-iv/,Post-Parlo,"The kids at Post-Parlo are really on to something-- their pair-up of indie rock's best and brightest for split EPs, with each pressing capped at a mere 2,000 copies, has collectors everywhere running around like toddlers with their pants off. And they've really outdone themselves with their choice of packaging-- these envelope sleeves constructed from thick-pressed cotton paper spare no expense. They're even fit for a wedding invitation! Oh, and I nearly forgot to mention that, for this, the fourth and most highly anticipated installment of the series, they've secured Conor Oberst and Britt Daniel, the respective frontmen of indie rock major-leaguers Bright Eyes and Spoon. Not bad for a start-up. On their website, Post-Parlo touts Oberst and Daniel as ""two of the most gifted songwriters of the past decade,"" marketing this release as both a testament to and a test against the validity of that statement. The label isn't the first to make such a claim, but it's almost a dubious distinction, considering the dearth of quality songwriters these days. What's noteworthy about this release, however, is that Conor Oberst and Britt Daniel didn't simply submit two songs apiece to be packaged and peddled; these two heavy-hitters, best songwriters of the past decade or not, have actually collaborated on this outing. To avoid confusion down the road, let's get our credits straight first: all tracks are performed by both Oberst and Daniel together. ""Spent on Rainy Days"" and ""Let the Distance Bring Us Together"" were co-writes; ""You Get Yours"" is a Daniel original; and ""Southern State"" was penned by Oberst. The songs were recorded in Oberst's basement, then mixed in Austin by Daniel, and engineered by Spoon drummer Jim Eno. And, by dint of the collaborative format, the four songs flow together seamlessly. In accordance with Oberst's apparently innate songwriting formula, he opens ""Spent on Rainy Days"" with a regret (""I wish I saved up for rainy days cause they're the hardest to be dry""), and continues with, as usual, an account of the angst of separation. But the track, colored by these lite-pop motifs, is a winner, as Daniel's metallic guitar, alternating between sparse plucking and jagged strums, churns out a distorted riff that dashes beneath Oberst's strained pleas. The difference between the two songwriters, however, becomes evident with Daniel's ""You Get Yours."" Written in a direct and terse style, both lyrically and musically, it's a sharp contrast to Oberst's slow, unfolding allegories. Daniel's often admitted to his rudimentary ability on guitar, but we all know that technical skill hasn't got a damn thing to do with talent, and here, his simple, banged-out riffs burst with ecstatic energy. ""I won't kick you when you're down,"" he sings amidst the fray, ""I'll pull you back on your feet/ When you get yours."" ""Southern State"" is naturally more downtempo, with Daniel's southwestern acoustic guitar and backup vocals offering welcome depth. Conor, meanwhile, whispers over distant drums and a gently plucked guitar that, at times, is barely audible. Occasionally, Oberst's overwrought poetry paints the song a bit trite, yet his eloquence as a storyteller gives it the conviction to avoid coming off contrived. It's a shame, though, that he continually insists on drawing from standard pop fare for his lyrical content; love, heartbreak and drinking oneself to death have no question been done to death at this point, and he's got a way with words that would lend itself well to other topics. His unending pursuit of true love only detracts from what might otherwise be a truly unique vision The disc closes out with the simple, if highly compelling, co-write ""Let the Distance Bring Us Together."" Britt Daniel handles vocals here, and with a voice that wavers between the hum of a power saw and a slick, quiet falsetto, he softly slurs his words over a swollen tongue. The lyrics drag the song, unquestionably the highlight of the record, across the smooth sawdust floor of a Texas bar as Daniel subtly changes his pitch and tempo. I don't know how Post-Parlo managed to convince these two to pair up for such a limited-run project, other than that labelhead Ben Dickey must be one smooth-talkin' son of a bitch-- it's hard enough to get two artists of this caliber on the phone at the same time, let alone to persuade them to co-write and record fresh material for an EP most fans will likely never have the privilege to hear. But whatever the case, the result of this tag-team match is worthy of pay-per-view, and well worth the difficulty of tracking down. I'm not quite ready to back up that ""most gifted songwriters of the past decade"" bit, but I will say this: if these two can crank out a batch of songs this affecting their first time out, they oughta get together more often.","The kids at Post-Parlo are really on to something-- their pair-up of indie rock's best and brightest for split ...

Raining on the Moon,William Parker,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ff7ea9e61561daa4466/1:1/w_160/dd0cdb75.jpg,2002-08-20 05:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6173-raining-on-the-moon/,Thirsty Ear,"We argue now and then around the 'Fork office about whether or not ""jazz is dead."" My take: it's not, and Thirsty Ear's Blue Series is the evidence. Despite the genre's recent bout with hard times, its artists-- from Matthew Shipp, to John Zorn, to David S. Ware, to William Parker-- continue to merge new ideas with new technology, breaking many of the old laws of conventional jazz while still adhering to its base policies. With the ground broken by these artists in recent years, jazz, at least in the underground, is finding a new audience, and even enjoying something of a renaissance-- Blue Series curator Matthew Shipp broke records when, earlier this year, his Nu-Bop LP became the first album ever to debut at #1 on CMJ's college charts. The Blue Series is tailor-made to grab new listeners and convince that jazz is alive and doing damn well, thanks very much, with releases showcasing this new, boundary-pushing jazz music. William Parker and Matthew Shipp, in particular, have anchored many releases that take the best living improvisers and throw in something 'extra'-- sometimes a DJ, sometimes an programmer/electronics guy, or in this case, a singer. On Raining on the Moon, Parker's quartet-- with Louis Barnes on trumpet, Rob Brown on alto and flute, and the extremely simpatico Hamid Drake on drums-- is joined by Leena Conquest, who sings Parker's lyrics with a deep, compelling voice. Like Parker's bass, Conquest's vocals fluctuate between the bold and the yearning, always reaching for the fantastic from a deep-rooted center. And what she reveals about his vision makes this album as essential as his other recent projects, as well as a fine place for beginners to start exploring, as it's probably the most accessible. William Parker pursues spirituality through hard work. He plays bass as if reaching heaven is a matter of steadily, repeatedly knocking until someone opens the door; he's one of the avant-garde jazz players most dedicated to the pursuit of higher purpose and heightened awareness in music, and he approaches it with a heavy, elemental tone. His poetry, which he has rarely recorded, has the same character: it's full of images that emerge steadily and deliberately, using simple words to evoke rich colors and sounds. Take, for example, these lines from ""Song of Hope"": ""I have a rag doll filled with light and when I squeeze it the world gets brighter and brighter.../ I clap my hands and birds fill trees with sweet melodies."" On the album's centerpiece, the ambling, fourteen-minute title track, Conquest sings about an America turned upside down. Every wrong is corrected: the Native Americans take the presidency, and ""the White House is now the Red House""; Columbus Day is off the calendar; millionaires hand their money to the poor. It's a great riff, slowly growing more serious and pseudo-Biblical when everyone who's been lynched comes back to life. The victims forgive their killers: ""If you knew what you did you'd be evil... and I know you're not evil."" The song swells and rises, yet it never erupts or loses balance: Parker and Drake stay the course, Parker's tone sounding like a man moving heavy furniture while Drake's hi-hats shuffle around him. On two tracks, Parker plays an African Harp called the 'donso ngoni,' and echoes the reflectiveness of the New York loft jazz sound; there are also two instrumentals, the bright ""Hunk Pappa Blues"" and the ballad ""Old Tears,"" where Barnes and Brown stretch out beyond the commentary and interjections given to the other tracks. The album generally sticks with a strident, determined tone, with echoes of 60s and 70s protest music-- Conquest often evokes the spirit of, say, Abbey Lincoln on Max Roach's Freedom Now Suite-- yet the lyrics don't signify opposition so much as they dream of alternatives: a better world, more justice, watermelons that grow on trees... These are wild visions, but they sure seem real, and even attainable, when Conquest sings of them.","We argue now and then around the 'Fork office about whether or not ""jazz is dead.""

Since We've Become Translucent,Mudhoney,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c40313d197565213be69/1:1/w_160/4b5f4144.jpg,2002-08-20 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5493-since-weve-become-translucent/,Sub Pop,"The title of this album reeks of self-reflection; I'm gonna guess Mudhoney became translucent, oh, probably right around October 26th, 1993, with the release of Five Dollar Bob's Mock Cooter Stew. And when grunge lost its relevance to the music world at large in the mid-90s, Mudhoney simply became invisible. Much has been made of their continued determination to pummel a very dead horse, but old habits die hard. I mean, they've been rolling in the mud since it was still cool to be clean-- why stop now? When has lack of 'relevance' stopped most bands, really, and why, necessarily, should it? If Mudhoney could continue to belt out ""Touch Me I'm Sick""-caliber raunch, pertinence could go suck it. But, oh, music fans, such is not the case. So I'll waste no time getting to the point: Since We've Become Translucent is the most grinding, plodding, lumbering, overwrought hunk of sludge that I've had the misfortune of slogging through this year (I had to break out the hip-waders). Yet despite this, it's not even particularly awful-- it just makes you work for the good stuff. Hard. Yeah, early Mudhoney ain't exactly feathery-- ""In 'N' Out of Grace"" and ""I Have to Laugh"" are like 800-pound gorillas compared to some of the limp-wristed sissy-boy crap that's come along since. But now, where massive riffs were once churned out at light-speed, there's only the sound of what seems like a painful duty for Mark Arm and friends. And the worst part is that it sounds exactly like Mudhoney-- from the ultra-fuzzed guitars, to the primal percussion, to Arm's vitriolic, sneering vocals-- minus all the brute, unprocessed energy that originally made them so distinctive. The vocal/lyrical force is one of the few positive aspects of this disc, so I'll give credit where it's due. Arm still belches some of the silliest, throw-away (as in 'awesome') lyrics in rock with all the requisite conviction. The words, naturally, are of tertiary importance compared to the attitude behind them, and that's for the best, because this is one of the band's few remaining strong points. Few other voices in rock can make otherwise abysmal lyrics like, ""When you lash out against societeee/ And find yourself in penitentiareee/ And your cellmate says, 'You belong to meeee'/ You gotta take it like a maaan,"" sound this entertaining. Seriously. And it's not as though there aren't a few songs present that don't bring back fond memories. If every track on Translucent had even a fraction of the passion that comes through in the screeching and wailing of the closing moments on ""Winner's Circle""-- home to the album's best use of horns (the only significant instrumental change from vintage Mudhoney)-- it might shoot the rating up three full points. Admittedly, two other songs do share some of this track's pummeling sturm und drang: ""The Straight Life""'s chorus alone saves it from writhing under its own tonnage, resulting in a strange, lurching sort of tune that ends up damn enjoyable; and the urgency of ""Dyin' for It"" makes it a close second for best in show. But the sad fact is, the rest of this album's cuts are lifeless husks by comparison. Even the opening of ""Winner's Circle"" drags. The other tunes consist mainly of straightforward, generic homogeneity. Things slow to a crawl for much of the album, and without the frantic drive, there's nothing but traditional song structures and ancient, played-out progressions. This is the sound of Grunge Past, raised from the dead to parade its rigor-mortised corpse around for a few moments before returning to the grave. And it's kinda fun, but hardly bears a second listen. Mudhoney's sound is one of the most monolithic in grunge-- vintage or 'post'-- and back when the desire was more evident, there was nothing wrong with that. But now, lack of invention has stagnated the band's otherwise tolerable strains of filth, and left them with a record that's too often content to be nothing special. That is, when it isn't overwhelmingly bad, which, thankfully, is only for one track: the opener, ""Baby, Can You Dig the Light."" This eight-minute, forty-second behemoth is interminable; its grim monotony throws all the most obvious failings of Translucent directly in your face and dares you to walk away. Surviving that, the album proves to be somewhat more enjoyable, even if it tastes like unsalted drywall. Previous releases suffered from the same sort of rut, but the energy was mostly there; if nothing else, it sounded like a labor of love. Here, unfortunately, it just sounds like labor.","The title of this album reeks of self-reflection; I'm gonna guess Mudhoney became translucent, oh, probably right around October ...

Sun Papa and the Fan Club Orchestra Vol. 1 and Vol. 2,Fan Club Orchestra,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd4413d197565213b4e3/1:1/w_160/fb7a50a1.gif,2002-08-20 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2983-sun-papa-and-the-fan-club-orchestra-vol-1-and-vol-2/,Sonig,"Say what you like about Belgium's Scratch Pet Land, but they're original. They may not always be great, they may not always be enjoyable or even tolerable, but no one sounds like they do. Combining vintage noisemaking machines, computers, unusual percussion, and discarded toy instruments, Scratch Pet Land made an otherworldly and (at times) compelling racket on their debut full-length back in 2000. Influences were undetectable, instrumental sources puzzling. It sounded like nothing but Scratch Pet Land. Now Laurent and Nicolas Baudoux have expanded the Scratch Pet Land project and given it a new name: the Fan Club Orchestra. In 1999, The Brothers Baudoux assembled ten friends and had them improvise on Game Boys, samplers, flutes, harmonicas, turntables, mouth harps, and god only knows what else, all under the direction of Laurent, who gave detailed instructions to the Orchestra via overhead projector. The resulting cacophony was then mixed down and edited. Believe it or not, there is now a Fan Club Orchestra Japan, started by an early participant in the Belgium chapter. He brought the communal noisemaking format back to his homeland, and FCOJ just might release a record of its own down the road. To be completely honest, the most beautiful thing about the Fan Club Orchestra is the concept. There's a small black-and-white photograph of a recording session on the back cover of the record, and you can feel nothing but joy gazing at the dozen or so folks sitting on the floor with their guitars and electronic devices. The idea of a group of people, some of whom are non-musicians, coming together to get all drum-circle with their battery-powered gizmos seems like a total blast to me. It's the polar opposite of IDM's primary archetype: the pale, bald-headed shut-in sitting alone in front of a computer monitor. The music, even though it doesn't come close to matching the greatness of the communal idea and sometimes strays into ""more fun to make than listen to"" territory, has enough weird and inspired moments to make the album worthwhile. But as with Scratch Pet Land, erecting signposts is difficult. The typical Fan Club Orchestra track is built around a three-chord vamp on some sort of cheap keyboard, with various instruments-- most of which have a timbre that could be best described as 'dinky'-- buzzing around this center. The Orchestra makes no attempt to hide the fact that close to half its members are making music on handheld gaming devices, instead using the toys to build a sweet, innocent and unpredictable world of sound. And while I've sometimes wondered about the authenticity of improvised laptop music, there's no question that these guys are making it up as they go along. The softer, more focused tracks (none are titled), which retain a certain amount of musicality, are by far the most enjoyable. A couple of these even come close to building a groove, when the chord riffs and bits of percussion come together to create something that swings. And then there are a handful of tracks that just aren't fun to listen to, where all the tinny devices combine into a midrange-heavy roar. But most of the fourteen pieces fall somewhere in between, filled with odd textures and melodic bits that pop out momentarily only to disappear back into the chatter. You won't hear another record that sounds like this any time soon; then again, you probably don't need to.","Say what you like about Belgium's Scratch Pet Land, but they're original.

Briefly known as Warsaw, the foursome was one of the darkest bands to come out of Manchester's late-70s punk scene, and their unique sound-- filled with the urgency the genre was known for, but also with the tormented imagery and pained cries of frontman Ian Curtis-- was largely responsible for the initial success of England's Factory Records. However, a newborn daughter and the prospect of an American tour could not draw lead singer Ian Curtis away from the dissolution of his marriage and a rash of epileptic seizures, and in May of 1980, he took his own life. The question of the band's place in the pantheon is moot, of course: the remaining members went on to form New Order, pioneers of the 80s synth-pop that would go on to be characterized as new wave. But one of the aims of the film is to illustrate how rave culture rose up in England, a vision of hope out of the bleak Manchester landscape. New Order serve to symbolize that rebirth in a way, the lynchpin that ties the post-punk and early electronica eras together. But first, some context. The film follows the exploits of one Tony Wilson, the witty, pretentious co-founder of the Factory record label central to the story, and his comments in the liner notes offer some illumination on this vital but somewhat flawed soundtrack. He was there for the infamous Sex Pistols gigs that took place in Manchester during June and July of 1976: only 42 people supposedly attended, but as the legend goes, most went on to form bands of their own. Wilson reminds us that ""Anarchy in the U.K."" hadn't even been written at the time, but the film and the soundtrack kick off with it anyway. So it's weird to hear this version, so clean and glossed with sharp production, more rock-and-roll anthem than punk call-to-arms. Still, it's the fucking Pistols: the galvanizing guitar surge, the bombastic drums, and Johnny Rotten's vicious sneer of a laugh. Then came the Buzzcocks, punk's great singles band. Pete Shelley and Howard Devoto were at that same Sex Pistols show, though they'd already begun practicing as a band. ""Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn't Have Fallen In Love With),"" included here, bursts forward with manic energy rarely rivaled on either side of the Atlantic. It's a surprisingly moving song, buoyed by Shelley's passionate, almost feminine vocals. Wilson has to have a trio of punk icons, though, and so we complete the circle with The Clash. Though not Mancunian themselves, the band are hardly unwelcome on this collection, especially with ""Janie Jones,"" surely a shock to 70s rock dudes everywhere who found themselves painted for the first time as squares. Joy Division and New Order are the heart and soul of the soundtrack, though, and it's bound to sell well with so many of the classics covered. From Ian Curtis' frantic urging to ""dance, dance, dance, dance, dance to the radio"" on ""Transmission,"" to the disturbingly prescient ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" and the broken appeal of ""Atmosphere,"" these are painfully revealing songs. It's odd that the film passed over New Order so quickly; the soundtrack does a better job of tracking how technology slowly permeated the music. ""Temptation"" provides this soundtrack's first glimpse of synth-pop with its giddy undercurrent of keyboards and drum machines. Then the song that flipped the equation: ""Blue Monday,"" the biggest-selling 12"" single of all time (it sold three million copies worldwide), where the beats and synth came first and the riffs only added color. Of course, half the journey is just getting there, and younger ears might be disappointed with the old-school synth-sounds of the techno acts on the soundtrack. A Guy Called Gerald's ""Voodoo Ray"" chops and loops a woman's ecstatic vocals, and manages to escape from the history books with the simplicity of the arrangement. The group Gerald started out with, Manchester's 808 State, were named after the Roland TR-808 drum machine, a Pandora's box that was tweaked to create many of the mutant sounds of electronica. 808 State were brilliant sequencers, but it's hard to deny that the canned horns of ""Pacific State"" remind us more of the Muzak you hear on television directory channels these days. At least the Warner execs had the sense not to choose ""Contrique,"" an 808 song arrogant enough to sample the bassline of Joy Division's ""She's Lost Control."" But what's up with the original, which occurs later on the soundtrack? On first listen, the version of ""She's Lost Control"" included here seems to be the twelve-inch mix, which placed deeper reverb on the minimalist drum pattern. But those signature beats have been retouched even further, and the insectile feedback that rose up at the end of the original mix has now been added to the front as well. There are no notes to explain this anywhere, and it raises the question of why this was necessary. Likewise, the cover of Joy Division's ""New Dawn Fades,"" performed by New Order in 2001 with help from Billy Corgan, John Frusciante and Moby on vocals. The ensemble manage to do it some justice-- Moby really belts it out at the climax-- but like his cover of Mission of Burma's ""That's When I Reach for My Revolver,"" this live cut is too loyal to the original to justify inclusion. It makes less sense to complain about the mixes of the Happy Mondays material-- their shambling live sets were given to psychedelic treatments, and the second half of the film focuses on how the crowd shifted from punk pits to a collective proto-rave atmosphere somewhere between the future and the hippie past it was partially spawned from. So you've got the Jon Carter mix of the song from which the film takes its name, and the Steve Osbourne/Paul Oakenfold re-working of ""Hallelujah."" ""Loose Fit"" actually works best in its original form, though, and that early-90s alternative dance-crossover apparently still had some rock left in it: Shaun Ryder's laissez-faire call to ""do what you're doing, say what you're saying, kill who you're killing"" is pretty far from the 'Peace, Love, Unity, Respect' creed the rave scene came to adopt. Like the movie, the 24 Hour Party People soundtrack (and its attendant liner notes) occasionally seems to pat itself on the back too often. Surely the smug self-satisfaction of New Order's recent ""Here to Stay"" could have been switched out for something more relevant. If influences outside of the Manchester scene like the Pistols and the Clash were allowed, why not Afrika Bambaataa's ""Planet Rock,"" the original showdown showcase for the twisted 808? Or maybe Phuture's ""Acid Tracks,"" one of the earliest pure techno songs, which could have better highlighted the dialogue between Chicago and Manchester. A Certain Ratio would have done well to balance out the Durutti Column on the Factory ticket. And spout all the jokes you want to about Vini Reilly making chillout music-- ""Otis"" is a real dud. What remains is a decent introduction to anyone completely unfamiliar with this crucial period in modern music, but as Tony Wilson writes, ""at worst, a soundtrack album is a souvenir of a movie."" It's not clear how the album's revamped versions are meant to celebrate the originality of its artists, but there's a danger of getting the history wrong when looking back on it with colored lenses. Moreso than most other situations, it affords me the opportunity to insist that you run out and buy the albums these songs were culled from instead, to forge your own personal journey of discovery through the era. I can say this because the story's much broader than that of rockists and Anglophiles: it's a timeline shared by the nascent hip-hop and electro coming out of New York, the burgeoning Detroit techno and Chicago house industry, and the beginnings of the goth scene in Joy Division's doom and gloom. Better to track down this decade's insane explosion of tangents individually than to be given a brief summary by a hit-or-miss marketing device.","24 Hour Party People seems a strange title for a film that begins by chronicling the rise and fall of ...

"G2, 44+/ x2",Phill Niblock,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3f613d197565213be48/1:1/w_160/e8171435.gif,2002-08-19 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11789-g2-44-x2/,Moikai,"I am giving Phill Niblock's G2, 44+/ x2 CD what could well be my one and only 'proper' listen. I've heard the record a half-dozen times walking around town and riding the bus, and I've given it a few more spins while reading in my living room. But for none of these did I follow Niblock's own instructions in the liner notes: ""...you should play the music VERY loud. If the neighbors don't complain before the piece ends, it's probably not loud enough. The ones that live a mile down the road, that is."" I live in an apartment populated by respectable people with real jobs who keep regular hours. One of them could be pounding on my door at any moment. So I'd better get to it, then. Phill Niblock is a distinguished composer who also happens to have released very few records. Like LaMonte Young (with whom he shares many ideas about drone, pitch and tuning) and Maryanne Amacher, Niblock has avoided releasing his pieces, in part because he hates the idea of giving up control of how they're presented. The notion that someone might give one of his pieces a casual spin on a cheap stereo has been too painful for Niblock to bear, and so, he has presented his work in installation settings, where he can make them as loud and as long as he likes. Niblock's aversion to recording is slowly giving way. This recording contains two versions of a 1996 piece called ""Guitar Too, for Four."" On the first, Niblock recorded and edited guitar parts laid down by Rafael Toral, Robert Poss, Susan Stenger and David First, and then let Toral improvise on top of this construction. On the second, Niblock adds further improvisations from Kevin Drumm, Lee Ranaldo, Thurston Moore, Robert Poss and Alan Licht to the original mix. Yet, despite the presence of all the high-profile guitarists and the word 'improvising,' both of the ""Guitar Too, for Four"" pieces are total Niblock. All guitars were played with an e-bow, a device used to magnetically stimulate guitar strings, and hence, ""Guitar Too, for Four"" is pure drone from start to finish. There's no telling who plays what, and a grand total of three notes are heard, anyway. So, then, what's the point of layering five guitars on top of each other of you're only going to play three notes, you ask? Well, Niblock's music is all about small, subtle differences, and the interference caused by tiny pitch fluctuations. Each guitarist is continually making slight modifications to his part using the guitar's tremolo arm, and inside these details lies the heart of the piece. The varying pitches at which the guitars hum initially seem stable and unchanging, but as you listen closer, you notice the slow, gradual shifts happening continuously. The midtone almost imperceptibly slides below the high note, or two competing versions of the bass shake out of tune, giving a beating rhythm of harmonic fluctuation. What's key is that each particular amalgamation of tones has its own subtly different emotional quality. At one moment the piece seems as soothing as the fluffiest Windy & Carl piece (though there's no distortion here, make no mistake); the next it takes on a menacing cast, as the pitch differences start to flutter. ""Guitar Too, for Four"" closer than anything I've heard to capturing the sound in LaMonte Young's Dream House. This piece is sound as sculpture, a fixed object rising from the ground that's infinitely variable based on the point of view of the listener. But while Young's installation literally varied markedly based on the listener's position in the room, Niblock's piece involves movement of another sort: one based on where the listener chooses to focus his attention. I'm not going to lie to you-- this is the kind of record where you have to put in some work and have even more patience, but the payoff is there. And now, after just over an hour inside G2, 44+/ x2, the second version of ""Guitar Too, for Four"" fades out-- and not a peep from the neighbors. Perhaps next time I'll give the volume knob another 45-degree turn clockwise.","I am giving Phill Niblock's G2, 44+/ x2 CD what could well be my one and only 'proper' listen ...

II,Palomar,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0e6b1335d7bf1698115/1:1/w_160/bcf1b443.gif,2002-08-19 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6128-ii/,Self-Starter Foundation,"My personal musical continuum allows for wide-range emotional expression. On one end of the continuum lies rage; at the other, joy. Everything else-- from sadness or humor, to apathy or longing-- falls somewhere between. It is a broad, canyonesque continuum, spanning genres as diverse as black metal, slow-core, space-funk, post-punk, and many others. But alas, there a few limited avenues of expression which find themselves on an entirely different plane, excluded from this continuum of toleration. One of them is cuteness. Palomar is cute. Not perpetually cute, thank god, but in spurts, Palomar are Nermal to my Garfield-- almost intolerable, and a major hurdle toward my enjoyment of the album-- or most adults', for that matter. The basic cuteness construct Palomar employs here is a spin on pop/punk, with a heavy emphasis on the 'pop' part, and the 'spin' displaying all of the symptoms of an indie-polka. The polka-line isn't just a toss-off critique, either; tunes like ""Knockout"" or the beginning of ""Lesion"" had me tasting pierogies. None of this is to say that Palomar aren't talented. Quite the contrary-- wade your way through the Hello Kitty delivery and you have a good slab of catchy, competent songwriting. One of the band's talents is orchestrating spunky, energetic vocal melodies. It sounds like at least three, if not all four band members, chip in once in a while to sing lead, enrich choruses, add counterpoint, or complete a four-part harmony. Tonally, the band remains fairly consistent, with treble-heavy bass, two guitars (one with a warm electric tone, the other overdriven), and a nasal vocal lead. The music itself is nowhere near as stagnant as most pop-punk, though, as Palomar sensibly modulates tempo and intensity, like on ""Evening Falls at the Buffalo Bar,"" which shifts from a slow, one-horse trot to a full-band gallop. ""Up!,"" featuring two guys from the Strokes (!) on background vocals (not Julian), builds through a standard punk verse to a super-catchy Grease-like theatrical chorus and denouement. Demographics are probably about as much of a concern for Palomar as an arena tour. But supposing this band had thought about demographics, it would be plainly evident that they'd reached some sort of consensus about females under the age of 22. I say this because Palomar plays fun, youthful music-- the kind of stuff you'd expect your 16-year-old girlfriend to put on a summertime mixdisc (your 16-year-old girlfriend-- mine is 17, thanks very much). The youngsters will probably enjoy this record most, but this doesn't mean you won't, too (provided you're over 22). If you have the stomach for a cute, carnival-fun atmosphere, Palomar just may be your very own orgasmic version of Whack-A-Mole. If you don't, then the Tilt-a-Whirl may be a better analogy, with this review playing the part of 'ominous wafting barf aroma.'","My personal musical continuum allows for wide-range emotional expression.

Revolverlution,Public Enemy,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a14cc0084474cd0bfd9e/1:1/w_160/54033117.jpg,2002-08-19 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6501-revolverlution/,Koch,"Public Enemy first placed the music industry in its infamous crosshairs in 1987 with the release of their breakout album Yo! Bum Rush the Show!. At the time, the military industrial complex was thriving thanks to the Reagan/Bush regime, and hip-hop, which had yet to be completely co-opted by the mainstream, was famously tagged by Chuck D as the ""black CNN."" 2002: the nations have seen some turnover in staffing, but the political landscape remains largely the same. What has changed is hip-hop and its role in the national political dialogue. In today's climate, it would be unimaginable for an aggressively political group such as Public Enemy to achieve the levels of commercial success and exposure that they did in the late 80s. Hip-hop-- particularly mainstream, though the underground is not inculpable-- has degenerated into an iced-out billboard for hyper-capitalism and MTV culture. Instead of saying ""fuck tha police"" or ""fight the power,"" today's hip-hop heavyweights implore their audience to buy their clothing line and obey their thirsts. Hip-hop statesman/PE frontman Chuck D, realizing that the grip of corporate capitalism has strangled hip-hop's ability to invoke public dissent, has now embarked on a mission to redefine the cultural parameters of the music. ""The [hip-hop] culture has been bought and sold,"" Chuck D recently told Bay Area DJ Davey D. ""As a people, we aren't even at the packaging table. The determination is being made elsewhere."" So it's evident that Chuck D is still very articulate with his views. What's revolutionary about Revolverlution, though, isn't its socialist-charged rhetoric, but its decentralized means of dissemination and its level of audience interactivity. Since 1998, Public Enemy have established four separate websites to achieve their goals: Rapstation.com is a general hip-hop news site; Bringthenoise.com offers a real-time live feed of underground and mainstream hip-hop; and the main facet of Publicenemy.com is the message board, which is both widely popular and closely monitored by the band members to gauge audience attitudes and encourage an open dialogue between artist and audience. Slamjamz.com, however, is perhaps the most innovative of all four-- here, the band made 1999's There's a Poison Goin' On available via MP3s, and have consistently posted instrumental and a capella versions, encouraging fans to manipulate them and share the results. Last August, Public Enemy posted four a cappellas (""By the Time I Get to Arizona,"" ""Shut 'Em Down,"" ""B-Side Wins Again,"" and ""Public Enemy #1"") to the website, and requested visitors to remix them for inclusion on Revolverlution. And from the sound of the remixes that ended up making the cut, Chuck D's still got a pretty good ear-- the tracks are disjointedly experimental, and the new sound breathes new life into these classics for 2002. The ""B-Side Wins Again"" remix, in particular, really stands out. The minimalist yet funky drum track fades in and out, augmented by densely textured and frenzied samples that perfectly complement Chuck D's riotous homage to b-sides. Not many old-school acts could pull off such an audacious revision, but Public Enemy have always been musically ahead of the game; their siren-laden sound collages provided the blueprint for everyone from NWA to Company Flow. Noticing that audiences tend to digest mix CDs better than full-lengths in the post-Napster world, Chuck D sought to structure Revolverlution so that it mimicked the Internet mixdisc. And in order to concoct what Chuck has called a ""compilation of ourselves,"" Revolverlution also includes several live selections of their classics, an interview with Big Daddy Kane and Ice Cube on the making of ""Burn Hollywood Burn,"" and a post-concert interview in 1992 that covers how Arizona dealt with the controversy that arose when it refused to recognize the Martin Luther King holiday-- a political mess that was chronicled in the PE classic ""By the Time I Get to Arizona."" Of the live tracks, ""Fight the Power"" and ""Welcome to the Terrordome,"" both recorded in Switzerland in 1992, capture the blistering energy of the group's acclaimed live show and also demonstrate the international eminence of hip-hop. Of course, while the album's structure is both inventive and successful in recontextualizing Public Enemy's past, it does result in diluting the focus of the new songs, a hit-or-miss assemblage of tracks addressing the post-9/11 political climate. ""Gotta Give the Peeps What They Need"" kicks off the album with a sample declaring that ""our society is fucked up, they are fucking our brothers and sisters up,"" followed by Flavor Flav and Chuck D alternately screaming broken imagery in vintage PE fashion. ""See Uncle Sam pissin' on us,"" Chuck D declares before the chorus repeats what has become a mantra of sorts for the band: ""Before you give the people what they want, you gotta give them what they need."" But the most pointed critique on Revolverlution seems to be aimed at the hip-hop community. ""Gotta Get Your Shit Together"" addresses hip-hop's reaction to 9/11: ""Cold and dark is the weather y'all,"" Chuck spits over a bludgeoning drum track, ""Gotta get your shit together."" This works on occasion, but it's true that Chuck no longer seamlessly spits the witty and confrontational critique that characterized It Takes a Nation of Millions or Fear of a Black Planet. And, with its guitar soloing theatrics and 7th Octave's Zach de la Rocha-like squealing, ""What Good Is the Bomb"" may be the worst song to ever have been tagged with the PE name. Yet, despite these moments when PE shows their age, they have largely prevailed with Revolverlution by revamping the very structure of how we digest music. One can only hope that their ability to examine the relationship between themselves and their audience will be infectious, and that other hip-hop crews will pick up where the group left off.","Public Enemy first placed the music industry in its infamous crosshairs in 1987 with the release of their breakout album ...

Last Call for Vitriol,Superdrag,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5d99d034d5c69bf33c8/1:1/w_160/7afd0802.jpg,2002-08-18 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7621-last-call-for-vitriol/,Arena Rock,"Superdrag kicked off their career in high gear with a solid debut of laser-focused fuzz-pop dripping in melodies that stayed with you like burrs on a hiker. Their sophomore album, 1997's excellent Head Trip in Every Key, delivered almost fully on their potential, expanding their sound in multiple directions-- from crystalline ballads to sitar-fueled epics-- while tying it all together with songs most rock bands would kill to have written. So why is it that since that album, they've shoehorned themselves back into the tight fit of their debut? Continually retreating into their fuzzy pop sound (which, admittedly, they've pretty much mastered by this point), Superdrag have put all their eggs in a basket too small-- they live and die on the strength of their hooks. Do they deliver? Pretty much, as their choruses will absolutely spear you. But are these enough to carry the whole album? I wish I could say yes. For one thing, the band's verses frequently aren't as strong as the choruses, and very often resort to cheap couplets pulled from Roget's Rhyming Dictionary. In fact, principle songwriter John Davis leads off the album with the lines, ""She is one in a billion/ With lips of vermilion."" Thankfully, ""Baby Goes to Eleven"" is blessed with a melody about as good as they come, so you barely notice the lazy rhyming as the band backslaps you into the amazing chorus and never looks back. Superdrag stick with the basic sound for the album's entire first half, and at first, it seems like it's going to work. ""I Can't Wait"" rocks, and hard, too. The band even snares you early with some hard-hitting vocal hooks. The song also finds room for a guitar solo, a fine source of rock pleasure that most bands just don't seem to be down with these days. ""The Staggering Genius"" is the first sign that the band isn't headed for any new horizons, whipping out what may as well be labeled ""Superdrag Basic Track #2."" It's the kind of fuzzy riff that's fueled at least a dozen of their songs in the past, which is all well and good, I suppose, since at this early point in the record, you haven't had much of a chance to grow tired of it. ""So Insincere"" pulls the tempo back, but fails to change the sound at all, and the song is considerably less interesting than what comes before it. After the pleasant ""Extra-Sensory,"" with its simple harmonies and clean guitar jangle, the quartet bangs out another great tune, ""Feeling Like I Do,"" which mines the exact same territory they've been hiding out in since the mid-90s. Great tunes are a plus for any band, but some sort of deviation in sound-- even a slight one-- might be cool once in a while. The need for deviation doesn't come only in the overall sound, though. There's this chord progression that John Davis really seems to like, and it's smeared all over ""Way Down Here Without You."" I can count several other Superdrag songs off the top of my head that use this same progression as a background hook, and that's just kind of tiresome. Aside from that, however, the song is pretty tight, falling toward the cleaner end of the Superdrag spectrum. Oddly, the album makes its biggest misstep with its clearest attempt at variety. ""Safe and Warm"" sounds so much like a mid-70s Eagles ballad that-- no shit-- it had me looking for the Glenn Frey co-write credit. Nope, just bassist Sam Powers who, incidentally, turns in two of the album's strongest numbers late in the game: the powerful, sticky rockers ""Remain Yer Strange"" and ""Stu."" These songs, with their slightly different (but no less catchy) melodic and compositional styles are a breath of fresh air, as Davis' craft is almost too consistent. ""Remain Yer Strange,"" in particular, ranks as one the record's best songs. The title of ""Her Melancholy Tune"" basically describes the song, which sounds an awful lot like Head Trip's ""She Is a Holy Grail."" Closer ""Drag Me Closer to You"" moves into bluesier territory and winds up sounding like something that might have cropped up as a Badfinger album track. That's not necessarily a bad thing (er, necessarily), but it's also the least catchy thing here, and as a result it feels somewhat anticlimactic bringing up the rear. So what Superdrag have given us is essentially the same thing they've been giving us for most of their career. And this is my dilemma: how important is the fact that this band hasn't really taken their music anywhere new on this album? It certainly doesn't make the songs any worse, and at face value, Last Call for Vitriol is a good record from a seasoned band that writes melodies like haberdashers make hats. This makes the second album in a row on which Superdrag has failed to evolve as a band, and there's a bit of tragedy in that wasted potential. So here's what I'll say: fans of Superdrag will like this, provided they're okay with more of the same; newcomers should proceed directly to their first two albums and decide if they want to go from there.","Superdrag kicked off their career in high gear with a solid debut of laser-focused fuzz-pop dripping in melodies that stayed ...

Rad Zapping,Hockey Night,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0ffabf31b7dc7156556/1:1/w_160/2c68b132.gif,2002-08-18 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3896-rad-zapping/,1mg,"I was going to open this review with a bit of commentary from Ron MacLean and Kelly Hrudey of the Canadian Broadcast Company's ""Hockey Night."" Then I decided that Canada jokes are all but played out in this post-South Park: The Movie universe, and besides, I couldn't for the life of me imagine why these two cats'd be discussing Rad Zapping instead of, say, actual hockey. But, minutae aside, it'd have worked beautifully to narrate the breakneck stylistic shifts of Rad Zapping. For you see, Hockey Night, the conceptual outfit of one Paul Sprangers, skips from genre to genre like little kids playing hopscotch. Opening track ""Voice in Control"" commences with a bland drum loop before U-turning its way into speed metal power riffage. ""Battlestar Galactica"" sets up shop with a video-game sample beat and slacker boy/girl pop vocals, but breaks into some nasal white-boy rapping over the bridge. Track three continues the prep-hop over music that somehow sounds like Rush's ""Tom Sawyer"" mixed with ""Living on a Prayer,"" yet tracks four and five find the band spitting out cracked four-track guitar pop punctuated with Atari squiggles. And so on, and so on. By the end of the journey, Sprangers has tried his hand at virtually everything but Bavarian oom-pah and Mongolian throat singing. Actually, to scale back the hyperbole, the genre spectrum of Rad Zapping stays strictly within the boundaries of your typical indie renaissance man: synth-pop, lo-fi guitar histrionics, and ironic flannel-shirt hip-hop. All styles we've heard before, but rarely juxtaposed so closely within a single album or, occasionally, a single minute of a single song. Nevertheless, all the band's personae are not created equal. The more straightforward indie numbers (see ""Axe of Deliverance,"" ""StyleRaiders,"" or ""Princess Starcrystal"") expertly filter the bang-yo-head hard rock through a lo-fi aesthetic and shy vocalization, a la early Built to Spill... if they were playing a live set in a 1985 arcade. Alongside strong, tongue-not-in-cheek tracks like these, the many 80s nostalgia kicks and attempts at Beck-like wink-rhyming weigh down the album with excessive kitchiness. Other than some semi-interesting instrumentals falling somewhere between sound collage and DJ mix (most notably ""R.E.B.E.L System,"" with its eerie scratched-vinyl samples of children's songs and martini crooning), the non-rock pieces serve merely as novelty filler. Far be it from me, lowly non-musically talented rock critic that I am, to advise Mr. Sprangers on his musical career, but the keyword here is 'focus.' The multiple-personality disorder act might catch a jaded listener's ear the first time through, but runs the risk of being written off as a basement four-track goof for Paul and his drinkin' buddies. To maximize your potential, young sir, go with the bleep-bloop-enhanced indie stuff on future Hockey Night releases, and annex the goofy stuff off to some appropriately disposable side project. Actually, while you're at it, ditch the name Hockey Night altogether-- I hear CBC has some downright feisty Canuck lawyers. Thank me later, chief.","I was going to open this review with a bit of commentary from Ron MacLean and Kelly Hrudey of the ...

To Spirit Back the Mews,Various Artists,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7629d034d5c69bf37a7/1:1/w_160/c5dcb586.gif,2002-08-18 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1848-to-spirit-back-the-mews/,Asthmatic Kitty,"You know, when I first got this thing in the mail, I wasn't sure quite what to think. A thirty-seven track compilation issued by an obscure, preposterously named, Santa Fe-based record label owned and operated by Sufjan Stevens, a guy whose claim to fame thus far is the occasional Danielson Famile collaboration and a well-received but little-known full-length called Enjoy Your Rabbit. The disc, as it turns out, includes a large helping of unexceptional acoustic singer/songwriters, a couple of novelty pieces, and a handful of occasionally better-than-average lo-fi offerings. Thus, I'm left with the dubious task of distilling this bounty of unmemorable tracks into something you might want to read about. I hesitate to tell you there are gems hidden in the fabric of this release (overstatement), but like most compilations, a little patience and an attachment to your stereo's '>>' button might assist you in finding something to your fancy. Half-Handed Cloud's ""He's Not the Swindler We Are"" places singer/songwriter John Ringhofer's breathless quirkiness inside a synth-pop structure that at times recalls early Stereolab. Toronto-based Royal City's addition, the lazy honky-tonk ""My Brother Is the Meatman,"" is a decent Silver Jews homage with wonderfully gory lyrics. Jason Brouwer also does a mean barbershop quartet paean to chewing gum that ranks as one of my favorite tracks on the album. Unfortunately, Brouwer is allowed not one, but two more opportunities to undermine his first and best contribution. The first, ""Run Me Out of Town,"" lifts a guitar line from a Kinks klassik almost verbatim, and reformats it for intimate squeaky cleanliness so that it might back up his tepid attempts at lyrical profundity. The second, the Beck-meets-Grandaddy-lite ""It's What You Know So Well"" barely deserves a mention. And that, folks, is all the mention I care to give it. The multiple tracks granted the artists on this compilation is mostly an irritation; if I want to hear more than one song by Liz Janes, I'll buy her CD. And an artist that simultaneously channels Cat Power and Ida while chanting, ""Guitar... guitar... guitar,"" over-- you guessed it-- a guitar is something akin to sleeping in a cage full of wheezing asthmatic kitties. Likewise, Sufjan Stevens gets four songs that, to me, all sound like the emotionally overblown acoustic sadcore favored by such controversial characters as Pedro the Lion and Damien Jurado. But the above are not the nadir. Those slots are reserved for the ill-conceived electronica (""Bells"" and ""Big Room"") of Lowell Brams, whose contributions are both challenged and yet somehow saved by their brevity. Or the catatonia inducing, vague twee of the ladies in Lifestyles&Vistas;, who use both the holy spirit and an out-of-tune organ to sing about their preferred conception of ""the kingdom of God"" on ""Ordinary Guy."" Or Matthew Haseltine's super-baroque folk instrumental numbers which I can only associate with the Positive Vibes Christmas music CDs played at art glass and ceramics galleries from November 15th to New Year's Eve every year since 1975. And while I'm at it, the short, witless monologues the label has included here are rendered tangentially viable only through the overuse of a vocoder on 'chipmunk' setting (accredited to ""Chatty Munchkin""). Problem is, they're so blatantly ripped off from Beck's Stereopathetic Soul Manure that it strips them of any comic relief. I could imagine this being a better CD, sort of, had the Asthmatic Kitty compilers opted to quality over quantity, which would allow for a much-better-than-average compilation with limited missteps. As it is, To Spirit Back the Mews is an exhausting mess, and seemingly symptomatic of a label that has a hard time saying no.","You know, when I first got this thing in the mail, I wasn't sure quite what to think.

Turn On the Bright Lights,Interpol,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b97913d197565213ae72/1:1/w_160/59424c77.jpg,2002-08-18 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4113-turn-on-the-bright-lights/,Matador,"As you read this, there are likely a number of people in your midst summoning up all the backlash powers their mortal frames can bear, those who believe the boys from Interpol to be the latest shock troops in the battle of PR style over artistic substance. And who can blame them? After the veritable shitstorm of publicity drummed up by a certain New York City band-- one that had the audacity to not be the denim-clad messiahs of rock and roll we'd been promised-- directing a little skepticism toward NYC's buzzmongers is probably healthy. Plus, at a glance, Interpol's snazzy suits and expensive haircuts seem symptomatic of a carefully spun image designed purely to separate money from wallets. It's okay to be suspicious. But back up. These guys are on Matador, not RCA. The hypester division of Matador is a guy in a closet (and he's only part-time); the 'spin' budget for Interpol wouldn't even be a down-payment on Julian Casablancas' designer leather jacket. The fact that these guys see press at all can only be attributed to their die-hard contingent of fans (I'm only recently converted), and was earned purely through legwork and a handful of underpublicised EPs. And now that they've won our attention, after three years of toiling in obscurity, it's mere icing that their debut full-length delivers upon what the whispers only hinted at. Interpol's debut full-length is wrought with emotional disconnection and faded glory, epic sweep and intimate catharsis. Inevitably, the hype exceeds return (that's why it's hype-- and, to be fair, Interpol has largely flown under the radar compared to most other NYC acts), but there's no getting around that Turn On the Bright Lights is an incredibly powerful and affecting album. Loss, regret, and a minor key brilliantly permeate jangling guitars and rhythmic and tonal shifts-- and although it's no Closer or OK Computer, it's not unthinkable that this band might aspire to such heights. Speaking of Closer, Interpol can't seem to shake being likened to Factory prodigies Joy Division. The cause, however, isn't necessarily evident. Indeed, Daniel Kessler's sublime, angular downstrokes follow the smooth confidence of Carlos Dengler's basslines, and Paul Banks sings with Ian Curtis' downcast delivery and dramatic flair. The difference, however, lies in the music itself: what Joy Division played was sparse and jagged-- punk with a melancholy, but often minimalist bent. Interpol, meanwhile, are punk in ethic alone; their music bears few of that genre's signatures, with the band instead immersing themselves in a grander, more theatrical atmosphere with lush production that counters their frustrated bombast. ""I will surprise you sometimes/ I'll come around/ When you're down,"" Banks gently affirms over echo-drenched guitar simplicity and rolling bass, as ""Untitled"" hovers on artificial strings to open Bright Lights. The words are plaintive yet assertive, in agreement with the unsteady warble of the background, and they set the tone for an album that is equally paradoxical-- often bleak, but surprisingly uplifting. Each of the album's eleven tracks evoke raw, unsettling need suffused with delicate serenity. It can be difficult to absorb this much emotional relentlessness, as Banks unflinchingly confronts you with it at all times, but it's precisely this challenge that makes this record so staggering. The visceral punch of the thematic content is backed at every turn by melody among serrated riffs and amorphous percussion. Discussing the highs and lows of Bright Lights would just be splitting hairs, given its consistency, but a few tracks stand inches above the others. Of the two songs to be carried over from their self-titled EP, ""NYC""'s conflicted show of conditional love for the streets of Interpol's hometown is still one of the most brilliant cuts present. And as tight as the EP was, Interpol show how much more they're capable of with ""Obstacle 1"" and ""The New,"" the range between which is striking. ""Obstacle 1"" is as close to Joy Division as Interpol gets, coupling harsh, restrained outbursts of aggression with disturbing imagery as Banks clearly gasps, ""You'll go stabbing yourself in the neck."" The tense lead guitar is a counterpoint, giving these explosive bursts added depth, just as Ian Curtis' emotional collapses were made more poignant by the fragile guitar that cradled them. By the time the album reaches ""The New,"" the anger has dissipated, leaving only the calm sound of sober acceptance. The tragedy of music press is that when the buzz spirals out of control, people are apt to question a great band's validity, whereas if the band went largely unknown and was 'discovered' independently, so to speak, folks would be less likely to reject the praise out of hand. Whether that will happen with Interpol remains to be seen, but as a member of the press, it's my duty to tell you, from one music fan to another, what I personally think of an album, and in this case, it's that Turn On the Bright Lights has been one of the most strikingly passionate records I've heard this year. That other people I've spoken with have the opportunity to experience it, and that they feel similarly about it, can only be a good thing.","As you read this, there are likely a number of people in your midst summoning up all the backlash powers ...

Fat Beats Compilation Vol. 2,Various Artists,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a787c0084474cd0c0bee/1:1/w_160/ab7ae3d7.gif,2002-08-15 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1887-fat-beats-compilation-vol-2/,Fat Beats,"Although hip-hop culture spans decades, it wasn't until the mid-90s that what we now consider to be underground hip-hop defined itself as a movement. A loose artistic aesthetic was established, the independence-as-freedom stance was cemented, and the key elements (breaking, emceeing, DJing, and graffiti) were revived for a new generation of b-boys and girls. Although one cannot downplay the power of the Internet to spread the message to those in non-urban locations, Fat Beats Records acted as a physical epicenter for the renaissance of roots hip-hop. The staff was comprised of noted DJs that transcended their roles as sales clerks and acted as educators for their patrons and as a distribution lifeline for independent artists who were otherwise ignored. The love and devotion that Fat Beats displayed was infectious, and as hip-hop purism and vinyl culture spread, the company branched out from its original NYC location and opened stores in Los Angeles and Amsterdam. They were also able to launch a label that has released the latest J-Zone and Atmosphere albums, among others. If any record store/label has earned the right to release a self-aggrandizing compilation album, it's Fat Beats. The first compilation, released last year, was an unmitigated jewel, featuring everyone from the RZA to Blastmaster KRS-One to (comparative) new jacks Kazi and Non Phixion. DJ Eclipse kicks the second volume off with a short intro that cuts and splices the words ""Fat Beats"" from various hip-hop tracks. Next up is ""Make Them Clap"" featuring Lootpack's Wildchild and produced by none other than Madlib the Bad Kid. After the long delay between the Lootpack LP, which was released almost four years ago, and Wildchild's solo CD, which is scheduled to be released later this year, there were doubts about whether or not the man still had it in him. ""Make them Clap,"" with its infectiously funky beat and classic ""ready on the right"" samples, should erase any doubts about Wildchild's stature as one of the left coast's preeminent rhyme technicians. Wildchild sounds as hungry as ever as he spits battle rhymes in his trademark rapid-fire delivery. ""Ironically,"" Wildchild raps, ""[I've] been paying more dues than physically paying rent."" While it may not be anything revolutionary, emcees like Wildchild personify the old school, on-the-corner mentality and the inclusion of this unreleased track almost single-handedly justifies the purchase of this compilation. Fellow Lootpacker Madlib also pops up later in the guise of his bugged-out alter ego Quasimoto on his classic ""Come On Feet."" The track's production, which is a fusion of ""Come on Feet Move for Me"" (from the blaxploitation classic Sweet Sweetback's Badass Song) and the theme song for the French avant animation classic Fantastic Planet (produced by Serge Gainsbourg arranger Alain Goraguer), captures a soulful paranoia that sounds straight outta the intergalactic hood. Another highlight is the Saukrates and Common collaboration ""Play Dis."" The beat, supplied by Saukrates, has an aired-out funk vibe that's more than a little reminiscent of Jay Dee. In other words, it's a perfect track for Common to spit his positive and vaguely political rhymes. Leading off the second verse, Common smoothly rhymes, ""Stimulated by a tree of drama/ I advance on the branch of respect and honor/ A patient of the ill state, centered in trauma."" If nothing else, the track whets our collective appetite for Common's upcoming LP, Electric Circus, and establishes Canada's Saukrates as one of the few emcees who can hold his own when faced with Common's complex metaphors and wordplay. With the unreleased song ""My Song,"" Minnesota-based Atmosphere also comes with a lite and funky production that is reminiscent of Jurassic 5's ""Concrete Schoolyard"" or 4th Avenue Jones' ""Back in the Day."" Vocalist Slug initially picks up on the childhood reminiscence vibe the track begs for, rapping, ""Sitting on the steps with Ant... flipping pig Russian, discussing politics and contraband."" However, as the track progresses, Slug's imagery grows darker and more aggressive until the song becomes a taunt to his critics who are ""sleeping on life and writing the same scriptures"" and act ""like they don't know the words to my songs."" While the whole I'm-fucking-your-wife diss that the song dissolves into is a bit played (at best), Ant's sweet and slow production keeps the song afloat and contrasts nicely with Slug's dark and personal lyrics. Other highlights include the Alchemist number with Twin of the Infamous Mobb (aka Mobb Deep). The song features a back-and-forth lyrical duel between Alchemist and Twin, contrasting Alchemist's privileged upbringing with the inner city horror of Twin's childhood. ""We used to play with guns,"" Twin raps, shortly followed by Alchemist declaring, ""We used to play ball."" The lyrics follow the Alchemist (who rarely rhymes) and Twin through their respective lives until they're ultimately brought together by a love of hip-hop. It's an interesting look at the two different spheres of the genre, and reveals how hip-hop has the potential to break down racial and financial barriers that would have otherwise been insurmountable. While almost every track on this disc is a certified banger, I did question some of the source material. Mass Influence's ""All Out,"" J-Zone's ""Live at Pimp Palace,"" the Arsonist's ""The Session,"" and ""Come on Feet"" are all certified classics, but they've also been circulated on so many mixtapes, compilations, and LPs that their inclusion here seems a bit redundant. I'm sure that the peeps at Fat Beats have a small vault of incredible b-sides and unreleased jewels that would make even the most seasoned digger jealous. Why not give us a little more underground love? I also wondered why Fat Beats, which is the Mecca of DJ culture, didn't release a mixed version of this album. With the advent of filesharing and CD burners, most of the compilation's songs are easily attainable without having to drop a penny. And when you have DJ like J-Rocc or Shortkut providing their own interpretation of the songs, it gives the consumer a greater incentive to plop down their $14. Still, these are minor, peripheral complaints and should in no way discourage anyone from checking out this great compilation. This is a worthy reflection of the kingdom that Fat Beats helped create, and I can't wait for a volume three.","Although hip-hop culture spans decades, it wasn't until the mid-90s that what we now consider to be underground hip-hop ...

Gantz Graf EP,Autechre,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a14aea9e61561daa4775/1:1/w_160/1ed07530.gif,2002-08-15 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/362-gantz-graf-ep/,Warp,"At press time, there seem to be two predominant attitudes about Autechre. The first is that they're one of the brightest, most consistently interesting outfits in IDM, and records like EP7 or LP5 define the present state of electronic dance music. The other is that Autechre's overly clinical approach puts them in grave danger of running their busy-beat shtick into the ground. 2001's Confield, despite its mention as one of Pitchfork's 20 best albums of last year, practically defined what it means to get mixed reviews. You could almost split its audience down the middle into those who were down with the avant-trip, and those who found it unengaging and devoid of visceral emotion. I like the album, but even I would admit that emotion isn't the first thing that comes to mind when listening to it. So when you're not sure whether you've stimulated or alienated your audience, what do you do? In Autechre's case, they've gone back to basics. The music on their freshly released five-inch, three-song EP, Gantz Graf, finds them revisiting the 'D' in IDM, as they have to varying extents on just about every release prior to Confield. Does that mean they were listening to their detractors last year? Or does it mean that they simply had some groove left in their brains after so much abstraction? Who knows? Maybe they were just dicking around in the studio and felt like releasing an EP. Gantz Graf's opener and title track wastes very little time hitting you with over-the-top beats and a distorted mix. There's a punchy melody comprised of successive synth jabs and some of the usual glitch trickery. But this track will immediately catch the ears of folks expecting more random chin-stroking music, as during its first half it features actual recognizable beats. Even the overdriven production can't obscure the clear rhythm. Of course, about a minute into the tune the beat begins to disintegrate, leaving only the melody to twinkle in the gaping void. Then, a while later, even that gets consumed by the twitching computer noise, and by the track's end, Autechre have locked us back inside their signature confusion and manic drill-glitch. ""Dial"" is the most straightforward song of the three, with a fast bounce-beat featuring some goofy organ patches and that snappy, Autechre-patented vacuum-pop rhythm track. If this song has any place in the canon of a band who were said to have sold their souls to the chaos theory devil with Confield, I don't know where it is, what with its similarity to 80s new wave quirk. It's a bit on the speedy side, otherwise you might even consider dancing to it. And deep in the mix lie some very treated vocals, though I can't decipher whether they're saying anything or just getting chopped up for the sake of filling out the arrangement. But at a runtime of just over six minutes, this is probably the closest the duo has come to straight club music since 1997's Chiastic Slide. The final track is the epic ""cap.iv,"" which finds the sound only slightly more abstract-- at least at first. The tempo is similar to that of ""Dial,"" though the beats are considerably more cluttered due to what sounds like a couple of competing electro-figures running concurrently. A straightforward piano line and an announcer who sounds stuck in a cavernous airport terminal play beneath the chattering percussion, adding a subtle but affecting texture. The track makes the Autechre strategy plain: lay an attractive backdrop behind restless, seemingly chaotic (emphasis on 'seemingly') blips and clicks. The backdrop here, however, is somewhat prettier than usual, and I wonder whether the beat that obscures it was only placed in front to appease fans of the tried-and-true Autechre way. As the track wears on, the intruding rhythms grow progressively louder and busier, and a good nine minutes later have utterly overwhelmed the other elements. The videos offered on Gantz Graf's additional 5"" DVD disc-- including a revamped version of an older video by renowned Aphex director Chris Cunningham-- are of only marginal interest to fans, as they're no less abstract than the music. Chances are, you'll watch them once and shelve them indefinitely. And as for the music, nothing here should come as a surprise if you've been paying attention to Autechre's recent releases, unless you expected them to go even further out than Confield. My guess is that these tracks are just cool-downs from that album, or possibly warm-ups for the next, because other than the refinement of ideas they've already realized, there isn't much new to report.","At press time, there seem to be two predominant attitudes about Autechre.

Realistes,Comet Gain,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a631b1335d7bf1698d8f/1:1/w_160/7e1a1e83.jpg,2002-08-15 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1559-realistes/,Kill Rock Stars,"There's a surprising dearth of intellectualism to be found at Rock 'n' Roll High School. The students more apt to bury their Buddy Holly glasses in pages of Kant or a wanky text dissecting the film techniques of the French New Wave are bound to get their asses kicked at recess by The Liars or Rye Coalition or some other group that feels the need to let off a little testosterone. So these smarty-pants band together in secret, subtly veiling their high-minded leanings under a veneer of pretension-- they'll hint at their summer reading lists, but never let you see what's on it. A rare few of these young brainiacs are confident enough to flaunt their intelligence-- listening to Ted Leo referencing Joyce is just one of the things that made The Tyranny of Distance so interesting. Of course, Leo is also a convenient example of how to cross the line between 'high brow' and 'you've got to be kidding.' And the title alone of Tej Leo (?), Rx/Pharmacists, in the immortal words of another great intellectual (Joey from ""Friends""), makes ""the line a dot to him."" That said, Comet Gain have, thus far, been something like the anti-Leo in both the smarts department and their approach to music: twice the pretense of artsiness, but less substance beneath it. That is, unless you want to consider putting on airs as an artform in itself, in which case we could be here all night. But I digress. Point is, Comet Gain have always made a sport of broadcasting there preferences for words, sights, and sounds as loudly as they could, not just in their liners, but sometimes even in √ºber-pretentious spoken word bits on their albums. On past offerings they've piled it on so thick-- like some sort of nerd-poseur desperately seeking to prove himself nerdy enough to join the chess club-- that it was difficult to take them seriously at times, but harder to fault them for the effort. And now that I'm finally used to their odd affectations, Comet Gain have gone and shifted their lineup (again) to record Realistes, an album largely devoid of turtlenecked reference to art and culture. What happened to the pomp? The circumstance? Well, apparently, they needed to make room in the tour van for better songwriting, so most of it had to go, which is fine. Artsy pretense is fun like ogling a car wreck is fun, but it usually sounds like shit. Old film stills of Italian realist and French new wave films litter the liners of Realistes, and indeed, frontman David Christian provides a long-winded rant on the band's ideals of deconstructing and rebuilding-- but without even a head-nod to Bazin! And while, according to drummer Chris Appelgren (founder of Lookout! Records and now the frontman for garage-rockers The Pattern), this album attempts to juxtapose ""a country twang on krautrock's mechanical drones,"" it appears they just ended up copping from various incarnations of Sonic Youth. If you listen hard enough, you can hear echoes of Dirty and Daydream Nation between the reverb-drenched compositions and male/female vocal tradeoffs of Christian and Rachel Green. Indeed, Comet Gain have narrowed focus from their previous release, Tigertown Pictures, and settled in on raw, hard-edged guitars, simple rhythmic arrangements, and heavily treated vocals to keep the listener at arm's length. This, however, is not actually a bad thing, since these laid-back rock tracks keep their pop melodies in the driver's seat, and the band does allow occasional hints of invention to sporadically beam through the murk. ""Why I Try to Look So Bad"" and ""I Close My Eyes and Think of God"" both typify Realistes' tendency towards lo-fi pop a la early Sonic Youth, and ""Movies"" draws on an SY sound from a few years down the line. The fuzzy distortion and vocals of these melodies are as competent as anything Comet Gain has produced, and to be fair, it's extremely listenable without succumbing to total Xeroxation-- even if it's not particularly memorable. And though the hazy, droning retreads are a decent foundation, the album really shines in the exceptions. ""The Kids at the Club"" sounds like a brawnier second-cousin of Belle and Sebastian's ""Legal Man"" and features a great intro bit like a scratchy LP of a 50s ad jingle. It's an electric opener that's just out of place enough to set it apart from the more subdued tunes to follow, and the guitar vibe still plays into them naturally. Of the notable exceptions on Realistes, the real star is ""Ripped-Up Suit,"" and not just because I'm in love with Kathleen Hanna. For real, this song, co-written and sung by Hanna, is a much-needed burst of adrenaline following the two slowest, most ill-conceived pieces present. Heavy, thrashing guitars and a lumbering bassline form a wall of feedback, almost concealing the vocals, which are nearly indecipherable to begin with after passing through numerous distortive filters. Hanna's gorgeous spitfire delivery, punctuated by an occasional beautiful yelp through digital fog, is a godsend. Realistes' faults, mercifully, aren't fundamental to its sound, or as intangible as simple derivation, but instead confined to individual missteps. ""Labour"" is the one truly misguided effort-- completely out of step with the tone of the album, it's a weird, low-key, horn-driven piece that feels like run down a blind alley. It's not bad, but it's sure not very good, a strange foray into Motown that hearkens back to Tigertown in terms of unsteady lack of focus. And, for a final negative Sonic Youth comparison: ""Moments in the Snow"" is as glaring and pulseless as any of the masturbatory crap Thurston Moore threw onto the suicide bombing that was NYC Ghosts & Flowers, right down to the hackified spoken word. And even this, if nothing else, is at least a throwback to some of the band's earlier pretensions, which I loved. But I'm still happier with the music.","There's a surprising dearth of intellectualism to be found at Rock 'n' Roll High School. The students\n\ more ...

Villa Claustrophobia,Tanakh,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7255e6ef95969320ee2/1:1/w_160/b13eb8bb.jpg,2002-08-15 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7926-villa-claustrophobia/,Alien8,"""Every great or even every very good writer makes the world over according to his own specifications,"" says Raymond Carver in an essay called ""On Writing."" I thought of that line when listening to Villa Claustrophobia by Tanakh, a project headed by Richmond, Virginia's Jesse Poe. Tanakh's first full-length release is the kind of album that feels less like a collection of songs and more like a window into a meticulously rendered universe in miniature. There are conventional songs here, and instrumental moods, and drifting ambient washes-- a typical proportion of tracks that make up an eclectic record. But these discrete components are designed beautifully to create the overall world of Tanakh. Villa Claustrophobia is shadowy, menacing, and of indeterminate time and geography. East, West, past and future all collide as violin, guitar, hand percussion, sitar and horns blend with layered production complete with electronic touches. It's difficult to pin down a particular era in the music, though it's impossible to discuss Villa Claustrophobia without mentioning the word 'gothic.' Late-period Swans is one clear reference point, as are the poly-ethnic medieval soundscapes of Dead Can Dance, but these artists seem more like fellow travelers rather than direct inspirations. What makes Villa Claustrophobia is how it all comes together. From the opening fade-in of ""In Every Villa,"" it's clear that this is going to be a disorienting ride. The first sound heard is the coiled hiss of a sitar, and then the voice of a wailing woman, reminiscent of the wordless vocals so prevalent in the desert music of Ennio Morricone, tracing the outline of a near-East melody. Echoing guitars and a rusty pile of industrial percussion give the illusion of massive amounts of space, and the combined effect of the track is a sensual atmosphere shot through with danger and violence. Villa Claustrophobia then shows just how improbably coherent it can be when Tanakh veers from the exotic mysticism of the opening track into the Texas-style folk of ""Pharaoh's Lonely Daughter"" (sung by Poe in a deep voice softer and more tuneful than Michael Gira, but with a similar sense of phrasing), then back to the wordless vocals of ""Devil's Interval,"" this time with a Godspeed-ish backing of twangy guitar and nervous, uncertain violin. These opening three pieces, though drawing musical elements from a half-dozen sources from around the globe, seem indigenous to this place. Brian Paulson engineered Villa Claustrophobia, and featured players include Mick Turner, Ned Oldham, David Lowery, and Jessica Billey, among others. It's not clear who plays what, but approximately two-thirds of the record is instrumental. These tracks are universally dark, ominous and cinematic in character, but range in tone from vague drifts of cello, guitar feedback and sitar to clanging passages of metal-on-metal percussion set against radio static. The proper songs seem to fade into view when a dense cloud of sonic fog periodically lifts. My favorite of these is actually a cover of an olde English folk ballad called ""Gently Johnny."" There's an unreal amount of tension in the lyric narrative, which details the ritual of an erotic encounter: ""I put my hand on her hair/ She said, 'I like it there,'"" eventually leads to, ""I put my hand on her belly/ She said, 'Do you want to fill me?'"" These exchanges are carefully phrased by Jesse Poe in a deep, booming voice, accompanied by acoustic guitar, violin and trumpet. My other favorite is ""Prayers in the Pavilions,"" which is like a four-inch-thick slice of 4AD heaven. Evoking the desolate folk of Mojave 3 mixed with the rock reverence of Opal, the track has the feel of a post-apocalyptic ballad-- ""Morning Dew"" for the new millennium. It should be illegal to play Villa Claustrophobia in the daytime. This is not a summer record, but as the year wears on and the days grow shorter, I know I'll be drawn deeper into this world. A record this dark, frightening and sexy doesn't come along very often, and it needs to be savored in the proper (black) light. Hang out in this dim space long enough and your eyes will adjust.","""Every great or even every very good writer makes the world over according to his own specifications,"" says Raymond Carver ...

Why can't you be more like your brother Jesus? He does everything right."" I cling to Sam's stirring vision of the jilted sibling every time you get compared to your brother Will. The other kids at school chide me, ""Anomoanon sounds like the Grateful Dead, ass,"" and then they beat me up and caulk my navel. One even slandered my choice of sneakers, saying, ""I tried to get some shoes like yours, but my quarter got stuck in the machine."" Cold! Ned, I've been your fan since Palace was a Brotherhood. The controlled tremble of your what-if-Neil-Young-could-surf voice nailed your enigmatic brother Will to our planet. I often skulked around you on summer tours, inspired by the brashness of your flip-flops. When you guys were practicing for the Lost Blues tour in Charleston, South Carolina, I crouched in the dunes at Folly Beach and watched you boogie board. (Let's see those mean kids pick on his shoes, I thought.) A patrolman wrote me a ticket for screwing up the grass. Years ago, when your bandmates the Stith brothers announced a Ned-fronted project, I ran out to get the first Anomoanon seven-inch, ""Hello My/The Free Web."" I don't think you've topped its festive brooding yet, though the album and EP of original material each had their strengths. And you should have seen how the other kids at school reacted to my championing your Mother Goose album that celebrated the bawdiness and gothicness of oral-tradition nursery rhymes. Then, when you did the album of Robert Louis Stevenson children's poetry and I did a report on it in class, someone filled my back bicycle tire with weevil urine and punctured it just enough to squirt a mustard line down my back. So now, Ned, you've released an EP of Francois Villon poems set to your scrappy, moody harbor-rock. Oh, okay. ARE YOU TRYING TO GET ME KILLED? You knew I would go purchase it and love it! And that the other kids just associate the French with some caricature of frou-frouness. They'll think Villon a squinting snoot, unaware that he was the consummate ne'er-do-well, robbing churches, killing a priest, and hosting many a street fight. I'm reckoning that the cover's gothic woodcut of three hung figures is a reference to how many documented times this poet barely escaped the noose. Your impossible-to-overlook brother has put the work of several poets to music, including D.H. Lawrence and Rabindrath Tagore. You guys are arch at being arcane. I enjoy reminding those who accuse both of you of pretentiousness that being pretentious involves pretending. And neither of you are pretending to be swept up in what you're doing, or to know something you don't know. TV culture, though, curse its rank abortive porridge, has people thinking that saying you're into anything outside its narrow window of instant gratification is pretentious, even if you passionately and authoritatively enjoy it. This EP of yours is a culture casserole, hurtling the listener through various centuries and to various countries and mead halls, except it's always twilight. ""John of the Slum"" almost reaches a breaking point of how much a song can goulash, with you singing French in your Kentucky brogue while playing stumbly flamenco. ""Ballade of Villon and Fat Margot"" is a classic slop-country chronicle of Epicurean hollowness. You sound exhausted telling the world that ""I am her pimp and she my prostitute be."" Villon raised his hell in the 1400s; most of us dingleberry Americans think the Beats invented decadence. The digital lacquer on your voice helps you slink around the phrasings, building to that chorus, ""In this brothel where we ply our trade."" The trademark Oldham codeine-waltz of ""Ballade of Good Doctrine to Those of Ill Life"" is held together by a Dylanesque harmonica line that leads lazily into the next ""Ballade""'s trippy wailings. I'll recommend this (via the Internet, Ned, because the kids at school will just drag me out to the parking lot and make me lick their Talons' gas caps) to any fan of My Morning Jacket's indulgent, reverby psychedelia. I hear echoes of the echoes of Drag City tenants such as Plush, Papa M, and even the Pink Floyd liquiscapes of the slow moments of Smog's Burning Kingdom EP. Well, kudos to you, Ned, for singing about doublets without calling to mind the drama-school dropout goateeans who welcome Medieval Times customers to ""the realm,"" or the nerds jousting for the hearts of frumpy maidens in Doc Martens at renaissance fairs. You should call up Chef Boyardee and come out with your own canned pasta, Arpeggios. I read your essay about Tiny Tim in The Oxford American, and my figuring is that you are an authentic freak who just happens to look like a buff Jeff Daniels. Your face at concerts, Ned, especially at that shitty art space in Baltimore, reminds me of big-eyed babies who are blown away by the fact they exist. How'd you pull of that pastel plaid shirt that night? How'd you and Paul and Will share teats and end up so musical? How'd you conjure an EP that forces the eyelids to half-mast and the cynicism to melt? Villon, ever the mopey ironist, wrote in ""I Die of Thirst While at Your Fountain Side"" that ""I'm joyful and I don't have any fun... well received, dismissed by everyone."" You're perfect for each other. I'ma go get my ass kicked in the year 2002.","Dear Ned Oldham,

Kill the Moonlight,Spoon,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a51b9d034d5c69bf320b/1:1/w_160/47ba3f42.jpg,2002-08-14 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7428-kill-the-moonlight/,Merge,"About the time A Series of Sneaks hit the scene, I probably could have been convinced to wager a substantial amount of money on Spoon coming out on top. On top of what? Of anything. That album was the sound of a band that had nailed their particular aesthetic to the wall, or so I thought. Spoon was ready; Spoon was there; and then, fatefully, Spoon was dropped. Monsieur Laffitte, the Elektra A&R; man whose villainy was immortalized on the band's The Agony of Laffitte EP, set them adrift. Now, few things fuck with a band like being dropped by their label (taking third place behind smack, and of course, suicide), and indeed, something changed in Spoon. Freshly cut loose, they suddenly decided to go 'respectable,' cleaning up their sound as if to win back Laffitte's heart while deriding him in song. I'll be candid: at that point, I missed Spoon. Girls was swell, but its slickly produced lounge grooves only made me long for the casual ""just swung by the studio to drop off some tunes"" brilliance of Sneaks. Nothing on it could ever generate the massive, ultra-condensed endorphin rush of ""Car Radio."" Fortunately, somewhere between there and here, Spoon took the time to burn their sound down to its foundation, dissect the sullen intricacies of Girls using Sneaks' barbed, melodic hooks, and reassemble something out of the pieces that's far more than the sum of its parts. The result, Kill the Moonlight, plays like a greatest hits compilation not of songs, but of sounds-- the best echoes of everything Spoon has done swirl around and unite. Bowie soul seamlessly flirts with Spoon's deceptively simplistic rhythms and vocals that span all the hope and hopelessness of the human condition. Moonlight plays out as if Spoon is standing dead center in a vast, empty warehouse. Thousands of seats are placed close to the band, and there's a drawn-out nervousness-- total silence-- before they produce a single sound. At that moment, a Hammond-esque drive kicks off ""Small Stakes"" with enough energy to get even a factoryful of hipsters doing the wave. And then you look around and realize that you're the only person in attendance. This record is an adventure in starkness, beyond Girls Can Tell even while evoking some of that album's finest moments. But any hack band can create space, right? Maybe. But using it is the tricky part. Like some of the best minimalists in music, Spoon use the null and void to create tension which bolsters and sets apart every nuance of the music-- every handclap, every reverberating crash, every beep from the synthesizer. ""Paper Tiger,"" in particular, effortlessly floats into of the realm of the hyper-real; there's nearly more silence than music. Spoon has always struck me as a band that, no matter how good the rest of their album was, could always be relied upon to produce at least one or two songs every album that would make my jaw drop (""Car Radio,"" ""Everything Hits at Once,"" ""Lines in the Suit""). And while Moonlight has far more than its fair share of stunners, ""Paper Tiger"" blows them all away. Daniel distantly croon-growls, ""I'll never hold you back/ And I won't force my will/ 'I will no longer do the Devil's wishes'/ Somethin' I read on a dollar bill,"" over reverse-playback beats, solitary piano chords, and drumsticks; nothing else. It's an effect of singular elegance and power. The rest of the album is largely more upbeat, fortunately, or it could have slipped into a fugue. A little of the guitar braggadocio that netted the band so many past comparisons to the Pixies, and older acts like Wire, is showcased on ""Jonathon Fisk."" The riffs hit hard and fast, and some of the horns Bowie once used on Hunky Dory drop by to lighten things up. Later, the rock piano stylings of Jerry Lee Lewis could shed a tear for catapulting the bittersweet ""Someone Something"" into the ""best of"" section of Spoon's catalog. Bright-eyed optimism and the faintest hint of the uncertainty of expectation are conveyed through the staccato piano, and the vocals build and carry it off to a beautiful conclusion. Also of note: ""Something to Look Forward To"" may be the best fusion of older and newer Spoon to date, and ""Stay Don't Go"" will likely be your only chance to experience a sample of Britt beat-boxing. Truly surreal. Kill the Moonlight is a hailstorm of complex emotional underpinnings; sometimes vibrant, sometimes morose, but usually in a frighteningly anxious limbo. ""Vittorio E"" closes shop and turns eyes toward the future with a 3\xBD-minute synopsis of the album's emotional heft. Choir-like harmonies fade in from the depths behind the main vocal, and a simple, sweet piano refrain lifts it away from any of the sadness or trouble left behind it. It never looks back. Indeed, Spoon's latest is their magnum opus to date; it takes a scalpel to the highlight reel of their career, cutting and pasting a 35-minute tour de force that ends too soon. And yet, despite all the elements Spoon has toyed with over the years, it doesn't sound distinctly like any of them. In fact, this all feels like a decidedly different Spoon, like the real start of the next phase for which the merely likable Girls Can Tell was only a bridge. So be prepared. The difference is in the distance.","About the time A Series of Sneaks hit the scene, I probably could have been convinced to wager a\n ...

Octopus Off-Broadway,Parlour,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ffbb1335d7bf1697f03/1:1/w_160/51d3d8e5.gif,2002-08-14 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6176-octopus-off-broadway/,Temporary Residence,"Tim Furnish is a veteran of the Louisville, Kentucky scene, which for more than a decade now has been one of indie rock's brightest outposts. He was a founding member of Cerebellum, the band that spawned Rodan, Matmos, and Crain (of which he was also a member) and helped give rise to the local scene. And after dropping from the spotlight for a few years, and settling into the role of sideman for Louisville's various successor bands like the For Carnation and Aerial M, he's turned up again with Parlour, his first new project in years. Consistent with its regional origins, the music of Parlour could only be referred to as 'post-rock' these days-- the term and a couple of its various definitions simply fit like a glove. Parlour play long, drawn-out, slowly developing instrumentals that rely on simple motives to carry them forth. There's not much of a sense of urgency in the music, and it seems that there wasn't in the studio either-- it took over four years for this album to be completed. Four years is a damn long time to work on seven songs, and it's a testament to the consistency of their craft that the band sounds more or less the same from track to track, and that the mood remains cohesive. And this is all despite the fact that it was recorded at two separate locations over the course of a couple of minor personnel shifts. The basic foundation of the Parlour sound is exceedingly simple: a basic, steady mid-tempo rhythm garnished by the occasional off-center drum fill, a creeping, repetitive bassline and some sort of clean rhythm guitar part, usually playing arpeggios. To this, textures are added with guitars and synths, building to points of high density and then receding to something more skeletal before doing it again. The sounds snake together like so many tentacles, but there aren't many suction cups in the way of, say, memorable melodies to stick to you. As such, Octopus Off-Broadway is very much a record of the current moment. It's enjoyable to listen to, but when it's over, it's over. Nothing really stays with you when it ends. That said, as it plays, ""Mperfect"" is a thick wall of rhythm and texture that will effectively blanket your surroundings with sound, while the drumless ""Sleeper"" is a relaxing, almost new agey interlude. The synth tone that enters toward the middle to play a sort of wandering melody line is really the album's only blatant misstep, sounding as though it could have come straight from the general MIDI soundbank, but the washes of sound behind it largely compensate. The album opens with shimmering, aquatic xylophones before the drums crash in with a fractured march, and a woozy bass spills like a cloud of ink all over everything. You can almost visualize our cephalopod friend from the cover art jet-propelling himself across the ocean floor in search of crustaceans to scoop up and turn into snacks. The octopus' off-Broadway adventures close with several minutes of dark ambience that end ""The Living Beginning,"" an oddly disconcerting finish to an album that, for the most part, remains steadfastly consonant. And as much as it's largely pleasant, it's also pretty ephemeral, leaving little trace of its presence when the disc stops spinning. Still, though it won't do much to win any new converts, it will undoubtedly please fans of all things post-rock.","Tim Furnish is a veteran of the Louisville, Kentucky scene, which for more than a decade now has been one ...

Songs in a Northern Key,Varnaline,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9259d034d5c69bf3bd4/1:1/w_160/b17b99e5.jpg,2002-08-14 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8418-songs-in-a-northern-key/,ArtemisE-Squared,"She don't use Linkous. She don't use Tweedy. She don't use the Jayhawks, or any of these. She uses Varnaline. Varnaline. Varnaline, the brainchild of singer/songwriter Anders Parker, former member of indie-rockers Space Needle is what she uses, and she uses them for a reason. Varnaline fills her need for vocal twang and conflicted self-expression that she can only find in the alt-country genre, except Varnaline delivers the goods with significantly less friction. Less grit, more moisture. Warm, soothing moisture. Like a salve. A salve that soon anesthetizes. Numbing. Soporific. Unexciting, unremarkable and passive. More Ben Gay than Vaseline. But certainly not coarse, and certainly inoffensive. Easy to digest. But engaging, no. Briefly, an overview of what you'll be missing when you don't buy this album: ""Still Dream"" features Parker singing in a hushed/muffled voice about how he ""still dreams."" It's got some double-bass, some mandolin, a steel-stringed acoustic guitar, a birdie chirping, and a little drummer boy towards the end. Very drab, despite the birdie's best efforts. Then comes the requisite gritty-rocker called ""Song,"" which 'isn't good' in the same way the Steve Miller Band 'isn't good.' The song after that is nondescript. Proceeding to track four, ""Blackbird Fields,"" something in Parker's bag of tricks begins to click. It opens with nifty production, all feedbacky and such, then settles into pure, fingerpicked mope. Parker revisits his hushed/muffled voice, to greater effect this time, and raises the hopes of the listener (just a little bit). Track five, ""Blue Flowers on the Highway,"" dashes those hopes. Parker lays down hackneyed √ºbertwang, replete with √ºbertwangy stringed something-or-other (Dobro? Lap steel? Tell me your name). It's got a pop song structure, and had me thinking I hadn't listened to Chris Isaak's Baja Sessions in a while (meaning three years). Do you have the idea yet? The slow learners say no, so let us plod further along this 15 track boulevard: ""The Drunkard's Wish"" is a brief banjo solo played by a retard. The not-that-horrible ""Difference"" cuts the retard off short, then sets into a predictable folk/slow-core stylee (probably not composed by a retard, unless said retard were highly functional). ""Anything from Now"" does not improve the album. No, wait-- it actually does. It sort of rocks. But ""Down the Street"" definitely doesn't. Horrendous lyrics, a ridiculous use of a glottal vocal flair (see: Britney Spears), and a shameless rehashing of the shitty melody Parker already used once on ""Song."" As track nine comes to a close, I have had it, and I'm checking out. No more Varnaline for Haywood. Six more tracks and I'll be kicking my dog, whom I love and who, as of now, still loves me back. The warm, moist soothing has officially reached my nerve endings. Numbing.","She don't use Linkous. She don't use Tweedy. She don't use the\n\ Jayhawks, or any of ...

About a Boy,Badly Drawn Boy,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1f9b1335d7bf16983b1/1:1/w_160/af728af0.jpg,2002-08-13 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/528-about-a-boy/,ArtistDirect,"News flash: Hugh Grant likes boys. His latest film is entitled About a Boy, and is based on a book by Nick Hornboy [sic]. I'm told that the flick is sort of like Adam Sandler's Big Daddy, but more ""boy-focused."" The soundtrack to the film, aptly named About a Boy, was written and recorded by Damon Gough, known to people other than his mom as Badly Drawn Boy. Clearly, lots of boys for Hugh to handle. What's a boy to do? Suck it. That's what Badly Drawn Boy does with the soundtrack, anyway. I have no clue about the movie, although my friend told me it was ""better than [he] thought it would be"". This statement is obviously very ironic for two reasons; one, because it just is, and two, because the soundtrack is completely lifeless, and unlike the movie, way worse than anyone thought it would be. Apart from some familiar melodic tendencies and Gough's distinctive voice, About a Boy sounds very little like The Hour of Bewilderbeast. His debut was a charming one, if not magical. Magic within magic, even, as we got mixdisc keepers like ""Once Around the Block,"" alongside a smattering of quarter-song vignettes like ""Fall in a River"" and ""This Song."" Moreover, it displayed tons of promise; despite some questionable production, Gough's splendid folk-pop melodies were hard to ignore, even during those one-minute interludes. The folk part has largely disappeared, though, and in its place stands... something qualifiedly worse. This is not to say that a talented artist isn't allowed to grow creatively. By all means, grow-- but grow well. Realize that preprogrammed 80s dance-pop beats and electronic anvils (""S.P.A.T."") are meant for the rarest occasions, and generally spell ""barf."" Realize the same about Doc Severinsen-style novelty orchestras, especially when you're determined to deliver a tune like Barry Manilow (""Above You Below Me""). And by all means, do not moan like an unsexed Bono (""Silent Sigh""). Tempting? Maybe. But not advisable even for Bono, let alone aspiring non-Bonos. There is no mystery in this music, nothing worth listening to multiple times to understand or uncover. Every card Gough plays is painfully transparent from the first time you play the disc. It's elementary stuff. It sounds manufactured, refined, cosmetic and sterile; in a word, silicone, like a pair of Badly Sculpted Breast Implants. Other than the album's anthem, ""Something to Talk About"" (not the Bonnie Raitt song, but almost), the music on this disc is ""something to keep to yourself."" Corny is probably a good word to describe a number of the songs. Bad is another, especially the lyrics, which were never Gough's strong suit to begin with. Apparently unaware of how unimpressive the lyrics are to ""Walking Out of Stride"" (""You and me could never hide/ Too busy walking out of stride/ Take one, two, three then four or five/ People talkin' keeps us aliiiiive""), Gough repeats them twice, evoking only the fondest memories of √ºber-diva Gloria Estefan and her Miami Sound Machine (""One, two, three, four/ C'mon baby say you love me/ Five, six, seven times""). There are a couple points when Gough's facility with folk-pop songcraft manages to meld even these plastic parts together into something complete, as on the aforementioned ""Something to Talk About,"" a clap-along number comparing favorably with Bewilderbeast's ""Pissing in the Wind,"" another song with a great hook and horrible, horrible lyrics. It is by far the album's strongest track. ""River-Sea-Ocean"" is nice, too, a more polished, abbreviated analogue to Bewilderbeast's ""Once Around the Block."" Altogether, though, even a handful of mildly enjoyable songs can't rescue this boy. If you're at all like me, you're dismissing the About a Boy Original Soundtrack as just that: a soundtrack. Probably not the artist's finest work, and probably not the most accurate representation of his artistic development or freedom. Do yourself a favor and dismiss this one preemptively; save your money for the movie.","News flash: Hugh Grant likes boys. His latest film is entitled About a Boy, and is based on a book ...

Black Rio: Brazil Soul Power: 1971-1980,Various Artists,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7f2c0084474cd0c0cf8/1:1/w_160/071dcae6.jpg,2002-08-13 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2005-black-rio-brazil-soul-power-1971-1980/,Strut,"Black Rio: this is James Brown, Kool & the Gang, funky congas and slippery guiros, black pride, black power, samba, dancing boys and girls, two turntables and no microphones, sweet Soul Brasileiro, secret block parties, dozens of cowbells, trumpets, clubs, sweat, afros and all the right moves, Soul Grand Prix, the Culture of Rebirth, bailes black, renegade DJs and the ""school of music."" In the 70s, this South American paradise for vacationing Americans was in actuality a tough place to live for young blacks. Brazilian society offered them reduced economic and cultural freedom, yet instructed them to represent the ""essence of Brazil"" by 1) never leaving their designated neighborhoods, and 2) never bringing the influence of their Harlem brothers and sisters to their country. Samba was the old party music, but young Brazilian blacks had other ideas. Boa vinda a Black Rio, friends. As DJ Cliffy indicates in his liner notes for this compilation of his own selections, the sound of Black Rio was difficult to separate from its politics. What the Brazilian press derided as the sound of local black youth shamefully imitating American soul and funk was actually the voice of a new generation with little use for the ultra-conservative destiny set aside for them. Music and dance promoter Dom Filo argued against the hypocrisy of white kids in the north dancing to the Rolling Stones while blacks in the south couldn't do the same with James Brown. The legendary Gerson King (originally Cortes) typified the scene's openness to new sounds and ideas by maintaining a ""black is beautiful"" philosophy, while at the same time stating that white, the color of the clouds, was equally so. However, no matter the unpopularity of Black Rio's politics with hard-line Brazilians, it was the music that gave the scene its real color. Samba is the traditional dance music of the country, but American soul began to infiltrate Brazil in the early 60s as famed bandleaders Tim Maia and Cassiano played music known as 'Soul Brasileiro,' influenced by James Brown, Stevie Wonder and jazz fusion. Gerson King played a kinetic, funky music influenced by the rhythms of Jamaica as much as Maia and Cassiano, and actually danced with James Brown onstage at a gig in New York. His tune, ""Uma Chance,"" closes this compilation on a very JB-styled note, replete with horn hits and ""good God"" exclamations. Its mid-tempo groove and way-70s clavinet and vamp-structure (another lift from Brown) must have suited the all-night party circuit just fine. King discovered another band in the suburbs of Rio de Janeiro called Uniao Black whose ""Black Rio"" was Kool & the Gang right down to the tight horns and bass up front. Similar to King and Uniao Black, the very politically and socially active Toni Tornado specialized in hard, gritty funk. ""Podes Crer, Amizade"" is more Bar Kays than JBs, but its bottom-heavy beat and call-and-response vocals (inherited from samba) were just as suited to celebratory release as King's stuff. Trio Mocoto also had a knack for the celebratory, if slightly more traditional (sometimes approaching tribal). Their ""Nago"" is the fusion of samba shouts, jungle dances and backwater funk. This band played eclectic black music alongside the best American bands, but was actually more famous as the legendary Jorge Ben's backing band in the late 60s and early 70s. Jorge Ben's style differed greatly from his more rigorously funky compatriots, in that he seemed to prefer smooth, breezier rhythms and a generally sweet atmosphere. His most renowned album, 1976's Africa Brasil, popularized the Afro-Brazilian sound well outside of the country's borders. His music was funky, but in a much subtler fashion than Gerson King's or Toni Tornado's. ""Comanche,"" culled from Ben's Black is Beautiful LP, features traditional acoustic guitar strumming, understated trumpet, and Ben's own pastel keyboard shadings, all over a propulsive, yet featherlight, rhythm. It's a beautiful sound, and if this collection does nothing else, hopefully it spawns a few new Ben fans. Another Soul Brasileiro superpower was the Banda Black Rio. Formed in the mid-70s, the band weren't around for the birth of the scene, but certainly did as much for it as anyone else. One of the few acts to be backed by a major label, BBR released three albums featuring arguably the most successful fusion of samba, soul and funk of any band going. Furthermore, improvisation played a big role in their music, and the best players (themselves plucked from many of the best local bands, such as Dom Salvador's excellent bossa-funk ensemble) would be able to pick up the groove and take a solo at the drop of a fedora. ""Gafieira Universal"" is a marvel of samba and classic cocktail funk that could've turned any episode of ""The Love Boat"" into an all-nighter. Some of the tunes on Black Rio don't hold up as well to my ears: the goofy instrumental version of ""Rapper's Delight"" by Gang do Tagarela seems a little unnecessary, as it just repeats the same bassline and beat over and over, with little interplay between the soloist and band (not to mention that, without the MC, this isn't really ""Rapper's Delight,"" but ""Good Times""!). Likewise, Eklipse Soul's ""Psicose"" takes a patented Kool & the Gang groove and proceeds to add not much other than some weird screaming vocals, and what sounds like someone impersonating a theremin. So, on second thought: classic. Today, this music is probably going to do its best work at parties and clubs. Whatever politics are embedded in this music aren't necessarily important when you're dancing, though they do tend to give it a darker hue when you factor them in. Black Rio didn't last long as a scene, but its spirit undoubtedly lives on in Brazilian music (hip-hop is almost as big there now as it is here), and in compilations like this. So, you can do one of two things: pick this up and experience the bittersweet celebration of Soul Brasileiro, or just dance your ass off.","Black Rio: this is James Brown, Kool & the Gang, funky congas and slippery guiros, black pride, black power, samba, dancing ...

Ming Star,King of Woolworths,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbaac0084474cd0c28ef/1:1/w_160/6a8edd7e.jpg,2002-08-13 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4445-ming-star/,Mantra,"Here's a wild stab at populational psychoanalysis: all electronic artists secretly harbor the desire to score films. It's a charge that could be levied at any purveyor of instrumental music, the choice to leave out lyrical imagery feeding the assumption that the composer might be willing to rent out his child as sonic wallpaper for celluloid. Given the many extravagantly budgeted promotional spots computer tweakers churn out for the odd 3:30am showings on MTV4, the electronic genus seems particularly disposed to marrying the visual and the auditory. King of Woolworths, the professional handle of Englander Jon Brooks, tips its hand right on the back cover by including both a ""main titles"" and ""end credits"" version of a song called ""Bakerloo."" The ten tracks of Ming Star support this thesis, residing somewhere between the hazy, lazy Tomorrowland of Air and the always-referred-to-as-'pastoral' densely textured vibe of Boards of Canada. Like the former context-establishing band (whose sublime Virgin Suicides soundtrack reigns as gold standard for electronic scores), Brooks has a taste for organic foundations and analog synths, but with a darker edge that keeps King of Woolworths from becoming Zero 8. In fact, I wouldn't be too surprised if Hollywood's music directors aren't spinning Ming Star on their $70,000 office stereos as we speak, pondering which upcoming release could best utilize Mr. Brooks' talents. But before you dial up Mantra Recordings on your headset telephone, Movie Guy, here's a helpful guide to how the better songs of the album could be used: ""Colcannon"": With its splashy distorted drums, throbbing club beat and synthesizer flatulence, consider this track for that Matrix rip-off you've got in the pipeline. It might not be the freshest sound, but that slow-motion 360-degree camera trick is getting pretty stale, too. ""Kite Hill"": Anchored by a delicate string arrangement and some perky bass-and-drumming, ""Kite Hill"" is that brand of glacial atmospherics that would anchor a nice travel-across-America montage scene. You know, characters staring pensively out bus windows at expanses of corn, sun setting behind mountain ranges, metaphorical shots of The Open Road, that sort of thing. Pencil it in for the feature film version of the Nick Drake Volkswagen ad. ""Bakerloo"": The most Air-ish composition here (due to its picked acoustic guitar and oscillating synth melody), it's hard to imagine cinematic uses for either of the two versions here that don't blatantly bite from The Virgin Suicides. Hire Sofia Coppola, and use it as dressing for a soft-focus, sun-drenched flashback. My cynicism about Hollywood's use of electronic music notwithstanding, Ming Star is a pretty impressive and affable full-length debut, even if it does lack that one unique element necessary to separate the album from its genre peers. Other than slightly bothersome familiarity, the only misstep comes from Brooks' clunky use of film dialogue-- the respective moods of ""Stalker's Song"" and ""To the Devil a Donut"" are creepy enough without superfluous soundbytes from low-rent Sleeping with the Enemy and Rosemary's Baby knock-offs. But in the class of Space Age-y instrumen-tronica, King of Woolworths still a earns a solid B, certified for pre-clubbing gin-and-tonics or the newest indie buzz-kicker from a Coppola spawn.","Here's a wild stab at populational psychoanalysis: all electronic artists secretly harbor the desire to score films.

The problem for the new head-scratch of an album by Stuart David's Looper is that it's not even of a ""sort."" In fact, it blends hints of so many genres and idioms that it becomes genreless and idiomless, leaving me only to proffer oxymorons like ""white-noir"" and ""anglo-funk."" To further complicate critiquery, the album boasts a song called ""Driving Myself Crazy"" on which David sings, ""I'm driving myself crazy,"" over and over and then some more. Then he sings, ""I go on and on and on and on and I won't shut up,"" over and over and then some more. So the next line is, ""I'm trying not to listen but it just won't stop.""

Looper's first single introduced folks to the notion that something could be stank up in Belle and Sebastian. As the group cloyingly became more a collective than Captain Murdoch's Tuneful Melancholy Express, the spoken word-y Stuart David went and decided, like Whitney Houston, never to walk in anyone's shadow, bailing altogether from the wan clan. Subsequent releases under the Looper name perpetuated a toybox ethic of so-so sounds, drum machines, and stories. The Snare roams far enough from that turf to seem like a sly bait-and-switch on par with the killer-less Halloween III: Season of the Witch, leading the listener to wonder why David didn't released it under some other pseudonym (perhaps Peacock Johnson, the character from David's novel with whom this disc is vaguely concerned). It'd have made The Snare the most odd such outing since Stephen Tunney squeezed an excellent rock adaptation out of his mockalyptic novel Flan, employing his Shimmy-Disc stage name Dogbowl. Easy to dismiss, smirk at, or even hate on the fist listen, nine out of The Snare's ten tracks are grind-and-pause, semi-sultry pairings of exotic keyboard settings and mid-tech beats that exploit their refrains and come weirdly close to the patterns of 'risqu√©' after-dinner radio pop circa 1999-present. So, let's see, how do I put this... the, er, beats, they, uh, well, never, never change or build or fade within a song, and since they share the same constituent elements and the same calculated mood, the songs fail to differentiate themselves until the nth listen, by which time the shifting vibra-tones, trumpets, saxes and flutes (particularly those of the dratmospheric ""Lover's Leap"") will have had plenty of time to slap you around their seedy motel's parlor. Cellos, violins and the occasional stand-up bass creep through the proceedings, as if not wanting to be spotted. All the songs are... sung, which is a departure for Looper/David/Johnson, but the singing is personafied, a knowing, untrustable whisper that suggests lonerdom even when chronicling all manner of intimacy. The clich√©s draw hordes of flies here and there, and the blokey humorlessness nearly provokes laughter. The album's constipated Curtis Mayfieldisms and Isaac Hayes tinctures, combined with the cover's cold suggestion of a ratty, slickish corner hustler, can drive the listener to reckon Peacock Johnson a daft Shaft, or Rudy Ray Less. Which is still a cut above my initial response (embarrassment for David). Track ten, though, provides a gloriously more interesting text. Suddenly, we're out of Mick the Rat's borough and among the hetero-fops and waterheads of Tweeville, only Mick's stringy ass is following us, bringing his inhumanity with him like a pox. I can't help but construe this ditty's spry arrangement as a comment on B&S;, mixing David's oldie ""Century of Elvis"" with the featherweight bits of The Boy With the Arab Strap. The sweetly sung lyrics (intentionally) hilariously mix weaker B&S; sentiments: ""Such a funny old feeling, such a beautiful day/ Come on, get up off the ground."" Except, see, someone's really on the ground: ""Come on, you're getting blood all over the place."" Things get worse in ways I shouldn't recount on this family-oriented website, but here's a peek at the chorus, after a ""don't look so frightened, dear"" a ""take your hands away from your face,"" a ""don't get excited,"" a ""this isn't serious,"" and a ""don't try and run"": ""We're only fucking around/ We're both just fucking around."" Ultimately more misanthropic and befitting of Todd Solondz in its 4\xBD minutes than the entire Storytelling LP, ""Fucking Around"" first teases the wit and indirectness out of B&S;'s seduction-as-a-lark canon, then moves on to showcase the disturbing dichotomy of tenderness and violence that complex-ifies David Lynch's manifestly unsafe territory. The Snare's droll, wanna-be gumshoe darkness (""She's a Knife,"" ""This Evil Love"") ends up strangely redeemed by absolute depravity masquerading as bubble-gum. By not being able to gush over or pan Stuart David, I feel like I'm letting a small-time crook get away, possibly to commit more ambitious crimes. And in the end, David acknowledges, and then escapes, his own career's trappings. But now he's the sole practitioner of what, horror-pop?","Abraham Lincoln is said to have once simultaneously dodged controversy and lodged a complaint in a book\n\ review by ...

A Word in Your Ear,Alfie,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0449d034d5c69bf2692/1:1/w_160/20143fe6.jpg,2002-08-12 05:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/105-a-word-in-your-ear/,Twisted NerveXL,"You can't tell a record by its cover, but you can judge a book by its contents. For Alfie's second album, the former is the latter: you've got an illustration of a dog-eared old volume lying open, with the title printed on the left page and a painting of the band on the right. The five Brits are sitting on a bench with a newspaper and a football, looking like right proper lads in their natty sweaters. Fans of Coldplay and Travis rejoice-- we've come upon another charming trad-rock boy-band, right? As if! For Alfie are telling us that you can't judge a group by their lame-ass name or album title. Instead, Alfie are a song-oriented rock band, and they shuffle effortlessly through a number of different styles. ""Gee, I've never heard that description from a reviewer before!"" Shut it, you sad bastard. As with all good pop, your reservations are lowered when you actually listen to the music. The title track starts the album with acoustic picking and a soft, skiffling drumbeat. Singer Lee Gorton lets down his defenses, singing that ""it's yours if you want it, no one's berating me/ Try not to be so afraid, it's your move."" The interplay of piano and organ at the end makes for a warm, pleasant opener. ""Cloudy Lemonade"" gets more flirtatious with a funky percussion intro and lyrics about flowers and such. A flautist fills out the song with a keen midsection, and the technicolor swoon of the guitars adds to the romance. ""Don't groups of this sort usually have a charismatic lead singer?"" Well, how convenient that you're here, rhetorical question, because Lee Gorton does have an endearing presence. That is, if you don't mind the slurry wash of vowels that he sings through his nose. The nasal factor really isn't bad, and on the beautiful ""Rain, Heaven, Hell"" his slow drawl allows for a sensitive tone. Of course, it also aids him in impressions, as on ""Bends for 72 Miles,"" named appropriately since it's an (unannounced) tribute to Radiohead's The Bends. The sultry bass groove copies Colin Greenwood's very carefully, and Gorton adopts the same sneering Britpop sass that Thom Yorke was going for back in those heady mid-90s. It's all forgivable, though, since it's done so well; it's ""The Reverse Midas Touch"" that threatens to turn it all to shit. Gorton mumbles this cod-hip-hop introduction, like Fun Lovin' Criminals ripping off G. Love aping John Lee Hooker. In case you missed that, it's white boys copping black blues, thrice-removed. His affections are awful, but forgivable since it's just a bad page in an otherwise good book. When Alfie stick with influences closer to home, they're quite convincing. ""Halfway Home"" breezes through with muted trumpet swells, and Gorton's fey vocals remind me of Gorky's Zygotic Mynci. Later on, ""Summer Lanes"" drops into an infectious, bouncy beat reminiscent of the Wedding Present. There may be some skeptics out there for whom the cycle between shuffle-pop to indie rock is not the best example of 'eclecticism.' Fear not, naysayers, for Alfie deviate even further from your expectations! ""Not Half"" boasts a washboard-pluckin' New Orleans-style breakdown complete with a trombone, and as a swanky diversion it actually works. ""Me and Mine"" plods through an interesting rhythmic lilt, punctuated by piano and what sounds like rusty pipes being scraped and glass bottles beaten. Meanwhile, the closer, ""The Lighthouse Keeper,"" contains perhaps Alfie's best and worst impulses at once. The band plays a gentle waltz, bolstered with brass accents. The sweet pace doesn't do much to distract from Gorton's annoyingly whimsical vocals. But then he disarms you with the line, ""Tell me when you'll give me to the sea,"" and the other bandmembers begin echoing his lines, one measure behind each time, obscuring his words as if the waves were washing up against the rocks. XL Recordings licensed A Word in Your Ear from Twisted Nerve, the label started by Andy Votel and the Badly Drawn Boy himself, Damon Gough. As fitting for those two, Alfie's new album retains a slightly folky atmosphere despite the different stylistic arrangements, and a near-twee confidence that makes you want to stick up for the underdogs. It may not have you dropping your Sarah Records vinyl off at the Salvation Army, but at 43 minutes it's a brief, satisfying read. It does well to rip open the rain-soaked cardboard, as predicted by Father DiCrescenzo in his review of the band's previous EP collection, If You Happy With You Need Do Nothing. I can only end this review with an endorsement: as albums go, it's better than a turd in your ear.","You can't tell a record by its cover, but you can judge a book by its contents. For Alfie ...

From Filthy Tongue of Gods and Griots,D√§lek,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a88aea9e61561daa5845/1:1/w_160/26053c27.jpg,2002-08-12 05:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2148-from-filthy-tongue-of-gods-and-griots/,Ipecac,"This avant-garde hip-hop stuff is spreading faster than anti-Arab sentiment on September 12th. You know the stuff of which I speak; hip-hop built from samples harder to grasp than a wall of Jell-O, whose time signatures change faster than a 15 year-old girl's fashion sense, all strung around beats dirtier than the old man asleep at the bus stop. Innovators like cLOUDDEAD, El-P, and the Anticon Crew have been redefining what hip-hop is for years now, so it's nice that people are finally starting to take notice. If you've been paying any attention, you know what's bound to happen next: the market will glut, and innovation will make way for imitation. But first, D√§lek returns to the scene, fresh off collaborations with Faust, Techno Animal and Kid606, with a sophomore album inventive enough to extend avant-garde hip-hop's stay in the limelight for, at the very least, a few more weeks. So what is it that makes D√§lek-- alongside producer Oktopus, and turntablist/producer Still-- stand out amongst a seeming onslaught of original, challenging hip-hop? Namely that their songs are set to moody musique concr√®te backdrops that sound like something out of a David Lynch nightmare. Yes, there are rhymes set to hand-drums and cowbells. Yes, the lyrical content would feel more at home in a lit hall than in some trash-ridden alley. Yes, there are times when D√§lek opts to speak his vocals rather than rap them. And yes, he's more sensitive than your average bear. But what really separates D√§lek from the rest isn't his rabid experimentation as much as the way he builds a bridge between the avant-garde and the traditional. While his contemporaries experiment with slant-rhyme and abstract poetics, D√§lek takes a comparatively standard lyrical approach (assuming you'd consider rhymes like, ""Forgot our days in shackles?/ You concentrate on battles?/ I lecture graduates/ Discussing Kant till they leave baffled,"" standard), setting forcefully delivered rhymes to some of the strangest soundscapes that will ever be labeled 'hip-hop.' Pleas for understanding, cries of frustration, and even the occasional ray of hope weave in and out of music that owes more to 80s Western European industrial music a la Psychic TV and Nurse with Wound than it does to Grandmaster Flash or Public Enemy. Steering clear of the purposefully vague poetic abstractions of his peers, D√§lek prefers to revisit much of the thematic ground that hip-hop culture was built on. He's confused by issues of race (the album opens with a track called ""Spiritual Healing,"" which poses the question: ""Who you pray to, my God, the black God?/ Who you pray to, my God, the brown God?/ Who you pray to, my God, the white God?/ Your reaction's kind of odd for a kid who loves to nod""), frustrated by his confusion (""I vent my anger on all angles/ Would strangle angels if they'd let me""), yet certain all the while that the answers lie in the past, never ashamed to look to his predecessors for clues in his eternal quest for understanding (""Remember days of cardboard, fat lace, and Krylon?/ Microphones and twelves, tools we all relied on/ Niggas dropped a verse, the thought was one to die on/ I remember hip-hop, that's my Mt Zion""). If D√§lek's skill lies largely in his ability to merge the traditional with the unusual, then perhaps it's somewhat ironic that From Filthy Tongue of Gods and Griots' finest moment is its most atypical. A twelve-minute epic called ""Black Smoke Rises"" serves as the album's centerpiece, a defining moment that sees D√§lek all but abandoning any and all rules of hip-hop. ""Black Smoke"" is all atonal drones, hisses and shrieks that build and build, computer bleeps that pierce the atmosphere like an alarm clock pierces through sleep, ghostly vocals that linger ominously on the horizon, coaxing the nervous listener to come closer. Throbbing Gristle is the closest reference point I can manage, with D√§lek playing the role of Genesis P. Orridge, calmly intoning a mantra (""Black smoke rises to a heaven I do not know/ Slowly gaze to take in our sorrow"") that bobs peacefully in and out of the murky chaos. His words float through the listeners' consciousness, eventually overtaken by the building drones. The grinding noise escalates and D√§lek plays the now-clich√© part of the emotional emcee. But his introspective spoken words transcend the obvious. As he longs for a soul he once knew, the listener catches himself uncertain if D√§lek's referring to a lover, a more innocent world, or himself. Such ambiguity rears its head again on ""Trampled Brethren,"" built around a vocal sample that warns, ""So that we would be denied the knowledge of who we are, this was taken out of the history books several centuries ago. And, of course, it hasn't been put back yet."" Standard hip-hop fare, sure. But by placing it against a backdrop of Eastern Indian instrumentation, D√§lek denies the surface interpretation, reminding listeners that injustice and oppression is something happening everywhere, to everyone. ""Forever Close My Eyes"" is universal in a different way. Depressed, though never whiny, D√§lek embeds a refrain of, ""My yesterdays don't matter now, they're gone/ Your careless expression left my wrists torn.../ Yesterdays don't matter now, you're gone/ Shattered glass of empty bottles cut my palms,"" in a glorious bed of e-bowed guitar feedback a la Fripp & Eno's No Pussyfooting. As an emcee, D√§lek shows off a rare versatility, equally capable of straight rhyming and formless spoken word. As a poet, D√§lek has a grasp on subtlety that most will never approach. And as a collective, D√§lek have achieved the seemingly impossible: successfully bridging the conventional and the experimental in a way that respects both at once. It's a risky endeavor-- one that threatens to alienate fans of both disciplines. But it's this very risk that makes D√§lek's music so very affecting.","This avant-garde hip-hop stuff is spreading faster than anti-Arab sentiment on September 12th.

"Lifted, or, The Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground",Bright Eyes,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a39ab1335d7bf1698775/1:1/w_160/f14d5210.jpg,2002-08-12 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/937-lifted-or-the-story-is-in-the-soil-keep-your-ear-to-the-ground/,Saddle Creek,"Conor Oberst doesn't read the reviews. Nope, he's not playing for me, as he clearly states on ""Let's Not Shit Ourselves (To Love and To Be Loved)."" Fair enough, because it shows. If Oberst was really out to put smiles on the ears of his critics, the sound he's cultivated up through this, his third release, probably wouldn't be quite so constant. By now, expecting Oberst to somehow gravitate away from his tortured tales of youthful angst and the perils of confiding yourself in another seems as hopeless as asking a dolphin to stop using echolocation. Bright Eyes' jangly acoustic strumming and rise/fall vocal quaver has evolved fairly naturally since his 1998 post-Commander Venus solo debut, Letting Off the Happiness. So, then, would you be shocked to discover that Lifted is just about the least surprising album of all time? It's true. This record will happily provide you with plenty of opportunities to be unsurprised-- vocally, thematically, and in some cases musically. Thankfully, it's all dramatically counterbalanced by some of the most unique arrangements Oberst has dreamt up yet. The Bright Eyes orchestra lends its services to Lifted, pulling a string section and a few horns out of hock for atmosphere, and even recruiting some drunks for choir detail on ""Laura Laurent"" (there are some sober folks, too-- not just alkies). When these orchestral elements take center stage, the effect is light-years removed and improved from any previous Bright Eyes offerings, though subdued enough to preserve the essential tone of past works, lest the sound be too disorienting. The changes on Lifted-- beyond the aforementioned strings and horns-- are immediately recognizable. Somewhere along the way, Oberst has developed a much better ear for melody and left (most of) his shrieking tantrums by the wayside. The tunes are often lighter, even playful at points; a far cry from prior heartsick ballads, some of which did little more than display his temper. Of course, these backroom confessions are as intimate as ever, but the vibrant, slightly more lighthearted arrangements are a knowing wink of one bright eye as Oberst crows, ""I could tell you/ The truth like I used to/ And not be afraid of sounding fake/ Now all anyone is listening for are/ The mistakes,"" on ""False Advertising."" All the self-consciousness can become draining after a while, but the lion's share of this album consists of songs about his family and friends, and the musings of an artist second-guessing with the prospect of failure (and only 22 years old). Love it or hate it, the precious, nasal vibrato Oberst affects is the tie that binds all these varied tunes together in the end, and in most cases, it compliments the music admirably. It has its lows, of course, the most notable misstep being the nearly a capella ""The Big Picture,"" which stretches the limit of taste for seven full minutes. Oberst falters often here, giving the illusion of greater emotional heft, although the track only really serves to underscore his vocal limitations. Lifted's other weak moments come with a few rarities heretofore consigned to the limbo of cyberspace. ""Method Acting"" now comes complete with a backing chorus for the bridge, and ""Waste of Paint"" sounds to have been reworked a little, but they've been out in the sun too long. Next to the fanged beauty of ""Lover I Don't Have to Love,"" these songs are undeniably faded. But Lifted hits more than it misses. The slow buildup of strings in the languid waltz of ""False Advertising"" is exceptional despite containing the album's most embarrassing moment (a contrived 'mistake' in the playing just as Oberst sings ""mistake""), though, as with the album as a whole, its accomplishments compensate for its oversights. ""Bowl of Oranges"" features a delicate, continually shifting piano refrain and bittersweet swells of strings in the background. ""So that is how I learned the lesson/ That everyone's alone/ And your eyes must do some raining/ If you're ever going to grow,"" is backed by major-to-minor shifts to compliment the subtle mix of emotions. The slow burn of ""Don't Know When But a Day Is Gonna Come"" hangs like a thundercloud in Western skies as Oberst talks of men with silver guns and dying for his father's sins. The cadence that unrolls and distant piano warbling sound like the first drops of rain that presage an eventual downpour, before the song finally breaks with a flood of strings and guitar. It brings to mind some of the darker moments of The Man in Black himself, Johnny Cash, with all its murmurings of end-times prophecies and sober grit-- and that's just about as high a compliment as I could pay. This track is definitely first among equals with the other great moments of Lifted. The album wraps with ""Let's Not Shit Ourselves,"" a vaguely country-and-western tune that's all over the place, taking a vague stab at assessing the world's situation and how it relates to Oberst himself. It's wildly pretentious, but the charming-- dare I say, quaintness-- of this record finally makes that an asset, especially on this sweeping closer. He's wracked, maybe by necessity, and he's really starting to turn that to his advantage; the prosaic poetry of his work is genuinely compelling on this album, partly due to pretense, and partly to sincerity. In the end, of course, I'm still somewhat disappointed that Oberst isn't catering to my personal expectations, but as long as he keeps marching toward broader musical horizons, I say more power to him.","Conor Oberst doesn't read the reviews.

The Californian,Sunday's Best,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5b29d034d5c69bf335e/1:1/w_160/0ae6da05.jpg,2002-08-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7575-the-californian/,Polyvinyl,"For those of you quick to jump to conclusions, I'd like to cut you off and mention straightaway that this album isn't even half as emo as the cover art makes it look. The guitars rarely rage, the meters are never odd, and the vocalist never wails like a possum in heat. If I were to label them at all, in fact, I'd just call them a pop band, plain and simple. Popular prefixes like 'power' and 'post' need not apply. And so it goes that all over The Californian, the second full-length from the L.A.-based four-piece Sunday's Best, the guitars chime melodically, the vocalist never yells at you, and a guy known as James Tweedy (no relation) studiously offers up utilitarian basslines with a minimum of flash. The funny thing about all this is that Sunday's Best used to be totally emo, but somewhere between their debut and this album, they seem to have realized (possibly through their own introspectiveness) that they weren't very good at it and would be better off moving in next door to Sloan and the Posies and honing their songcraft. Critical flippancy aside, the band has undergone a lot of cataclysmic change in their lives between records, including divorce, exiting members, rehab and rough tours, and these life experiences have lent more authenticity to their music. Vocalist Edward Reyes is suddenly a smooth, capable singer with a bit of 70s AM honey in his voice and it suits him, though sometimes the double tracking that's heaped on feels a little overdone. That's hardly the only cue the guys take from the 70s, though, as the chorused guitars that crop up frequently are quick to remind. Like most pop bands with guitars, Sunday's Best are at their most affecting when the songs are trimmed of excess fat and drive the melody straight home. Opener ""The Try"" is nicely arranged, with several contrasting rhythmic feels, each of which appropriately support the lead material they're given. Drummer Thomas Ackerman and co-producer Tony Lash (ex-Heatmiser, drummer for No. 2) keep the sound crisp and clear and are always sure to have Reyes' voice up front and center-- an important move, as his tenor is easily the most distinctive element within the band. Ian Moreno's lead guitar parts play a nice second fiddle to the vocals throughout the album, never intruding on Reyes' space, but adding a little more interest to the backgrounds. Yet, despite the musical subtleties present, it's a shame that the band hasn't made more attempts to broaden their overall sound, as the sonic uniformity of The Californian begins to wear as it progresses. ""If We Had It Made,"" with its surprising, tasteful incorporation of bells into the arrangement, hints at something more expansive in the band's future. If Reyes is the band's focal point, it certainly helps that his lyrics (co-written with Ackerman) aren't half bad. The lightly rocking ""Our Left Coast Ambitions"" is one of the record's best tracks, featuring sarcastic calls of ""Hooray for Hollywood!"" and a lead guitar part with some unusual volume and crunch, while ""Beethoven St."" is straightforward and unapologetically nostalgic for the street Reyes grew up on. Part of what makes ""Beethoven St."" work is that the feeling of nostalgia is conveyed through imagery, rather than through the whiny ""I wish things were the way they were""-isms that too many songwriters get bogged down with. Sunday's Best stretches out the structure of the final song, ""Los Feliz Arms,"" utilizing loud/soft dynamics and some guitar heroics likely left over from their early days, but keeping it reigned in enough that you don't forget it's a pop song. But that, of course, is one of The Californian's primary shortcomings: it's just a bit too polite. I'm not advocating a feedback frenzy or a screaming fit on any of these songs, but the band could stand to be less afraid to let loose and step a bit outside of the ultra-comfortable pop trappings they're now calling home. Between that and the overall single-hued feel of the album, it's hard to recommend this to just anybody, though fans of guitariffic indie pop should find it pretty easy to swallow. The Californian is a fine, if inessential sophomore effort from a skilled band that could be on the cusp of something great if only they'd let their guard down.","For those of you quick to jump to conclusions, I'd like to cut you off and mention straightaway that ...

Film Molecules,Tender Trap,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7555e6ef95969320f53/1:1/w_160/d84680b1.jpg,2002-08-11 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7971-film-molecules/,K,"I sympathize with all those who had to double-take on the above. I, too, experienced a peculiar sense of d√©j√† vu upon first viewing the white promo sleeve emblazoned with ""Tender Trap"" and the K logo. You figure someone's banking on the confusion of the record buying market, much like the once-clever (now unemployed) Internet pioneers who correctly questioned our collective spelling ability and bought up such choice domain names as Amazone.com and Salan.com. (A point clearly discovered by all too hasty Pitchfork readers who forget the ""media"" suffix and find themselves encouraged to buy livestock. Accident? I don't think so). For clarification purposes, Tender Trap's relationship to Tiger Trap is merely coincidental but they will likely appeal to the same audience: a largely (though I don't mean to invoke stereotypes) female fanbase whose taste runs toward short, jangly, dreamy, twee-influenced indie pop. Tsunami's Jenny Toomey once asserted that ""punk means cuddle,"" but it took Heavenly's ""PUNK Girl"" to make me believe it. The warmest and fuzziest of all bands ever (even if inappropriately) associated with girls and their oft-cited ability to kick ass, Heavenly could hypothetically sing about the bloody aftermath of nuclear apocalypse and conjure visions of fluffy puppies and charming, precocious children frolicking in grassy wonderlands. Hence, they inspired legions of doe-eyed twee bands worldwide. With the suicide of Heavenly's Matthew Fletcher, the rest of the band, led by Amelia Fletcher, changed their name to Marine Research, fleshed out their angelic pop and released the lush, Sounds from the Gulf Stream. And now, after the recent departure of keyboardist Cathy Rogers and guitarist Peter Momtchiloff, the remaining Heavenly Researchers have regrouped as Tender Trap. The band has spent the last two years writing and recording this album of eclectic, though no less ethereal, pop songs, the vast majority of which hover around a two-minute length. And while nothing on Film Molecules is exactly unexpected or newly innovative, Tender Trap is a remarkably clean, cohesive, entertaining proposition. The opener, ""Fin,"" builds out of an electronic pulse and resolves into a sort of featherweight shoegazer, the arrangement of which serves as a terrific showcase for Fletcher's breathy vocals. This is followed abruptly by the upbeat, jangle pop of ""Oh, Katrina,"" which, with its pitch-perfect harmonies and quick tempo, more closely recalls Heavenly than anything else on the album. Fletcher's candy coated melodies provide a clever juxtaposition to the implied message of her lyrics, evidenced in the bouncy ""That Girl,"" which documents the travails of burgeoning teenage feminist whose ""record collection separates women from men,"" and namechecks Le Tigre. Likewise, the Blondie-influenced ""Face of 73,"" offers a subtle critique of media superficiality without veering a single step outside the retro dance-pop formula-- even Fletcher's droll vocals are dead-on. The super-abbreviated ""Dispraxic,"" with its stripped down metal-tinged guitar and the excellent new wave flavored ""Chemical Reaction,"" provide Fletcher with the opportunity to rant without the ironic distance, and the evocative ""Talk in Song"" is an oddly dark, fractured torch song that single-handedly keeps me from issuing a pejorative comment about the slow songs on Film Molecules. That being said, the overwrought melodrama of ""Emma"" sounds like filler, and the minimal ""Brown Eyes"" only shows the unflattering limitations of Fletcher's vocal abilities. I imagine it's difficult to pull off this kind of music without causing sweet-induced listener aneurysms and/or counting so singularly on the affectation that you lose all substance-- but the Heavenly/Marine Research/Tender Trap gang has continually represented one of the better and more sophisticated models of the genre. And on the whole, Film Molecules is no exception. It may be unlikely to win fans from audiences with allergies to saccharine, but that's not really the point, is it?","I sympathize with all those who had to double-take on the above.

The answer's a little complicated. Thing is, KWLD works when there's a good track, and if so, I'm usually singing along, bouncing in the car. I figure this is because it's got a cool beat, cool production, cool vocal or all three, which makes it an instant classic. And if I'm writing about it later, I'm even going deeper. But that's a big 'if'. I doubt Universal Records cares what I think about during Nelly's tune as long as I'm buying the album (which I didn't-- radio free everything, bigwigs). And in fairness to Nelly, I actually do go deeper than just bouncing in the car when his song comes on (ever like to listen to see if you can pick out what instruments are doing what in songs? Do you want to be my music buddy?), but if I and 100,000 of my closest friends don't run out and purchase the album, K-Wild's gonna take it off the air fast. And I don't want that. I want a party. IDM and experimental electronic is different. The feeling here is more of an extended consideration, even for the most 'entertaining' stuff in the family. We all know and love Selected Ambient Works 85-92, but think back and see if your record is completely clear of all chin-scratching and/or getting high and talking about how ""infinitely spacious, yet mathematically efficient, yet blissfully... oh, what's the word"" it is. And then consider the realms of analysis breached upon each playing of records by Oval, Autechre or anything featuring Jim O'Rourke (and really, should we be dissecting Stereolab records?). Whether there really is a unifying characteristic among all of the music classified as IDM has been debated. And I'm not sure, but I can't think of any relatively popular music that so consistently receives props of the intellectual nature (and non-props of the obsessively analytical persuasion). From the sound of Here and You, Tatsuya Oe (a.k.a. Captain Funk, a.k.a. just Oe) means to bridge the gap between KWLD and Warp. Oe burst upon the Japanese techno scene in the late 90s, as Captain Funk, with his record Bustin' Loose (step back now-- would you have bought a record by Captain Funk called Bustin' Loose?). Unfortunate names and titles aside, it was fairly popular and Oe still has a pretty good rep as a DJ. But since then, he's gradually moved outside the pure electronica realm into poppier territory. His previous release, Songs of the Siren, emphasized traditional song structures while maintaining the beat tactics and head-cocking production so common in dance music. Here and You follows his blueprint. Now, the question remains: why can't anyone make a good fusion of pop and IDM? Oe shows me why it's not nearly as simple as it might seem. ""The Glow"" opens with a panned acoustic guitar and lead vocoder-vocal (and as a side-note to all artists not named Daft Punk, quit using this. And to Daft Punk, think about not using this next time). When the beat comes in over the newly harmonized vocal, the mood immediately goes from minimalist future-pop to Chemical Brothers-style big beat. Pretty soon, multiple new guitar lines enter, and Oe introduces any number of tricky polyrhythmic ornaments. It's a neat little piece, even if the beats are a tad on the 1997 side. Similarly, ""Rambler and Canter"" has a very hummable melody line (courtesy of Oe's whistling), and some light polyrhythm borrowed from the first tune (think Philip Glass scoring an Evian ad). It's a nice tune, and the extended tic-tack bridge into ""Time Has Told Me"" is almost art-house cool enough for Mille Plateaux. Here and You works least when it seems to sacrifice those neat production tricks for the hummable melodies. ""Unexamined Sam"" brings back the vocoder way too soon, and unfortunately doesn't feature a beat big enough to hide the thin gag. The simple melody, really nothing more than the electronically harmonized vocalizations of Oe and his machinery, isn't enough to carry the limp beat. So the song falls short of something you would dance to, or with which you might sing along. Against all odds, Oe brings back the speak-and-spell vocoder vocals for ""Dismissed."" The tune itself seems like homage to Dots and Loops-styled space-pop, though someone should tell Oe that Laetitia Sadier doesn't use a vocoder-- that's just how she sings. Parts of this record should be left open for further research. First, there is the electro-drone (Daft-Gaze?) of ""Hollow Stone."" The opening wall of guitar-driven feedback and meandering melody exist in perfect symbiosis, and the peaceful exit music of ""Sleep Will Come"" is just minimal enough to qualify as futuristic, while still retaining lounge-y romanticism. Oe has fashioned an album full of melodies (however obscured by production they may be), yet with precious little to back them up. The production is good (and, important for bringing out those melodies, never gets overly complicated), but there's something missing in the mix that would turn Here and You into a viscerally engaging record. As it stands, the jury is still out on whether you can really fuse pop and new electronic music.","In the car, tuning to 100.3, KWLD: ""Get your Wild on!"" First up, it's Avril Lavigne. Next. A ...

Immediately EP,The Pattern,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a00db1335d7bf1697f28/1:1/w_160/3db1b8ca.gif,2002-08-11 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6192-immediately-ep/,Lookout!,"All I hear is Chris Appelgren's voice. It sticks out like a bare ass in the window of a passing school bus. While the band plays squeaky-clean garage rock, Appelgren hops and skips through the melody, arbitrarily shrieking one note and dragging another behind him like a rag doll. His voice doesn't even sound integrated in the mix: it comes through so loud and clear, and so much more histrionic than the rest of the band, that you can picture him alone in an isolation booth, planning out how he'll maul each lyric. Appelgren has plenty of tricks up his sleeve and a firm hold on his technique. He's talked about using his voice as an instrument, which seems to mean that he wants to wheeze out as many sounds as possible: sneers, yelps, shrieks, moans, and drawn-out, pitch-bent tones of pure whining noise. Dig the full-bore slide into meaningless lines like, ""Sunned things speak to me/ To the effect of free."" But the casual listener won't judge Appelgren on what he can do so much as how it all sounds, and in the studio, his voice veers towards needy, overwrought, and a little immature. At his day job, Appelgren is a sophisticated businessman who runs the Lookout! Records label; but on ""Breakfast,"" when he sings, ""Fix me breakfast,"" he sounds like your visiting nephew waking you up and demanding food. The wailing on ""C'mon"" places him at five years old, maybe six. At other times he sounds like a teenager, and although rock caters to needy teens, how often do you actually want to listen to one? No, Appelgren, you can't borrow the damn car tonight. I don't care if Sally's easy. And that's no way to talk about a girl. Meanwhile, the band chugs along somewhat anonymously. The Pattern's crack indie veterans include Jason Rosenberg of Saint James Infirmary and Andy Asp of Nuisance on guitars, bassist Carson Bell of The Cutz, and drummer Scott Batiste from Heart of Snow. They rock hard, but they don't have much personality together-- and it doesn't help to play straight-out garage-rock at a time when such records are pure commodities. Even with only six songs on the disc, nothing they wrote stands out: they don't have any new hooks or riffs, the pace is rigid, and there's nothing you'll be humming on your way to work tomorrow morning. The material puts this album damn near the platonic ideal of the Pitchfork 5.0: not awful, but not great. It only eeks above that because, whether or not you like Appelgren, there's never a dull moment when he's around. Word on the street is that these guys give good gig, which landed them on tour this spring with the Mooney Suzuki and The Hives. (Which is why they're getting notice now, and why we're reviewing this a year after it came out... we're whores to fashion, but at least we're honest.) A lot of bands can't capture on record what they do to a crowd: they rock you all night but send you home with a disc you never end up playing. But if you dug their tour, or you can't get enough of that wholesome, ""Hey Jimmy, let's start a garage band!"" sound, they have a newer single, ""Fragile Awareness,"" on their website. On that MP3, Appelgren's voice is better integrated and the band sounds for-real frenzied. Save your money for their next album.","All I hear is Chris Appelgren's voice.

Song Islands,The Microphones,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c45b69fc7814a47cd878/1:1/w_160/9be12a36.jpg,2002-08-11 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5266-song-islands/,K,"The story of the Microphones is one without the mental breakdowns or hermetic between-album freakouts that typify sonic experimenters of Phil Elvrum's caliber. In fact, for a guy with a near-supernatural talent for manipulating recorded sound, Elvrum seems almost suspiciously good-natured. Even as his albums have progressively become more sonically complex and his songs more epic, he has remained an entirely accessible and likeable character. As there's no contrived artifice of mystery or obscurity to the Microphones, it's not all that surprising that Elvrum has compiled the plethora of hard-to-find Microphones singles-- as well as some other non-album recordings-- onto this one, easy-to-swallow CD. Song Islands compiles pretty much every non-album Microphones track in existence, aside from those that were included on last year's vinyl-only Blood LP. As such, the compilation is far more disparate than Elvrum's other recorded output, especially last year's stunningly consistent The Glow, Pt. 2. In short, there are a few moments of absolute brilliance, a few stinkers, and a whole bunch of tracks that will be of great interest only to die-hards. Song Islands' first several tracks have an adventurous, though endlessly unrefined, lo-fi sound that typifies early Microphones recordings. The appropriately percussion-heavy ""Bass Drum Dream"" contains several sonic calling cards-- stereo-panned acoustic guitars and elephantine distorted drums. The lyrics are vivid and imaginative, detailing Elvrum's vision of a fantastical drum-oriented universe. ""The Storm"" is less successful, pairing overdriven marching band percussion with layers of indistinguishable distorted noise. ""Feedback,"" however, is one of Song Islands' most interesting tracks. Opening with a sample of an retro-style announcer discussing drums that wouldn't seem displaced on DJ Shadow's The Private Press, the track soon becomes a sparse acoustic guitar-and-mumble dirge, and then a mess of blaring guitars and booming percussion. As these songs were not assembled as an album, the more sonically overpowering tracks lose some of the punch they carried as part of a greater entity. Song Islands is at its most successful when the more basic elements of songcraft are given precedence. An alternate version of ""The Moon,"" with a sparse, Pink Moon-style arrangement, is quite possibly the most beautiful single track ever to grace a Microphones album. ""Deeply Buried"" is centered around a bass drum, a bell, and an utterly gorgeous vocal melody, and accentuated by flourishes of backwards percussion and guitar. Like the best of Elvrum's work, it conveys a concurrent innocence and understanding that's capable of stripping your defenses like industrial-grade paint thinner. Yet, sadly, there are parts of this album in which that innocence turns almost ridiculous-- most notably, the hokey sing-along ""I Can't Believe You Actually Died."" Though the instrumentation and recording is typically top-notch, the song itself is cloying and sing-songy, entirely betraying the serious subject matter. And the fact that half the population of Olympia sings on the recording doesn't do much to counter the its awkwardness. The rest of Song Islands doesn't stray far from what we've come to expect from Elvrum. Given the fact that this is a compilation, it obviously doesn't come together all that well, and there's little here that can really compare to the best of It Was Hot, We Stayed in the Water or The Glow, Pt. 2. Still, for fans, there's a lot to like here. And thankfully, that goodness can now be tapped without having to sort through countless pieces of seven-inch vinyl.","The story of the Microphones is one without the mental breakdowns or hermetic between-album freakouts that typify sonic experimenters of ...

Boom Box 2000,Boom Box 2000,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a34a9d034d5c69bf2da8/1:1/w_160/a988276b.jpg,2002-08-08 05:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/862-boom-box-2000/,Orange Twin,"The Orange Twin website states that, ""Boom Box 2000 challenges the boudaries [sic] of what may otherwise be known as music."" I guess that's one way of describing their sound. Another would be to say that this is easily the worst hip-hop album I've ever heard. If Boom Box 2000's goal was to make an album so horrible that it exposed post-millennial hip-hop as a vapid, disposable art form, they should at least take comfort in achieving the first half of their goal. On the songs that have raps, which are fortunately only a few, their lyrics are weak and completely out of sync with one another. Their production sounds as if it was created with a $10 Pic n' Save Casio after a week-long nitrous oxide binge. Unless you're the type that likes to slow down and laugh when you see a fatal car accident, there is absolutely nothing redeeming about this album. The ""put-two-culturally-na√Øve-Asian-kids-in-a-room-and-let-them-make-a-hip-hop-album"" concept is needless at best. At worst, it displays a racist undercurrent that belittles the considerable accomplishments of Asians in hip-hop and is comparable to the blackface comedy of the early 20th century. The fact that this was released by an indie-rock label that has never even dabbled in hip-hop before makes it all the more offensive and irritating. If you can imagine Def Jam contracting Trick Daddy and Ol' Dirty Bastard to record an emo album where they whined about their trust funds and little white dicks, then perhaps you can understand just how unlistenable and tasteless this mess is. And amazingly, the product is just as bad as the concept. ""Boom Box 2000,"" which is the album's first song, comes closest to actually approximating hip-hop. With its over-the-top string sample and repetition of, ""Boom Box... Boom Box,"" rightfully skewers hip-hop's self-aggrandizing streak. But the criticism is strictly superficial, and is delivered in such an intentionally horrible manner that it loses any of the power or humor it might have harbored. On ""Drunk and High"" they also delve into a subject that's ripe for scrutiny (i.e. the glorification of drugs and alcohol in hip-hop), but as they scream, ""Get drunk and high,"" you find yourselves digging into the couch cushions in search of that elusive crack rock to put you out of your misery. There are a few bright spots to be found. Clocking in at three seconds, ""Treats"" is the best song on the album by a long shot. While ""Taste Buds,"" which stretches a full 20 seconds, comes in a close second. The only vaguely witty lyric on the entire album is during ""Girls We Like"" when one of them (maybe) mocks Eminem's homophobia, singing, ""I once knew I girl I used to like, until she punched me in the dick.../ I called her a faggot 'cause I thought it meant jerk."" The whole album clocks in at a little less than 24 minutes, and I'd like to believe that Boom Box became so disgusted with themselves that they abandoned the project before they did any further damage. It's a shame this album was so godawful. With everything from the absurdity of the commercial studio gangsta to the relentless and sometimes pointless ""independent as fuck"" posturing of underground emcees, hip-hop is a giant target for satirical spanking. While Boom Box does have some of the subjects right, they're so painfully devoid of talent, and have such little understanding of the culture they're mocking, that their satire falls utterly flat. If you want a good laugh at hip-hop's expense, rent Fear of a Black Hat or CB4, but whatever you do, don't get fooled by this bullshit.","The Orange Twin website states that, ""Boom Box 2000 challenges the boudaries of what may otherwise be\n\ known as ...

To the rest of the world, they were the noir-fed band with the smoky baritone sax and massive bass that leant mood to TV crime shows and that movie about the guy who sleeps with his mom. They had a couple of minor hits, but were always known more for their sound than their singles-- Mark Sandman's basso profundo and rumbling two-string bass guitar over Dana Colley's reeds and the coolly tense drumming of Billy Conway. Sandman died unexpectedly on stage of a heart attack in 1999, and he's still an important figure here. The city of Cambridge even dedicated a square to him next to the rock clubs-- a stunning, and let's face it, bizarre honor. His bandmates also kept up his legacy, first with the Orchestra Morphine project which revived their material, and now with Twinemen. This new band isn't trapped in the shadow of Morphine; they embrace it, doing everything but wearing Sandman's black shirts and donning his sunglasses. The cover art of their debut uses his cartoon drawings, which he called ""twinemen,"" and they recorded the album in Morphine's Hi-N-Dry studio. Husky-voiced singer Laurie Sargent has a rough tone that sinks to the level of her sidemen, lending these songs similar arrangements to the ones she gave Orchestra Morphine: drums, sax, vocals, and some 'low guitar.' It's the same moody, lead-guitar-free sound Morphine had mastered. Of course, there are also many changes, and the biggest is Sargent. She leans seductively on the line between raunchy and sexy, with lyrics about ""fucking all day,"" or her ""chose sauvage"" (that's ""wild thing"" in English). She takes charge instantly with the opener, ""Spinner,"" a catchy tune with the kind of deep-plowing chorus we'd been missing post-Morphine; the guest musicians on keys and bass fill out the sound around the raw meat of Colley's sax. But on the next tune, ""Little by Little,"" they slow down the tempo, strip down the music, and just let Sargent work the mic. Conway ever so lightly plucks on a guitar while Sargent lays down a sultry, lounge-like mood, sounding looser and more expressively sexy than on the louder tracks. There's just one problem: beneath the atmosphere, Twinemen don't have the songs. After three strong tracks there's a run of tunes that simply lack any hooks or strong choruses. ""Watch You Fall"" and ""Learn to Fly"" feel like sketches, and ""Harper and the Midget"" only edges above those because of its freak storyline. The band throws some guitars on ""Ronnie Johnson,"" but Sargent's desperate vocals make the song; after that, ""Who's Gonna Sing"" wraps the album with a slim and pretty tune, Conway taking the vocals, as Colley does on a few other tracks. Conway, though, sounds far less like Mark Sandman than Colley does on ""Golden Hour""-- maybe it's the irony-free tone in his voice. It's unfair to compare Twinemen to Morphine again and again, but they invite it: they can't let go of that slim palette, that black-and-white mood. But at least they're expanding it. Every track shows a new direction they could take, new sounds to play with, and emotions that go beyond the snarky, articulate cool we've already heard from them. And who knows, if they fine-tune the writing, Twinemen could become the band that Morphine needed to grow into.","The rest of the country doesn't understand what Morphine meant in Boston.

Whatever It Meant,Nate Ruth,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2de5e6ef95969320502/1:1/w_160/1058dedc.jpg,2002-08-08 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6881-whatever-it-meant/,Soundless,"I really don't want to compare Nate Ruth to My Bloody Valentine, but hey, what can you do? As obvious as the reference seems, he doesn't give me much choice. Not that Ruth's music really sounds like the work of Kev Shields, but the aesthetic used to construct the songs is remarkably close to the one that created Loveless. See, Ruth's basic approach on Whatever It Means seems to be to start with a simple vocal melody, and then layer sheets of controlled guitar noise on top, creating an intensely dense yet penetrable texture. This concentrated squall is propelled by programmed beats that just might be somewhat danceable if they weren't carrying the weight of such a deep roar. Ruth deviates from this formula as the album reaches its midpoint, lifting the fog for some more directly accessible numbers, but for the first few tracks, this is what we get. And it's a wonderful thing. The third time I listened to Whatever It Meant, I remember distinctly saying out loud, to an empty room, ""Man, this album is fucking weird."" What I hadn't yet realized was how insidiously memorable it is. The more I listen to it, the deeper it buries itself in my mind, taking hold of a different cerebral region with each spin. The first four songs pour from the speakers like digital molasses. ""End Up,"" for example, sounds like it wanted to be a normal song at one point, but the vocals and trotting percussion wind up trees in a forest of sound. ""How Truly Great You Are"" is a drumless, eerie thicket of guitar and quietly soulful singing. Lyrically, it's an excellent, sarcastic devotional to a gigantic ego and all the people that bow to it; musically, it's a subtle and imaginative offering that neatly toes the line between ambient comfort and pop accessibility. Whatever It Meant reaches a sort of turning point after that song, moving several lateral steps into some sort of cabaret for the clinically depressed with ""Oversimplifying."" ""Lots of newfound free time I have/ Oughta teach a course in being sad/ And the clouds that hover overhead get taken for granted,"" sings Ruth over not much more than a bass and some strategically placed effects. ""To Forget"" and ""Kindly"" reverse the mixing principles of the first four songs, sweeping the noise-addled guitar parts behind the vocals and allowing the mixture of drum machine grooves and live percussion to flow more freely. ""Kindly"" almost reminds me of some of Porcupine Tree's best material, with its understated vocals and creeping arrangement. Ruth sits down at the piano for ""Every Summer,"" which is about as straightforward as pop music gets: singer and accompaniment, with some soft-toned synth countermelodies and xylophone to spruce up the edges. The album's final third dives back into noisy territory, though it feels somewhat removed from the first four tracks during which the guitars are frequently so overdriven that the strumming and harmony becomes somewhat ambiguous. ""Code Words"" is almost reminiscent of the shoegazer punk of Italian Flag-era Prolapse, minus the male/female vocal attack of that band. The transition is smooth, though, as Ruth seems to have had sequencing in mind when making the album. The song opens with a very odd repeated piano phrase that immediately throws you off the trail of whatever key the song might be in, something that's not aided by the distorted everything that comes in shortly afterward. ""Thanks Just the Same"" is a gorgeous ballad filled with floating piano figures, dejected vocals, and yep, tons more distortion. The guitar loses prominence as the song progresses, setting up the off-kilter ""Nothing Can Make Me Feel Better,"" which opens relatively clean over some drunken piano before the static undertow and frantically busy drum program cut in. The album closes with ""It's Been Worth the Wait,"" and you're likely to agree, because it's the most majestic track on the album, weaving synth and distorted guitar (of course) into a quilt of pure sound and bringing the album full circle to the sound that opens it. One thing I love to do with records that feel this complete is try to divide them into logical, equal sections, and I find that it's usually possible on some level. Whatever It Meant follows what I've found to be a broad trend of breaking works into thirds to make them more digestible. You've got the noisy/melodic first-third, the relatively clean, more sonically varied second-third, and the noisy/melodic/this-time-with-piano final third, complete with a nod back to the beginning at the end. It sounds simple, but it's this kind of logical flow that makes this album a breeze to listen to, despite its often challenging mix. Whatever It Meant is an intriguing solo debut for an artist who's obviously not afraid to try something different. Aside from his sonic adventurousness, though, he's also got an innate pop sense to balance it with, and that's what really makes it work. This album is a world of sound, and it's got the hooks to drag you right into it. Give it a try.","I really don't want to compare Nate Ruth to My Bloody Valentine, but hey, what can you do? As ...

First The Books album Thought for Food turned my head all the way around, and now I've been drawn deep into the world of Flim. Dresden resident Enrico Wuttke is the man behind the name. According to the sleeve notes, he recorded tracks for this, his debut album, between 1993 and 2001. That's a hell of a long time to complete 11 tracks totaling 35 minutes, but when the assembled record sounds this good, I call it eight years well spent. It seems right that this short, modest record took so long to put together because everything about Given You Nothing seems patient. In a world of ADD channel surfing, Flim calmly stays the course and lets slight variations in melody and tone do the work. Because the foundation is so simple, these tracks require a certain amount of faith on the part of the listener. You have to hear the quiet, whispered suggestions a few times to realize how much they're telling you. My first listen to the album and the opening track ""Hell"" was unnerving. Somewhere in my subconscious, I've grown to expect certain sounds when I give an initial listen to an electronic release, and ""Hell"" delivered none of them. For the track's two-minute length, the dominant sound is piano, an achingly slow left hand vamp combined with concise melodic variations using four or five notes. Far in the distance is a barely heard synthesizer drone, adding the smallest digital flavoring to the pristine keyboard sound. It was fresh and oddly emotional, despite how little seemed to be happening. The following ""Plural,"" which picks up the pace but still builds around a left hand riff, reminded me of Vert's stunning interpretation of Keith Jarrett's Koln Concert in its contrast of perhaps the most well-known sound in Western music (the acoustic keyboard) with precise, detailed accents of processed noise. The sounds laid down in those first two tracks set the tone for the album. Wuttke has a piano, a synthesizer with a button or two, and a drum machine he busts out when he's in the mood, and he doesn't need much else. Unusually, the piano is the main instrument throughout Given You Nothing. I referenced Vert's Koln Konzert above and that comparison applies at various points throughout this album. That said, Wuttke is not improvising and Flim is nowhere near jazz. The similarity enters from his impressionist, introspective tone and pacing, and his delicate melodies. The Tomlab website says that Given You Nothing owes something to Talk Talk's Laughing Stock. This comparison seemed strange to me so I gave the album a careful listen for clues. I discovered that ""Linker2"" does in fact share a tone and deep, punishing drum beat with Laughing Stock's ""Ascension Day,"" but I still think the connection is overstated. Much of Given You Nothing has a light, childlike cast. ""My Czesko Guitar"" and ""April"" sound a lot like the vulnerable innocence of Nobukazu Takemura collaborator Aki Tsuyuko, where you almost cringe at how open and defenseless the music sounds. The single word that comes to mind with Flim is ""refreshing."" It's nice to hear an album that uses the tools of the computer age while completely retaining its musicality. Good, simple tunes and the unsteady rhythm of an actual human being make Given You Nothing a record with a lot of heart.","Tomlab is on a roll.

""Who's there?"" ""Hot Hot Heat...?"" No. ""Who's there?"" ""Obvious, hackneyed music review introduction...?"" That was at least truthful. Our Hero sighed and watched bleary-eyed as the cursor annihilated one of the most inane leads he had ever felt compelled to commit to the page. Of course, it probably didn't help that he also felt compelled to write only while hammered on Diet Captain Cokes, but the way he saw it, Hemmingway was a great writer, and alcohol had solved all of his problems (except for that last one, but whatever). Sitting imprisoned at the computer keyboard, Our Hero was all out of options. He had already married all the pens and pencils in his desk drawer (they had been living in sin for years-- it was for the best), and fogging his glasses with compressed air had begun to lose its K-thru-6 charm. Plus, he was out of canned air. No, the truth of the matter loomed as large a litigant in the class-action suit against the grease-peddlers of America: he had to find some way to write about the debut EP from the Canadian foursome Hot Hot Heat. He needed to buy some time-- it was time to listen to the CD again, but that would only get him sixteen minutes, so he needed to think faster than he had ever thought before. Momentarily blinded by the hot hot pink Knock Knock Knock, he placed the disc into his Hello Kitty! CD player, and waited to be inspired. Instead, all he got from the opening track, ""Le Le Low,"" was Steve Bays' voice reminding him why he'd started drinking to write this review in the first place. Normally, Our Hero would be reluctant to to say that someone was a ""bad singer,"" but god help him, this guy sang like he was swallowing his tongue. He poured another drink and jotted a few notes: ""Vocal delivery has three modes: gurgling, gasping, or atonal wailing. None pleasant."" ""Reminds me of a pre-pubescent Robert Smith. Sometimes."" By the third track-- and this may just have been the Captain talking-- Our Hero started to realize that, aural root canal or not, the singing was just maddening enough to work with the danceable abandon Hot Hot Heat so desperately tried to get across. It was crazy, but in a calculated sort of way. Once he ""got into the groove"" of Heat's compulsively rhythmic strangeness it became far more palatable. Even as he warmed to the vocals, however, the review remained unwritten, and time was running out. The unique blend of salsa-flavored percussive elements that propelled ""Sleep"" faded out with piano keys twinkling, leading directly to a storm of hand-clapping and foot-stomping, ushering in the morse-code attack of Dante DeCaro's rapid fire guitar in ""Touch You Touch You."" He had to give the band credit; the instrumentation was tight and inventive throughout the EP, and latin-tinged tension of ""Touch You"" was the high water mark. Our Hero slowly took in the keyboard effects (ridiculously old-school lasergun tweets-- laughable, but entertaining as hell) and jittery piano through an alcohol-addled haze; the monitor stared at him, and he stared back equally blankly. At least the vocals on this one had been contained somewhat and were far more believably emotive than before; a nice change of pace. Finally, as the ebullient guitar work and faint, but appreciated, harmonies of ""More for Show"" burst forth from the speakers where the Hello Kitty's mouth ought to have been, Our Hero was inspired. It might have had something to do with the fact that this closing piece was an unexpected blast of blue skies and optimism from an EP that had thus far been nervous, but with a sinister swing (the same sort of vibe as ""Hell,"" by the Squirrel Nut Zippers), or maybe it was the lines of cocaine. Either way, he was fired up to write; it would be an ill-conceived, pretentious, and self-referential narrative about the difficulties of music reviewing! And it was all thanks to Hot Hot Heat's surprising new EP. Their blending of vaguely Latin percussion (Hawley's drum work was easily the standout of the album), a hint of post-punk guitar-grinding, and truly insane vocals had grown on him like a not-so-bad fungus. Our Hero was thrilled, until he realized the second obstacle that confronted him: he had no conceivable way to end the review.","Typing, typing, typing:

Torino,Cinerama,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5d29d034d5c69bf33b4/1:1/w_160/cc0db8d3.jpg,2002-08-07 05:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1471-torino/,Manifesto,"You know, sex in our superculture could use some demystification. Folks are constantly subjected to the infantilizing peekaboo juxtapositions of advertisements (hot, the designer handbag covers her boobs!), the choreographed passion and streamlined intercourse of film and TV (shucks, it all sort of falls into place if you buy silk sheets!), the vapid posturing and exaggerations of radio (you're the one I love forever which makes everything in this horrible world alright and, hey, plus, do me!). I know it's in our programming, but I had this flimsy theory that the mega-pull of loin-worship might be made more subtle if sex wasn't presented as a balletic panacea. We might not have to witness such heartbreaking sights as: the desperation conveyed in the epidemic of people donning hoochie-wear to check the mail, old men overfilming their niece's birthday parties, or overweight Christians glaring passively at the disingenuous porn of reality TV. Was a time I'd implicate Cinerama's David Gedge in the conspiracy to keep us drool-dangling and hump-hoping via vagueness and broad strokes. During his stint as the leader of criminally unsung polish-rockers The Wedding Present, and on his last two albums fronting Cinerama, he's been quite the advocate of the booty = bliss equation, give or take the occasional nod to the pain of longing or the opportunity cost of a breakup. But on Torino, Cinerama's blaringest and best release, Gedge yanks off the soft-focus lens and offers sexual specifics. This honesty should be a balm for anyone traumatized by less-than-paradisiacal romance with actual consequences: wait, you mean lust can be detrimentally consuming? People's parts can intrudingly misalign? Menstruation's real? The side effects of hay-rolling might include cretinous jealousy? Birds can still shit on you out by the pool, even if you're mid-cuddle? Then why don't car alarms go off outside the conjugal windows in Meg Ryan movies? Alas, prolonged exposure to le nittre grittre didn't save Gedge from his addiction. In the course of compiling all of his detailed research, he has become his subject's hostage. Wasn't it Nietzsche who said that if you stare too long at genitals, they also stare back into you? Thankfully, Gedge's habit doesn't prevent him from concocting a stellar, if somewhat single-minded, album. The lyrics will reduce you to thinking the cover art is not just dangerously close to Kent's Isola, but that it's some sort of nipply, or priapic, or orgasmic visual suggestion. ""And When She Was Bad"" kicks the album off with the query, ""If he's only a nobody, then why does he stare at your breasts?"" The equally noncircuitous but kinkier ""Two Girls"" (as in ""at the same time"") is about someone who-- and this is a sampling of Gedge's words-- chokes, provokes, eats, defeats, charms, harms, fights, delights, bites, excites, annoys, destroys, mocks, shocks, hates, and devastates him. ""Estrella"" deals with punishing a mate, via sleaziness and ""slight adultery,"" into breaking up with him. ""Cat Girl Tights"" involves cat girl tights. The violins and Bona Dragness of the brief ""Airborne"" provide a moment of emotional release, but oh snap-- it was just a segue to ""Quick, Before It Melts"" which never leaves the smutgutter after this opening: ""When you said I've got nothing on beneath this dress, that was such good flirting/ I usually find such candidness disconcerting."" Sure you do; the next line, she adds: ""I don't wear underwear because it leaves a stripe."" Amid these initial one-night standings, you'll notice that into the clean and lush Cinerama mix of strings, horns, harpsichords, flutes, fifes, and keyboards, a fair amount of actual rock chops has been added. These amendments aren't entirely mannered; rather than introduce themselves by saying, ""Hello, my name is Raaah and I'll be your guitar blast today,"" these abrupt bursts-- sometimes craftily preceded by a teensy xylophone bridge-- will send you diving for the volume knob. And don't commit the O'Rourke Fallacy and attribute the stomping, turbulent riffage to Monsieur Albini's presence-- he's been working with Gedge since the late 80s. Anyhow, the Albini on deck here is a different, more attentive one than the Corky O'Whamkaboom persona he's generated of late. Underproducing overproduction, he captures the elegant noise here as deftly as he drew Will Oldham out of his warble on Viva Last Blues. ""Tie Me Up"" is an almost impolitic celebration of being owned and enslaved, complete with an overdone dead-stop at which Gedge whispers, ""I'll do it,"" and a symphonic crescendo at which he yells, ""I cried your name and then I came."" By the time the song is over, you might be plugging your ears and defensively humming Weezer's ""Tired of Sex,"" or at least shouting, ""I get it, already."" But you've still got to survive the catchy, clavier-seasoned ""Close Up"" whose speaker demands to be slowly told and retold about his partner's affair, the bras being undone, the ""touching you there,"" the ""making you come."" And you'll feel used by the opening couplet of ""Starry Eyed"": ""Why have you locked the bathroom door/ It's not as if I haven't seen you piss a thousand times before."" You know you're in love when a grueling lifetime of toilet-shyness dissipates into team spirit. If any of those excerpts triggered a blush, a tee-hee, a ""don't go there!"" a ""too much information!"" or ""damn, that's raunchier than N.E.R.D.!"" then memorize this fun fact: writer Marcel Proust got off on cursing at, and spitting on, photographs of his mother. So you watch who you're calling perverse. Besides, Gedge doesn't leave you worrying about how he manages to stumble to the loo in the morning with his, apparently daily, sore sex-ankles. There's plenty else to appreciate on Torino. Gedge's game-to-grating fey factor prevents him from ever coming across like a salacious neighbor or bombastic Seducifer. The Southpaw Grammar guitar and whirlwind sound effect of ""Starry Eyed"" continues to acknowledge the Moz in the tradition of Cinerama's cover of the Smiths' ""London."" Throughout the album gongs, bells, and chimes sneak in. Sally Murrell's once-frequent call-and-response backing vocals are now just bops and ahh's sprinkled on like pepper; you might think someone behind you in the room joined the show for a second. There's a surfy track, and forgone-conclusion spaghetti western touches. Huge slices of French cheese are processed with reverent seriousness. And right when the bed-centric melodrama approaches artlessness and unbearability, the album is interrupted with a snippet of studio banter that reminds the listener of the pedestrian aspects of preparing a disc about peach juice running down the face of the girl with whom the speaker just made love by the lake: the bandmembers call headphones ""cans"" and laughingly tell Albini that they need to hear that last twenty seconds again, fearing that they got ""carried away"" and flubbed the music. Justify the rating, you ask? What elevated this CD beyond its first-listen glass ceiling of merely sufficing 7.8dom? A: Timing. The conscious throwback of Britpop's stately rumble sounds tremendous after long spells with hardscrabble Americana and labor-intensive Experimentia. Anyone who ever Morrissey-twirled a hosepipe on their provider's patio as a combustible teen will welcome this effort. Gedge seems oblivious to the fact that all the gushing critics and cliquey consumers are crowding the 60s, 70s, and 80s lounges, leaving him to hog the stage in the remember-the-90s room. B: Legacy fulfillment. How can he still have this much energy? What were you doing in 1989? I was trying to rig up a homemade Flavor Flav clocklace. Gedge was covering a obscure band named Pavement. Something about a box elder or something. C: ""Health and Efficiency."" What a pop closer. The song begins and ends with sadly swooning chords played over what I assume is a 'field recording' that runs counter to the entire album's oh-hi-there pose. City noise, squeaking brakes, and the beeps of a truck in reverse can be heard, along with conversation that includes a man holding forth about 78s, Motown, his kids, and how ""we've become a very cold society."" The drums perfectly, lazily conceal the epic wail of distortion that arrives later, accompanied by a nervy, trilly violin. The lyrics finally fess up to regret and loss, and the listener is saved by one warmly reverbed note that ends the song right before you've closed the garage on your monoxide party.","You know, sex in our superculture could use some demystification.

You Can't Fight What You Can't See,Girls Against Boys,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf2d13d197565213b859/1:1/w_160/5c509153.jpg,2002-08-07 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3457-you-cant-fight-what-you-cant-see/,Jade Tree,"For one week out of the year, Austin sheds its neo-hippie facade and reveals itself to be (SURPRISE!) the cultural apex of western civilization. Though commonly referred to as ""cha-CHINNNNGGG!"" by a handful of Texan economists, this event is more often known as South-by-Southwest; a temporary musical mecca that easily justifies the thousands of nerdy pilgrimages it inspires. It seems that the concentrated ambience even strikes a few ne'er-to-do politicians as profound, because every year local legislature imposes a city-wide moratorium on driving with your windows rolled up. This, in effect, turns your stereo selections into high decibel calls for potential friends and mates and also exposes that cute blonde in the next lane for the Shawn Mullins fan she really is. That said, it's also worth noting that pretending your six o'clock traffic jam is really a Wayne Coyne-directed parking lot experiment really helps to pass the time. Seeing as the ratio of P.R. representatives-to-actual fans is a good 9-to-1, it's no surprise that each coming year charts new levels of frenzied hype. Some of the press releases range from moronic (""They Might Be Giants MIGHT BE ready for an Underground Renaissance"") to silly (""The Shins: What Johnny Rotten would sound like if he went emo"") to stuff warranting an A&R; exorcism (""With her latest offering, Abra Moore clearly defines herself as the next Radiohead""). This year, I wanted to forego all of that and subject myself to the brutal punishment of Japan's Acid Mothers Temple. I wanted to grasp Makoto Kawabata's extended hand as he took me on a tour of our pulsing ultra-violet universe, replete with its space coyotes and floating dojos. Where did I end up? Back in 1997, trying to reidentify with Scott McCloud and convincing my dyslexic friend Jake, who had read GVSB's acronym on the club's marquee, that Rob Pollard wasn't going to be making any appearances. Seriously, the whole network's gonna go down. Hey, have you seen Hackers? Suffice to say, Girls Against Boys were cooler when their music seemed a dangerous cocktail of post-punk and pre-millenial tension. Regardless of whether You Can't Fight What You Can't See is a return to form (which, in all respects, it is), it's hard to argue that the great alternative-industrial rock irony of 'chronicling-the-evils-of-technology-by-means-of-utilizing-technology' didn't go the way of the Tamagotchi and that ""21st Century Digital Boy"" song. Operating on the premise that, with the exception of 1998's Geffen calamity FreakOnIca, Girls Against Boys haven't drastically changed their formula since their 1989 debut Tropic of Scorpio, it's safe to say that the band knows their sound inside-and-out. And what you've heard is all true: You Can't Fight What You Can't See cans the discotheque disaster and returns the guys to their original sound. A wise decision undoubtedly, but it seems now that the band is terrified of change, leaving them to rehash what their first five albums accomplished in lieu of actual progression. And as anyone could tell you, if there's something Girls Against Boys need now more than ever, it's to change anything. See, they had the right intentions with FreakOnIca, they just went about it all wrong. And now, post-backlash, they're not going about it at all. The style is unmistakably dated now, and the 'grooves' constructed throughout You Can't Fight What You Can't See attempt only to reinstill the same hedonistic impetus as on their oversexed 1996 release House of GVSB. Never mind that the group has already successfully approximated that sound, as documented on that album's ""Disco Six Six Six"" (not to mention Cruise Yourself's ""The Royal Lowdown""). But, while GvsB has always distinguished themselves from the crowds of would-be sonic revolutionaries crying ""MOLOCH!"" by lyrically excluding all listeners not affiliated with the rave scene, here the band manages to break new lows for ecstacy-tinged, Underworld-inspired speak/sing rants: ""I keep pushing/ Pushing in like an obsession/ Like an addiction/ Keep pushing..."" Of course, You Can't Fight What You Can't See, like most albums, does have a few spare moments of seemingly inspired performance. ""All the Rage,"" despite its standard piss-poor lyrical content, ranks amongst the better songs on their last three albums, and ""Kicking the Lights"" finds the band experimenting with texture moreso than ever before. The rest? Just flip back through their catalog and imagine what those songs would sound like with crisper production and less inspiration. Indeed, there's not much here to love, which just leaves one to wonder if history will remember any of Girls Against Boys' records beyond 1994's Venus Luxure No. 1 Baby. God knows I won't.","For one week out of the year, Austin sheds its neo-hippie facade and reveals itself to be (SURPRISE!) the cultural ...

Ascend,Manual,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3a469fc7814a47cd6c5/1:1/w_160/f34df4d7.jpg,2002-08-06 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5096-ascend/,Morr,"Twenty-year old Jonas Munk first broke from obscurity with a debut EP for the Denmark-based Hobby Industries label. The disc's blend of IDM breaks and classic shoegazer lullabies quickly earned him international recognition, and he soon found a natural home with the Morr Music label. How pleased with himself must Thomas Morr have felt when Munk dropped his first Manual full-length, Until Tomorrow, on his Rococo gilt- and ivory-inlayed walnut desk. It instantly captured the Morr aesthetic: the fusion of Powerbook beats with Slowdive's effects-pedal swoon. Earlier this year, having given the world some time to recuperate from the bliss-out of his first LP, Munk joined forces with friends to flesh out his debut's gossamer glide with Orion, released under the moniker Limp. As it turns out, that album serves as a springboard for Ascend. If you haven't heard Orion, the difference between Manual's first full-length and this new album might seem a bit striking; where Until Tomorrow is etiolated and fragile, Ascend is strenuous and graceful. Opening statements don't get much more transporting than ""Midnight Is Where the Day Begins."" Out of a low rumble of digital ocean waves, all manner of processed chimes ripple until an angelically chorused guitar line threads its shimmering way into prominence. In its path follows a glorious retinue of beguiling sounds that never quite become a coherent melody. It's instead an iridescent wake that fades out two-thirds of the way through to allow a peaceful conversation between pristine metallic flourishes and lush guitar. Against heavy percussion echoing the DMX drum machine Vini Reilly used on his early 80s Durutti Column albums, swooping lines are set to ""Astoria,"" reminding me of, actually, Vangelis at his most economical. ""Out of the Summer"" ruminates like the peaceful passages in Tangerine Dream's ""Atem"" before Munk reminds the listener of his debt to Boards of Canada by introducing a sparsely plucked acoustic guitar and the wordless vocalizing of a child. And once ensconced in the BoC soundscape, Munk sees no hurry to leave, grafting the see-sawing piano melody from Massive Attack's ""Teardrop"" to ""Casey,"" and also appropriating some of the granulized fuzz of Autechre's Confield to mask the influence of Pale Saints' ""Little Hammer."" He later emerges with ""As the Moon Spins Around,"" his guitar taking enormous legato glides across a near-empty pace. A tiny pulse and the occasional soft clank of alien machinery passes almost undetected beneath the gentle cosmic ambience. Jonas Munk has a grasp of melody and elegance that far outstrips his young ears. Ascend belongs rightfully with the Irresistible Force's It's Tomorrow Already as an album of concentrated bliss and artful precision. But truth be told, I'd rather not have heard Orion first, as it gave away the interim steps that would otherwise have been such a great surprise. Next time I hear a Manual album I want to feel overwhelmed by his overachievement rather than comfortably pleased by it.","Twenty-year old Jonas Munk first broke from obscurity with a debut EP for the Denmark-based Hobby Industries label.

"More Specific, Less Pacific",Caesura,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4c4ea9e61561daa4fb5/1:1/w_160/b2487b7d.jpg,2002-08-06 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1215-more-specific-less-pacific/,54¬∫40' or Fight!,"If I wanted a mud bath I would've gone to a spa. I mean, yeah, I'm all strung out on stress and I'm sure my skin could use a little exfoliation after all these months of swampy summer air; a trip like that might do me some good. I could come back all rejuvenated, ready to take on the world with a newly relaxed viewpoint and ultra-healthy skin. It'd be like in those Bior√© ads! Yet, despite not having done any of this, I'm still being subjected to a heavily applied bath of sludge. The production on Caesura's debut album's what I'm talking about, and it's not helping my skin any, much less my poor, bloodied ears. This upstart San Francisco trio really deserve better sound, too, which makes listening to this album all the more frustrating. Instrumentally speaking, Caesura (named for a breathing point in natural speech rhythms) hang together pretty damn tight, blasting home a broad range of inventive, complex arrangements for the standard rock trio of guitar, bass and drums. Never mind that it's frequently difficult to tell the difference between the guitar and the bass on the album, these guys play with focus, and it's their strongest point. For proof, you don't even have to listen past ""For Staged Encore,"" the band's opening salvo of nonstop riffage and distorted, barely audible vocals. Rather than engage you with a melody or some sort of memorable musical motif, though, the band attempts to trample you under foot, moving rapidly from passage to passage and through a disorienting series of tempo shifts that, while well executed, don't amount to a hill of beans in substance. Equally charged rhythmically, ""Enter, Fluorescence"" is more focused compositionally, but there's still no real hook to hang your hat on, and the production is unrelentingly brown and undefined. Then there's the matter of the song's title and its odd placement of a comma. Who, exactly, is Fluorescence? All I know is that back in the 80s I entered a fluorescent jacket every day and all it made me was a fashion victim. I wouldn't go so far as to call the guys in Caesura fashion victims, as I basically support this post-punk renewal thing they're musically tied to, but they do seem to be the victims of poor planning, making their small mark on a trendy scene with a sound that's only about 60% fleshed out. There are thirteen other songs on this album, but to talk about them would be to repeat what I said about the other two. At every turn, the band throws down an impressive, heavy rhythmic attack and forgets to add a building to the foundation. Vocals are buried either by distortion or by simply being mixed to low to be heard-- though, listening closely, it's clear that the parts aren't very engaging anyway. Guitarist/vocalist Evan Rehill has enough vocal control and ability to rate as 'promising,' so it's a mystery to me why the band and engineer Aaron Prellwitz have decided to marginalize his voice so much. The band does take a couple of admirable shots at expanding their sound, but they come off as throwaways, like the 50-second percussion interlude ""Compromise in Theory."" ""Auxiliary Engine"" is mostly a standard-issue Caesura tune, but contains a few surprisingly clean moments where the blanket of fuzz is lifted to let the clean, melodic bass playing of Brad Purvis (great name!) to the fore. ""Assassin Assassin"" is an oddly chaotic instrumental that alternates quiet, clattering passages with noisy explosions where all of the instruments bleed together. Again. But this time even more than usual. Despite those few sidesteps, though, More Specific, Less Pacific is an ultimately monochromatic affair compromised by dirt-bound recording that only occasionally allows any space in the mix, and then never for long enough. The album slams shut with the aptly named instrumental ""Brown-Out,"" which is technically proficient enough to reinforce the notion that Caesura can do better than this. With any luck, they will in the future, but for right now, they could help themselves out by hiring a producer who can clean some of the mud off.","If I wanted a mud bath I would've gone to a spa.

Saint the Fire Show,The Fire Show,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd9bc0084474cd0c2d31/1:1/w_160/2da0774e.jpg,2002-08-06 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3060-saint-the-fire-show/,Perishable,"12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 Damn. Looks like we lost power again. Happens pretty often here, especially on the hottest days. System overloads cause brief glitches and outages, draining the power we take for granted from our appliances and modern devices. Unsaved data is lost, the fan stops circulating the air. And when normalcy resumes, the clocks come back confused, blurting ""noon"" at intervals until reset. As strong as we like to think our technologically advanced society is, it's telling that the electricity and power that we rely on daily are brought to us by an exceptionally fragile network, vulnerable to malfunction at millions of points. Art has long been the mirror to society, from the physical and philosophical ideals suggested by Greek statuary, to Picasso's cubist deconstructions of wartime massacres and Hendrix dismantling ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" to simultaneously explore his patriotism and his disgust with the Vietnam War. So, as we as a society become more reliant on technology to aid us and remember the details of our lives for us, it seems logical that music-- perhaps the most immediate and cathartic art form available-- should explore the intricacies of our relationship with technology. It also bears noting that music, a capella singing notwithstanding, is a technological art form, relying on the inventions of human hands to produce and capture it. In their unfortunately brief time together, Chicago's the Fire Show were more than willing to explore the possibilities and limitations of the equipment they had to work with, often exploiting its limitations in the service of expression. Last year's mini-album Above the Volcano of Flowers came across as something of a mission statement-- the mission being simply to move forward and create something genuinely original and affecting, a feat the band seemed utterly prepared to accomplish. And with their swan song, Saint the Fire Show, they do. The album is a dark, unpredictable maelstrom of ideas, emotion and haywire technology, at times disquietingly calm and at others in danger of running completely off the rails. The band opens the album in a strange place with the crippled hymn ""The Making of Dead Hollow,"" and for some, its intense strangeness may be somewhat offputting. But I suspect that it's for this very reason that the band sequenced it this way-- that perhaps it's a means of weeding out the faint of heart before they've invested too much. Here's how it unfolds: M Resplendent's mournful falsetto hangs in empty air, untouched and natural. It moves in simple, drifting phrases, never wavering or faltering, as sampling, peculiar noises and oddball musical passages crop up alongside it. A clanging drum beat, a vicious guitar, reprocessed vocals and soundtrack strings all threaten Resplendent's moody vocalizing, but nothing really takes a swing until a full-band rhythm rises at the song's end for an instrumental coda. The rest of Saint the Fire Show is hardly as weird, but no less inventive. ""The Rabbit of My Soul Is the King of His Ghost,"" one of several outstanding tracks on the record, kicks in with harmonized guitars before dropping a colossal groove, funked up by Pyx Klos' rubbery bass. Resplendent sing-speaks his way through the post-punk landscape as Olias Nil injects layered backing vocals and heavy-echo tape effects. ""Dollar and Cent Supplicants"" is eerie and arctic, with chilly pianos swimming through frigid oceans of reverb. Sampled operatic interjections aside, the song is utterly skeletal, and as such it's the most piercing thing here, Resplendent's voice crawling up your spine to whisper, processed, into your ear. ""The God Forsaken Angels of Epistemology"" creeps in on a bed of fuzz and heavily compressed drums. The strings return here as well, pumping necessary organic sounds into the electronic stew. Resplendent's delivery on the chorus is so perfect, it's easy to miss that the only thing backing him up is the percussion. But Saint the Fire Show is the kind of album where the details sneak up on you like that-- most of it is so perfectly layered that it tricks you into thinking there's more going on than there actually is. For instance, ""Useless Romo Cravings"" never places more than four instruments behind the vocal at one time, yet the way it's recorded gives the impression of intricate overdubbing, the sound washing inland like the first break of a tsunami crashing through a coastal metropolis. The joint production work of Graeme Gibson and Brian Deck is stunning as well-- the duo focuses on injecting space into the dense mix, and as a result, the bass still seems to float, even when weighed down by overdriven cymbals and piles of keyboards. The closing dirge ""You are My Sunshine"" (yes, that one) uses a scarcity of sounds to elevate itself from an ironic cover into something genuinely desolate and despairing. I'm absolutely positive that, while writers Jimmie Davis and Charles Mitchell certainly didn't intend the song as some kind of joyous celebration of humanity, they never meant for the song to sound quite this desolate. The Fire Show focus on the plea of the line, ""Please don't take my sunshine away,"" spinning it into a visceral anguish, with the album's final embers burning out slowly as a wrecked trombone enters to sweep aside the catharsis. And that's right around the time that you realize this is the last you'll ever hear from the Fire Show. The individual members will likely move on to other things, but it's an absolute shame these guys won't be operating as a unit again, because, in simple terms, they were tremendous. Two brief documentary segments are included on this disc for your enlightenment, though they offer no insight into the band's decision to call it quits. But there is one small comfort: at least this band left us their masterpiece before they departed.","12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 12:00 ...

Remember back to the first time you wiped out on your bike as a kid. Right afterward, wasn't there a heightened sense of reality? As if you were asleep right up to the moment when you flipped over your handlebars? You might have been bruised and bleeding, but after the crying was over, didn't you feel more alive than ever? This frozen moment of awareness is something Spokane managed to extend and harness long enough to create an album's worth of songs. Midway through recording Able Bodies, the Richmond-based trio's fourth album, the members of Spokane were involved in a car accident in which they flipped over twice. They were lucky to walk away without serious injury, but the accident obviously informed the remainder of the sessions. It's hard not to attribute the increased urgency displayed here over previous work to their close call behind the wheel. Able Bodies is brief by most standards-- just under 32 minutes-- but says all it needs to say and still manages to carry you off into a wispy, airy world with chiming guitar, haunting violin, and minimal drum brush strokes. Led by Rick Alverson, formerly the helmsman of the much-lauded Virginia folk group Drunk, Spokane create evocative miniatures with just the bare essentials and a few well-placed embellishments: microcosm with a little cello here, a touch of glockenspiel there, but not enough that you could ever accuse Spokane's music of being baroque. Likewise, Alverson's lyrics simply point the direction rather than take you by the hand and walk you home. He offers one or two concrete details, artifacts and objects, and that's about it. It's as if he knows how little time is given him and his fragile crew, so he tries to say more with less. And the beauty is that it's always enough to get you somewhere-- through the song at the very least-- and usually somewhere you weren't expecting to be taken by the scant nature of the raw materials. ""I set my thin trunk of ribs in a room/ My full set of teeth by a horsehair broom,"" he sings on the album closer ""The Made Bed,"" revealing a world to those with the patience to listen. Elsewhere, his lyrics resemble the kind of fragmented thought you might have while pulling yourself from a twisted heap of metal that was once an automobile: fragmented, yes, but keenly aware of detail and with a heightened sense of the real. ""In houses/ I'm waiting/ The future seems misshapen/ The ease of wishing is a weight I know/ And victory is so hard to let go,"" he sings on ""In House."" Literally, it makes little sense, but through the delivery and the music it speaks volumes. Comparisons with Duluth dirge-rock standard bearers Low are perhaps inevitable when discussing a band like Spokane, but while Low evoke images of snow-covered wastes and Midwestern desolation, Spokane have a distant, 'Old America' quality to their sound, mainly due to the copious and haunting use of the violin. Half of the time it sounds like it could accompany a Ken Burns Civil War documentary on Virginia battlefields. And like those documentaries, Able Bodies conveys an air of triumph amidst the scenes of wreckage.","Disaster, or near disaster, can bring life into focus quicker than just about anything.

Daybreaker,Beth Orton,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba0a5e6ef95969322ae5/1:1/w_160/33a6b5da.jpg,2002-08-04 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6046-daybreaker/,Astralwerks,"The first thing you notice about Daybreaker, Beth Orton's third in a series of progressively bland and unadventurous releases, is the cover's striking similarity to any number of deodorant advertisements. The theme continues on the back cover as the gangly English giantess is shown frolicking in the foamy surf wearing jean shorts and a white tanktop, leg kicked out behind her in a gesture as if to say, ""Finally a pad that suits my lifestyle."" Inside, things get a little confusing, if not intriguing. The three-panel foldout shows: 1. A fenced-in area next to a dock and gazebo, which, like a Jandek cover, initially seems meaningful but leaves you with the lingering suspicion that it's probably just randomness for randomness' sake. 2. A cove in which two boats have beached: a mid-size fishing craft and a Greenpeace-style rubber raft, suggesting the photographer had recently watched The Man with the Golden Gun. And, most perplexing of all: 3. Beth sitting in the above-mentioned fishing boat, back turned, apparently breastfeeding an acoustic guitar. All of these photos are shown through a hazy, soft-focus glow usually reserved for soap opera flashbacks, Barbara Walters interviews, and Jerry McGuire. Disappointingly though, this album is neither a veiled avant-feminist concept album nor some backhanded commentary on advertising culture and consumerism; it's rather a product of such schemes. And after listening to the album, the artwork, which once was simply perplexing, becomes merely hilarious, if unintentionally so. But let's move past the images and get to the heart of the matter: the music. Well, it's sad, really. An artist who once seemed poised to carve out a brand new style of electro-acoustic music (I once saw the painfully reaching term ""folk-hop"" used in a review of her previous album, Central Reservation) is here reduced to a mere mannequin upon which can be draped layer upon layer of guest artists. The jewel case sticker, which claims that Daybreaker ""effortlessly cross[es] musical boundaries,"" and is ""richly evocative and lyrically profound,"" seems pathetically hyperbolic with Orton's trademark mellow dreck pouring like chicken soup from the speakers. Do they really believe this, the folks at Astralwerks? Exactly what musical boundaries are being crossed here? Yay, it's got both acoustic guitars and electronics! The same could be said of nearly every 'new country' release rolling off the Nashville assembly line these days. We're far past the point where such things are even novel; it's what you do with it that counts. And here, Beth and her endless brothel of collaborative misfits ain't doing much at all. In fact, the enthusiasm that occasionally marked Trailer Park, and the emotional attachment that brought to life the better moments on Central Reservation, have utterly vanished. Some of the Big Name guests appearing on Daybreaker include the Chemical Brothers, William Orbit, Ben Watt, and Johnny Marr, the combined talent of which, amazingly, seems to have gone into making this album devoid of much personally at all. Apart from a little ""Space Oddity""-style send off on ""Mount Washington""-- presumably courtesy of one of the above knob-twisters-- the presence of all of the above musicians passes unnoticeably. Which is probably a good thing, come to think of it. Unfortunately, the same can't be said of Winona-bait Ryan Adams. The alternahunk-o'-the-minute's grubby paws are all over this record, and his presence is all too conspicuous, though his name is suspiciously left off the sticker. (That Ryan, such a shy one.) Adams seems to have taken a break of, oh, say, half an hour or so from smoking joints and getting his bedhead just so to write a song 'specially for Beth. ""This One's Gonna Bruise,"" tackles (I'm guessing) the subject of domestic violence with such, er, hard-hitting lyrics as: ""I feel bad for you, I feel bad for you, but I don't know why, I don't know why..."" Slippery. I've mentioned all the peripheries accompanying this album because, after a half-dozen times through the album, they're all you're left with. Apart from the opening track, the slightly rousing, string-heavy ""Paris Train,"" nothing genuinely reaches out and latches on. Even the blips and bloops that pop up here and there (such as on the title track) lose all potential effectiveness in the overproduced, glossy morass. But what truly separates Daybreaker from other Orton efforts is its lack of emotional resonance-- moments where Beth just belts it out or where she actually seems engaged with the songs she's singing. But, as with her cover photo, she seems to just passively sit there as the album goes by, just another guest artist on a generic Astralwerks Record Project. Orton's voice is still astounding, conjuring blurs of Joni Mitchell and a slight elvishess without resorting to neo-folk schlock, but it's rarely, if ever, put to good use here. The songs are just so tentative and directionless, and the whole electro-acoustic thing so formulaically and routinely applied, that she seems like a mere pawn at the mercy of her collaborators and record company. Beth has been a guilty pleasure of mine since Trailer Park, mainly due to her strong vocals and occasional flashes of brilliance (like ""Pass in Time"" from Central Reservation). But Daybreaker leaves me rightfully shamed: the pleasure is gone, leaving me with only the guilt.","The first thing you notice about Daybreaker, Beth Orton's third in a series of progressively bland and unadventurous releases ...

You don't hear much from bookish lads chatting in pubs about ""anarcho-syndicalist"" politics or crapping about how they never get laid. Such topics, of course, seem gloomy on the surface, but... if you sugarcoat them in some catchy pop/punk you get something pretty damn good, as proven by Newcastle-upon-Tyne's everyday rockers, Milky Wimpshake. You can hear a little bit of Billy Bragg here, and a lot of punk, but I mostly get a serious vibe of Herman's Hermits doing ""I'm Henry VIII I Am"" to more spastic music. Pete Case's guitar is a gristly sandblast to the eardrums, buzzing over a keyed-up rhythm section, and the raw mix doesn't shave off the edges. It could sound like just so much noise except that these songs are catchy and their lyrics are witty. The hooks and jangle complement the distortion of ""Scrabble"" and ""Philosophical Boxing Gloves,"" and the jerky strumming and haphazard squalls on ""Dialling Tone"" blanket a song that could be rehabbed (and ruined) as an American ska-rock hit. The band also uses harmonica, banjo and violin here and there, which adds just enough color, though the harmonium on ""Philosophical Boxing Gloves"" sounds a bit twee. Case has a slim set of pipes, best displayed on the band's cover of Phil Ochs' ""Do What I Have To,"" where he strains through the broad lines of the song. But he's adept with biting words and nimble melodies, and he shines on ""Jackass,"" his protest against Home Secretary and fanatic prison-builder Jack Straw. Case also proves himself earnest and expressive as his songs jump from politics to love gone wrong, to his personal history, to an entire song about how etymology relates to the validity of ideas passed on to us by zzzzzzzzzzzz... er, right. Yeah, okay, so some of these topics are a bit absurd, and the songs are sometimes reachingly wordy, but Case generally makes them work. And the great cover of Spraydog's ""Lemonade"" puts him through lines that are more abstract and emotional, not allowing him to hunch behind his own wit. Lovers Not Fighters at times makes me wish the band would tighten up a little more-- specifically, that Case would sharpen his own lyrics to show how clever he really is. His best lines are tight, witty and even silly: ""This song has a verse but has no chorus/ The police are out in force and looking for us."" On the other hand, he seems to have a rule that if he can't make a good rhyme in five minutes or less, he goes with whatever he has: ""Your boyfriend seems so dull/ He was probably born in Hull."" Indeed, Case could definitely tighten the screws, but the lack of polish and these few awkward moments are probably what make the band work. Milky Wimpshake are smart, noisy, and this close to outrage, but they're too modest and good-natured to let it get in the way of a good time. And you've got to like a guy who can cut himself down like on the pro-cheating anthem ""Dialling Tone"": ""Yeah, I know I'm your bit on the side/ But I hope one day you'll be all mine."" If only the Gallaghers could be so humble.","A lot of British pop beaches itself on our shores, but it's rare to find the voice of the ...

Our Land Brains,Snowglobe,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4989d034d5c69bf30e5/1:1/w_160/9263f7e0.gif,2002-08-04 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7307-our-land-brains/,Bardot,"In July of 2002, Bardot Records had the collective balls to suggest that Snowglobe, a Memphis quartet no one outside of Tennessee had ever heard of, recently recorded the ""pop album of the year."" The suggestion ran as a banner ad atop the Pitchfork front page, and was disguised in question format (i.e. ""Snowglobe: Pop album of the year?""). If you're at all like this reviewer, you probably reacted to this blatant hype-evangelism with a curt, cynical hipster retort-- something along the lines of ""Pop Album of the Year? Try 'Poop Album of the Year.'"" Then you and your friends all laughed together in a warm spirit of bitter, self-righteous erudition. Hipsters, however, are notorious for reacting before thinking, especially to suggestions that something is actually good. So if you were one of those doubting this wintery 'Globe, then prepare to be shamed. On second thought, shame is too strong a word. That is, unless by doubting Snowglobe you also got caught masturbating (unlikely). Prepare instead to be lightly corrected; your bitter cynicism is about to be exposed as false. By who? By Snowglobe, of course. And by me, who is writing about this wonderful quartet. Our Land Brains may not be the pop album of the year, and Snowglobe is definitely not the bandname of the year, but this disc sure is a dandy. Whenever a band starts an album with three near-perfect pop songs, it's usually a good thing (that is, unless it only gets worse from there on out, but we'll tackle that issue later). Our Land Brains opens with ""Waves Rolling,"" a 60s throwback reminiscent of the Byrds and the Elephant 6 posse. Don't think Beatles, though; their influence is present, but Snowglobe draw from a wider pool of resources, most of which are American. The second number, ""Beautiful,"" opens with a simple, playful five-chord piano progression. Other pianos dot in and out of the composition, some pounding lower bass notes, others scampering down scales at the upper registers. Percussion is composed of sleigh bells, tambourine, xylophone and kettle drums. Then comes the voice: ladies and gentlemen, please say hello to Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys. I mean that in the least derogatory way possible; somehow, vocalist Brad Postlethwaite and his comrades in harmony manage to bottle up a candy-sweet Beach Boys melody, replete with letter-perfect vocal reproduction and reconstitute it here for your listening pleasure. Postlethwaite shares songwriting and lead-vocal duties with Tim Regan, who gets his first chance to display his wares on ""Dreamworks,"" the album's third actual song. Regan's voice tends more towards a Pete Townsend timbre, and his songwriting takes on a dramatic, serious mood. Prominent instrumentation on the track include a strong, uptempo minor-key bassline, a mournful piano vamp and horns, and a wah-wah'd guitar that's afforded its own 35 second solo. The lyrics are nicely poetic: ""Slip away from all you've known/ Swim out in the distance/ Catch a ride on the furthest star/ Colors bleed into your eyes, as you shoot through the distant skies of heaven."" The melody, ascending into the upper registers for the chorus, punctuates the emotion in the lyrics. After ""Dreamworks"" is through, however, the disc begins a descent back into the land of the pop mortals. Most of the rest of the album is well above-average, like ""Adrenaline Mother,"" which falls somewhere between the Moody Blues and ""Norwegian Wood,"" and ""Muse,"" a sing-along-with-Belle-and-Sebastian-style melody. But some tracks plain fall flat, like ""Big City Lights,"" a seven-minute tune with a few too many nonsensical twists and turns, and ""Playground,"" where Postlethwaite's nasal delivery is epitomized, and his sense of melody is effectively disguised as a sense of the boring and clich√©d. ""Pop Album of the Year?"" It's possible. Would have been even more possible had it been shorter (there are 16 tracks on this sucka). Even if it's not, though, I wouldn't go so far as to call Bardot Records a brood of vipers. Their lies will have been white ones-- helpful ones, even, lies that led the deceived to some fricking sweet-ass music with a few superb songs and massive loads of promise. Bardot Records, you bastard liars, we thank you.","In July of 2002, Bardot Records had the collective balls to suggest that Snowglobe, a Memphis quartet no\n\ one ...

Stars on My Ceiling,Caural,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a554ea9e61561daa50f3/1:1/w_160/cc1b0b5f.jpg,2002-08-04 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1352-stars-on-my-ceiling/,Chocolate Ind.,"There are several musical byproducts of the technological revolution: a new widespread accessibility of complex audio software; a sudden wealth of extremely personalized, genre-less music; and a small army of critics, versed in pop-deconstructionism, who busy themselves with constructing new words to contain the sounds that they're purportedly experts on. From 'Intelligent' Dance Music to glitch-hop to whatever-step, critics are quickly establishing a new vernacular of non-descriptive, esoteric terms that act as a shortcut to actually describing the music. I'll be the first to admit that I'm not without sin; I've definitely splooged a few zingers into the critics' cannon of linguistic banality. And when something as indefinite and mercurial as Caural's new Stars on My Ceiling drops, I get that Rumsfeldian itch to deploy the troops; ""hip-hop,"" ""electronica,"" and ""post-rock"" anxiously clutter the front lines, while ""glitch-hop,"" ""downtempo,"" and ""tribalism"" ready themselves to swoop down and pigeonhole Caural into an artistic corner. So, for the sake of maintaining my analytical integrity, I will attempt to refrain from namedropping any micro-genres, and instead focus on providing a naked portrayal of the music contained within Stars on My Ceiling. ""All These Todays Just Melt into Tomorrows,"" the record's opening track, is an accessible and percussive-driven salvo that liberally applies a voice synth, cowbell, and various African percussion instruments. The track is organic, cerebral, and fragmented, like a musical fusion of Salvador Dali and Georgia O'Keeffe, and sets the tone for the rest of the album. Perhaps what's most intriguing about the album is that, while Caural is musically manic, the distinction between sounds isn't based on track numbers. Caural will flip the script in the middle of a song while carrying over various sounds from track to track, a device that denotes his intention that his work be experienced in its entirety. The jazzy keyboards of the first track almost seamlessly fade into a two-tone line that introduces ""Stick to Modeling,"" a track in which fast breaks swell up from a backdrop of backward music and stunted vocal samples. Throughout Stars on My Ceiling, Caural attempts to inject certain aural motifs between the seemingly disparate sounds and samples, creating a monolithic soundscape out of asymmetrical bits and pieces. Juxtaposing sounds is definitely one of the themes here. On ""Camphor,"" Caural places a mellow piano line against a drum line that hardens as the track progresses. Reversing samples so that the bass sounds warped and inside out is another theme: ""Retrospect"" is almost entirely comprised of them, and the listener is left wondering what the track would sound like if it were actually played backwards. But, for the most part, Caural ensures that the album is both interesting and enjoyable, and he rarely sacrifices the listener's pleasure to his various conceits. With its infectious Spanish guitar, laser-like samples, and clear, uncluttered beat, ""Red Sunshine"" is one of the loveliest and most listenable instrumental tracks of the year. And the organic, airy quality of ""Ultra Vivid"" makes it a leading contender for outside nighttime sex jam of the summer. While it doesn't successfully translate into a prosaic form, on ""For Earsnot NYC"" Caural successfully brings the background noises (i.e., record static and recording noise) to the foreground in an attempt to illuminate the beauty of the incidental. While most of the song is comprised of noises that barely register on the EQ, Caural drops sound altogether for much of the last two tracks and uses the breaks and silences to develop a musical narrative. It's an interesting concept, albeit one that feels a bit too forced and indulgent. And self-indulgence isn't the only problem with this album. ""Mink and a Hospital Watercolor"" drifts dangerously close to Air territory, and although I have resisted confining Caural to a certain genre, whatever it is would definitely be prefaced by ""lite."" Another major complaint is that at times Caural seems to be merely dabbling in the various genres that inform Stars, resulting in the equivalent of a micro-genre megastore that carries everything yet specializes in nothing. But while Stars on My Ceiling probably isn't going to impress a hardcore devotee of any one of the genres that Caural briefly appropriates, for those who love highly conceptualized, original music this is a pleasure.","There are several musical byproducts of the technological revolution: a new widespread accessibility of complex audio software; a sudden wealth ...

When it finally rings, you're still pretty sleepy, as you stayed up all evening worried about your first day of school; you and your family have just moved from the bustling streets of Chicago to the quiet town of Rhodes. The other children you've met in this town seem distant and never make eye contact when speaking to one another. This bothers you, but your mother always says to ""take your worries and shove them down deep inside to where they can never ever find their way out,"" so you stretch and head down the stairs, hoping not to be late for first period. As you walk out the front door, you see many of your schoolmates walking in a trance-like state, armed with needles and thread. Now you're really frightened. Do you... A) Go back inside and hide your head under your pillow (go to pg. 41)
B) Ask one of the children to explain the strange goings-on (go to pg. 93) Pg. 41
As you race back inside, you are ambushed by a gang of ninjas who proceed to trounce your ten-year old ass nice and proper. It appears that you're pretty dead. THE END Pg. 93
You race up to the nearest child. ""Hey, what's going on here?"" you inquire timidly. The child turns to you, his head hung low. ""We are following the prophet Sparhawk. He has said that when our town has finished knitting the mystical Winter Blanket, then he and his life-partner Mimi can reunite with the messianic Kramer, lord of the drone, and rule over the earthly Kingdom of Low."" HOLY SHIT! Do you... A) Run off to school and forget about this conversation (go to pg. 12)
B) Continue talking to Culty McJimjones here (go to pg. 25) Pg. 12
You run off to school and forget about the preceding conversation. When lunch time arrives, you open your lunchbox to find it swarming with scorpions. As you try to pick them from your eyes, a gang of ninjas descends from the cafeteria rafters and manhandles your puny adolescent body, which is clearly no match for their brute strength. After you are dead, they use your corpse as a training dummy for their intense games of thumb war. THE END Pg. 25
""Tell me more about this Sparhawk,"" you say, trying to mask your intrigue. ""Well,"" responds the child, eyes darting wildly. He only oversees the production of the Winter Blanket. It's actually the brainchild of this guy Doug Miller. He's a sweet and caring man, and he knows how tough it would be for us grade-schoolers to pay attention to any sudden changes in the structure or dynamics of tha' Blanket, so he keeps the work really simple and repetitive. Nothing too daring or original. We couldn't keep up! And when he speaks, he says things really plaintive so that even we kids can understand. Like yesterday, when he took me aside and whispered, 'Why am I waking up without you by side/ All night I can't sleep with open eyes.'"" ""Hey, he's right! It is hard to sleep with open eyes!"" you realize. ""Yeah!"" responds the child, obviously gaining in excitement. He then looks about nervously and leans toward you. ""But really,"" he stammers out, ""the Winter Blanket is just something to pass the time until Low's next renaissance. Its child-like simplicity, structurally speaking, won't give it much durability in the coming years. Shit, I'm sick of it already."" With two knowing taps on the nose, he walks off into the traffic of dreary-eyed youths filing their way into the schoolhouse. You consider joining them in their uniform march, but think better of it and decide to catch a taxi back to Chicago.

IAO,John Zorn,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab2e13d1975652139b76/1:1/w_160/1636b876.gif,2002-08-01 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8927-iao/,Tzadik,"Evil inspires. From Chuck Berry birthing the ""devil's music,"" to the 70s pyrotechnics of KISS, to the gorily detailed Prince sex of the 1980s, indecency and the notion of complete self-empowerment has driven artists and listeners alike. Beyond the well-known (and usually exaggerated) tales of devilish mischief, there are many examples of black inspiration producing great works of art: Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring,"" Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Anthony Burgess' A Clockwork Orange, and the work of Robert Crumb, just to name a few. Free will's ties to deviance go back a long way, and have apparently been of use to more than just practitioners of the black arts. Experimental music icon John Zorn has been living on the edge of deviance for some time now. In the mid-80s, during his six month sojourns to Japan, repeated exposure to extreme porn and S&M; rubbed off on him-- enough to find a place in his compositions with Naked City and afterwards. He's produced soundtracks for South American gay porn, placed dead bodies and decapitated heads on his CD covers (there's a pentagram on the back of this one), and composed whole albums about deadly poisons. Zorn seems tempted by the dark side, and it often brings out the best in him. IAO is his meditation on evil, specifically concerned with the Beast (the name IAO is Kabbalistically identical to 'Satan'). The liner notes tell me it was partially inspired by cult theorist Aleister Crowley, who spent most of his life practicing and writing about the concept of 'Magick.' As much as I can gather, Magick was the practice of governing and empowering one's sense of free will through Gnostic rituals (often with sexual symbolism) and tarot cards, all tied together by a system of strange symbols and a mythical poem called ""Liber al vel Legis."" Crowley was as subversive a figure as you're likely to find, and it's not hard to see how his esoteric deviance could have inspired Zorn to focus on primal fears and ritualistic lusts. The music of IAO is classic Zorn: dark ambient exoticism, ethnic percussion exercises, hypnotic suspense-film music, thrash, and avant-garde classical. Similar to his recent ""Music for Children"" series, he seems to be loosening the reins on his tradition for branding each project an isolated incident, opting instead to use all of his best colors on one canvas. ""Invocation,"" follows Crowley's ritual model, and its clanging cymbals and use of null space seem to nod to Nurse with Wound's similarly disturbing Homotopy to Marie. A church organ (of all things) opens the track with dissonant, wavering chords, and bells rustle along both sides of the stereo. They give way to a whirling tailwind, and what sounds like someone sharpening a blade. And like a black hole, this implodes slightly, only to supernova into a wall of flies. This may actually be the loudest moment on the album, and two minutes in, it's apparent that Zorn's new album is one of the better records to be affiliated with the black arts (a short list, I know). I won't bring up the backwards-singing choir or voodoo sticks, as I'm sure you'll want to experience the sheer thrill for yourself. ""Sex Magick"" is probably the most straightforward tune here, a 13-minute tribal percussion trance. Again, the act of ritual plays into the program-- where Crowley may have hinted at carnal desires in his individual yoga-like meditations, Zorn goes for hidden jungle rites of sacrifice and ancient fertility. Musically, I'm not sure the idea of these rituals isn't more interesting than the fairly basic groove set up by percussionists Cyro Baptista and Jim Pugliese, but with this music, imagery is everything. ""Sacred Rites of the Left-Hand Path"" uses repetitive rhythmic patterns again to describe the ritual, but instead of heavy percussion, Zorn uses understated electric and acoustic pianos, synth, and scattered hand drums. The prevailing atmosphere is not unlike classic Tangerine Dream (or even ""Everything in Its Right Place""-style Radiohead), but the strange acoustic interruptions emphasize the music's natural inspirations. ""Leviathan"" features Mike Patton on lead, er, screaming, and is arguably the best thrash-influenced track in Zorn's entire catalog. The chaotic percussion (which eventually inverts to being played backwards mid-song-- Zorn is getting better at using the studio as an instrument) and completely unrestrained guitars produce a sound that wouldn't be out of place on a black metal album. Even further out is ""Lucifer Rising,"" which features an a capella female choir. The music is almost soothing, though dissonant, as the circular melody pushes higher and higher. However, what stands out is the sickly, desperately tempting whispers from the soloist. I can't quite make out what she's saying, but it sounds like one part seductive invitation, another part surreal plea for torture. As I mentioned, IAO falls squarely in line with Zorn's recent projects, wherein he seems interested in integrating many of the elements experimented with over the past twenty years into a single statement. Like 2001's Songs from the Hermetic Theater, and going back to 90s releases such as Kristallnacht and Duras:Duchamp, this record is an example of how rampant eclecticism can lead to something more than just a mishmash of styles. Whatever the inspiration for IAO, the results are often so engaging (and, yes, sometimes scary) that it's hard to question Zorn's motives. Go ahead, come in.","Evil inspires.

When this occurs, one is left with one of the following options: Offer foggy synopsis of what the record sounds like and derisively dismiss it for its perceived inability to ""rock."" Write a long-winded personal anecdote about something irrelevant like loss of virginity, high school, or that time I stole a bodice ripper from the local drug store, and try to abstractly relate that to feeling produced by said album. Describe the music by negative comparison (e.g. ""Well, it's not garage rock."") Do some research, and offer drinks to local college radio station DJ who likes this kind of stuff in exchange for his informed opinion, then try to cultivate some appreciation for the music so as to not look like a total moron. The trickiness of this dilemma is only exacerbated by Pitchfork's semi-official stance on music in this vein. You need only note that the Gas album Pop, a record I found equally mystifying and intimidating, made it onto the site's list of the 20 best records of 2000. So I made the choice any self-respecting coward would and went for option four. Now that all my cards are on the table here, let's trudge onward. Chris Smith is Australian. He is/was a singer/songwriter. Everything on Map Ends has been previously released on vinyl in Australia, but nowhere else, and never before on CD. All Music Guide (apparently operating under an ironic reversal of option #3, see above) mysteriously identifies him as ""power-pop"" and further notes that ""Map Ends will give audiences a good idea of his power-pop sound."" Map Ends is sort of a lush, ambient drone-- so much of a drone that I had an incredibly hard time following typical protocol and listening to it straight through without pause the first time I heard it. Every now and then, white noise, wind, and muffled voices of background radio are broken with vague instrumentation-- usually xylophones or toy pianos. Some of the songs, like the back-to-back ""Fake Hand"" and ""Replacement,"" have moments of shoegazer-like feedback and resonant layering. Fortunately for the short-attention-span'd, four of these tracks are less than six minutes long. The aforementioned ""Replacement"" (which I liked) weighed in at just over twelve minutes long, could have been edited to roughly half of its length without losing too much of its effect. And the ""Captain, This Is It"" (which, to me, sounds like hearing my old upstairs neighbors run the vacuum cleaner on the hardwood floor), with its 18+ minute runtime, helps to underscore a theory I have regarding self-indulgence and songs involving the word ""Captain."" It should be noted that my DJ friend/consultant disagrees with me, citing ""Captain, This Is It"" as among the album's high points. He also liked ""Brazil,"" which I think sounds like the distant interstate from my backyard lightly amplified, but which he found appealingly scary. I think what's done here is done well, and I respect the opinions of those whose advice I have taken while listening to this album. It's a stretch for me to recommend anything for which ""extended, rhythmless drone"" serves as a positive description, but those who like this sort of thing should likely have a go of it. I, in the meantime, will go about my business in unsophisticated bliss. Stay tuned for next week when I pretend to really amped up about listening to John Cage.","In the course of a Pitchfork writer's life, one is occasionally called on to review something that falls somewhat ...

Seasons,Landing,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc945e6ef95969322e8f/1:1/w_160/7a6faa45.jpg,2002-08-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4669-seasons/,Ba Da Bing,"I had a small epiphany last week. On a Monday morning I was walking the two blocks to catch the bus to work. It was raining hard, I was trudging along under my umbrella, and it felt great. It's the driest year this area has had in many years, and I realized while walking that I hadn't used an umbrella even once in six months or more. On my discman was the new record by Connecticut's Landing, a loose concept album about cycles and weather called Seasons. The song playing was ""Encircled (Through Falling Leaves)."" In the second stanza of ""Encircled,"" the words ""rain... comes... falling... down..."" are sung in a whisper next to the wet, resonant picking of an acoustic guitar. The only thing that could have possibly sounded better at that moment would have been The Clientele, but they wouldn't have had the element of surprise because every damn song of theirs is about the rain. Landing caught me off guard and made me smile to myself on a dark, wet morning. It's dry again now. I'm listening to Landing in the air-conditioned comfort of my living room, and something is missing. Of course, Seasons isn't having the chill-inducing effect it did when the weather seemed orchestrated for the theme, but in truth, I just don't like this album as much as either Oceanless or the Centrefuge EP. To the band's credit, they're stretching out on Seasons and trying things only hinted at before. Where Oceanless was comprised of lengthy, mindbending excursions into shoegaze psychedelia, on Seasons, Landing become a song-oriented band, crafting comparatively short, spare tunes that showcase the vocals of husband-and-wife co-leaders Aaron and Adrienne Snow. Befitting the music, Mr. and Mrs. Snow sing in hushed whispers, where melodies are given gentle prodding and encouragement rather than being shoved into the cold world on their own. The aforementioned ""Encircled"" is unusual for the record in how folky it sounds, with a plucked acoustic and vocals high in the mix. It actually has something of a 70s singer/songwriter vibe to it, suggesting something quiet by Cat Stevens. I prefer this acoustic tunefulness to the indie slowcore of ""Clarke Street,"" where Landing clearly strive for Low territory, but unfortunately lack the singing ability required of something so clear and direct. I much prefer the longer, more experimental tracks on Seasons to the more conventional songs. ""First Snow"" is by far my favorite, a slowly building wall of sound with tufts of guitar distortion gathering like white flakes in a pile of dead leaves. It's a song without verse or chorus featuring the pretty sound of Adrienne and Aaron harmonizing together, and it reminds me of something from Piano Magic's Low Birth Weight shorn of dark and gloomy edges. Also interesting is ""Ruins of the Morning (So Cold),"" which starts in a drifting, amorphous cloud of distortion, turns into a chiming, raga-like drone, and then transforms into a minimal slowcore track that seems like a completely different song, all in the span of eight minutes. ""Blue Sky Away"" closes the album on an up note, with an open, sunny vibe that feels looser and more relaxed than anything preceding it. Landing have serious gifts with mood and texture and the move toward song structures is an interesting one, but at this point, their songwriting chops don't measure up to their way with sound. Perhaps this effort, coming relatively quickly after Oceanless and their Surface of Eceon project with Adam Forkner of Yume Bitsu, was just a bit rushed.","I had a small epiphany last week.

After Mathematics,Kleenexgirlwonder,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbd7ea9e61561daa7328/1:1/w_160/fb9556de.gif,2002-07-31 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4490-after-mathematics/,March,"Let's not belabor the point: After Mathematics is not a great record; it's not even a good record. Graham Smith (aka Kleenexgirlwonder) the once lauded lo-fi wunderkind, whose terrific early albums won him comparisons to Robert Pollard and charges of egoism usually reserved for artists twice his age, may have finally reached a point so low on the totem pole of pop relevancy that even the fifteen or so fans who kept the faith after the debacle that was the double-disc disaster The Smith Album are scratching their heads and wondering if it's too late to revise their opinion on the whole of Bob Pollard's solo career. These people need something to distract them from the deafening thud of Graham Smith's career hitting rock bottom. The sound of After Mathematics could be described as Beck meets the Barenaked Ladies in gladiatorial combat over the muted cries of a thousand starry-eyed adolescents who-- having found their grand artistic vision (""Hey, wouldn't it be cool to four-track some power-pop songs and mix them up with R&B; thievery and bad hip-hop beats? No?"") co-opted by Mr. Smith-- have locked themselves in their suburban basements to consider such philosophical ponderances as, ""Could old-school pop/punk become the new ironic obsession for the jaded metropolitan hipster?"" Like Smith's longtime habit of scribbling self-referential lyrics and liner notes, it's hard to determine where the joke ends on After Mathematics. I tend to assume the lyrics to ""Why I Write Such Good Songs"" (""No one can sing like me/ No one can play the guitar like me/ No one says the things I say/ And no one else ever feels this way"") are a matter of tongue-in-cheek self-satire, but is its musical similarity to Sugar Ray (replicated again on ""I Am a Serving Wench at a Themed Restaurant"") also part of the punchline? And what of the affected rapping throughout ""The Pathetic Fallacy"" and the (parodied?) gangster rap conclusion of the otherwise-ripe-for-a-car-commercial instrumental ""Intentional Fallacy""? If it's all one big gag, Smith ought to ask himself if he's content to be better remembered for his moronic novelty than for the infectious pop songwriting of his past. What hurts most is, Smith hasn't even lost his knack for insufferably catchy melodies. The sugary power-pop of ""Amelia"" is almost buoyant enough to stand the weight of its wordplay (""Amelia/ Ameliorate me."") Likewise, the punchy, if typical, concluding track ""Fitzcarraldo"" provides a brief return to the earlier and more palatable days of Ponyoak. But these lukewarm conciliatory attempts hardly make up for all the computerized backing vocals (an unfortunate leftover from The Smith Album) or the sketchy simulations of platinum hip-hop. Were I so inclined, I suppose I could muster some self-righteous anger at the overall tone of After Mathematics. Instead I'll suffice to say that what Smith needs is to drive into the city, park the car in the heart of Cabrini-Green, blast this disc out his trunk, and learn firsthand what thug life is all about.","Let's not belabor the point: After Mathematics is not a great record; it's not even a good record ...

I'm Lonely (And I Love It) EP,Future Bible Heroes,by: Meg Zamula,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be6413d197565213b716/1:1/w_160/cb90a223.jpg,2002-07-31 05:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3252-im-lonely-and-i-love-it-ep/,Merge,"At the college radio station where I work, there are a few types who show up at every open house. There's the kid who wants to do an all-Phish show, but who, in the interest of keeping things fresh, would consider mixing in some Moe. He's often followed by the alarmingly socially inept kids who pitch ""a 'Loveline'-type show"", overlooking the fact that even radio divas like myself are lucky to get five calls on a 10-watt station. There's the white rapper who cries when he doesn't make the cut (actually, this is the same guy every semester). And always, always, there are freshman girls who want to do an 80s show. There are reasons these girls, enthusiastic as they most certainly are, do not get radio shows. Not least amongst these reasons is that the local adult contemporary station does a more than adequate job of covering this era. At least, that's what we tell them. The real reason is that no one wants to be subjected to Men Without Hats again. It's difficult to write a meaningful synth-pop song-- I've never done it (and god knows I've tried), but also, it's just that rare to hear one. The genre lends itself to disposability. But while Herculean, it's certainly not an impossible task, and Stephin Merritt, who contributes lyrics and vocals to the Future Bible Heroes, has probably written a good percentage of the 90s' most compelling ones. On the Magnetic Fields' excellent 1993 album, Holiday, Merritt primarily depended on synth to back his eternally deadpan vocals. Even the record's mid-fi production values couldn't blunt the impact of his songwriting. But Future Bible Heroes frontman Chris Ewen just isn't a Merritt-caliber composer, and this EP suffers in contrast to even Merritt's b-sides. In 1997, when the Future Bible Heroes' debut album was released, it was a treat. Those were less prolific days for Merritt, and any output was anxiously anticipated. Now, however, with Magnetic Fields fans still discovering new favorites among last year's epic 69 Love Songs, this EP is disappointing. Having explored Merritt's many musical fascinations-- 69 Love Songs found him taking on John Cage, the war ballad, and Celtic music, amongst other genres rarely explored by pop artists-- it's difficult to return to the Future Bible Heroes' limited musical worldview. The title track, a manic ode to break-ups, features Merritt's best lyrical effort here, offering gems like, ""I'm lonely as Mount Everest and probably as high/ It's time to buy the records you would never let me buy."" ""My Blue Hawaii"" is one of Ewen's more compelling compositions, a near-hysterical combination of drum machines, whirs, clicks and sirens. Merritt, unfortunately, is at his laziest on the song, listing every tropical association that occurs to him. Elsewhere, ""Caf Hong Kong"" is too reminiscent of my least favorite Magnetic Fields song ever (""Tokyo A Go-Go"") for me to find any enjoyment in it, and here, as well as on ""Good Thing I Don't Have Any Feelings"", the band strays far too close to Human League territory. And it doesn't bode well for I'm Lonely that its strongest track is a remix of ""Hopeless"", a song that saw release on the Future Bible Heroes' 1997 full-length, Memories of Love. Still, the song's combination of morbid lyrics and bleepy, danceable pop proves that Merritt and Ewen do have their inspired collaborative moments. Chris Ewen writes some fun, fairly interesting electro-pop, but it's his ties to Stephin Merritt that makes this a salable record. The Magnetic Fields association guarantees an audience for the Future Bible Heroes, and a place for them on college radio. Much like the spongecake recipe in I'm Lonely's liner notes, Ewen's music is sugary and weightless; Merritt adds the ""favorite filling"" which makes it unique. In the end, though, the EP just isn't substantial enough to join the exclusive ranks of memorable synth-pop records.","At the college radio station where I work, there are a few types who show up at every open house ...

In the Fishtank (with Telefunk),Willard Grant Conspiracy,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa38ea9e61561daa5b74/1:1/w_160/1843f036.gif,2002-07-31 05:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8684-in-the-fishtank-with-telefunk/,Konkurrent,"You can do things in Holland that you could never do elsewhere. Many people travel thousands of miles to enjoy those illicit splendors, like legal drugs, prostitutes, and assorted other vices. And over the past few years, Amsterdam-based indie label Konkurrent has added to this list of otherwise unavailable opportunities with its In the Fishtank series. The series, now in its eighth installment, offers relatively popular indie acts the opportunity to drop by Amsterdam for two days and record anything they choose. Some go into the studio alone, like June of 44; others go in pairs, like Tortoise + the Ex, and Low + Dirty Three. Rarely do the bands practice, and unfortunately, it generally shows, resulting in albums that are usually better than average but far from exceptional. The latest in the series, the Willard Grant Conspiracy + Telefunk, follows suit in its mediocrity. The Willard Grant Conspiracy is well-known for country-folk acoustic balladry, fronted by the dour baritone of lead conspirator Robert Fisher. In theory, Fisher's authentic, intimate delivery would lend itself compellingly to collaboration with a darker, electronically minded group like Telefunk. Yet when put to the test, this theory proves false. What's documented here is a short six track album of traditional covers, a few of which are good, and the others, which are somewhat difficult to endure. The spacious opener, ""Twistification,"" sounds like the Willard Grant Conspiracy + the Willard Grant Conspiracy. Telefunk? Undetectable. This is a running theme throughout the disc, as some tracks simply sound like WGC, and others simply like Telefunk with a Robert Fisher cameo. Except for ""Cuckoo,"" where a funky double-bassline gets peppered with a folky blend of strings, banjo and background wailing, the bands don't seem to be working together that well. What I'm saying is, they missed that ""Sesame Street"" covering cooperation. Of course, only a couple songs are dreadfully bad, but for these, 'bad' as an adjective fails to evoke the full experience, but suffice to say that the horror always lies in the vocals. One of these more crap moments comes with ""Grun Grun Grun,"" which features Fisher and the Telefunk crew chanting the names of colors back and forth to one another in two languages for pretty much the duration of the track. Whoever produced it also found the time and energy to give it Gregorian overtones. As anyone who's ever listened to Enigma knows, this can only be properly executed with the saccharine pretentiery of a whispery French chick and that one ethnic instrument that always manages to find its way into Neutrogena commercials. (Follow-up hit must prominently feature the senilic wail of a Polio-stricken retiree pretending to be Native American.) Elsewhere, ""Just a Little Rain,"" is by far the worst song I have heard all year, and that includes ""Nod Ya Head (Black Suits Comin')."" It's hard to nail down exactly how they fucked up so royally with this track, but the crucial misstep seems to come with the totally non-European, faux-West Indian accent turning ""what have they done to the rain"" into ""what have dey done to de rain?"" I'm sorry I had to write that, but imagine what it was like having to listen to it. The record recovers a bit with the closing track, an adequate-enough little number titled ""Dig a Hole in the Meadow."" Again, Telefunk have retreated to the background here, perhaps content with the damage they've already wrought. Beyond that, I don't know what you want me to say about the Willard Grant Conspiracy + Telefunk's In the Fishtank. Uh, don't buy it?","You can do things in Holland that you could never do elsewhere.

Specifics,Midwest Product,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c46569fc7814a47cd88f/1:1/w_160/9d592115.gif,2002-07-31 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5276-specifics/,Ghostly,"Thank goodness for the In Betweeners. For all us old foges still wary of this newfangled 'electronic music,' it's nice to have a few bands here and there to hold our hand while we wade into the shallow end with our water wings on. To lead those of us with terminal rockism towards the flickering LCD monitor glow, it's necessary to have a few artists that will meet us halfway, mixing in safe, comfortable, 'actual' instruments to make us feel at home before hitting us with the subliminal digital trickery. Which is where a band like Midwest Product comes in: one of those acts that's not a rock band, not yet an electronic act. One peek at the liner notes says all you need to know, as all three cats listed are right-slash utilitymen covering both an old-fashioned musicmaker (guitar, bass, drums) and the willfully mysterious task of ""electronics."" What that information translates to is a solid base of organic drums and bass guitar with a walk-in closet's worth of keyboard gizmos playing hopscotch over the top and through the holes. Sure, it's not an entirely groundbreaking formula, but I rather enjoy how Midwest Product falls smack dab in the middle between the rock and electronic leagues. With their predominantly instrumental arrangements and now-it's-live/now-it's-Memorex drums, the more recent or remixed work of Tortoise springs to mind, albeit with less vibra-phoniness smoothing out the rocky edges. A varied effort, Specifics swings from the shimmery guitar atmospherics of ""Reminder"" with its restrained electronic twinklings and machine buzzes, to the almost entirely circuit-based ""Alternator,"" a twilight exploration of microhouse's sweeps and clicks. But it's the in-between stuff that hits harder; songs like ""Still Love in the Midwest"" and ""Vitamin"" that skillfully straddle genre boundaries. Most strikingly, the three boys of Midwest Product know that computers still can't replicate the deep groove of a bonafide rhythm section, and the bass of Drew Schmeiding and drums of Chad Pratt create a solid continuity for the knob-twiddling antics of Mr. Ben Mullins. Throughout the album, Mullins' drum loops and lower-end synthesizers do a nice happy frolic with the output of his fellow band members, generally avoiding the crowded-elevator toe-stepping that all too often occurs from these sort of man/computer collabs. A warning, though: due in part to its instrumental nature, Specifics might not quite have the goods to win over the guitar loyalist crowd, as the album's fifty minutes have the usual electronic album side effect of not planting enough head-sticking melodies to prevent its fading into background music for casual listeners. Even the dark synth-pop of ""Pigeons,"" the one vocal-fortified track here, isn't quite jingle material and disappointingly resorts to the tired vocoder trick, a device that hasn't been scary since Superman III and hasn't been kitschy cool since Moon Safari. Recording for Michigan-based electronic label Ghostly International isn't going to help win over the rock hordes either, as Midwest Product will most likely be marketed as six-string escapism for the laptop crowd, rather than vice versa. But Ghostly International is also based out of the woody landscapes of suburban Detroit-- though, between us, don't tell Ann Arbor I called it a Detroit suburb-- and the moniker Midwest Product is more than just a (um, not especially) catchy name. For Detroit, with its Rock City status and decidedly retro 'automobile' industry, might just be the right place for a successful merging of the electronic with the electric, from which Middle America can be gently nudged towards a Tron-like future. To appeal to Joe Midwest, you've gotta have a backbeat that rattles the hatchback, and by providing such a feature alongside their electronic musings, Midwest Product has downright Moses potential.","Thank goodness for the In Betweeners.

The Sounds of the Sounds of Science,Yo La Tengo,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaf813d1975652139b1f/1:1/w_160/25d4cb43.gif,2002-07-31 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8865-the-sounds-of-the-sounds-of-science/,Egon,"Who even cares about the ocean anymore? Or the beach, for that matter? If I want to deal with dead fish and syringes I'll take my dad to the supermarket (he has a problem). And that doesn't even address all those alien-style face-huggery things that call the water their home. At least on land animals can be relied upon to have things like eyes; half the crap in the briny deep hasn't even discovered the joys of internal organs. Apparently, though, there are at least a few people who enjoy the ocean-- the French have been particularly enamored of it for several years now, sparking a long tradition of strange and disturbing films documenting the behavior of its contents. Jacques Cousteau may have gotten all the glory on that front, but Jean Painleve had more art in a single reel of his work than Cousteau had in his whole pruny body. Declaring that ""science is fiction,"" Painleve wasn't content to tamely document the exploits of octopi ""doing it"" as were so many of his contemporaries, preferring instead to arrange his films to not only be enlightening, but entertaining as well (he was hung up on invertebrate intimacy, too-- they all were-- but he was funnier about it). Painleve ventured nearer to his subjects than scientific interest would dictate, artificially imbuing them with distinctly human characteristics like rage and sexuality through the careful editing and scoring of his films. It didn't win him any points with the scientists, but the French surrealists invited him to all their picnics. Flash forward to April 2001, the San Francisco Film Festival: eight of Painleve's most famous shorts (films, that is) are scheduled to be displayed, and Yo La Tengo is asked to write and perform a live score. Long story short, history is born. In case you missed it, don't fret-- your friends in Yo La Tengo have gone to great lengths in the studio to bring you The Sounds of the Sounds of Science, and you ought to thank them. It's not a throwback to their earlier scattershot aesthetics, but that's obvious (it's a score for underwater documentaries, after all), and anyone who's well-versed with the dream-inspiring tunes from And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out should have no trouble submerging themselves within these soothing aural vignettes. Each track was written to accompany a specific piece of Painleve's work, and Yo la Tengo's level of success ranges from impressive to downright incredible. For the few of these films that I've been fortunate enough to see, the Hoboken three captured the feel of each short damn near perfectly, and crafted songs so moving and evocative for the remainder that by the end of the album I felt as though I'd seen them all. Even when the album 'picks up,' it still never strays far from a relaxed exploration of the lush organics they're able to draw from their standard rock setup, aided here by assorted percussive oddities (vibraphones, chimes, etc). As calm as their most recent work has been, a more natural touchstone for The Sounds of the Sounds of Science is the Future Sound of London's Lifeforms. Some ambient music seems to want nothing more than to be the next employee pick at Natural Wonders or some other ridiculous hippy emporium, but the best of this genre isn't willing to fade into the wasteland of new-age background music. Brilliance along the lines of Aphex Twin's Selected Ambient Works II isn't so passive-- listening creates a sense of revelation, completely enfolding the listener in its wet, glowy womb. The Sounds of the Sounds of Science, over the course of 77 minutes, manages to do that. In fact, within the realm of organic ambient, Yo La Tengo may even have an advantage over a few of the reigning techno acts. If the techno-organic creatures of Lifeforms come from Mars, Yo La Tengo's are distinctly Earthbound in keeping with the subject matter of these documentaries, owing mainly to the human qualities of the sprawling, emotive performance. Each song is an epic, sometimes changing course two or more times before concluding. ""The Sea Horse"" chronicles the male sea horse giving birth in dramatic fashion; ""How Jellyfishes are Born"" illustrates the diversity among jellyfishes, um, giving birth; and for a change of pace, ""The Love Life of the Octopus"" is about birth preliminaries (I promised you octopus sex). Naturally, Yo La Tengo doesn't let the thematic similarity stifle them-- each cut is vibrant and unique, capturing its scene with colorful tonality. ""Shrimp Stories"" may be the album's single fault. Some of Yo La Tengo's famous diversity shows up in this free-jazz inspired standout, but for this record's purposes it just seems out of place. Mainly, The Sounds of the Sounds of Science is a document of new environments being unveiled, and ""Shrimp Stories"" seems painfully mundane in contrast. It's solid, and does well at breaking the pace, but isn't exactly compelling. But this lone misstep aside, the album is remarkably powerful, showing not only that Yo La Tengo are fully capable of penning elaborate film scores, but that their years have earned them a unique adeptness at communicating real emotion, human and otherwise, with conventional instrumentation. Animal porn never sounded so good.","Who even cares about the ocean anymore? Or the beach, for that matter? If I want to deal with dead ...

Seed to Sun,Boom Bip,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a346b1335d7bf16986ca/1:1/w_160/a6151777.jpg,2002-07-30 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/858-seed-to-sun/,Lex,"Boom Bip's Seed to Sun isn't hip-hop. Hip-hop is dirty, concrete, in-your-face visceral, and reflective of an on-going public discourse. Seed to Sun, which is a mostly instrumental offering, is tightly enclosed and intensely internal; the sound doesn't attempt to capture the public zeitgeist, instead preferring to meander through a cryptic inner space in search of slight, fleeting emotions and repressed memories. At its best, it works as a soundtrack to the prolonged moments of silence that accompany technological isolation. Yet this isn't another dry, droid-like testament to the dystopia of post-millennial life. Its focus is generally more human than it is mechanical, and it's more tenderly emotive than it is dryly disjointed. Although Seed to Sun is a very personal affair, the music is identifiably derivative. Boom Bip (aka Bryan Hollon) engages in what seems like incessant genre-hopping; suburban hip-hop, wankish laptop conceptualism, and cinematic post-rock are all indiscriminately plucked from Boom Bip's musical milieus and given generous footing on this record. Still, Hollon maintains a consistency throughout by constantly reinforcing his musical motifs. Looped, barely suppressed voices can be heard throughout, and a high-pitch ringing sound is never far off, acting as a musical highwire that the various breakbeats and synth lines cling to. Thematically, the album oscillates between three different moods: the intricate melancholy of monotony; the broad sweeping attempts to transcend the clutter; and what is perhaps the triumphant failure of the warring tensions: when Hollon abandons his attempts at transcendence and embraces the playful possibilities that flutter around the edges of the techno wasteland. Seed to Sun works best when it's either quirkily repetitive or resigning itself to funky experimentation. When it attempts to be anthemic and triumphant, it falls flat. ""Roads Must Rule,"" which kicks off the album, contains a looping violin sample that comes across as forced, clich√©d, and more than a little similar to disposable soundtrack music that denotes a victorious climax. The circus music quality of ""Newly Weds"" wouldn't feel out of place as one of the brief musical interludes on Tom Waits' Swordfishtrombones, while ""U R Here,"" which follows ""Newly Weds,"" resembles M√∫m, except with a juicier hip-hop beat. The static and transposed conversations of ""Pulse All Over"" are effective if a bit incidental. The discordant vibe carries itself through the first minute of the next track, ""Awaiting an Accident,"" before giving way to a smoky, almost gothic beat that sounds something like a Depeche Mode remix. Hollon also offers a couple of vocal tracks which pop up sporadically throughout the album. ""The Unthinkable,"" which features spoken-word artist Buck 65, boasts an ironically bouncy beat. ""No matter what, I still can't sleep/ Everywhere I still see ghost,"" Buck 65 sings in the chorus, and the song feels like a half-awake recitation of random, eerie suburban imagery. The seemingly unrelated scenes that Buck 65 conjures are both mundane and magical, which can be said to inform Boom Bip's style in general. By extracting the minor aural nuances of everyday life and tinkering with them just enough to slightly skewer their context, Boom Bip conjures the artful from the mechanical like some wired snake charmer. At his best, he taps into the internal logic that guides the random beeps and squeaks that generally slide beneath our immediate consciousness. But when his hand is too strong, and he attempts to place the noises within a more traditional song structure, it's an embarrassing failure. Still, this is experimental music, and occasional failures can be forgiven.","Boom Bip's Seed to Sun isn't hip-hop. Hip-hop is dirty, concrete, in-your-face visceral, and\n\ reflective of an ...

Think of it as simply addressing her target audience. Fortunately, with Slumber, Miss McCall has succeeded in crafting an album of remarkable strength, sorrow, and diversity, all while maintaining her peculiar brand of eerily melodic atmospherics.

If you are, though, don't rule it out as the soundtrack for an absinthe overdose. Okay, so I'm exaggerating slightly. Slumber isn't truly depressing; it's just moody and evocative. McCall's debut highlighted her remarkable ability to lead the listener through deep sojourns across dusty sonic backroads, distantly guided by the gloomy, western light of Mazzy Star. The self-titled debut was a compelling bit of theater, but in the end, McCall's gloom-and-doom folk started to wear itself out, if only out of consistency which bordered on homogeneity. Slumber, though, manages to take the sounds of the Cowboy Junkies at their most sober and subdued and greatly expand upon them-- the flourishes of varied instrumentation and tone completely rejuvenate McCall's carefully crafted ballads. Airy strings, errant electronic tones, and what may or may not be a tuba (no promises) on ""Carolina's Crown"" work wonders to deepen this album's sound. From the outset, ""Eyes Aglow"" makes it clear that Jana won't be satisfied by merely producing dulcet melodies (even though she later proves on several tracks that she's more than up to the task); she presents the accompaniment of awkward, slightly dissonant synthetic notes that don't quite fit. It challenges the listener immediately, if only subtly-- her dusky, heartfelt vocals supported by tones which just aren't quite right. It's distracting, but only for a moment, and once the strangeness is reconciled, it's truly gripping. The desire to confront the listener continues with the horns on ""Carolina's Crown"" and the screeching electronics behind ""Bloodlines,"" and proceeds to recur throughout. In rare instances, it does more harm than good by putting too much distance between the music and the listener, but it's ambitious nonetheless. Thematically, Slumber doesn't stray far from the hangman's noose, and doomsday lyrics along the lines of, ""Today is a brand new day/ Waiting for the sun to die/ Inside your mind,"" lose their impact after six or seven different configurations. More than once, McCall steers the album dangerously close to ambient darkwave, a la Lycia, when these vocals are coupled with Slumber's most plodding, aimless cuts. Still, that's not necessarily a bad thing in small doses, and McCall does an enviable job of pacing the album to prevent it from falling into the trap of her debut. There's a lot of minute variety present, and she never goes too far into a dismal stretch without providing at least a glimmer of light at the end of a .45 caliber barrel. Some of the most transcendent moments come from the gorgeous, uplifting strings at the close of ""Birthday,"" the soothing strings of ""Bloodlines"" which offset the electronic background wailing, and the electric guitar straight out of The Phantom of the Opera on ""Echoes"" which is followed briefly by a surge of cascading synths, horns, and vocal harmonies. And naturally, the thread that binds this darkling web of songs together is the voice of McCall herself. Most of the album is characterized by a sultry half-whisper or lullaby, which goes a long way towards selling the creepy imagery she waxes on about. Occasionally, she jumps to a higher register (""Clary"") just to indicate range (and she has plenty), but no matter what, her vocals are always the strongest asset. Which is lucky for her, since it's tough to be a singer/songwriter if you can't fit your voice to your music-- especially when that music is brooding, spacious gothic-tinged folk.","Quick, wrap a towel around your wrists!

The Pupils,The Pupils,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a15aea9e61561daa479f/1:1/w_160/214aafed.jpg,2002-07-30 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6514-the-pupils/,Dischord,"Can somebody please give me an exact date as to when the turbid relationship between my peers, armed with their indie ethics, and corporate America cooled and reshaped itself into a symbiotic coupling? When I fell asleep in 1991, Neil Young was preaching the evils of product placement and even Pat Boone was wore leather. Now, I wake up in the new millennium to a media who 'nurtures and exposes' the artists it once worked so hard to oppress while asking for 'little in return.' Granted, some commercial pairings can be traced back to a logical and rational mind, as in the case of the Shins and their donation of ""New Slang"" to McDonalds. But had I known that drinking MGD would make me as depressed as Bill Callahan, I'd have opted for the party ambience of your average Coors commercial. Seriously... I could've learned to tolerate the occasional 'crunching blues riff.' Unfortunately, our faceless corporate antagonists have saved their most horrendous act of sacrilege for last, as earlier this month General Mills unveiled their newest commercial, which features an animated Stephen Malkmus gliding gracefully down a rainbow shat by a clearly nerve-addled rabbit singing ""Trix are everything to me."" Luckily, Ian McKaye saw this coming some fifteen years before the fact. Out of sheer desperation he founded his independent record label, Dischord, boasting a stable of artists dedicated to satiating that whining Marxist in each of us. Over the years, Dischord has been a haven for acts who are as well versed in anti-capitalist rhetoric as they are in music theory, leaving the label with only one real problem: selling records. You see, when you release a consistent output of music created by artists who are hell-bent on never selling out, you sometimes release product that consciously sounds like crap for the sake of not being commercially viable. That's right, Pupils... stick to The Man. On their eponymous debut, Daniel Higgs and Asa Osbourne run the gamut of your typical two-guitar and drum machine group. Truth be told, to cite this as rationalization for making such a plodding and disingenuous album as The Pupils ignores the archetypal work of Timbuk3 (admit it, you still own Greetings From...). If anything, The Pupils are consistently unremarkable. The whole disc plays like the White Stripes covered by a small geriatric community, afraid or unaware of how to change tempo with a drum machine. Sounds like a novelty worthy of Langley School's fame! Having an established musical precedent to contend with can only hinder the critical reception of a side project and, despite the fact that Osbourne and Higgs have only managed to break new ground for mediocrity in their day job as Lungfish, the album sorely misses the sophisticated dynamics and occasionally evocative lyrical content of The Unanimous Hour or Pass and Stow. Rather, we get a litany of muddied social observations (""All the People"") and a few psilocybin-induced meanderings (""The Mind is a Hole in the Body,"" ""I Will Remain Human for Another Day""). If this album truly is, as the lyrics suggest, the product of a few nights of inebriated excess, I strongly urge The Pupils to enter a 12-step program. That way, when they finally reach step nine and ""make direct amends to all persons they've harmed, except when to do so would injure them or others,"" I might get an apology for having to write about this crap.","Can somebody please give me an exact date as to when the turbid relationship between my peers, armed with their ...

What Was Me,Calvin Johnson,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba109d034d5c69bf5389/1:1/w_160/318a83df.jpg,2002-07-30 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4277-what-was-me/,K,"When you first hear this album, you'll be transported into the Martin Sheen role in Apocalypse Calvin, surrounded by affable brass and a CIA spook at a meeting so classified it doesn't even exist. A young Harrison Ford will be playing this album's a capella paean to dispassionate mobility, ""Nothing to Hold Us Here,"" on a reel-to-reel, sweating and dreaming of making out with Kate Capshaw years later in Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. When the album finishes, the older guy across the table from you will utter some you-had-to-be-there blarney about the human heart and some vicissitudes he noticed it had. Then he'll say, ""We think it is quite clear that Calvin Johnson has... gone insane,"" an assessment you'll be obliged to affirm. Then you will be told that you should ""terminate his command... with extreme prejudice,"" and then there's some strippers in a helicopter, and then Larry Fishburne dies, etc etc. During all the jinx on the boat, you'll read Calvin's dossier and sustain an intriguing inner dialogue: ""This guy was in Beat Happening back in the day. He's a beacon of the unpindownable punk spirit. He's seminal. He opened for Black Flag. He's got the last chapter in Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981-1991. He launched the Halo Benders and Dub Narcotic Sound System. Criminy-shanks, man, DubNarcSS released 'Booty Run,' as randily pragmatic a seven-inch to come out on this planet. Johnson's an institution, like marriage and Astroglide. His fingerprints pock the legacies of a stable including artists as diverse as Beck and Modest Mouse. He has his own respected label. So why the hell would he go back into the fray, alone, with just an acoustic guitar and his acquired-taste throatations?"" When you arrive at Johnson's bizarre Olympia compound, you'll find a zonked Phil Elvrum waving his hands around, welcoming you, calming but also alarming you, explaining that he was Calvin's 'engineer,' though he sounds more like a hagiographer. He will compare Calvin to poets and legends, and shudder when extolling the debilitating oomph of Calvin's voice. When you finally meet Calvin, he'll have been expecting you. He knew you were sent to nix him. In fact, he'd already started marketing his new album as 'posthumous.' He will sit in the dark, rubbing his head and explaining to you via a 4\xBD-minute (ahem) a capella song, how ""The Past Comes Back to Haunt."" By Calvin's side are the mysterious women Mirah and the Gossip's Beth Ditto. They join him in the also (cough) a capella ""Ode to St. Valentine"" and ""Lightnin Rod for Jesus,"" respectively, which are gorgeous and grating, respectively. Hi! Thanks for reading! You know, we've had a lot of fun here today, but sometimes a feller ort to shoot straight: the above was an attempt to disqualify myself from having to deduct whether or not this album is an achievement or embarrassment. I can't figure it out. The album sounds as tossed-off as it does deliberate. The songs are as preposterously conceived as they are straightforwardly delivered, as jokey as they are sincere. Did you catch my drift re: the perplexing amount of a capella stuff? Even as a fan of ""the voice,"" I can't wholeheartedly recommend that you purchase this disc, which at points suggests that Johnson is eager to join Irwin Chusid's freak collection and become, like Daniel Johnston, someone whose work is better when covered (which is as good a tangent as any on which to propose that the seeds of the greatest Chris Isaak or Anonymous Crooner album ever are resting here). But see: one point on this here CD, which is largely a 'love' project, provides a satisfying bellow of desire reminiscent of the first Smiths album. It comes right after the three-minute mark on ""Can We Kiss?"" which is otherwise essentially a remake of a similarly themed but more imperative Halo Benders song. Suddenly, Johnson emits an ""ohohhhhohhhh"" followed by an ""uhooohhohhhowwwohh,"" that redeems the status of commingling foodholes; the kitsch is automatically baptized out of celebrating an old-fashion liptangle. ""Love Will Come Back Again,"" despite offering the popular redundancy of back-againness, is equally convincing, especially when Johnson booms subtle hints to his intended such as ""unbuckle that Gingham dress."" The aforementioned ""Valentine"" will melt the sentimental lobe of anyone lingering in love's potential orbit when both vocalists collide to plead, ""Ooooh, give me a sign."" Despite some increments during which the vocal loudness is poorly modulated, What Was Me is easily Johnson's best harnessing of his divisive foghorn. If I'd heard the avant-Guthrie of the scrappy, miss-me-when-I'm-gone title track on Internet radio, I'd run out to buy this album, being sure to topple several senior citizens en route to the store where the jaded hippie half-mans the register. Same goes for ""Lies Goodbye,"" an exercise in the elasticity of enunciation (e.g. ""rage"" becomes ""rayeeyayeeyage""). The individual songs may be more than the sum of their aggravatingly drumless parts, but this album as a whole is less than that sum. Choruses are repeated ad comatosium, and one is left to wonder what even a provisional backing band could have offered material like the six-minute, no-key-change, basic-chord ""Palriga."" Many of us are so pathetic that we want the album playing in our car after the club closes to be cool and gregarious-- What Was Me's sweet bloviations might get you snickered at. Still, these songs have bullied my head for weeks. The island-strum of ""Warm Days"" has soundtracked my fascination with a hyper-gesticulating woman in the opposite lane who flips her cellphone the bird. ""The Past Comes Back to Haunt,"" for some reason, was my mantra as I stared at an SUV sporting a Jason Voorhees glow-in-the-dark hockey mask hanging from its rear-view, with two pine-shaped air-fresheners in the eyeholes. Even ""Lightnin Rod for Jesus"" colonized my brain as I watched crows eat fries out of a McBin. Which brings me back to wondering if this occasionally-acoustic-only album is just a nominee for the time capsule labeled ""Crazy Shit We Did With Our Freedom,"" or the masterwork of an aimless Cupid.","When you first hear this album, you'll be transported into the Martin Sheen role in Apocalypse Calvin,\n\ surrounded ...

Alone I Admire,Auburn Lull,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a13f9d034d5c69bf28fb/1:1/w_160/cf8721e4.jpg,2002-07-29 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/351-alone-i-admire/,Burnt HairBurnt Hair,"Occasionally you'll come across a bandname that describes its aura more succinctly than you ever could. The 'Auburn Lull'-- that warm, radiant feeling that stays with you when your girlfriend's gone home, after a psychedelic trip or just a long, lazy day at the beach. It's an apt name for the musicians, who holed up between the summer of 1997 and the spring of 1998 and carved out the thick slabs of resonance that became Alone I Admire. The album was originally released in 1999 on Burnt Hair Records, the Michigan label known for drone excursions by groups like F√ºxa and Windy & Carl, and it's been out-of-print since shortly thereafter. Darla was wise to secure the reissue: this is a classic, transcending notions of space-rock and shoegazing to reach an apotheosis of pure, vibrant sound. A massive amount of production work went into Alone I Admire, no doubt due in part to producer Andrew Prinz of Mahogany. The sleeve notes mention the array of microphones spread throughout the studio, centered especially around the drums to create a sensation of depth. The guitar signals were bi-amped for dense resolution, and ""it should be noted that several different kinds of sampling and delay units were utilized, as well as a gregarious amount of external reverberation processors."" Afterwards the songs were enhanced by further editing and tape looping, and eventually fed into a 16-channel mixing desk. As a result, these slow songs evolve gently through some of the most eyelid-shudderingly rich sonic layers I've ever heard. Audiophiles will revel in a record that finally tests their systems to the limit. The group begins each track with a simple rhythmic idea, as with the steady cymbal tick that opens ""Stockard Drive."" A sheet of sound rises up, instruments completely indistinguishable, just this sustained choral hum that builds as the male singer breathes a light refrain. Nothing prepares you for the burst that follows, though, as a searing ray that was once a guitar soars upwards into a gorgeous heliosphere. The timbres throughout Alone I Admire have you reaching sheepishly for embarrassing adjectives like 'glorious' or 'sacred.' There's an all-enveloping, alien perfection to the music that even some legendarily obsessive musicians couldn't quite craft. The Auburn Lull's success has to do somewhat with the minimal instrumentation they chose. Bass, guitar and drums are augmented by other strings and occasional tape loops and piano strains. ""Old Mission"" features the bowing of a cello, its solitary nature setting a melancholy counterpoint against the orchestral swell of guitars that follows. ""Blur My Thoughts"" brightens the mood as angelic pulse tones descend amongst the cavernous bass drum reverb, a constant shimmering that reminds me of Seefeel. That's one of the only comparisons necessary for these otherworldly atmospheres, though, and ethereal vocals intrude to draw you out of total reverie. A sample of foreign language chatter from the television ends the piece on a tense note. The album's careful to keep enough progressions in play to avoid floating away entirely. On ""Desert,"" the sheen of the guitar permeates the mix at first, chipped into recognizable form by the circling strokes of the percussion. Then a deep rhythm line rises, like dub played on double-bass, shifting the piece into forward motion. Again, the male/female vocal harmony chimes together like a psalm, and the lyrics (""leave without a clue..."") turn the title into a verb. But despite the utterly solemn moments on the album, it's striking how nice the melodies are overall. ""The Last Beat"" in particular heightens the pace with a faster drum shuffle, and the oscillating scree of the guitar brings peaceful images of seagulls gliding over shorelines. It's simply beautiful, uplifting music. Environments this pristine and patient inevitably get tagged as 'glacial,' but the Auburn Lull drift through spaces far more nebulous, like billowing clouds ringing mountaintops. Of course, some listeners might get lost in the haze, and there will be some who say that the album puts them to sleep. That's partly the point: whereas the rock-oriented shoegazer bands were content to coat their pop songs in cycles of distortion, the Auburn Lull finds an even more engrossing starting point deep within the decay of reverberation. You'll find yourself lulled by the swirling sounds, always spinning forward and yet echoing in the past's delay, caught up in the doldrums and realizing it's a lovely place to be. They may have recorded only one album, but the Auburn Lull have made music fine enough to die to, and I don't think I alone admire their ability to bring heaven to the earth.","Occasionally you'll come across a bandname that describes its aura more succinctly than you ever could.\n\ The 'Auburn ...

Highly Evolved,The Vines,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a95cea9e61561daa5a0c/1:1/w_160/310fd6ad.jpg,2002-07-29 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8471-highly-evolved/,Capitol,"The Vines. Four young guys from Australia determined to tear it up in the States, their end goal being the glorious egotrip of international rock stardom. Now, let's be fair-- most guys starting bands regularly entertain notions of 'hitting the bigtime,' and there isn't a goddamn thing wrong with that. It's just that few are content to play it quite so safe. Even the metal guys have personality. And while I imagine that, somewhere beneath their media-friendly exterior, The Vines might be real characters, you'll find no trace of it on their Capitol Records debut, Highly Evolved. I picture Craig Nicholls and Ryan Griffiths in some lavish London hotel suite at this very moment trying to figure out some way to glue the TV to the ceiling. (Not so easy, is it, champs?) Then Patrick Matthews walks out of the shower demanding, ""Ayy, whicha you blokes whacked off in the shampoo?"" Hilarity ensues! It's like The Monkees if they wanted to be, say, Silverchair instead of the Beatles. Yet no life signs penetrate the crystal clarity of this album. I'd even go so far as to say that Highly Evolved may actually be the least fun record of the year, with its grungy vocals and hamfisted guitarwork-- not to mention the vintage Brit-pop and soaring harmonies they've tossed in for broad-range accessibility. It's not even a problem that they tattoo their influences on their foreheads and add nothing to what they steal from The Verve (on the slow songs), Nirvana (if Nirvana were a pop act), and the rest of commercial radio's last twenty years. But did they have to make it so dull? I mean, I understand that it's already a hit, and if anyone gets laid this summer because of this album, that trumps whatever I can say about it. But Highly Evolved has 'dad rock' written all over it. It reeks of product, right down to the special $6 purchase price most stores are pushing: ""Why not check out the Vines?"" Of course, the production, courtesy of Rob Schnapf, is impeccable. But then, in typical Schnapf form, it's too impeccable. He's lent his Mr. Clean polish job to luminaries like Beck, as well as many bands who didn't need it-- Guided by Voices, for one example, Elliott Smith for another-- and while Highly Evolved is lush, having been recorded in L.A. over two months with Schnapf's mood-setting collection of vintage instruments, it also sounds plastic; he doesn't let the band make a single mistake anywhere on the album. Schnapf's production is somewhat augmented by Craig Nicholls, singer, guitarist and lead songwriter, whose mushmouthed vocals at least stray from sterility. Problem is, his unintelligible croon doesn't really work with the more sentimental tracks (which account for at least half the songs here), and even when the music ascends to garage-style rock, his only communicable emotion is the time-honored bratty sneer. Still, Nicholls is a natural talent as a writer. He already knows from killer hooks-- ""Highly Evolved"" and ""Outtathaway!"" are fine grunge, switching from bare strumming to throbbing, jagged, yet infectious guitar lines. ""Get Free"" kicks off with a riff like revving up a lawnmower, and the chorus shows off the band's perfectly pitch-corrected vocal harmonies-- even if the extra-catchy bridge sounds tacked on to make it a bigger hit. And the mini-epic ""1969,"" though sprawling and indulgent, is genuinely refreshing after squeaky-clean hard rock like ""In the Jungle"" and the obnoxiously beach-ready ""Sunshinin'"": its tortured mess of an outro drags on long enough that, for once, the two guitarists actually find room to breathe. Highly Evolved also slows down for some endearing pop, like the peppy, syncopated ""Factory."" Mellow love song ""Mary Jane"" shows Nicholls' most sincere and affecting vocals, and ""Autumn Shade,"" colored with acoustic guitar and piano, echoes the melody and eerie harmonies of the Beatles' ""Because."" But then he gets all serious on us with the yearning harmonies of ""Country Yard"" and the over-earnest ""Homesick."" They haven't even been on the road six months and they've already found time to miss Australia? The Vines get credit for ambition, but Highly Evolved covers so much ground that none of it seems convincing: there's just no emotional depth here. Nicholls is not yet a great singer, and his feelings outpace his ability to express them. But moreover, the Vines are adept enough at rock pastiche that they miss why the Beatles took a decade to get to Let It Be. With Schnapf's help, they've crammed an entire career into one album: from song to song we skip from hard-rock teen raunch, to the popcraft of a well-behaved studio band, to the old-soul, ""wish I were home again"" pathos of mature, balding rockers. And it all has to come through a sneer.","The Vines. Four young guys from Australia determined to tear it up in the States, their end goal being the ...

My Way,Akufen,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0365e6ef9596931feca/1:1/w_160/88eb3575.jpg,2002-07-29 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/91-my-way/,Force Inc,"Some things never get old. I could eat a cream cheese bagel every morning for the rest of my life and never get tired of it. Unfortunately, the musical equivalent of a cream cheese bagel is hard to find. Most artists, albums or genres, if I hear too much over a certain period, eventually start to wear. Often this happens gradually over a long stretch of time, so gradually that I can't pinpoint when my affection started to change. Other times my dissatisfaction comes over me in a wave and I have a moment of clarity. I believe Akufen's My Way marks the precise moment I started to get a little bored of this strand of microhouse. It's not really fair to Akufen that it happened to catch me at this time, because as records in this genre go, this is a good one. The beats are crisp and funky, a good many of the melodies are memorable, and the concept is interesting enough. A quick note on the latter-- Akufen (Mark Leclair of Montreal) uses a technique he calls ""microsampling"" to gather raw materials for his tracks. This method involves recording tiny fragments of radio transmissions and recontextualizing the sounds into his pumping, stripped down house rhythms. Favorite Akufen snippets are brief acoustic guitar riffs, one-syllable vocalizations, and quick string stabs. It's a distinctive sonic signature that gives his tracks load of possibility. And it sounds good, really it does. Yet, the half dozen times I listened to this album, my primary thought was, Do I need another record that sounds like this? Even though Akufen meticulously builds complex riffs into these tracks from dozens of stray sound fragments, and even though he layers these sounds above propulsive and endlessly danceable beats, My Way doesn't really stand out for me. In truth, when the thick clusters of sampled sound get past a certain density, I just find them annoying. My favorite track on My Way is the most focused, the overtly pretty ""Skidoos."" It takes its time building up from an opening of dubby percussion and processed samples, but after a vaporous synth drone folds in, the 4/4 beat and grabby bassline identify the tune as an energizing dance track. Key to its appeal is the ping-ponging vocal riff that appears and reappears, a killer hook that makes the track seem close to a 'song' in the traditional sense of the word, even though the singing is clipped and wordless. Beats this danceable deserve a little bit of pop, and ""Skidoos"" does not disappoint. If I ever make it inside a club again, I hope to hear something as blissed out as this. After that peak, the rest of My Way is fine and reliable but never great. ""Heaven Can Wait"" has some R&B; vocal samples with similar emotional power, although the cluttered arrangement diminishes the return. ""Deck the House"" takes the prize in terms of technical expertise, with chords, rhythms, melodies and counter-melodies all generated from tiny dust particles of sound that fly past so quickly your brain barely has time to make out the pattern. After that, there's a whole lot of 'this sounds interesting' and very little engagement. The truth is, I'm not sure how much new glitchy house I need in my collection at the moment. I still find Farben and Herbert stunning, and MRI's All That Glitters remains great fun. But I do know that when I next reach for something in this vein, Akufen will fall pretty far down my list.","Some things never get old.

The Tight Connection,I Am the World Trade Center,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c19713d197565213bc10/1:1/w_160/c7d5f434.jpg,2002-07-29 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4039-the-tight-connection/,Kindercore,"Hoo boy, I can think of at least a thousand ways I can get into trouble with this review. I Am the World Trade Center know my pain; thanks to a certain day last fall, the thought-associations their name evoked changed from kitschy capitalistic monolith to slow-motion catastrophe replay. Sensitive to the country's general freaked-outedness but still needing to pay their bills, Dan Geller and Amy Dykes continued touring under the slightly censored moniker I Am The... for a while. But with the release of The Tight Connection, the duo have resumed using their original name, boldly leading the way back to normalcy for similar hard-luck acts like Burning Airlines, Anthrax, and little-known Albuquerque high-school group O-Ska-ma Bin Laden. Now, after reading album reviews assessing the role of everyone from Andrew WK to Nelly in our new hyper-paranoid age, I made a personal vow never to wrassle with Spooky Tuesday-related themes in my own work, and I won't bite on the alluring bait this album offers. I will observe, however, that the band's quick and fairly non-controversial resumption of the World Trade Center title (cynical publicity reasons aside) closely parallels our country's own short-term memory with disaster. Just as they're already slinging around plans to rebuild the WTC to reclaim precious lost office space, and the country has returned to losing sleep over the Dow rather than Middle-Eastern insurgents, the band sees no reason to lose brand loyalty with a pesky, confusing name change. Makes sense, though, since musically, that same collective short-term memory is exactly what I Am the World Trade Center banks on. Coloring carefully between the lines laid out by their eighties synth-pop ancestors, Geller and Dykes do little with their updated technology that would sound unfamiliar to the asymmetrically coifed hordes should The Tight Connection be shot back to 1986 in a time machine. It's laptops instead of octagonal drum pads, but can you tell the difference? Owners of I Am the World Trade Center's previous album, Out of the Loop, already know this, but repeat visitors might be surprised by the greater emphasis upon the synth part of the band's musical equation. I Am the WTC's songs go down easier when samples provide at least a tenuous link back to the world of actual instruments, as on Loop's flute-y ""Me to Be"" or the theme-show-brass of The Tight Connection's ""Dancing Alone."" By comparison, the machine-bought drum breaks and parade of synthesizers found on tracks like ""Believe in Me"" and ""California Dreaming Again"" are a little too cold and rigid like for the oh-happy-day vibe they attempt to create, like a keyboard demo preset. Of course, even the iciest Powerbook arrangement can be warmed up with a charismatic vocal, but Dykes' cords hardly move the mercury. Preferring a low-range, low-variability style, Dykes' singing bears an unfortunate resemblance to the squirmingly awkward Joey Lauren Adams musical number in Chasing Amy-- look no further than the rather flat take on Blondie's ""Call Me."" The detached, semi-ironic delivery doesn't play well with the perky club beats, making even the slam-dunk seductive questions of ""Big Star"" (""do you want to drive around in a big car?"") sound less than alluring. This could-be-irony is ultimately what brings down The Tight Connection, plopping I Am the World Trade Center down in an uncomfortable middle region between your deadly serious synth acts (i.e. The Faint) and your bubblegum brand (i.e. any synth-laden radio single from 1981-1988). Without any significant additions to the field, it's hard to imagine what niche the album fills that couldn't be filled by, say, a highlights mix-tape of that seven-disc 1980s collection Rhino recently released. If your record collection sorely lacks a boy/girl duo with a Reagan-era fixation, going with Adult is probably the better bet. At the very least, their bandname will release far fewer repressed memories.","Hoo boy, I can think of at least a thousand ways I can get into trouble with this review. I ...

Tejada's previous releases have appeared on the UK's A13 and DeFocus labels, as well as his own Palette operation, and his recent move to Plug Research is a logical one: Tejada contributed to the excellent L.A. techno compilation Dublab Presents: Freeways that also featured Plug Research's finest, Daedalus and Dntel, and he also mastered Soulo's self-titled debut. Daydreams in Cold Weather features twelve takes on clinically melodic IDM with a smattering of laboratory electro and a faint whiff of drum-n-bass. Given how connected Tejada is to Plug Research, I find it odd that this album is most reminiscent ""Artificial Intelligence""-era Black Dog Productions. What hallmarks a Tejada production is the intricacy with which he arranges each element of a track. His precision is deceptively transparent. It's easy, in fact, to be awed by the overall flow of the track and not to pay close attention to how Tejada has put it all together. A superb example of this is ""Young."" The track begins as a Xerox of Friend & Dr. Kosmos' version of the Clash's ""Career Opportunities"" before incorporating that signature bassline into what I imagine a Black Dog/Pete Namlook collaboration might sound like. Likewise, the moody ""Shifted"" rejects the jauntiness of the opener, ""To the West,"" thereby making an undeniable case for its inclusion in a set by Certificate 18's Norwegian post-drum-n-bass genius, Polar. Occasionally, though, Tejada slips up. The wistful ""Summer Rain"" sounds weedy and unsure, with a drum pattern that offers none of the rhythmic bobbing and weaving I've come to expect from his records. Yet at other times Tejada can be as precise as heat-seeking missile-- ""Rehearsing Disaster,"" for example, snatches some of Squarepusher's manic energy and channels it into meticulous rhythmic detailing rather than Tom Jenkinson's freaky jumble. ""Abre Los Ojos""-- no doubt a tribute to Alejandro AmexE1bar's disturbing and provocative film of the same title (the one Cameron Crowe neutered for Vanilla Sky)-- features a heavily processed vocal sample of Tejada's operatic soprano mom, Carmen. Fortunately, Tejada doesn't choose the facile route to success by turning the track into an Enigma or Enya knock-off, instead threading the modified voice through the background out of which acidic squiggles and off-kilter percussion stalk across a mechanoid landscape. Instrumental hip-hop also creeps into Daydreams in Cold Weather. Tejada's previous album, The Matrix of Us, was the first time I'd heard him divert from his abundant love of uncut Detroit techno. While The Matrix of Us was no Endtroducing, I found Tejada's application of techno's automated sterility to hip-hop fascinating, and Mo'Wax's mystic tongue Divine Styler added hugely to the success of the endeavor. Divine Styler returns here to give his cool power to ""The Silence of Us""-- a deliberation on inexpressible realities. While I can find little to fault Daydreams in Cold Weather, I must say that I expected more from Tejada's first appearance on Plug Research. This isn't so much an indictment of Tejada, more a testament to the originality that Plug Research artists usually provide in spades. Rumor has it that the forthcoming Low Res album, Blue Ramen, will blow minds just as Daedelus' Invention and Dntel's Life Is Full of Possibilities have unequivocally done. Here's hoping that Daydreams in Cold Weather is Tejada setting up base camp before joining the others on their pioneering excursions beyond conformity and into innovation.","John Tejada's fifth album is his first for L.A.'s peerless IDM glitch-pop label Plug Research.

Lucky 7,The Reverend Horton Heat,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a26913d1975652138878/1:1/w_160/79c9c614.jpg,2002-07-28 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6773-lucky-7/,Artemis,"Change is good. It is the root of development and evolution. For many artists, it's almost a given that what you're playing now will almost certainly not be what you're playing next year. In fact, part of the thrill of following music is wondering what will happen next, who will be the instigator of the next big thing, and watching your favorites adapt to the times. Sometimes, artists change because they're in a rut of turning out the same old thing, perhaps losing their grip on relevance (think U2). The marketing-centric ones (Madonna) change before they have a chance to fall into a rut. Other times, artists change because they're genuinely interested in moving on to new things, presumably for the sake of art (like Beck or perhaps Radiohead). Yeah, change is everywhere, and it's good. On the other hand, change is terrible: ""The shadow of his early work will follow him forever."" ""The Sparks also use the old 'between albums EP' clich√© to indulge in a little experimentation at their fans' expense."" ""...Maladroit is definitely not a return to the sound of the band's mid-90s artistic peak."" All of these quotes are taken from recent Pitchfork reviews, and illustrate that changing your sound guarantees absolutely nothing. In these cases, it was viewed critically, though it could have been a lot worse (think of the mass throttling unleashed with any new John Lydon project-- Jesus, that I have to use the term 'project' for Lydon's stuff says it all). The problem these acts run into is that deviation from their once-successful formula has gotten them panned, and since they're still at least partially relevant to young listeners, resting on their laurels is practically a sin. And that brings me to the Reverend Horton Heat. James C. ""Horton"" Heath is in a real mess. Thing is, having a fairly sizable fan base who expects new product every couple of years is one thing, but what does he do when his band excels in a style of music which has remained essentially unchanged in 50 years? Sure, the Reverend's rockabilly stomp runs on a slightly higher octane than Carl Perkins', but rockabilly stomp it is, and there's only so many newfangled devices he can work into the show and still have it be good old rock 'n' roll. Don't believe me? Which album do you think all true-blue Heat fans hate the most? Hint: Al Jourgensen does not play rockabilly. So, where does that leave the band? From the sound of it, it leaves them (and me) with Lucky 7, and 14 very (very) slight variations on the devil's music. Very. On top of that, I'm not even sure Reverend Horton Heat needs to release a whole lot of new material at this point. They must make most of their living by touring, and none of this stuff sounds as good on a CD as it does live anyway. Of course, to stop releasing new stuff is even more a sign of an artist bled dry than refusing to change. So on with the show. The opener, ""Loco Gringos Like a Party,"" is a heavy, swinging blues shuffle that, for all intents and purposes, has probably written itself. Down to the detail of ""eating the worm,"" group-shouted backup vocals and the part where Heath ""brings it down"" for the solo, every part of this song is constructed to lather up a crowd in concert. It would also work pretty well in a beer commercial. In fact, here's a short list of tunes from this album which you can probably guess the sound of merely by reading their titles: ""Like a Rocket"" (up-tempo rockabilly, more beer ad cred than the opener-- it was even chosen as the anthem for the 2002 Daytona 500), ""Duel at the Two O'Clock Bell"" (moody surf-cowboy instrumental), ""Ain't Gonna Happen"" (thrashy rockabilly, Henry Rollins is loving every minute of both the music and the title), ""Suicide Doors"" (more up-tempo rockabilly, about a car), and the goofy ""Sermon on the Jimbo."" That last one is a spoken word intro to the closing track wherein Heath reveals the temptations (""playing with the poodle"") and saving graces (""the clear waters of his above-ground pool"") of his bassist Jimbo. It's not all that grimly predictable, though. ""Galaxy 500"" is a cartoonish lament on an ex-wife, and Heath's only request to her is to keep his car. Musically, it's more punked-out roots-rock, but the band works in a few new chord progressions, and even better, actual volume and mood changes. All in the same song! ""The Tiny Voice of Reason"" is a neat acoustic cowboy ballad with a tender heart. Most impressive is the deft bluegrass-style instrumental, ""Show Pony,"" featuring Heath's considerable guitar-picking talents, and his rhythm section at their energetic best. The good stuff aside, if hard whiskey, hard women and aboveground pools aren't your thing-- and I would imagine not-- it's tough to recommend Lucky 7. I can still see how most of it would work live (mostly remembering the incredible show they put on when I saw them years ago in Dallas), so the spirit's probably there. Nothing much has changed for these guys in ten years, and if that doesn't bother you, you've got a friend in the Reverend.","Change is good. It is the root of development and evolution.

The Palace at 4am (Part I),Jay BennettEdward Burch,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a26e9d034d5c69bf2bc9/1:1/w_160/e6c7a30d.gif,2002-07-28 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/649-the-palace-at-4am-part-i/,Undertow,"Objective: To use departed Wilco keyboardist Jay Bennett's debut album (with mystery man multi-instrumentalist Edward Burch) to determine the importance/nature of his role in said former band. Introduction: Jay Bennett's always been something of a wild card in the Wilco deck. A renowned session musician who joined up for the majestic double-album Being There, Bennett gradually accumulated influence over the band's sound, and according to some, was primarily responsible for the band's shift from twangy traditionalism to tentative pop experimentalism. However, at some point during the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot sessions, Bennett wore out his welcome as creative foil to lead Wilcolyte Jeff Tweedy and departed for the wilderness of a duo career with longtime confidant Burch. But, perhaps as part of his severance package, Bennett has thrown two YHF leftovers onto his debut effort: rocker ""Shakin' Sugar"" (sometimes known on Wilco forums as ""Alone"") and purty piano ballad ""Venus Stop the Train."" Now, thanks to the wonders of digital technology, we can pit the Wilco and Bennett versions against each other cockfight-style, and in doing so, shed some light upon Bennett's past and future. Methods: Bring over a couple of CD players from last weekend's Zaireeka party, pop in your copy of The Palace at 4am, and dig out that disc of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot demos and outtakes you salvaged from the file-sharing rummage sale. It's time for a little compare and contrast so that we might shake out just how important Jay Bennett was to current king-of-the-rock-galaxy Wilco. Results: The findings may be inconclusive (the completeness of the Wilco outtakes is unknown, not to mention whether Jim ""Pappy"" O'Rourke was yet involved at the time of their recording), but it don't look so good for Herr Bennett. ""Shakin' Sugar"" remains largely unchanged from its unremarkable organ-driven barnburner Wilco version, a song that, were it included on YHF, would've been a distracting stumble backwards to their less-rewarding A.M. days. On the other hand, ""Venus Stop the Train"" is thoroughly pillaged, changed from the hauntingly spare Tweedy/piano/harmonies take into a 64-track psychedelic dubfest of string sections and unnecessary organ embellishment, all behind an uncomfortably greasy vocal performance. Discussion: So, to analyze the data, it certainly appears that Bennett was not quite the forward-pushing individual many hypothesized he was for the band. Comparisons on these two tracks reveal a complacency with the traditional format of the rock song that may have actually been weighing Wilco down in their evolution, rather than accelerating it. Both ""Shakin' Sugar"" and ""Venus"" are also mired in the same over-overdubbing sludge that kept Summerteeth from being the album to infect the world with Wilco Fever. Is a song not complete until it has four keyboards blaring on top of it? These shortcomings can be expanded to the entirety of The Palace at 4am, explaining the album's considerable mediocrity. Bennett and Burch obviously just want to make a rock album, and you can't really fault them for it. But while YHF is a classic rock album with grease spots of laptop diddles and noisy skrawk seeping through, Palace is perhaps more what Reprise was hoping for: FM-ready stuff that at best resembles Tom Petty and at worst could be mistaken for the Counting Crows. While there are certainly some good songs to be found (""Whispers or Screams,"" ""Like a Photograph,"" ""Talk to Me""), most appear to have spent a little too long being kicked around the studio. The liner notes credit Bennett with at least nineteen instruments (Burch gets eight), and most songs appear to have utilized each and every one of 'em: mellotrons, omnichords, orchestral bells, and all. Most of the layering sounds more like camouflage than innovation, particularly on the useless remake of Summerteeth's ""My Darling,"" complete with head-scratchingly superfluous electric sitar and ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" muted trumpet. ""My Darling"" also highlights why Bennett was restricted to backup vocal duties by his former employer, as any song that's been previously given a treatment using Tweedy's signature rumpled rasp highlights unfortunate shortcomings in Bennett's forced-emotion warble. The excessive length of Palace doesn't help matters either; at nearly seventy minutes, there's far too much filler material diluting the good stuff. It's as if, freed from the parental reigns of bandmates, he's lost all sense of tasteful restraint. Right: bitch, bitch, bitch, Wilco, Wilco, Wilco. Can't I examine The Palace at 4am (Part I) on its own terms? Well, frankly, no. Nobody who isn't already a Wilco fan would probably consider buying this record, and as the above research shows, Bennett himself isn't quite yet out of the band's considerable shadow (I haven't even mentioned the appearances of Ken Coomer, John Stirratt, or a couple Mermaid Avenue outtakes). For the same reason, it's probably too soon to tell who'll win the Tweedy-Bennett showdown; without their former keyboard maestro keeping a rock foundation, Wilco's follow-up to YHF could launch too far into outer space, and Bennett & Burch supposedly already have a stripped-down version of Palace ready to go (Part II, perhaps?), indicating that Bennett recognizes his tendency to over-tweak. Bennett's future may not be you-gotta-wear-shades bright, but we probably shouldn't write him off just yet. Keep in mind that nobody thought Tweedy was the talented Tupelo.",,5.6,
The Way I Feel Today,Six by Seven,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a424b1335d7bf16988b1/1:1/w_160/8d0218d1.jpg,2002-07-28 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7192-the-way-i-feel-today/,MantraBeggars,"No overdubs. In an era when even many supposedly live albums have the rough spots smoothed over in the studio, that's not a phrase you see every day. It's not really a strange idea, of course-- for ages, all music was recorded sans-overdubbing. But the recording revolutions of the 1960s changed the way things were done to such an extent that it became a rarity for musicians to record their takes simultaneously, opting instead for the illusion of pitch-perfection and impeccable timing. I think this is one of the reasons that The Way I Feel Today, the third album from Nottingham, England combo Six by Seven, sounds so refreshing. Recorded live in the studio, without a single overdub, the album has an urgency and unpolished energy that most music simply doesn't possess. Whittled down to a quartet with the departure of guitarist Sam Hempton, Six by Seven sound hungry, focused and ready to blast your internal organs into a mushy pulp. They can mash away for all I care, because for the most part, the band's assault hurts in a very good way. They're at their best when the throttle is all the way forward, drummer Chris Davis flailing with Animal-esque intensity and Paul Douglas' bass throbbing just above him. The two are a potent rhythm section, falling somewhere between the shoegazer drone of Ride and the brawling catharsis of classic UK post-punk. The album opens on a deceptively clean note, with James Flower's repetitive piano figure and Chris Olley's vocals floating above. ""Last night I thought I heard you/ Stepping through the door/ You and me were so beautiful/ It must have been a dream,"" he gently intones as an unsettling organ enters, setting up the line, ""You know they really screwed you up before you tumbled down,"" which is repeated as the song ramps to its climactic explosion of dirty guitar. The band's fusion of noise and melody has never been more seamless than it is here, and Olley is shaping up to be not only a fantastic vocalist but also a remarkably effective slash 'n' burn guitarist. The band have an obvious single on their hands in ""I.O.U. Love"" (assuming, of course, that the world doesn't mind being re-fed The Church's ""Under the Milky Way""-- which they probably should), a propulsive, organ-soaked confection that shelves the noise in favor of jangle and vocal harmonies. ""All My New Best Friends"" backs off from the noise even further, with Olley picking on an acoustic guitar and Flower providing texture with his organ and surprisingly tasteful synthetic string sounds. After the first three songs, it's tempting to believe the band are softening, but any such inkling is immediately obliterated by ""Flypaper for Freaks,"" a larynx-shredding punk onslaught that I found dangerous to drive to. ""I never promised you shit"" shouts Olley as the whole band crashes in at once. And from here, the album never looks back. ""Speed Is In, Speed Is Out"" is rocket-fueled, fire-spitting rock and roll, while the wall of organ and distorted guitar in ""Karen O"" rides a pile-driving beat so tight it can only be looped. ""American Beer"" is built on a droning organ and shoved forward by raw drums. The track builds in intensity as the guitar gets louder and Olley's vocals morph from resigned and melodic to ragged and angry. Each line he sings seems to make him more enraged, until the anger finally gives at the end and he and the band return to resignation. The band missteps a bit in the album's final quarter, allowing ""Cafeteria Rats"" and the droning title track to trail on for a bit too long, but in their own rights, these are effective songs, despite being less immediate than the two-minutes-and-change punk eruptions that comprise the album's most gripping moments. However, the band roars back with a vengeance on the pummeling closer, ""Bad Man,"" which recalls the opening one-two punch of ""Eat Junk Become Junk"" and ""Sawn-Off Metallica T-Shirt"" from 2000's The Closer You Get. The final impression one gets from the album is that Six by Seven must put on one hell of a live show if they're capable of sounding like this without any help from post-production add-ons. They're obviously very well-rehearsed, as there's not a discernable mistake anywhere to be found here, but the music benefits immensely from the spontaneity inherent in live performance. The fact that Chris Olley delivered these vocal performances in uninterrupted takes is impressive, too, as he makes a case for being one of the best singers going in today's rock world. This band obviously has a lot of steam in them-- let's hope they blow some more of it off on another record soon.","No overdubs.

Deadringer,RJD2,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2815e6ef95969320423/1:1/w_160/c3b18611.jpg,2002-07-25 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6797-deadringer/,Definitive Jux,"Rjd2 is in the very enviable position of being the hottest new artist on Def Jux, which is quickly establishing itself as the epicenter of post-millennial hip hop. After Rjd2 dropped the superb I Really Like Your Def Jux Baby Tee earlier this year, a steady buzz began to build that Deadringer would be the next step in instrumental, sample-based hip-hop. Def Jux guru El-P even declared that this record will ""change the motherfuckin' world."" Heads began to salivate with expectations of a terse, discordant soundscape that mingled the cinematic glory of DJ Shadow with the decidedly subterranean grime of the other Def Jux releases. It seemed to be a marriage made in heaven, albeit a particularly dark and confusing corner of God's kingdom. Perhaps you should brace yourself before sliding this particular slab of vinyl onto the decks. While the Shadow influence is evident throughout the album, Deadringer sounds absolutely nothing like anything else on Def Jux. It's funky, soulful and seems to draw more from The Beatles than it does Skinny Puppy. That's not to say that there aren't dark moments on Deadringer, but that Rjd2 maintains a stylistic consistency while oscillating emotions and moods at the drop of a hat, and that its ability to capture the various hues that comprise life's mosaic is a rare thing to find in today's music. Opener ""The Horror"" kicks off with a jolting chorus of horns before quickly fading into a grandiose, cheeky sci-fi sample that sounds more playful than menacing. A flanged voice declares, ""It's time, time, time to understand the horror... It's time, time, time to understand the monster."" These light, almost teasing moments, which are liberally sprinkled throughout the album, keep Rjd2's soundscapes from veering too closely into Shadow territory and help this album overcome the generally monotony of most music being labeled 'cinematic.' But if you think you've got this record's number already, think again: ""Smoke and Mirrors"" totally flips the script. It's bluesy, eerily reminiscent of the cold psychedelia laid out by early Pink Floyd. After a raucous intro, a throaty voice pops in and sings, ""Who knows what tomorrow will bring, maybe sunshine, maybe rain... maybe it'll bring my love to me."" And while the track initially comes across as simplistic and retro, the subtleties of its execution are complex, transcending the genres that inform it. Other strains of psychedelia can be heard throughout this album. ""Ghostwriter,"" with its light, shimmering guitar work, alternating samples of 'mmms' and 'ahhs,' and chorus of triumphant horns, recalls the joyful loopiness that defined the best psych-pop of the mid-60s. The song's final joyful burst is so sublime that it alone justifies purchasing this album. ""Final Frontier"" and ""F.F.H."" prove that Rjd2, who got his start doing the production work for the MHZ crew, can still back up an emcee. Unlike other producer wunderkinds, Rjd2 never allows the production to overwhelm the vocalist, and as a result, both tracks are highly effective. But the symbiotic dynamic between producer and emcee is most evident in the incredible ""June."" The production seems understated and almost ordinary as Copywrite spits his verse, but in the long break between the first and second verses the hypnotic brilliance of the track crystallizes. The interplay between the flamenco guitar, ringing synth, and shuffling breakbeat is transporting. And how the music drops before Copywrite comes with his second verse is a minor but brilliant touch. But Deadringer's real jewel comes after the album is officially over. While hidden tracks tend to be gimmicky clunkers, this is a diaphanous slab of soul. The brief, simple sample that anchors the track is both melancholic and resilient. A smoky yet smooth vocal sample declares, ""You are gone, I'm so all alone... as I stare at the ceiling."" It's a rare display of emotional transparency in hip-hop, although it would be a bit unfair to classify Deadringer as strictly hip-hop. There are a few missteps. While Rjd2 inarguably brings the heat with ""The Chicken Bone Circuit,"" the track's breakbeats-on-steroids drums and haunting, minimalist piano sample too closely approximate DJ Shadow. ""The Proxy"" might serve as a standout track for those who enjoyed Bundy K Brown and Jim O'Rourke's remixes on The Sea & Cake's Two Gentlemen EP, but it's a bit too lite for my tastes. Still, for every instance that the disc threatens to blatantly parody Shadow or descend into the impish, commercialized world of Moby, Rjd2 tweaks a sample and drops a beat that makes your heart palpitate. While it's doubtful that this album will ""change the motherfucking world,"" or even the landscape of hip-hop, Rjd2 has managed to perfect his certain brand of sampling, making Deadringer an essential purchase for any fan of instrumental hip-hop.","Rjd2 is in the very enviable position of being the hottest new artist on Def Jux, which is quickly establishing ...

In C,Acid Mothers Temple,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299ff0b1335d7bf1697ee9/1:1/w_160/4e26dcac.gif,2002-07-25 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21-in-c/,Squealer,"Terry Riley's ""In C"" was his breakthrough composition, and in many ways the piece that crystallizes the ideas behind minimalism. ""In C"" also sits at a fulcrum in the development of the movement. Riley considered his work as an extension of the ideas of LaMonte Young (Riley focused on repetition instead of sustained tones), and Steve Reich was one of the musicians for the initial performance in San Francisco in 1964 (Reich says now that his involvement with Riley in 1964 planted the seeds that developed into ""It's Gonna Rain""). ""In C"" is open-ended, in the sense that any number of instruments can be used, and a performance can last indefinitely. The piece is constructed from a number of short, repeating melodic phrases that can overlap or be extended at the discretion of the players; what is always constant is the key of the piece, and a repeating high C that provides the rhythmic foundation. ""In C"" been recorded many times since 1964 in many different ways, but never quite like this. There is something so right about the idea that a group of superpsychedelic rock freaks would take on a composition from the minimalist canon. Acid Mothers Temple is the perfect band for the job, enamored as they are with the spirit of the 60s and the quest for the cosmic vibration (Riley has said that ""In C"" grew out of his interest in psychedelics.) It's telling that the inside cover of this release is a panoramic shot of Kawabata Makoto spreading his arms in front of Stonehenge. Aside from the heartening Spinal Tap associations, Acid Mothers Temple do indeed tune into something ""out there"" and work some magic on ""In C."" AMT's version of the Riley piece starts very slow and quiet, with a tempo dramatically pitched down from a typical classical version. The root C is played on a vibraphone throughout, and as the track warms up, just the vibes and a droning organ outline the tune. The first three minutes or so are meditative and beautiful, as the single note and spare harmonies coalesce into a gentle swirl of sound. Then, from beneath the calm a gradually building herd of drums creep into the frame. Once the drums reach full volume, they become the motivating force of the track, the pace quickens, and ""In C"" turns into a rollicking, endless jam. Though the sounds appropriately bleed together into a single pulsating cluster, Terukina Noriko's incredible work on vibes and glockenspiel remain the discernable element throughout. Her tone is reminiscent of steel drums as she finds endless variations on the simple themes. The other instruments are difficult to identify-- it sounds like assorted synthesizers and perhaps a sitar. If Makoto is playing his guitar, he is seriously altering the tone. But this jam is all about the collective, and it remains intense and exciting throughout its 20-minute length. The Acid Mothers Temple original ""In E"" comes next (har har), and it's almost as impressive. Opening with a thick, oozing synthesizer drone, Makoto's guitar strums eventually become the focus. An open E chord provides the heavy bottom for the ensuing jam, as he drives home a slashing ""Sister Ray""-style riff for 16+ minutes. This is Acid Mothers Temple finding where early-70s Detroit intersected with Krautrock. It's a thrilling piece of psychedelia that, with its more focused riffage, outperforms anything on last year's New Geocentric World. The CD-only bonus track ""In D"" closes out the album with a thick, balmy drone that shifts gradually over the course of 20 minutes. There is no noise here, and no drums; in fact, if it weren't for the Far East buzz of an unidentifiable instrument, ""In D"" could pass as a fine Windy & Carl track, evoking images of a naturalistic trance state imbued with sunlight and billowy clouds. It's a perfect compliment to the two tracks that precede it, and a fine way to close this exceptional record. Terry's not very into the noisy stuff these days, so I'm not sure he approves. But to my ears, AMT more than honors his legacy.","Terry Riley's ""In C"" was his breakthrough composition, and in many ways the piece that crystallizes the ideas behind ...

Stab the Unstoppable Hero,Arlo,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1005e6ef959693200b2/1:1/w_160/1358347b.jpg,2002-07-25 05:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/289-stab-the-unstoppable-hero/,Sub Pop,"""Nature is always stronger than principle,"" could very roughly be translated to, ""Fuck it-- fun is fun, mindless or otherwise, so gimme back my Guided by Voices pogs."" Now, David Hume was an intelligent man, but does that really claim have anything to do with music? Well, maybe a little (though he might not have intended it to), since it pretty much sums up the entire justification for all things pop since Haydn's final symphony, ""Girls are Neat, in D Minor."" It has spawned the often dreadful 'mindless fun' defense, going to win innumerable precedents in the court of public opinion. Certainly, some of the records defended by this argument are triumphs, but for every Daft Punk, there's an O.J.-style travesty like I Get Wet that's just waiting to trot out the same brainless defense. So, Dave, mindless fun may be all well and good, like underage drinking (hilarious), but it can get out of hand, like being arrested for Heroin possession (still funny, but only if it's not me). When that time comes, in the equally classic words of Abe Lincoln, ""the hammer's gotta come down."" Oh, hey, Arlo! I was just talking about you. Stab the Unstoppable Hero, the second outing from this L.A. four-piece, is numbingly catchy, and with lyrics like, ""Are you made of salt?/ Or are you sour?/ Do you fall apart/ In the shower?,"" no one's going to nominate a song like ""Little American"" for the new Mensa theme. Yeah, Arlo's newest chunky, garage-style mess has the nature of pure power-pop and the hooks to ensure that no brain cells get out alive. Often, it can play almost as well as Weezer, or, more commonly, Walt Mink, but... goddammit, here's where the principles have to come in. Did I say like Mink or the Weez? Yep. Arlo reads right off their script-- and the script of every other garage-pop act in the last decade, for that matter-- they're just not quite up to the part. For roughly 75% of this album, Arlo is content to show off its best impression of much better bands, and, to be fair, it can be a fairly slick impersonation. I mean, Riv Cuomo hasn't penned a song as innocent or apparently effortless as ""Too Sick to Tango"" or ""Linger On"" in two albums, and yet, somehow Stab still isn't any fun. The problem is, where this album ought to have the sweet consistency of bubblegum there's nothing but the acidic taste of blatant, heavy-handed derivation. ""Working Title"" could blend in seamlessly with any of the outtakes from the Miss Happiness sessions-- there's not an ounce of invention in it. Likewise, the streamlined guitar fuzz and soaring harmonies of ""Temperature"" are easy on the ears, but even that was done a hell of a lot better on El Producto. So why bother? It's a question of craftsmanship versus straight sonics, and the fine line between influence and rip-off is crossed here throughout. Hell, the White Stripes haven't played a single glorious note that hasn't been found elsewhere, but no one could sensibly accuse them of shoplifting from influences like Zep and, you know, all blues ever written. I'm not saying that of Arlo, either, but they'd have a much harder time clearing themselves if that was the charge. Let me be direct: when Arlo are wearing their masks, they may sound derivative, but at least they sound pretty good; they're taking cues from some great acts, after all. And as much of a difficulty as it is, it's better than the alternative. Sadly, for about a quarter of this farce, Arlo sounds like plain old Arlo, and I'll tell you, that's a prospect that won't be well-received. The most original shots they've got in them are muddy barrages that lean more towards grunge sludge (""Runaround"") or limp-wristed alt-country (""Up""), songs notable only for their absolute nondescriptness and predictability. Stab the Unstoppable Hero even contains the single most obvious ""we're rocking so hard that we can't even play the music properly"" outro in recent memory. Though, to their credit, at least it sounds like they wrote it. This album is just one more round in the inevitable victory of nature over principles-- it's not easy to resist some of the more entertaining pop kernels lingering on Stab the Unstoppable Hero. Which is a real shame. Hume might not have known what he was excusing, but that doesn't mean that this sort of pap can slide. These songs were written on tracing paper, leading to some amazingly troubling pop. Oh, and I guess since 'troubling pop' isn't a phrase that's likely to see much use, Arlo might be notable for that, too.","""Nature is always stronger than principle,"" could very roughly be translated to, ""Fuck it-- fun is fun, mindless or otherwise ...

Strangest Parade,Makers,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c37a5e6ef95969323840/1:1/w_160/703e7f04.jpg,2002-07-25 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5055-strangest-parade/,Sub Pop,"At a seedy roadhouse three miles off the interstate, a scruffy assembly of skinny boys and girls in tight blue jeans, skinny ties, and bright red lipstick gathered for one final night to raise hell with hard liquor and filtered cigarettes, and bid farewell to the garage/surf revival that had sustained them. When the evening was over, the crowd dispersed via classic car or motorcycle, or passed out cold in the gravel parking lot. The last word came from a staggering DJ, who, while clumsily loading old Sonics albums into the back of his vintage Camaro, reputedly uttered: ""They say electronica is the next big thing. I guess that's the end of us."" Many of the evening's attendees took this prophetic line too much to heart, and went home to sell their guitars and invest in expensive music software. Or in the case of Spokane, Washington's The Makers, grew out their hair, changed their names, and started talking concept albums. As it happened, the whole 'garage rock is dead' bit was at best a gross exaggeration, or at worst a vicious rumor started by an enterprising couple from Detroit who aimed to capitalize on the gullibility of their peers. It's no secret that anything bearing a remote resemblance to garage rock is huge right now, and despite marginal accolades for their new, improved glam rock personas, The Makers got the shit end of the deal. Which brings us, in a round about way, to Strangest Parade. A flawed follow-up to the flawed concept album that was the preceding Rock Star God, Strangest Parade shows the Makers 'maturing' from full-on glam rock excess into ordinary rock excess with little of the attitude, and less of the energy, that made them even remotely appealing in the first place. Yes, it's dark and serious and musically competent, but why should that be a recommendation of a band once known for their snarling, no-holds-barred noise and the somewhat mythical badassitude they derived from their skid row storyline and predilection for onstage anarchy. The only evidence of a sense of fun or humor on this album are the band's clothes, which, if the album cover's any indication, may have been purchased at a combination Rod Stewart/Queen garage sale circa '77. Strangest Parade is basically devised as a two-part concept album, separated into a long first half and a shorter second half by two short creatively titled introductions (respectively ""An Eternal Climb"" and ""Death and the Mad Heroine""), and a simplistic stylistic division-- the first part tends to drag anthemically; the second half comes closer to straightforward rock 'n' roll. The album is set up as a mock concert, concluding with ""Wide Wide World of Girls""-- a largely acoustic, almost Neil Young-inspired ballad complete with harmonica, dobro, and twang-- an interactive encore, wherein the music is overlaid with periodic stadium-sized audience applause and band introduction. Though this conceit irritates me as a rule, it's only a mild violation when compared to the over-the-top Bowie-aping that dominates the bulk of the album. With moments of cribbed ""Space Oddity"" (the acoustic segue ""Wild Gray Wonder"") and such blatant examples of ersatz Ziggy Stardust as the anthemic ""Calling Elvis, John and Jesus"" with its falsetto backup choirs and spacy guitar lines, or the whacked out confessional piano ballad ""Calling My Name,"" it's awfully hard to lend them credence that they're anything other than a veiled tribute band-- let alone that they wrote these songs. The best moments on the album recall The Makers' more raucous past. Sometimes these occur almost inconspicuously: the unabashed crunch of the guitar on parts of ""Hard to Be Human,"" is nearly lost in the glam theatrics and sound effects. Likewise, the great Nuggets-era pop of ""Suicide Blues"" is hampered by the bizarre inclusion of what sounds like a children's choir at the chorus. Other tracks show the initial energy of what could be wild ass rock 'n' roll (the build-up alone on ""Addicted to Dying"" raised my heart rate), but draw back abruptly as if weighted by the maintenance of the album's conceit. I respect The Makers' desire to grow and evolve as musicians, even if-- in fact, especially if-- it seems both aesthetically and economically ill-advised to do so. But ask yourself: do we really need another uninspired T.Rex retread, and if so, do you really want the Makers to be the ones doing it? Me neither.","At a seedy roadhouse three miles off the interstate, a scruffy assembly of skinny boys and girls in tight blue ...

Solaris: Live in Concert,Jah Wobble,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa5fc0084474cd0c11ae/1:1/w_160/4f0227b4.jpg,2002-07-24 05:00:03,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8722-solaris-live-in-concert/,30 Hertz,"Lest anyone confuse this Solaris project with that of Stanislaw Lem, Andrei Tartovsky, or Steven Soderbergh, Jah Wobble has stamped his name on it. Well, naturally. Wobble has again collared four of his reliable old collaborators, keyboardist Harold Budd (from Wobble's Deep Space outfit), cornet-player Graham Haynes and basshead and producer Bill Laswell (both most recently visible on the Laswell/Wobble Radioaxiom album) and former Can skin-botherer Jaki Liebezeit, who appears sporadically throughout the Wobble discography. From this familiar quintet issues forth quite unexpected music. I'm used to Wobble experimenting with world music-- his output is replete with Japanese shakuhatchis, Cretan flutes, and various earthen drums. The Solaris project, however, opts to explore turbulent inner worlds, the vast distances that Tangerine Dream surveyed with their Zeit album, but with the roiling maniac intensity of Ash Ra Tempel's self-titled debut album. That these four tracks were recorded live offers the listener an opportunity to hear this quintet in the raw, without the safety net of a producer demanding a retake. As such, each member has seized the opportunity to kick their performances up several notches, all playing beyond my perceived limits of their abilities. For example, until now I have never fathomed what's so appealing about Graham Haynes' cornet-playing. In each setting I've heard it, it's struck me as more than just a little derivative of Jon Hassell's FX-textured horn work, merely adding a dull synthetic color to the other instruments. But here, Haynes has toughened up his sound, as though he's absorbed the fury and delicacy which British free-jazz luminary Evan Parker brought to Passage to Hades. Two-thirds of the way through the 20-minute opening track, ""The Mystery of Twilight, Pt 1,"" I can believe that Haynes is channeling Dark Magus-era Miles, playing with a conviction and intensity he has never shown in the studio. Though Haynes surprises me, the real revelation on Jah Wobble's Solaris: Live in Concert is pianist Harold Budd. Regarded as the connoisseur's George Winston, Budd memorably collaborated with Brian Eno on Ambient 2: The Plateaux of Mirrors and with the Cocteau Twins for The Moon and the Melodies. His heavily echoed and treated piano style never struck me as anything but decoratively and offensively pleasant. Whatever pill Wobble forced down Budd's throat on this night worked its magic brilliantly. In place of tinkling arpeggios, Budd transforms his piano and keyboards into a mutant army of squalls and blasts determined to annihilate all traces of delicacy. During the opening track, Budd's keyboard attacks actually resemble Eddie Hazel's jaw-dropping solo during Funkadelic's ""Maggot Brain""! And his battalions don't take prisoners, either. I've never heard Jaki Liebezeit so abused. Budd directs the majority of his energies to smothering Liebezeit's metronomic beats, and how refreshing it is to hear Liebezeit so oppressed. I've grown pretty tired of hearing the former Can drummer treated so reverently; whatever he had going on in the 70s has long-since departed. Witness his incredibly mundane work on Burnt Friedmann's Playing Secret Rhythms or Club Off Chaos' records if you need evidence. Liebezeit sounds baffled by the treatment and metronomes, as if ignoring the ceaseless waves of Budd's kamikaze warriors will make them disappear. Only during the final track, ""Around the Lake,"" does Liebezeit find some energy to retaliate. But he knows not to pick on the vastly superior Budd; thus, his stick work stutters around Laswell's stentorian and untroubled bass figure. The listener witnesses a convergence of irresistible force and immovable object until, when ten minutes into the track, Budd's keyboard impersonates Terry Riley's ""A Rainbow in Curved Air."" Bass and drums lay back to watch Budd's intricate balletic melodies dance like deliriously destructive Shiva. Laswell stands tough throughout Solaris. His fuzzed-out bass is reminiscent of his work with Painkiller, the avant-jazz/death-metal that also featured Scorn and Napalm Death's Mick Harris, as well as John Zorn. The shortest track here, ""Seven Dials,"" finds Laswell's bass trading jabs with Haynes' cornet (no contest, by the way-- Haynes doesn't last three minutes). However, Budd mocks Laswell's victory with twee tinkling bells that dance around his lumbering bass. So where's Wobble? His pure-tone bass is almost unnoticeably present. Most prominent on ""The Mystery of Twilight, Pt 2,"" he sounds less like Robbie Shakespeare and more like Mahavishnu Orchestra's Rick Laird. Across the four tracks, Wobble acts as the ground from which the other musicians ferociously emerge. Having given his name prominence in the title, Wobble demurely retreats into inconspicuousness. Not even appropriating the guise of master of puppets, Wobble becomes the catalyst by which the other reactants burn fearsomely bright and scorch the listener with their unbridled audacity.","Lest anyone confuse this Solaris project with that of Stanislaw Lem, Andrei Tartovsky, or Steven Soderbergh, Jah Wobble has stamped ...

The Sepultura EP,North of America,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c42cc0084474cd0c3624/1:1/w_160/66d1ed51.gif,2002-07-24 05:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5839-the-sepultura-ep/,Level Plane,"Wow, Sepultura sure have changed. There used to be a time when their aggressive, thundering riffs could crush your puny skull like so many eggshells and pull your very soul beneath the remains. Of course, they formed in the mid-80s, so maybe Belo Horizonte's favorite sons figured it was time to move on to new things, like, say, screamo and punk. Suffice to say, this new EP does not sound like the same band responsible for metal classics like ""Slave New World"" and ""Bestial Devastation."" But wait-- what's North of America? Wasn't that a Slayer album? Ahh, shit. This isn't Sepultura! Well, now it's all coming together. Turns out, the band is North of America, and The Sepultura is just the title this new EP. How stupid of me. Well, if I've got my Latin roots down (and I don't), I'm thinking that the word 'sepultura' has something to do with burial. And I'm thinking that North of America is just a not-so-clever way of saying 'Canada.' And as it turns out, that's correct-- the quartet hails from Halifax, Nova Scotia, best known in the record business as the home of power-pop all-stars Sloan, also known as the Other Canadian Beatles (first honors go to Klaatu). Despite geographic resemblance, though, North of America's music has really nothing to do with either that of Sloan's or Klaatu's. North of America came together during the initial ramping phase of Millennial fever in 1998, releasing an EP almost immediately and following it with two full-lengths in 1999 and 2001. Yet for all the work they have behind them, The Sepultura paints a picture more similar to that of a band just starting out. Perhaps it's just the vocals that make it seem that way. Scratch that-- it's definitely the vocals. This EP's six songs are packed with the petulant screaming that's turned so-called 'screamo' into such a self-parody over the years. Singing? Well, perhaps once in a while they'll settle down for a nice little melodic passage, but it always leads back to the yelling. It's like one side of an argument from the downstairs apartment. The production doesn't help this sense of a band getting on its feet much, either. There's no space in the mix whatsoever, even when there's admirable space in the playing itself, and every song is basically the same color. Between the lack of differentiation between instruments in the production and the near total lack of strong vocal melodies, songs tend to blur together, relying largely on the generous instrumental passages that inhabit them to help them make their individual marks. Instrumentally speaking, though, these guys are hot. They can clearly play, and they've got rhythm for miles. The bass tone is thick and heavy, ballasting every flailing note and dissonant chord the guitars can muster. The drums play through patterns as frequently as they play straight beats, lending a great deal of complexity to everything the band plays. ""Destroy Tambourine"" opens with drums charging through a forest of nasty riffs and guitar harmonics, and thrashes toward its fire-breathing instrumental bridge, built on a pummeling bassline and frenzied percussion. ""Back Stabbath"" similarly kicks the door open, only to temper itself slightly with a downward tempo shift, though the instrumental assault never truly lets up. By the song's conclusion, it's changed completely, with the band beating out a relentless rhythm in complete unison. The most conventionally conceived song is ""That's a Convincing Argument, Michael,"" which restrains the shouting more than any other song here. The density of the guitar attack actually lets up somewhat in the verses to give the vocals some room, and the band shoves the pedal through the floor on the sung/shouted chorus. The song that shows the most depth and adventurousness, though, is the eight-minute closer ""Font Crimes."" Beginning quietly with just a complex bassline, the rest of the band soon rains down intertwining guitar parts and thundering drums. The first verse is accompanies only by tribal drumming, though everything else crashes back in soon enough. The lengthy coda heads off into quieter, subtler territory, allowing the bass to guide as the cymbals mutate into a lo-fi wash and the guitars settle into oddball ostionatos. So, regardless of whether or not it has anything to do with the band of the same name, The Sepultura is a dense, aggressive, and even occasionally challenging release. It suffers from some fairly common musical ailments-- namely sameness and amateurish vocalness-- but even while these details detract, the overall picture is still something to look at.","Wow, Sepultura sure have changed.

(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan EP,Dntel,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9e0eb335119a49ec8bd/1:1/w_160/c7ccde7c.gif,2002-07-24 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2396-this-is-the-dream-of-evan-and-chan-ep/,Plug Research,"The second single lifted from Dntel's outstanding Life Is Full of Possibilities album, (This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan, could so easily have been in jeopardy. Allowing remix talent free rein on this resplendent jewel puts all I love about it in serious peril. What might ham-fisted, greenback-grubbing remixers do to the melancholy, glitch-inflected pop of Jimmy Tamborello and guest vocalist Ben Gibbard of Death Cab for Cutie? I need not have feared, as Plug Research has commissioned remixes from artists largely in harmony with Tamborello's aesthetic. The downside of that ploy is that I'm not much struck by the somewhat obvious choice of artists here. What would Coil have made of this fractured-beat pop? How about a Vladislav Delay overhaul? Not that those whom Plug Research chose to retool these songs disgrace themselves or trash the songs at all; it's just that some variety might be a nice change-up from these indie remix releases. Plug Research's own Safety Scissors takes the first swing and almost hits the song out of the park, toughening up the winsome accompaniment of the original by spiking the song with electro stabs and squiggles. Safety Scissors has a similarly brusque manner when it comes to Gibbard's performance and the lyrics he sings. In fact, he does away with Gibbard entirely and replaces him with Erlend √òye of Kings of Convenience-- and in homage to Safety Scissors' treatment of Gibbard, √òye feels at liberty to rewrite the lyrics. The nostalgia of the original remains, but now it's bolstered by an awkward gruffness. Barbara Morgenstern, stalwart of the Germany-based Monika label, chooses to leave the instrumental track pretty much untinkered with, save the addition of a church organ to heap on a doomy ambience. Her remix, such as it is, turns the song into a duet. Her vocals closely track Gibbard's, adding only a hint of the melismatics that might earn her a spot in the opening rounds of the next ""American Idol"" competition. The big room remix is Superpitcher, who recasts the song as an eight-minute lo-fi house track. He abides by the axiom that the most memorable house and disco has an air of true melancholy. Fortunately, ""(This Is) The Dream of Evan and Chan"" has plenty of that. Atop the four-to-the-floor glory, Superpitcher sprinkles some grubby flecks of distortion. Then, after a massive peal of bells, he removes all percussion and bass throbs, before finally lending an Astrobotnia vibe to the mix by sliding in a ghostly countermelody that wisps past Gibbard's repeats of ""ringing, ringing, ring off."" Of all the mixes on this disc, this is the one that will attract new comers to Dntel. The fourth and final attempt at adhering to the remixer's Hippocratic Oath (""do no harm"") is Lali Puna's instrumental mix. While the duo does no irreparable damage, they don't do much good with their instrumental mix, either. Much of the charm of the original song lies in Gibbard's fey delivery of the curious melody. Markus Acher and Valerie Trebeljahr substitute that curious but eminently hummable tune with a more meandering alternative. As they proved with their album Scary World Theory, Lali Puna are capable of bringing more hooks out of the vaults than Home Depot shelfstockers. But for this remix, they've wandered past those vaults and into the cold storage lockers where they keep dreary junk they haven't yet parted with. I do note, however, that this remix deflects any criticism that Lali Puna are mere slavish Two Lone Swordsmen copyists. This click-scuffed remix could seamlessly appear on one of Jan Jelinek's ~scape compilations. A new song titled ""The Hill"" is included here as a bonus, with Tamborello assuming vocal duties. While the track is certainly no equal of ""Evan and Chan"" in unabashed charm, Tamborello does manage to match its nostalgia. Over layers of accordions and thoroughbred busted beats, he advises the listener, ""Slide down your hill/ Until you remember how fun it was/ When you were young/ And don't forget to keep it with you when our time is over/ The alarm bell's rung and the week's begun."" ""The Hill"" restates the obvious fact that none of us is getting any younger, but reinforces that that doesn't mean we're destined to become crotchety gits. In fact, absorption of this single and the album that spawned it will nigh on guarantee you youthful vigor and sentiment long after you've made that devastating jump to disposable underwear.","The second single lifted from Dntel's outstanding Life Is Full of Possibilities album, (This Is)\n\ The Dream of ...

V,The Fucking Champs,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be56ea9e61561daa78a6/1:1/w_160/ee97ac79.jpg,2002-07-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3238-v/,Drag City,"You know the story, right? In the mid-90s, Nation of Ulysses guitarist Tim Green joined forces with sympathetic San Francisco souls Tim Soete and Josh Smith (who has been known to shred a few with √ºber-black metal outfit Weakling), and immediately commenced to answer the question of what happens when you combine the strengths of Iron Maiden, Metallica and King Crimson and thrust that ornery beast upon indie rock audiences. The guys' first releases were independent cassettes, recorded as The Champs, which were available only at live shows. Soon after, they were pressured to change the bandname by the 60s group of the same name who'd had a hit with ""Tequila,"" so they opted instead to be known as C4AM95. C4AM95's first official full-length, the double-album III, hit stores in 1997 on Frenetic Records, and witnessed an already fully developed band at the height of their powers dropping not only mind-numbing cock-prog adventures, but also a few electronic vignettes that might not have sounded out of place on the Flash Gordon soundtrack. 2000's IV cut the length in half, but retained the concept entirely-- and it only won them more props. So, in the grand album tradition of Led Zeppelin and, well, Chicago, we now have V. The good news: nothing has changed; the bad news: uh, you like prog-metal, right? Hey, it could be worse (two words: Dream Theater). Besides, I defy anyone to find an ounce of pretension or bloated self-indulgence on this record. Wanky? Maybe, but probably less so than recent collaborators Trans Am, and anyway, the Fucking Champs own pretty much everyone in the super-rock department. There's a school of thought that says you have to make excuses for listening to stuff like this, but that kind of bullshit comes up limp in the face of the Champs' ability to ram a riff down your throat, not to mention their sheer sincerity. The two-part ""Never Enough Neck"" starts things off subtly, with a soft synth chord that crescendos into the crashing, distorted drums and guitars. They hit riffs one right after another, the tempo relentlessly quick and drummer Soete's dexterity stunning. The first part of the tune is fairly melodic, if full of typical Champs' crunch; the second switches up to a decidedly proggy tip, odd time signatures and all. The majestic (or as much as can be said of this band) ""Children Perceive the Hoax Cluster"" is actually a live track, replete with drunken screams and featuring Smith's considerable synthesizer atmospherics. The track forgoes percussive fury in lieu of pure 80s sci-fi mysticism (remember Ladyhawke?). This leads directly into another 80s trip, ""I Am the Album Cover,"" which is something like the shameful instrumental meeting of Iron Maiden and Survivor. To my ears, even though that kind of stuff might get the Champs' more press, I think it could potentially lead to novelty-band status. The track sounds like it may have been an old four-track experiment (the music on this disc dates as far back as '93), so maybe they're focusing on a more idiosyncratic sound now. The best tracks on V are the ones that throw caution and 80s kitsch out the window in favor of chops-ahoy-- like the up-tempo ""Happy Segovia,"" or the epic ""Aliens of Gold,"" which may be the best-ever example of trying to fuse the words 'prog' and 'metal,' while never uttering the word 'sux.' And yes, there is a metal version of a Bach tune here (\xA91723, so say the liner notes), so I suppose even the Fucking Champs aren't above the occasional Spinal Tap move. But you know, it fits right in with the other stuff. So I guess the moral is that if a band is good enough, plays hard enough, and does it without the slightest hint of irony, they can find people who'll love them regardless of the genre. Either that, or resurrecting the ghost of Randy Rhoads is the magic formula for making cool records. What do you think?","You know the story, right?

Reviewer: Haywood, B.R. 7/11/02. First attempt at listening to Helene. Album consists of only one track, a composition featuring a woman reading poetry written by ""renowned New York artist"" (label's words, not mine) Mark Borthwick, atop a simple arpeggiated acoustic guitar pattern. The guitar occasionally cuts out, leaving dead silence. To quell the silence, famed electro-pop wizard Trevor hollAnd tosses diced-up pieces of the Borthwick poetry experience haphazardly back into the sonic landscape. That's all there is. Reviewer can't believe some of the shit that sees official release these days. Reviewer curses name of hollAnd. First attempt ends at 19:56. 7/14/02. Second attempt at listening to Helene. Album still only consists of one track. Reviewer incredulous, fast forwards through disc, looking for 'good parts.' Finding none after 26 minutes, second attempt ends prematurely at 26:15. 7/18/02. Third attempt at listening to Helene. Reviewer spends several hours on car ride to rural North Carolina, wondering if an album with only one track-- nay, only one musical idea-- can be considered an album. Reviewer supposes this is possible, but has his doubts. Reviewer plays Helene for 36 of last 45 minutes of road trip. Second attempt ends at 36 minutes when reviewer is pulled over by police. Reviewer curses name of Borthwick and Officer Hargrove. Still one track. 7/19/02. Fourth attempt at listening to Helene. Reviewer discovers that 10% of rural North Carolina towns are named Hargrove. Finds this less puzzling than the one-track, one-idea album, but puzzling nonetheless. Reviewer still angry at Borthwick, and wishes ill upon his renowned New York career. Despite anger, reviewer completes 39-minute listening experience, then punches self in head. 7/22/02. Fifth (residual) attempt at listening to Helene. Reviewer, in an attempt to rid self of lingering bias, listens to album once more. Reviewer reads another review to supplement own listening experience, learns that Helene was originally soundtrack to a gallery/performance piece (for Big Shot Borthwick, of all people). Helene beginning to make more sense. Still crap. Conclusion: Reviewer concludes, after three attempted and two completed listening experiences, that Helene is like a wedding video: if you were at the wedding, the video brings back fond memories; if you weren't, the video is perhaps only slightly more exciting than the wedding album. Similarly, Helene probably worked better when it accompanied Borthwick's artwork. Now it merely serves Borthwick, hollAnd, and their former patrons as a nice reminder of some fine month in Manhattan. All those not in attendance should steer clear.","REVIEW LOG

"Nortec Collective: Tijuana Sessions, Vol. 1",Various Artists,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7c413d19756521394c7/1:1/w_160/d8c39f73.gif,2002-07-23 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1954-nortec-collective-tijuana-sessions-vol-1/,Palm,"For those in the U.S., Tijuana has always had a sketchy reputation. Located on the far west coast of Mexico, just across the border from San Diego, the city became popular as a den of iniquity during the Prohibition era. Even today Californian teens ventures in droves over to the huge strip of bars and clubs on Revolucion Avenue, to take advantage of the 18-and-up drinking age. Of course, in the last decade or so Tijuana has become known for its maquiladoras, touted as the successful model for modernization under NAFTA: factories in which electronic components and other materials are assembled by cheap labor and then shipped back to the States duty-free. But the city has hardly shed the dangerous aura of la frontera-- a fact probably best symbolized in the 1994 murder of presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio as he was stumping for votes there. The Nortec Collective make every effort to show another, more artistic side of Tijuana, separate from debauchery and thug life. Yet it's hard not to imagine even the drunken touristas and narco bosses getting down to the raucous Nortec style that's been created. As legend has it, Pepe Mogt first began thinking about a connection between techno and traditional Mexican music while at a wedding listening to norte√±o, a form of folk music played on accordions, tubas, guitars and different types of drums. The polyrhythmic flair of the percussion and the accompanying brass lines make for a festive, parade-like air, and the sense of kitsch it invokes means the music is only popular in the north of Mexico. It's mostly favored by adults-- the youth aren't as into the traditionalism. But Mogt had other ideas. Together with his friend Jorge Ruiz (soon to be his partner in techno act Fussible), they collected outtakes from norte√±o studio sessions and began to fuse the samples with electronica. They got with a group of friends, all of whom were soon to have their own projects, and began to distribute tapes of the newly-made music at parties and clubs. The story is old news, of course-- some of these tracks were recorded as far back as '99, and in the following two years spread like wildfire from Tijuana's student population to the homes of just about anybody who'd ever moved their feet to dance. Thus, the Nor-tec phenomenon began, named alternately for the Norte of Mexico, or for the norte√±o music it came from. The Collective eventually caught the interest of Island Records' Chris Blackwell, who released The Tijuana Sessions, Vol. 1 on his Palm Pictures boutique label. Absent the hype from features in Time magazine and elsewhere, it's easier to see that Nortec is popular first and foremost because it's damn good dance music. Bostich kicks off the set with ""Polaris,"" his international hit. It's interesting that he's considered the godfather of the Nortec crowd, because his songs are the farthest removed from what is conventionally considered 'danceable' techno. Digitally modified accordion static and tuba blurts bring a strong Latin vibe to the mix, soon augmented by crashing conga rhythms and keyboard hum. The marching band atmosphere is preserved despite the electronic elements, making for a solid opener. Fussible come next with ""Casino Soul,"" sliding in on a bank of synthesizers and following with sharp 70s horn riffs. The catchy thrust of the bongo beats reminds me of the enthusiasm of Dubtribe Sound System's organic house. Despite the emphasis on their Mexican heritage, the Collective rests, for the most part, firmly in the house music tradition; it's just that their use of live instruments and polyrhythmic breakdowns add fresh flavor to the club scene. PaxF3ptica's ""and L"" (nice pun) descends into the submerged bass and synth-sonar of deep house, but the high-pitched percussive rumble on top casts it all into beautiful contrast. Likewise, Plankton Man gives us ""Elemento N,"" whose meandering intro suddenly coalesces into a driven progressive house number laced with solemn, noirish guitar work. It's a smart compilation, careful to keep the listening side of the spectrum happy as well. Clorofila slows the pace just a bit with ""Cantamar '72,"" as the sound of waves washes between the stereo channels. The chillout atmosphere is deceiving, though, and before you know it the bass and drums drop into a sexy funk groove. Terrestre takes it one step further on ""El Lado Oscuro de Mi Compadre,"" as an army of percussion samples rise up and clash together in a collage worthy of DJ Shadow. It's a strangely tense, claustrophobic piece for the compilation, far from the melancholy musings that Fernando Corona's becoming more known for recently as Murcof. All the better that he also offers up one of the classic dance cuts on the sampler, ""Norte√±o de Janeiro."" I challenge you vocoder-phobes out there to convince me that the joyous, slightly wistful vocals here don't make for the most perfectly sublime chorus. The Tijuana Sessions grows on you until you realize that, beyond all the hype, these guys are making innovative dance music worth getting excited about. There may be a few missteps, as with Hiperboreal's ""Tijuana for Dummies,"" whose condescending title doesn't do much to make up for the mid-90s tribal techno stylings it rehashes. And on ""No Liazi Jaz,"" Plankton Man makes the mistake of coating his horn lines in ultra-synthesized, E-Z listening syrup. But the suggestions of retro atmosphere throughout the disc, hidden here and there in the melodies, aren't much of a problem. The Nortec artists are hinting at the relationship between past and future, one articulated now in the present between their music and the norte√±o and banda sinaloense it springs from. They've become so popular on the dancefloor because they make music tailored to dancers, full of progressions and careful breaks that guide the body. Though the producers have their own label in Mil Records, Nortec has become more than just a musical collective these days: fashion designers are forming futuristic Nortec rave clothes by updating traditional rural garb, urban artists are tagging the city in their own image through Nortec-derived stencils, and the government of Mexico has even sponsored a forum connecting the musicians with eager students of the aesthetic. Nortec is getting mixed into DJ sets abroad as well, particularly in Germany where the polka origins of norte√±o still resonate. This is true cultural syncretism, the ideal genesis of new art out of the reverence of old, and especially important in its self-reliance. The maquiladoras are now moving slowly but steadily to China to take advantage of the $.20 - $.25 per hour average working wage (versus Mexico's $1.50)-- so much for the permanent benefits of free trade! In the meantime, check out the Nortec sound: it's more vital than whatever Eighteenth Street Lounge is pumping out, and you're not likely to come across as the annoying World Beat kid on your block. If you're interested in the evolution of electronic dance music, this is not a style to let slip by.","For those in the U.S., Tijuana has always had a sketchy reputation.

Pocket Symphonies for Lonesome Subway Cars,Casiotone for the Painfully Alone,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a543c0084474cd0c069f/1:1/w_160/f4c9dfc5.gif,2002-07-23 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1337-pocket-symphonies-for-lonesome-subway-cars/,Tomlab,"On the instrument respect scale, Casio keyboards have got to be pretty darn close to the bottom-- somewhere around guitars with built-in amplifiers and ukuleles. Nevertheless, they score remarkably high in the sentimental value category. The first synthesizer budget-priced enough to serve as Christmas tree fodder for late-80s twelve and thirteen year-olds, the Casio has provided many of us with fond memories of one-finger jam sessions to a brisk rhumba preset, trying to decide whether the so-called 'violin' or 'trumpet' setting was a more appropriate voicing. My own model was the beautiful PT-87, complete with ROM disk port that allowed me to play along with hits of the day like ""Dancing in the Dark"" and ""Walk of Life."" Still, like Casio's drinking buddy Atari, there's a certain amount of kitsch value attached to the instrument that prevents one from taking it too seriously. Which is why the idea of a mostly-Casio album that purports to consist of melancholy compositions for lonely souls is a little cognitively dissonant, like a collection of funeral marches performed on Rapman and Drum Buddy. So throughout Casiotone for the Painfully Alone's second LP, a listener's not quite sure whether to giggle, reminisce about soft-focus juvenile keyboard experiences, or mope along with CFTPA solitaire-junkie Owen Ashworth. Fortunately, when recorded right (read: poorly), Ashworth's digital friend is no less effective a tool for found-art, spontaneous-style tuning as the acoustic guitar most one-man acts choose. The obvious com-parallel-ison here would be Mountain Goat John Darnielle, who has been known to include the occasional Casio throwdown on his own albums, and whose minimal, hiss-laden approach to production Ashworth apes here. Actually, he emulates more than just Darnielle's recording style: Ashworth also borrows the fragmentary song structure (the 3:43 ""Destroy the Evidence"" is a downright epic), occasional spoken-wordish delivery, and even has a geographically oriented breakup song titled ""Oh, Illinois!"" But where Darnielle's keyboard jams never quite match up with the monophonic vibrancy of his primary instrument, Ashworth shows a knack for augmenting his flimsy instrument with his meager means. Copious amounts of fuzz grant the keyboard's rudimentary, built-in drumbeats significantly more texture (""Oh, Contessa!,"" ""Yr Boyfriend"") and the old over-distortion technique allows him to squeeze some impressively noisy waves out of the little guy (""Bus Song""). Occasionally, when songs go on longer than fifty seconds, these elements allow for a surprisingly full sound that could almost pass for New Order streaming at 28.8 kbps, with just about as much melodic appeal. I'm thinking ""We Have Mice"" and ""Suitcase in Hand"" for you MP3-sampling types. And yet, it remains tough to overlook the central gimmick of the album, and despite the rather valiant efforts of Ashworth, the Casio shows its limitations in setting a somber tone. Little touches like the push-button tempo shift of ""The Subway Home"" or the hyper-minimalist song-frag ""Dying Batteries"" may be cute, but they counteract the album's thesis that the instrument is not mere junk-store novelty. You gotta doff your cap to Ashworth, though, as Pocket Symphonies for Lonesome Subway Cars turns out to contain a few yards more depth than I would ever have imagined my childhood keyboard could provide. Only now do I feel stunted for never progressing beyond those ROM-accompanied versions of ""Greensleeves.""","On the instrument respect scale, Casio keyboards have got to be pretty darn close to the bottom-- somewhere around guitars ...

Thought for Food,The Books,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a341b1335d7bf16986be/1:1/w_160/c0d0f882.jpg,2002-07-23 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/854-thought-for-food/,Tomlab,"Every once in a while a record like this one appears out of the ether without clear reference points. Web details on The Books are sketchy, but I have ascertained that they're a duo consisting of guitarist Nick Zammuto, who lives in North Carolina and has released some solo material under his surname, and cellist Paul de Jong, who lives in New York and has composed for dance, theater and film. After that, the pool of Books information dries up fast. The music is similarly unknowable, in the sense that it's difficult to classify. Musicians famously hate to be 'put into a box'; well, if more bands sounded quite as original as The Books, the practice would likely cease. If this record is the product of any sort of 'scene,' it's not one I've heard of. Thought for Food is going to sit comfortably in my collection in its own little category, a small world unto itself. Despite Thought for Food's unique sound, the record, on one level, is not hard to pin down. The musical elements are so simple and commonplace that describing them is not a problem. What's difficult is conveying how these few everyday pieces are placed together so artfully to create something this striking and unique. I'll give that a shot later, but first-- what sort of music are we talking about here? Essentially, three different things go into nearly every Books song: there is always a guitar, usually acoustic; there is usually a stringed instrument, either cello or violin or both; and there are always sampled vocal fragments. That's basically it. Two tracks have a few bars of soft singing, while another, ""Mikey Bass,"" has some bass work by a guy named Mikey. Sporadic percussion and a few other instruments are scattered here and there, but the guitar/strings/samples troika is the meat of The Books. These three instruments are recorded and then cut up and arranged via computer. Sounds boring, you say? Think again. Somehow, The Books manage to turn these meager components into something touching, quirky and profound. The fact that vocal samples (which we can all agree have been done to death) sound new again here is nothing short of amazing. I'm not completely sure how they do it, though I know that the unusual amount of empty space in this record is part of it. While the rule of thumb for music with a collage approach has always been to stuff the samples into every nook and cranny, The Books let all the sounds breathe. In addition to the folky guitar, strings and the voice samples, silence is really the fourth primary instrument. Another great thing about the record is the way the samples, though they at first seem random, manage to tell a story. ""Read, Eat, Sleep"" contains slow guitar plucking that alternates between two chords and some gentle, bell-like synth accents. Over the barely-there musical backing, voices spell out ""r-e-a-d- e-a-t- s-l-e-e-p"" as distant sound effects appear. As the track winds down, different voices start repeating various pronunciations of the word ""aleatoric."" Finally, the main voice, which sounds like it could be the host of a spelling bee, clarifies: ""By digitizing thunder and traffic noises, Georgia was able to compose aleatoric music."" Ah, yes, aleatoric, a word meaning composition by use of chance. As he speaks his final word, the last ring of the guitar fades out, and you realize that the sampled dialog had been describing the process of the track as it unfolded. ""Contempt"" references the Jean-Luc Godard film of the same name. It contains a measured exchange between two men, with one asking the other the questions Brigitte Bardot asked her husband in the film: ""What about my ankles, do you like them?"" and ""My thighs... do you think they're pretty?"" Recontextualized here, the song takes on humorous overtones, as the men seem relaxed and speak slowly as if they're engaged in a job interview. The musical accompaniment to this dialog is a swaying waltz-time duet between plucked guitar and slightly screechy violin, and the tension that builds through the track is palpable. ""All Our Base Are Belong to Them"" could be live, it's hard to tell. Someone is strumming a guitar and then a voice starts counting down from ten, ""Space Oddity""-style. When he hits ""one,"" a noisy chord is played and four of five people cheer. Instead of annoying, though, the background chatter sounds wonderful against the guitar and picked banjo, as the vocals (the only real singing on the album) sing something close to Pink Floyd's ""Mother,"" sans-melodrama. It's warm and cozy wherever this is being recorded, even though something feels vaguely alien and unfamiliar. A disturbing vocal exchange opens ""Motherless Bastard,"" as a man speaking to a small child says, ""You have no mother and father... they left, they went somewhere else."" The tune that follows this sampled intro is a pretty folk strum, the melodicism of Fahey without the flash or technique. Indeed, if I had to name one clear forbearer for The Books, John Fahey would be it. The odd combination of folk guitar forms and aural collage seem at least tangentially related to his experiments. But the pleasure to be had from Thought for Food has nothing to do with musical referencing. This modest and unusual album stands on its own as a quiet triumph-- one unlike anything I've ever heard before.","Every once in a while a record like this one appears out of the ether without clear reference points.

Black City,Division of Laura Lee,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9a7eb335119a49ec82d/1:1/w_160/1e6f88f6.jpg,2002-07-22 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2343-black-city/,EpitaphBurning Heart,"So far, all my attempts to breathe a little life into our economy in these troubled times have met with little success. Selling off unopened vials of Andy Warhol's crystal meth on eBay (to collectors) got me a small fortune, but markets still remained stagnant, and apparently my idea for what I called an 'automobile' had been developed more than a century earlier. No matter how hard I tried to stimulate the economy, she rejected all of my Initial Public Offerings. I was near the end of my rope when, while sipping martinis off the stomachs of prostitutes with my good friend Ken Lay, he gave me a tip on a little known subsidiary of the Laura Lee corporation. This Division of Laura Lee was primarily concerned with producing the very sort of politically charged rock that should have been just the thing to jumpstart the markets and restore investor confidence. I was sold. After a series of hasty eleventh hour negotiations, the Division of Laura Lee was divested from its parent company, The Cayman Islands Offshore Holding Corporation, and I was about to learn, too late, that the Division would have a hard enough time vitalizing my stereo speakers, let alone a bear market. The Sweden-based Division was allegedly taking cues from the Stooges and the Jesus and Mary Chain, among other successful ventures, so I immediately called my old frat buddy Alan Greenspan to come over and give them a listen. We played badminton and swilled some homemade rye whiskey, and I cranked out the sounds of Black City, the Division's latest product. The swaggering bass and crash of guitars at the heart of opener ""Got to Get Some"" didn't call to mind of any of their self-reported influences, but it was solid and infectious, even if the siren-like background electronics were a little over-the-top. Greenspan flippantly dismissed the boys as ""The (International) Noise Conspiracy, with synths,"" but he doesn't hold the cards in this particular review (though his thorough examinations of Cerberus Shoal and Earth Crisis are nothing to scoff at). Undeterred, I stuck to my guns and was immediately pleased as ""We've Been Planning This for Years"" took the slow burn of the lead track and intensified it. ""Planning"" exploded like a powderkeg out of the opener's ashes; Per Stalberg's cries of ""money will break your fall"" coupled the political savvy I'd been looking for with a musclebound onslaught of riffs and fills. ""Number One"" continued the landslide of guitar-fueled aggression. Most of the band's time was spent railing against the evils of capitalistic profit ideals, but none of that was of any import with a delivery this sweeping, passionate and invigorating. Beneath the slick, barbed hooks I could almost hear the markets strengthening. Alan was reserving judgment, though; he muttered something about whether or not the band could maintain this level of activity. Sure, it might have been a fluke, but the first three tracks showed consistent growth and I was willing to bank on them. Alan was right, though, as fucking usual. Prescient bastard. The energy of the opening proved to be just a first-quarter surge. The moment I took Black City public, the bubble of enthusiasm surrounding the early tracks burst, and the rest of the album lost its footing. ""Trapped In"" and ""I Guess I'm Healed"" started to take the Division in entirely the wrong direction. These lazy, weak-kneed stabs at vaguely sinister slow numbers were D.O.A.; the Division just didn't seem to be able to infuse them with enough soul. For the same reasons, ""I Walk on Broken Glass"" tanked like Iraqi Special Forces. In context, it was more like the Division just needed a break, rather than actually wanting to produce the sort of sincere, intimate ballads they were trying their hand at. Rumors spread on Wall Street that my Division of Laura Lee had been artificially inflating their rock acumen and investors fled. I was out like Worldcom. In their defense, the Swedes made a few more passable attempts to recapture the spirit of Black City's early moments to show that they wouldn't drop without a fuss. There were a handful more barnburners left-- notably ""Pretty Electric"" and ""Access Identity""-- but with the spotty pacing of the remainder of their portfolio, it just never felt as natural as their initial strutting posture. Eventually, the Division of Laura Lee's Black City turned in a modestly successful effort, interspersed with a few hits and misses, although even at its best it wasn't anything that hadn't been done before. My options had taken a nose-dive, and I finally knew what it meant to have the financial rug pulled out from under me. The moral of the story was obvious: listen to Alan Greenspan, and when a band promises non-stop rocking, make sure their heart is in it before you bet the farm.","So far, all my attempts to breathe a little life into our economy in these troubled times have met with ...

Nobody Knows,Geeez'n'Gosh,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf01c0084474cd0c2f8a/1:1/w_160/d03a2895.jpg,2002-07-22 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3414-nobody-knows/,Mille Plateaux,"Jesus gets worship in many different forms. Some of his devotees whip themselves until their skin is a bloody mockery of normality. Some spend decades in the deserts with nothing but the burning sun and the freezing cold for companionship, and the occasional locust for nutrition. Others allow poisonous snakes to inject them with venom so that Jesus' healing power might neutralize the effects of the serpent's fatal alkalines. A prolific electronic prankster and man of many guises (Atom Heart, Se√±or Coconut, Lassigue Bendthaus, to mention just a few of his masks), Uwe Schmidt praises Jesus by imprisoning the voices of gospel singers in his hard drive. Nobody Knows is Schmidt's second stab at creating the definitive motherboard devotional microhouse glitch album. But having listened to the result many times, I'm forced into concluding that his first attempt, My Life with Jesus, came closer to meeting his goal. The primary reason Nobody Knows packs a smaller wallop than its predecessor is simply the lack of a killer track. My Life with Jesus floored me with ""Soul of Mine""-- a bucking house groove rhythmically offset with shards of glitch atop of which an uncredited female voice sang of her soul's certain journey back to God. In intensity and sincerity, ""Soul of Mine"" is rivaled only by Ralph Stanley's ""O, Death"" and Virginia Rodrigues' inspired performance of the spiritual ""I Want to Be Ready."" Throughout Nobody Knows, Uwe Schmidt plays more for the microhouse community than to anyone more interested in the recontexulizing of gospel. And when Schmidt does throw something out for the latter group, he chooses easy targets. Case in point: the stupidly obvious retooling of ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot."" Fans who come for the microhouse, however, suffer no such indignities or disappointments. ""It's No Secret (What God Can Do)"" is Schmidt's most rarefied abstraction of unearthly sounds; their brooding propulsion forces the listener to recall the opening verses of the first chapter of Genesis. ""The Love of God"" begins in a similarly portentous fashion-- as an inexorable climatic movement towards thunderousness before Schmidt drops in the sample, an enraptured gent soulfully crooning about ""The Love of God."" Here, Schmidt uses the sample and its juxtaposition to say something about the fervor of religious conviction and his respect for it. But elsewhere, Schmidt throws his respect aside. ""Pray"" uses a sample of a woman singing only the song's namesake as just another rhythmic element in his complexly funky arrangements. Likewise, strip out the male voice repeating the word 'Jesus' during ""Sing You Children"" and you have boilerplate Mille Plateaux glitch. Yet even when Schmidt panders to the godless IDM listserve subscribers, he proves that he can turn out a spastic drill-n-glitch ravey roof-raiser such as ""I'm Determined (Jesus Changed My Soul)."" In these moments, no one could seriously doubt Schmidt's prodigious skills as a programmer and musician, even if he is capable of much more satisfying and unique material. The central mystery of Nobody Knows is that nobody knows how ironic Schmidt is being with these tracks. I have no doubt that he was sincere and reverential on My Life with Jesus-- he took uncommon care to preserve the honesty and the message of those whose devotions he sampled and contorted into his sparse house grooves. But I can't say the same for Nobody Knows. The gold-embossed, pixilated depiction of Jesus and the copperplate font of the cover art are a major indication of Schmidt's cheekiness. It's technology and the programming intricacy that fascinates him here. Under other circumstances, I'd be at least as fascinated by his talent. But by mixing in these very emotional performances, in which the singers reveal their innermost and cherished hopes for a better life after death, I feel Schmidt has robbed them of some of their dignity and belittles their faith. Without any reason to criticize Schmidt's exemplary production and composition, your acceptance of Nobody Knows will pivot on how strongly you respect the religious convictions of others, or appreciate Schmidt's cavalier attitude towards them.","Jesus gets worship in many different forms.

This Flag Signals Goodbye,Swearing at Motorists,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5f713d19756521390a0/1:1/w_160/81caae6c.jpg,2002-07-22 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7650-this-flag-signals-goodbye/,Secretly Canadian,"Undisputed king of the lawyer-poets Wallace Stevens might have gotten his clock cleaned by Ernest Hemingway in an embarrassingly brief restaurant brawl, but he only met one abstraction he couldn't whup: everydayness. ""The malady of the quotidian,"" as he called it, reduced life to a nondescript paralysis, as one's routine eclipses the ""dumbly pent"" self and a universal conveyor belt outpaces one's own drive. This feeling can leave one hankering for the coming afternoon when technology is so extravagant and handy that self-hate and ennui can be cathartically dispatched by committing genocide on a roomful of one's clones. Somehow, Swearing at Motorists' Dave Doughman finds inspiration in the quotidian; chronicling successions of unremarkable moments as if they were epiphanic is his stock in trade. Cramming fourteen songs into thirty minutes, this latest album's lyrics are impressionistic to the point of seeming like impulsive postcards or manic answering machine messages set to music. Anything can be a song: seeing an acquaintance in traffic, pressing buttons in an elevator, stumbling around drunk, stumbling around stoned, going to a show, watching TV up late-- even leaving the DC borough Adams Morgan warrants an evocative 40-second ditty. A previous album actually boasted an ode to a relationship stunted at an impasse over the work of Robin Williams. I wanted to know what Doughman's secret was. How did he maintain such a high tolerance for the abyss, for the sound and fury that signify jack-diddly? I stalked Swearing at Motorists for three shows to find out, only to be befuddled by why this band insists on being a rickety two-piece in concert. This Flag Signals Goodbye lays claim to full, multi-tracked walls of competing guitar tones, accompanied by Joseph Siwinksi's dramatic drumming, and keyboards, banjos, and trumpets, next to none of which is harnessed live. Doughman even leaps and slides apoplectically, as if he's hearing more than what's coming through the PA. The third time I saw him, he performed by himself, and I couldn't help but think during his cover of ""Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want"" that he was asking for an effing band to spontaneously manifest. He's fascinating to watch, at once: the basement rocker who brings the basement with him the skinny guy just Manson enough to fight you the Angus Young spoof artist Angus Old the unambitious firstborn son who pathologically oversleeps the public access troubadour the clever Bizarro-Jesus lookalike who plays ""Galaga"" before the performance and asks for mushrooms during it and the show-taping dynamo who makes up songs on the spot about the weather, the bar's neon signs, and bleached-blonde audience members talking too loud on their cellphones (""Daytona Beach is over,"" Doughman came into the crowd and told her, then sang a song about how he doesn't disturb her job at Whataburger, so why does she hamper his?) Doughman hails straight outta the gray, gridded neighborhoods of Pollardville (Dayton), and shares GBV's urge to redeem cotton-mouthed drudgery in imaginative pop drapes. Though his detractors claim to hear an indie-rock Mellencamp, his songs blend elements of an avalanche of impressive touchstones-- most pronouncedly the Meat Puppets, Nirvana, and Jonathan Richman, though ""Fan Mail for a Criminal"" raucously dips the early Pixies in early Pavement, and ""The Real Thing"" could be smuggled onto a 764-Hero LP without detection. Many of the tracks are love songs written too late to save anything, as the speaker's general ""I"" mourns the seismographic arc spent with a (sometimes off-puttingly) specific ""you."" Reassuringly, some folks can still appreciate affection as being more than misfiltered attention, and can muster belief that love isn't just an absurd ritual concocted to guarantee an audience for one's orgasms. Nostalgia is the only thing that stumps Doughman. ""I can't seem to think past the past,"" he sings, crippled when his ""mind's in reverse."" This sentiment should comfort anyone with a tendency to crawl up yesterday's ass for naptime. After playing an old song at his solo show, he said, without pretense or false modesty: ""Huh. I used to be clever sometimes."" Unless recycled chord progressions or muted string-scraping gets you down, This Flag Signals Goodbye holds up replay after replay, its only fault being that some of the riskily earnest lyrics, if slightly recontextualized (say, if Tenacious D sung them) would be hilarious (Kraft example: ""All I want for Christmas is you,"" etc). This singalong knows that it's slight, even as it skirts the heinous detritus of post-love love and summons the cloud whose job it is to always rain on that one small section of the interstate. Postpone your yammering pursuit of misery with this album that acknowledges its limits when Doughman honors an epidemic of premature conclusions with the refrain ""I can't seem to makes these things last.""","Undisputed king of the lawyer-poets Wallace Stevens might have gotten his clock cleaned by Ernest Hemingway in an embarrassingly brief ...

Winter's Kill,New Radiant Storm King,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3e65e6ef9596932392c/1:1/w_160/b89ebd18.jpg,2002-07-22 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5774-winters-kill/,Rainbow Quartz,"What the hell happened to these guys? They sort of just fell off the map completely. Weren't they at one time supposed to be the ""next big thing"" in indie rock? The next Pavement, I seem to recall. Yep, back in the day, New Radiant Storm King had all the right connections: they called Amherst, Massachusetts home and hung with the Scud Mountain Boys, Guided by Voices, and the Silver Jews, among others. They even had a breakthrough album with 1996's Hurricane Necklace. Everyone I knew loved that record when it was first released, and it's a bit curious that nobody seems to remember it now. Reason for this, I hypothesize, has something to do with the combination of slacker-rock being dead and gone (at least until its impending revival in 2011), and that the band was, frankly, completely and totally cursed when its came to record labels. Suffice it to say they were just one of many talented bands to fall through the cracks when Rough Trade's American division folded-- and that was just the beginning of their problems. They soldiered on, but during the past few years, the band simply disappeared, its members presumably pursing higher degrees. Now, after much line-up shifting and label-hopping, New Radiant Storm King have pulled it together for Winter's Kill. At the center of the band remains the songwriting duo of Peyton Pinkerton and Matt Hunter, sharing vocal duties (both with a slightly affected British accent) and swapping guitar, bass, and a whole basement full of keyboards. Sadly, what they've turned out is far from groundbreaking. What it is is a solid collection of short, complex, introspective pop songs, sounding a lot like GBV if Pollard went on a heavy singer/songwriter-record-and-used-book-buying binge. Right from the first song, ""In the Spirit of Distance,"" it's obvious these guys still have too many brain cells left to be compared too closely with GBV, talking about ""a portrait of Dorian Gray"" and all, though the melody does seem to lift from those other notorious drunkards, the Replacements-- most notably their song ""Sixteen."" On ""Golden Parachute,"" the Radiant ones drop little nuggets of wisdom on you like, ""Keep your suitcase close to your heart,"" while the shimmering Rhodes-heavy ""Colony Falls"" imparts, ""You need to get lost to find out what you know."" Hey, it's a didactic album, and worthy lessons all, if delivered a bit on the stiff and stodgy side. And that's really the only fault with this album: many of the songs are a bit too precious and sober. I respect restraint as long as it's kept in check. On Winter's Kill, though, I found myself wanting the odd little tempo changes or spaced-out interludes (such as the finale ""View of a Wedding through the Hubble Telescope"") to stray into weirder territory, and on the rare occasions where the band attempts to kick out the jams, it would've been nice had they been kicked with a wee bit more oomph. But maybe I'm just missing the higher subtleties. I can see how this album is a consciously constructed 'grower.' It's not the work of a band trying to capture some quick attention with clumsy stabs at the latest trends, and in some ways, with its lack of laptop glitchery and primal screaming, it does come off somewhat conservative. But maybe it's for this very reason that this album could prove to hold up better than the recent work of some other members of indie rock's illustrious Class of '92.","What the hell happened to these guys?

You know as well as I do that the Master of Puppets tape that fused itself to the inside of your boombox when you left it out in the sun while painting your parents' garage in '94 no longer captures your sweaty summertime bummer. Your frustrations are too complex now to climax with ""Damage, Inc."" Lucky for me, I happened across the perfect musical accompaniment to my lazy, hazy, wallowing-in-doubt-and-anxiety, dirty south, palmetto-bug-battlin' summer mope-fest: And the Surrounding Mountains by the Radar Brothers. Its vaguely depressive lyrics and wide-angle spaciousness suits my ambivalence to these hotter months perfectly, with just the right amount of intro/extro-spection to keep me going until Autumn comes to cool the blood. I've listened to this album for almost two weeks straight now, enough to know that it's not going to wear off before the heat does. And that's despite the utterly stupefying simplicity of its component parts. Most of these songs shuffle along at the same slow, swaggering tempo with little sonic variation: they're usually built around acoustic guitar and warm analog synths, with vocalist Jim Putnam's David Gilmour-meets-Kermit tenor floating above in a languid drawl of humid acquiescence. Yet the album never loses itself in its own mired apathy; it instead maps a comfortable niche where mercury rises to meet a setting sun and dread, drugs and death are the only necessary comforts. Indeed, the Radar Brothers are smart to stick with what works, and as the album proceeds, each song seems to cozily sink into the next like sweat into faded t-shirts. Radar Brothers are usually lumped in with slowcore groups of the Low variety, and there's a reason for that. But it's a better point of reference for their earlier albums, as they've expanded their sound here to position themselves along the lysergic axis of Mercury Rev and the Flaming Lips. Admittedly, they're far less overtly weird than Wayne Coyne-- no psychedelic parables starring giant robots as grim death-- and rather than orchestral bombast and angelic ghost-choirs, they summon a distinctly mellow California vibe incorporating only the mundane guitar, piano and occasional synth. And the Surrounding Mountains begins with the grand and spacious sound of soaring harmonies and crashing cymbals, like the dawn breaking on a vast mountain range, while Putnam intones a vaguely threatening line to clue us in that all is not well under the bright blue, cloudless sky. The album peaks with ""Rock of the Lake,"" the band perfecting their hallmarks: the spacy keys, the slow, swaying rhythm, and lyrics both strangely comforting and sinister. Elsewhere, the Bros. get Floydian with ""Uncles,"" which recalls More-era fluidity, and ""Mountains,"" which could pass for a condensed version of one of Roger Waters' epic side-spanners. Familial themes run through the record-- first there's ""You and the Father,"" followed by ""Sisters,"" ""Uncles,"" and ""Mothers"" (and lest we forget, the band's name is Radar Brothers)-- but otherwise, there's no clear thread uniting these songs into a singular concept. It's better that way, though, so that these tracks can work in all kinds of situations: indoor, outdoor, alone, with friends, morning, night-- an essential component of any summer soundtrack. So climb outta that hammock and put down that glass of Country Time. Get in your car. You needed to pick up some more fertilizer today anyway. Stop off at your local record shop, and pick up a copy of And the Surrounding Mountains. I promise, it'll be worth your while. And if I'm wrong, ""Leper Messiah"" will still be waiting for you back at the house.","Don't you think it's time you got around to choosing that all-important Summer Album? I mean, it's ...

Light Green Leaves,Little Wings,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd2beb335119a49ece07/1:1/w_160/d29eb0e3.jpg,2002-07-21 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4817-light-green-leaves/,K,"Forgive me for falling into journalistic convention here but the truism remains: a band's moniker can speak volumes about their career. Need illustration in the form of snarky and hyper-referential 'single serving' synopses? I think we'll get along... Smashing pumpkins may seem a fun and exciting enterprise to adolescent suburbia, but loses its appeal with age. The U2, although once the silent ruler of the sky, seems a distant memory in our collective cultural consciousness since becoming a symbol of political turmoil and skewered international relations rather than an exacting weapon of intelligence. ""Little wings,"" however, appear to be an obvious evolutionary misstep-- appendages that serve no purpose to their host, other than as visible reminders of how futile and zealous nature can be in its rampant experimentalism. Likewise, if I was K records, I'd be in the bathroom with a saw and some ointment right now. Taking musical cues from the Oldham family side project, The Anomoanon, Little Wings' sparse-mountain-folk-by-way-of-warbly-vocals consciously vies with Will and the gang for marketing dominance over the indie community's wildly profitable bourbon-swilling infant demographic. While it's to lead-singer/songwriter Kyle Field's credit that the child-like observations and paradoxically pensive optimism found throughout Light Green Leaves never lapse into a parody of the genre, the fact remains that there's nothing to distinguish Little Wings from their sonic forebears. That, juxtaposed with song titles that occasionally come off as cutting-room-floor dialogue for the Bj√∂rk vehicle Dancer in the Dark, (""Boom!"", ""iii"", ""Si Si"", etc.), makes it pretty apparent that what we have here is just another mediocre addition to the litany of alt-country revivalists. That isn't to say that Fields is content with simply churning out product. While it's true that Light Green Leaves acts as nothing more than a reiteration of Little Wings' heralded ""Wonder Trilogy,"" the spare and evocative delivery of such tracks as ""Uh-Oh (It's Morningtime Again)"" and ""Under Your Blanket"" finds the group coming extraordinarily close to transcending their limited musical vocabulary. Unfortunately, the record gives more indications of stagnation than of progress, asking the listener to marvel at how many disingenuous folk songs one man can author in the shortest given period of time, rather than invoking the wide-eyed wonder the lyrics would suggest. Upon its release, Light Green Leaves will be available in three different formats, each chronicling the album in a different stage of completion. A fairly presumptuous move on the group's part, considering their relatively small fanbase. Maybe Kyle Field's exhausting his musical catalog so as to prepare himself for a complete 'revisioning.' His close friendship with the Microphones' Phil Elvrum couldn't hurt, though I doubt Elvrum has had much time to exert his influence, what with being nominated for saint-hood by Pitchfork's recently established Our Lady of the Lo-Fi and producing Mirah's excellent Advisory Committee. But, knowing the luck of the buying public, Field is just readying himself for a breakthrough collaboration with Shel Silverstein.","Forgive me for falling into journalistic convention here but the truism remains: a band's moniker can speak\n\ volumes ...

The Golden Dove,Mary Timony,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7b5b1335d7bf16990ee/1:1/w_160/d975431d.jpg,2002-07-21 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8066-the-golden-dove/,Matador,"Mary Timony is about exactly as famous as she needs to be. Having begun her musical career with DC's Autoclave with Christine Billotte of Slant 6 (and more recently Quixotic), she soon assumed Mary Lou Lord's position in Boston-based Helium, releasing three fantastic pop records and a handful of singles. Since that band's 1998 demise, Timony has sustained herself with side projects and a solo career culminating now with The Golden Dove, her second release. Through all of this, she has remained an inventive, if erratic, songwriter and guitarist, and has largely done so by drawing inspiration from the most unlikely of places. Mining the fantasy genre for musical and artistic enlightenment isn't without its risks. It's no accident that most artists who've successfully captured legions of fans via Tolkein-esque mass delusions aren't likely to show up on my personal hit parade. And that may be because I lost my taste for bombastic classic rock with proggy pretentions after the 75th replay of Led Zeppelin IV at summer camp circa 1989, but I think it runs deeper than all that. Tori Amos, for example, never sounded quite herself after admitting to late-night debates with 'the fairies.' Call me a skeptic, but I'll take a song about breakfast over one about elves any minute of the year. Which naturally begs the question of how it is that I've been able to maintain an affinity for Mary Timony's output since the early 90s, despite evidence suggesting that she's a prime contender for Miss Congeniality in the Mythologized Middle Ages Pageant. She's certainly crossed the line into self-indulgent Dungeons and Dragons eccentricity, with her songs' medieval tavern jam sequences and lyrical allusions that walk about two steps shy of Renaissance Faire farce (one part Tolkein, one part bodice ripper). You get the impression she's maybe even entertained thoughts of live shows including such dubious entertainments as multiple costume changes, laser light dragons, dancing knights, skits in Old English, and maybe a lute player or two. But Timony is talented and not easily categorizable by sound. The risk of writing music this complex, theatrical and outright weird is that it often leads to self-indulgence, but when it works, the output justifies the expense. The Golden Dove, Mary Timony's second solo release, again dons the Arthurian garb. Lyrically, she imbues a contemporary landscape with bizarre manifestations of magical realism, quotes liberally from what I can only assume is a dog-eared anthology from a long past Renaissance Lit class, and sets a 17th century poem to music. Likewise, she makes bold instrumentation choices in songs maybe best left to guitar, bass, and drums, and continues to show the same prog-inspired affinities poorly exemplified by her first solo release. That being said, The Golden Dove has moments of significant achievement. It shows greater similarity to Timony's earlier work than its predecessor, and to put it simply, it rocks a little harder. ""Blood Tree"" builds into an uncharacteristically pop chorus, over which Timony croons, ""I don't care about you, and whatever you want me to do,"" before resolving with, ""The only boy I ever loved/ Turned into a golden dove/ And moved to California."" Timony's latest incarnation sees her more inclined to catchy songwriting. The eerie, angular, piano-based ""Dr Cat"" is transformed halfway through with the introduction of a driving dance beat, making it seem the impossibly odd bastard child of new wave and demented nursery rhyme. Many of the best moments, though, are more typical of Timony's work with Helium. The intricate Polvo-influenced guitar (cribbed from one-time Helium member Ash Bowie) and unsettling jangle of the chorus are strong enough to distract you from moments of lyrical reference to talking with animals and the fact that you'll swear you've heard some of the songs before. (""Look a Ghost in the Eye,"" in particular, is a dead ringer for Helium's ""Devil's Tears""). But the first half of the album, dominated by this sort of material, is much more memorable and cohesive than the balladeering second half. These later tracks struggle, despite their comparative briefness and Timony's inviting vocal work. A small success may be preferable to a small failure, though, and on a larger scale, The Golden Dove is a better than average album. It's just that Timony has long outshined 'better than average,' and I'd so infinitely prefer bearing witness to what she might be capable of achieving with 'totally fucking awesome.'","Mary Timony is about exactly as famous as she needs to be.

All Roads Lead to Salzburg,Mice Parade,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c453c0084474cd0c3679/1:1/w_160/4b374219.gif,2002-07-18 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5259-all-roads-lead-to-salzburg/,Bubble Core,"The subtitle of this album, New, Live, BBC Sessions & Otherwise, makes it sound like your typical odds 'n' sods throw-together job, a clearing house for the half-baked ideas Mice Parade main-man Adam Pierce has lying around his Bubble Core office. Every indie band that endures for any length of time is obligated to release one of these babies; more often than not, the serious fan already has all the decent tracks and the collection is a waste of money. All Roads Lead to Salzburg, however, is an exception to this dodgy tradition. Instead of a broom pile, All Roads Lead to Salzburg offers a more complete picture of what Mice Parade is all about. While last year's fine Mokoondi showed Adam Pierce to be a master at the one-man-band aesthetic, here we get several opportunities to hear the project as a live unit, and they do not disappoint. The band on the BBC sessions includes Dylan Cristy on vibes, Pierce on cheng (the Chinese zither used so effectively on Mokoondi), Marc Wolf on nylon string guitar, Rob King on keyboards, Doro Tachler on violin, and most importantly, the godlike Doug Scharin on drums and percussion. It's an unusual mix of instruments, with the violin and cheng lending a Far-East flavor that blends nicely with Western chord voicings and a classical minimalist sense of repetition and structure. The interplay between the musicians is fluid and intuitive. The recording of ""Circle One"" expands greatly on the studio version with a propulsive sense of joy, and ""All Roads Lead to Salzburg"" (from the same session) is equally fine. Also notable is the exceptional sound quality of these recordings; the live mix of this large band with the blend of studio and electronic instruments had to be problematic, but the result is clean, clear and appropriate to the detailed music. More impressive still is the four-part ""Open Air Dance,"" recorded with the same band at another BBC date. Building from a riff laid down on the cheng, the band, shoved forward by the furious drumming of Scharin, explores variation after variation on the opening theme, squeezing melodic juice from a tiny three-note phrase as clouds of vibe harmonics expand and recede. This collective is all about the positive vibe and there's no denying a whiff of 'jam band' is present in the structure of this epic piece. Fortunately, the melodies are short and simple, and the launching point for the soloing is primarily rhythmic, so Mice Parade never approaches instrumental indulgence. Beyond the live tracks, there are a few experiments that come close to the 'closet cleaning' category, but manage to remain appealing. Among these mish-mashes are ""One Road Led to Columbia"" and ""Circle 2,"" both pieced together in the Bubble Core office by tweaking and manipulating live fragments via computer, resulting in an interesting digital spin on acoustic sound sources that owes a lot to dub. And the new ""Phasen Weise"" is a fantastic track that would have been the best thing on Mokoondi, with Pierce handling his usual array of instruments and then layering the haunting multi-track vocals of Doro Tachler on top, doing an odd kind of German folk chant. All Roads Lead to Salzburg is a fine collection and one hell of an advertisement for Mice Parade's live show.","The subtitle of this album, New, Live, BBC Sessions & Otherwise, makes it sound like your typical odds 'n' sods throw-together ...

Brain in the Wire,Various Artists,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a76b5e6ef95969320f8c/1:1/w_160/7ff5afc4.gif,2002-07-18 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1857-brain-in-the-wire/,Brainwashed,"As compilations go, Brain in the Wire doesn't make much sense. But then, neither does the institution that spawned it. Since 1996, Brainwashed.com has served as the Internet home to dozens of fringe experimental artists. From creepy industrial types (Nurse with Wound, Legendary Pink Dots, Coil, Current 93) and glitchy reconstructionists (Fridge, Panacea, Kid 606, V/Vm), to ambient noodlers (Stars of the Lid, Windy & Carl) and indie rockers (Bedhead, Godspeed You Black Emperor!, Tortoise), Brainwashed has been building, maintaining and hosting comprehensive websites for great bands at no cost, just because they enjoy doing it. And despite hits in the hundreds of thousands, it's all still free of costs and advertisements-- a strange breed, indeed. Which may help to explain why, at times, Brain in the Wire is about as coherent as George Bush Jr. at the peak of a coke frenzy. That's understandable given the diverse range of artists they've helped out over the years (many of whom have repaid the favor with exclusive works for this three-disc box), though it doesn't help that these tracks seem to have been arranged via dartboard. Example: I was pretty wowed by the Matmos/J. Lesser/Hrvatski collaboration that kicks off the second disc. The scorching rendition of ""Powder"" recorded at Chicago's Empty Bottle (by Shellac's Bob Weston, no less) is a powerful reminder of just what a mighty force Bedhead was back in the day. And the Meat Beat Manifesto track that follows stays true to Jack Dangers' well-established formula, not anything truly unexpected but still a pretty wonderful assault of the senses. Yet despite the quality of these picks, I can't help but question the sequencing of such sonically divergent tracks. Who sandwiches conventional indie rock between noise-inflected glitchcore and throbbing industrial heart attacks? It makes for an awkward flow-- more so than with your average compilation, which, unlike Brain in the Wire, typically revolves around some general theme. But I hear you. You could give a crap about this continuity bullshit; what you really came to read about is the music. Fine, then. But find a comfortable chair 'cause we're gonna be here a while. Brain in the Wire (the title of which refers to its initial pressing, which came free with a subscription to the British avant-garde music magazine The Wire) is three solid hours of screeching noise, programmed clicks, ambient phasing, and molten space-rock that reads like a who's who of contemporary underground music. And the overwhelming majority of these tracks are top-shelf material, something that can't be said of most 'previously unreleased' offerings. Jungle specialist Panacea turns in a brain-rattling dub reconstruction of a contemporary mainstream rap track about manning battle stations; !!! work their punk/funk hybrid with a tight live rendition of ""Hammerhead"" and, on ""disc x"" (for which the tracklist is a surprise-- and a pleasant one, at that), win best song title with ""We Were Stoned When We Thought Up the Title of This and We Didn't Want to Give It a Name That We Had to Explain as 'Oh Yeah We Were Stoned When We Thought of It' So We're Just Calling It Improvisational Jam 11-02-01."" There are a few clunkers, sure. The discs are spotted with inexplicable forays into folky, singer/songwriter pieces that drag on documenting little private dramas nobody wants to hear about. And then there's the sad tale of Current 93, who continues his recent trend of ignoring his own inestimable talent in favor of longwinded whining and acoustic guitar. But the great on this compilation outweighs the merely forgettable, and even when the results are predictable they still tend to be plenty enjoyable. Fridge contributes some of their chopped-up, guitar-based post-rock, Windy & Carl turn out another beautiful drone piece, Tino does breakbeat-heavy dub, the Legendary Pink Dots make tribal kraut-style rock with strings and oboes, and Kid 606 offers the typically irreverent ""Pregnant Cheerleader Theme Song,"" which sets giggling, helium-voiced chants of, ""I'm sexy/ I'm cute/ I'm popular to boot,"" ""I'm wanted/ I'm hot/ I'm everything you're not,"" and, ""I'm pretty/ I'm cool/ I dominate this school,"" to one of his standard-issue pounding basslines. All of these tracks are mighty entertaining, but the best moments come from those artists who-- assuming this box will wind up mostly in the hands of purists and longtime fans-- took Brain in the Wire as an opportunity to try out something totally different. Coil, for example, shuns the gloom and foreboding he built his good name on in favor of what is, for all intents and purposes, a very well constructed piece of raver-style dance music, complete with thumping bass, cheesy drum machines, fluttering synths and panting vocals. On the other side of the spectrum, Keith Fullerton Whitman (aka Hrvatski) turns his back on his typical rapid-paced drum-n-glitch and instead hands in a superb work for prepared piano, just slightly tweaked with digital post-production. Initially, the casual listener might have a difficult time distinguishing between the processed sounds of this track and the organic ones, but as the 10+ minute-long piece progresses, the acoustic sounds are overtaken by showers of echoes and chunks of inverted waveforms wisping by at lightning speeds. Also winning big subtlety points are the Kadane brothers, who contribute ""Harvest,"" an instrumental that begins as a meditative guitar duet before settling on two ingeminating guitar patterns, adding drums and lightly struck bells to the mix. Elsewhere, Broadcast produces a solid microhouse track with effects-layered vocals and an eventual barrage of strange noises that owes more to the current tech-pop scene than to their recent LPs. Brain in the Wire is a costly little nugget, but it's packed with endearing work from enduring artists, and with its limited pressings and distribution, it's not going to be around much longer. Its three discs are as varied as can be, and sometimes to a fault, but frankly, if the worst thing a guy like me can say about a box like this is that it's too diverse, I'm probably just searching for imperfections to provide the illusion that this is really a piece of legitimate criticism and not just the inane rantings of another record-collecting addict. Shit, I'll just put it this way: for a slapping down of one Grant-faced dollar bill, you walk away with a stainless steel container housing a healthy mix of rock, industrial, dub, electronic and ambient sounds that are just as welcome an addition to any music collection as Brainwashed.com is to the underground music community. And if that's not ringing-endorsement enough for you, you've been staring at too many web banners.","As compilations go, Brain in the Wire doesn't make much sense.

The Future Is Now,Non Phixion,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c4245e6ef959693239bf/1:1/w_160/b52b0bb0.jpg,2002-07-18 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5831-the-future-is-now/,Landspeed,"If there's one thing Non Phixion has taught me, it's that there's a fine line between the incendiary and the utterly ridiculous. When I first heard their 12-inch ""I Shot Reagan"" in 1998, I thought they were the heirs to Public Enemy's agitprop hip-hop throne. 2000's ""Black Helicopters,"" with its dark, claustrophobic production and Ill Bill's proclamation that ""American taught me how to kidnap and torture cats"" further whetted my appetite for the first incarnation of The Future Is Now, which was scheduled to be released later that year on Matador. So when the word on the street, or at least speculation via Non Phixion fans, said that Matador dropped them due to the extremism of their politics, I shook my head and cursed those bullfighting cowards. It seemed as though Non Phixion would join the long line of hip-hop artists whose albums were buried before ever seeing the light of day. Now, as I'm listening to the 2002 version of The Future Is Now, I'm beginning to wish that it had never been released, and I'm starting to think that the heads at Matador were just more discerning than fraidycat. Instead of the scathing socio-political critique I'd expected, Non Phixion has released an album that is perhaps the first example of inadvertent post-apocalyptic Marxist kitsch. It sounds as though somewhere along the way Non Phixion mastermind Ill Bill pawned his Chomsky books for baggies of cocaine and began drifting thematically closer to the crackhead comic relief of Flavor Flav than to the anti-capitalist stance of Chuck D. Even the titles are contradictory, corny, and unimaginative: The Future Is Now, ""Futurama"" (where ""cyborgs will kill your mamma!""), ""There Is No Future,"" and ""We Are the Future."" And the lyrics are even more so: ""Jews, Muslims, Christians/ What the fuck's the difference?/ We all want money, drugs and bitches/ Anybody that doesn't rubs me suspicious."" I'm trying not to say that political dissent has to be intellectually polished, and I'm certainly not trying to be some moral watchdog, but when lines like this are spewed by some snarling, white emcee mugging for the camera with a shotgun, I have to question not only his intelligence, but also his initial motivation for adopting a political stance. Perhaps in their quest to be the perpetually fashionable, anti-everything group of the month, Non Phixion merely adopted some of the more sensationalistic rhetoric of political radicalism. It really is a shame that Non Phixion comes across as being so juvenile. Technically, Ill Bill and Sabec Red are decent emcees; they stay on the beat and their flows are effective. The album is loaded with great production work by the likes of Pete Rock, Large Professor, and Necro. DJ Premier's ""Rock Star"" even boasts the best Primo track since the last Gang Starr album. But you can't escape the weak subject matter, the pointless misogyny, and the sheer stupidity of the lyrics. Perhaps hip-hop's recent turn towards complexity has me a bit spoiled, but I can't imagine that it would've made a difference when this album was released; The Future Is Now is a regressive and reactionary statement, regardless of the year.","If there's one thing Non Phixion has taught me, it's that there's a fine line between the ...

Three,Archer Prewitt,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0d113d19756521384a2/1:1/w_160/302c7d34.jpg,2002-07-18 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6468-three/,Thrill Jockey,"If I might personify the Chicago scene for a moment, he's probably growing his hair out into a ponytail, saving up to buy that new Ford Thunderbird, and wondering whether he could score with younger chicks if he ditched the wife. In people years, the ten-year-old subterranean Windy City post-everything scene has entered its middle ages and is starting to show all the inherent backwards-looking neuroses of the phase. Jim O'Rourke's hard-rocking kiss-off to the increasingly clich√© jazz-rock sound on Insignificance was the initial salvo, but recently, bands like Rian Murphy's Chestnut Station and Giant Sand have also embraced the classic-rock sound. One practically expects the next Tortoise to be a collection of Styx covers. Into this breach flies Archer Prewitt, veteran of the defunct Coctails and the MIA Sea and Cake, and possessor of the second best name in indie rock after Mr. Tobin Sprout. As both band cog and solo artist, Prewitt has done about as much as anybody to boost vibraphone sales and sculpt the dreamy, humid summer/snowy winter ambience of Chi-town's trademark sound. But now, as Three's psychedelic cover art and numerical heading seem to indicate, Prewitt's got his FM dial locked in on the sometimes-beloved, sometimes-maligned period between the Beatles and the Bee Gees. Three doesn't mess with the Prewitt formula too much-- meaning he'll still maintain his place amongst the other artists in Amazon's ""Customers who bought Elliott Smith's XO also bought..."" recommendations list-- but the differences aren't hard to spot. More strident guitar and drumming, lots of tambourine and organ, a complete lack of shame when it comes to sudden string/horn overdub free-for-all. Of course, Prewitt's gentle voice keeps things from rocking with a capital R, but remember that the mid-70s were the golden age of the bell-bottom jeans singer/songwriter as well. Picture Cat Stevens, Jackson Browne, and Lindsay Buckingham swapping hair-care secrets in an organic L.A. bistro circa 1974 and you're getting there. It's a strategy shift that allows for a damn fine first-half of an album. Opener ""Over the Line"" (sadly, not preceded in the chorus by the words ""one toke"" and followed by ""sweet Jesus"") tricks the listener with a traditionally Thrill Jockey-esque slow riff before building momentum to a downright soulful climax peppered with Neil Young-style harmonica squawks. ""Tear Me All Away"" punctuates the new approach in a compact less-than-two-minutes of hyperactive strumming and harpsichord arpeggios more classical than classic. ""Gifts of Love"" initially comes at you with the two-chord progression and melodic bass found in 90% of the Sea and Cake fakebook, but layers on enough orchestra and flute frosting to hide the resemblance. As with most of the 70s sensitive guy genre though, a lot of the music here toes the schmaltz line. And by the second half of Three, Prewitt's tripped right over it, landing in dangerous Neil Diamond territory. The LP closes with a quintet of excessively long number, half of which take a needlessly abrupt dogleg two minutes in; half of which droop under ponderous lyrics like, ""Forever cold/ And lost in space,"" repeated ad nauseam. Elements like the Lambchop-brand heavenly choir female backup singers go from tasteful lime flavoring (""I'm Coming Over"") to over-sweetened lemonade (cooing ""oh babe, hold me"" on ""No Defense""). ""Behind the Sun"" finds Archer veering a little too close to the artist formerly known as Cat for my tastes, while ""Sister Ice"" is a vivid reminder of why punk was a necessary response to the excesses of 70s rock. So Three ends up as a great EP set amongst a lot of so-so filler, damning it to the nefarious 7.x regions of the Pitchfork scale. It's an agreeable summer listen, but forgive me if yet another defection of a Chicago underground notable towards the classic-rock bin is also a wee bit troubling. Sure, the hazy Prekop/McEntire thing was moving more and more towards EZ-Listening territory, but is this what all that musical exploration comes to: tunes not far off from what Matthew Sweet was doing early last decade? Are we at the end of the line for this phase of the City by the Lake's musical progression, or are Three and its siblings a mere temporary re-assessment of roots and influences? Prepare a 3000-word essay for next week.","If I might personify the Chicago scene for a moment, he's probably growing his hair out into a ponytail ...

As If to Nothing,Craig Armstrong,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1035e6ef959693200bf/1:1/w_160/0f5e0dd4.jpg,2002-07-17 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/292-as-if-to-nothing/,Astralwerks,"Best known for scoring film soundtracks, Craig Armstrong has provided a-list pop acts (U2, Massive Attack, and Spice Girls) with cloying string arrangements. But his stock-in-trade is moody, gargatuanly stringed incidental music for hysterically overblown movies like Moulin Rouge and Plunkett and MacLean. The appropriately titled As If to Nothing follows on from his 101-Strings-for-Jaded-Dullards debut, The Space Between Us, and repeats the same formula throughout its sixty-nine minutes, just as its predecessor did. Though some might say that Armstrong's music is powerfully evocative and serene, such people hate music and all its subtle possibilities and intricacies. Plus, if Armstrong perceives that music can be subtle, intricate and meaningful, this album goes strenuously out of its way to demonstrate the opposite. An Armstrong piece is short and unobtrusive, which, for movie producers, means Armstrong's an affordable alternative to James Horner or John Williams. While no director really wants an audience distracted by a heavenly orchestral piece from his or her images, I expect something more eventful for home listening than billows of strings interrupted in the politest way by French horns or a soaring oboe. Perhaps aware of the limitations of his instrumentals, Armstrong enlisted help: drum-n-bass master Photek, soul crooner David McAlmont, Alpha vocalist Wendy Stubbs, Antye Greie-Fuchs from German glitchers Laub, Bono, Mogwai and even Lemonheaded lost boy Evan Dando took time out from their otherwise productive lives to take part in this effete twaddle. Rumor has it that a small town was built to house and support all the musicians involved in realizing Armstrong's bland vision. Divided into two camps: hundreds of Musicians' Union schlubs, and those star performers the liners classify as ""featured artist."" But anyone wandering into Armstrong's shanty town could distinguish the two classes by whether they had a limo pick them up from their temporary accommodation or whether they had to ride Shank's pony to the studio. Once seated in front of the music stands, the majority of the performers probably chuckled at how childishly simple Armstrong's score is, and how repetitious. All string players are asked to play languidly and high, piling on mock emotion by the shovelful. Horn players are similarly asked to underpin the insipidly swollen string gestures with mannered blasts. Percussion is left to programmers, who borrow heavily from Massive Attack's Mezzanine loops. Any discerning listener must hope that the ""featured artists"" will crack through the sickly sweet monotony. The juxtaposition of sweeping strings and Mogwai could have been fascinating, had Mogwai's contribution not been erased in post-production. I can detect no trace of them during ""Miracle,"" the piece on which they're credited. Photek suffers identically. I'm at a loss to find Photek amid the generic trip-hop beats of ""Hymn 2,"" and the addition of soprano soloist Catherine Bott to the track makes it seem as though Armstrong constructed this song solely for those wishing to augment their Enya and Enigma collections. Despite Armstrong declaring in a Guardian newspaper interview that Antye Greie-Fuchs' band Laub are reminiscent of Stockhausen, he (maliciously?) reduces her vocals to exotic curiosity during ""Waltz."" Fuchs babbles away in German and occasionally English making no sense and leaving the majority of listeners with a very dim view of her mental health. Bono gets to redo his vocals for U2's chestnut, ""Stay (Faraway, So Close),"" and reveals that despite his striving for Scott Walker's baritone, the best he'll ever achieve is Michael Bolton's. David McAlmont, former Thieves vocalist and collaborator with ex-London Suede guitarist Bernard Butler, fairs far better, which really is damning him with faint praise. During ""Snow,"" McAlmont taps into the powerful soulful pathos that made songs like ""Yes"" (from The Sound of McAlmont and Butler) such stunners. But again, Armstrong bludgeons McAlmont with the orchestra, perhaps out of jealousy. McAlmont is capable of real emotion, not Armstrong's ersatz approximation of feeling. I find Armstrong's successful career bewildering, given the extremely narrow musical ability he displays throughout this album. A case in point is ""Starless II,"" a piece that incorporates a chunk of Robert Fripp's guitar solo from King Crimson's ""Starless."" The extent of Armstrong's ability is to mimic exactly the notes Fripp plays in the string section, which is a stultifying waste of everyone's time. The strings attach themselves like barnacles to Fripp's guitar and refuse to be shaken loose. Another instrumental, ""Ruthless Gravity,"" demonstrates just how conservative an electronic label Astralwerks can be. Token blips begin the song before a deluge of syrupy unison strings shove the sound of the new out of the way. For me, ""Ruthless Gravity"" typifies Astralwerks' partially concealed loathing of innovation. Just one look at their roster and you'll see example after example of shoddy talent and crummy back-in-the-day-ism. Despite the prevalence of vapid schlock, As If to Nothing displays one genuine surprise in Evan Dando. Dando brings a maturity and sensitivity that I had hitherto not suspected he was capable of. Though the song, ""Wake Up in New York,"" lifts sections from Kate Bush's ""Moments of Pleasure,"" Dando's reserved solemnity gives As If to Nothing a grace it doesn't deserve. Armstrong does superbly to restrain himself from augmenting Dando with anything but an acoustic guitar for the first fifty seconds. But inevitably, Armstrong wants the spotlight trained back on him and lobs string salvoes to crush Dando's affecting delivery. The title As If to Nothing fits this execrable CD perfectly. Putting aside for a moment Armstrong's neutering of his ""featured artists,"" what galls me is his rootlessness. I can detect no affiliation with or reference to any classical tradition. I'm not asking him to wave the Darmstadt or Vienna gang sign, but at least show an awareness of the intricacies of composition other than those mandated by the Muzak Corporation. Though this record courts an audience who despises creativity and innovation, it will disappoint even them by not giving them a single decent melody to hum along to. At least Moby gave his audience ""South Side"" and ""Porcelain."" The dominant force of any Armstrong piece, the strings, are a unified mass, undifferentiated and relentless in their turgid banality. They move like a column of artillery, crushing any small beauty beneath their lumbering feet. Such tactics work splendidly for tender moments in a Michael Bay picture (surely Armstrong's next outing), but they have no place in any music collection.","Best known for scoring film soundtracks, Craig Armstrong has provided a-list pop acts (U2, Massive Attack, and Spice Girls) with ...

They Threw Us All in a Trench and Stuck a Monument on Top,Liars,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcf213d197565213b429/1:1/w_160/455fe23f.jpg,2002-07-17 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4764-they-threw-us-all-in-a-trench-and-stuck-a-monument-on-top/,Gern BlandstenGern Blandsten,"These guys eat ground glass. They're that nasty. You may like their music, but don't forget that they hate you. You didn't do anything; they're just sick of your bullshit. And what're you gonna say back? The singer's a towering, lanky Australian named Angus-- that's Scottish for ""Bubba""-- and the music's a gray nightmare of art-punk and noisy beats. It's vicious, but you can dance to it! No matter how much buzz they draw-- appearing on the John Peel show, touring with the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, having their debut re-released on Blast First-- the Liars will stay hostile and insidious. They make what I can only describe as cyborg junkyard rock. Guitarist Angus Hempell plays messy power chords and high-pitched, lobotomizingly zen-like guitar lines, but he also has a drum machine: dig ""Mr. You're on Fire Mr.,"" where he sticks programmed fills where you'd expect guitar riffs. The lo-fi electronics and sound effects that pervade the album give it a rhythmic kick, but while other artists try to make samples sound human, the Liars work to sound hypnotically mechanical. On ""Nothing Is Ever Lost or Can Be,"" they lurch and march-step to jerky high notes and tumbling drum fills. Angus Andrews is impenetrable, showing the emotional range of a matchbook: he's either flat or flared. His sing/shouting switches from weary to angry and back again, and just try to make sense of the splintered, hostile lyrics he spits like rat poison: ""They cut me up they cut me up they cut me up they cut me up they cut me up at the medical school."" It's up to bassist Pat Nature and Ron Albertson on ""friendly drums"" to reign in the noise, and Nature puts all the torque into the band: listen to ""We Live NE of Compton,"" where the bassline kicks it into a killer dance-punk number; and to see his modest side, check out how his steady rumble keeps ""Loose Nuts on the Veladrome"" together while the rest of the band buzzes off in every direction. He's the reason it's impossible to write about this band without comparing them to Gang of Four-- that post-punk tendency to impale rage and noise on the sharp edge of a floor-beating rhythm. But sticking with that would be too easy. Every time the Liars bust out a stone-cold party favorite, they answer it with a track that feels like sticking your head in a vice. ""Tumbling Walls Buried Me in Debris"" is disorientingly repetitive, with a sinking, introverted melody, zen-like chimes and an eerie beat that sounds like the delusion-sequence music from a P.O.W. film: Charlie's got us gagged and bound and tortured, and nobody gets out of here without a migraine. I've played They Threw Us All in a Trench and Stuck a Monument on Top a dozen times in the last couple days, and I get something different each time. Sometimes I find new sounds; sometimes I feel like I get less out of it with every listen. It's not clear where their tactics are going, whether it'll come together on the next album, or whether this fragmented style is the thing that makes them great. In fact, all that is clear is that it's rare that a band rocks this hard and still challenges you at every turn. The last track is the final showdown. ""This Dirt Makes Mud"" is a drawn-out slide of grinding, throbbing rock with Andrews moaning and shouting while Hempell squeaks and squalls and Nature rumbles menacingly underneath. In direct opposition to the brief songs on the rest of the album, this is a rock epic, but here's the trick: the music doesn't stop. At roughly the moment any other song here would end, the band fades into a four-second loop, and once the machine's going, they take off and get a beer while it plays over, and over, and over, for more than twenty minutes. You can leave whenever you want, but then you're quitting before the album does. Maybe this is a statement, maybe they're killing time, and maybe it's just the sound of a band crawling up its own ass. But when's the last time a record dared you to blink first?","These guys eat ground glass. They're that nasty. You may like their music, but don't forget that they ...

What's irkin' you? Boy-boy: Nothing. Grandpaw: Come on, now, spit it out. Don't mock my gift of discernment. Boy-boy: Grandpaw... is it okay if I like keyboard music? Grandpaw: Hmph. Thought we already had this discussion. You not supposed to fool with that rubbish. You from the hills. They got hills in heaven. I ain't heard tell of no synthesizers being in heaven. Sometimes I swear you don't have the sense the good Lord gave a toggle bolt. Boy-boy: Those CDs you took from me, could I have them back? Grandpaw: Look, now. I lost your sister Fern to that keyboard music in the 80s. And I had to bury your brother Coy to save him from its techno spawn. You're all I got left. I can't have you miming the piano thing from Erasure's ""Blue Savannah"" on the hearth and stashing copies of Depeche Mode's Some Great Reward in the churn. That music'll have people thinking you're a... invert. Like when you went to the city and came back with a pocketbook. Boy-boy: That was an eelskin attach√©, Grandpaw. And I aim to live in the city one day. Grandpaw: Where'd you cotton to keyboards anyway? Did you get this idea off that blasted landscaping website? Boy-boy: No. Pitchfork only half-vouches for the Faint and Stars and Vitesse. And they said the new-wavey Trans Am and Hefner were no good. They'd hate this unironic, sometimes daft, celebration of pure digi-retro swizzle. Grandpaw: Them boys at Pitchfork can sniff how faddish it all is, see, how it won't hold up over the years. They must have the gift of discernment like me. Boy-boy: They're not all boys, Grandpaw. And I don't care what they say; I like it all. I snuck this CD past you. Look. Grandpaw: Well, great day in the goddamn morning. This Is Tech-Pop. Where'd you get this stinkbiscuit? Let's see what the helpful booklet says: ""These are good-looking acts that have a strong fashion sense and are really fuckable."" That's just impudent. Boy-boy: Yeah, the liner notes are superficial and coarse. I apologize. Don't keep reading. The author goes on to link tech-pop's rise to the recession and terrorism. Grandpaw: Your mama always said bad things come in threes. Boy-boy: I mean, get blitzed to counter terror? Talking Heads and Radiohead, in ""Life During Wartime"" and ""Idioteque,"" at least pointed out the ironies of clubbing as a means of escaping having to fathom catastrophe. I dig these synths and beats, but I don't know about advocating conscious denial and aggressive neglect. ""This ain't no disco..."" Grandpaw: Who you talking to? You're alienating the hell-crust out of me as bad as some of these names. Fischerspooner? Boy-boy: Their song announces itself too much. Music has to do more than just arrive. Overrated. Grandpaw: Zoot Woman? Boy-boy: Their lite song is ugly. Mouthwashy. Should accompany the wholesome/titillating scene in a Freddie Prinze Jr. movie when he touches toes in the pool with the busty virgin. The only song worse is Crossover's bratty, redundant contribution. Grandpaw: Freddie Prinze has a kid? Boy-boy: Some of the songs here are swell, though. FC Kahuna and Selway do the most with their bleepity riffs, and Console, Tomcraft, and Mirwais use so many awesome vocal effects that they sound like lovelorn Decepticons. Grandpaw: Hey, now, use some words that make some good common horse-gumption. What is a Ladytron supposed to be? I think your cousin Plovis ordered one of those. Boy-boy: Ladytron chucks out the umpteenth remix of ""Playgirl."" Electro-yawn. But so many of the other female-vocalists' songs are close to terrific: Circ's ""Destroy She Said"" is one of those hits you accidentally memorize on first listen, and Swayzak's ""State of Grace"" is dopey, but inescapable. Grandpaw: One word: brainwashing, or as Reverend Bagwell says, ""lasting attitudinal change."" Boy-boy: Soviet's ""Candy Girl"" is pure mid-period New Order. Grandpaw: Don't you get it? New Wave, New Order, New Age. Heathenry is afoot. Devilment with a Korg instead of a Ouija. Boy-boy: Please, just listen to it. [20 songs and 78 minutes later, after a hacking cough and Grandpaw cursing about asbestos tiles...] Grandpaw: The hour of vengeance must be at hand. I felt lobotomized by that seventh song that kept saying ""genedefekt, genedefekt."" All these people's names are going on my list. Boy-boy: But some of them were using guest vocalists, and some of them record under different names, and some of them are producers more than recording artists. You'd never track these people down, Grandpaw, they live all over the world. Grandpaw: Sounds like Babel. Like a chaotic orgy. And I recognize that song ""Sunglasses at Night,"" from the 80s when that stuff got its hooks in your sister Fern. Boy-boy: Yup, the novelty insta-fades on that cover. Did you like any of the songs? Grandpaw: ""Naked, Drunk, and Horny"" was fine by me. Yellow Note Vs Pukka, whatever that is, recreated a scenario we all enjoy. And I like that she was building stairs by hand, and she talked about lumber and nails. I got goose-chills to that line, ""I'll wear sawdust instead of clothes."" Most of this music is so divorced from anything organic it makes me wanna shoplift a banjo just to feel the wood. Tech-pop seems awful environmentless to me; you could never distribute mulch or pot azaleas to it. This is for those coiffured and hermetically sealed people who never sweat. It's car-commercial-core. My second favorite: ""Rippin Kittin"" by Golden Boy with Miss Kittin. About murder, so I liked that, especially that line, ""Daddy, can I go out and hunt tonight like you do?"" She's not just pulling your leg, she is ornery! Boy-boy: Great taste, Grandpaw! Those are two of the best tracks. Grandpaw: I noticed that a couple of them went tst-chicka instead of the predominant oom-chicka. Boy-boy: That's microhouse. Grandpaw: Like a outhouse? Boy-boy: No sir. Grandpaw: Like a microwave? Boy-boy: No sir. Grandpaw: Foot! Confound it! I don't have time for nonsense. Boy-boy: Didn't you like how the CD is cleverly choreographed so that each song evolves into the next one, creating a super-juhhamm! Grandpaw: That just made it all run together more, to me. What's so '21st century' about this? It's that same stuff as that Yaz and that Gary Numan. Boy-boy: Granted, almost every style-revival is more homogenous than its predecessor. This disc is monochromatic compared to the old-school punk-dance In the Beginning There Was Rhythm comp. And come to think of it, there's not a lot of experimentation with the formula. But the album never promised difficult art, it promised that ""This Is Tech-Pop."" Which turned out to be straight talk. I mean, that's more honorable than naming a movie something grandiose like Reign of Fire when it should have been called Some Dragons at Fourteen-Minute Intervals. This, thankfully, isn't a Tupperware comp of leftovers, but it's also not pushing its genre's boundaries. It's an audience-widener, designed to work like hypertext-- you link and click off into the catalogs of the best acts. There are winners on this comp, but if the genre stays at this level, it'll have to be renamed Coleco-Bubble. Grandpaw: You're starting to sound like that Rakepoke website. Boy-boy: I wish. If one of the Pitchforkers reviews this CD, I bet that slut will listen to it and enjoy it a lot more than his 'critical' rating indicates. Grandpaw: Simmer down. Finish your chicken waffles. And give me a sip of that crayfishberry milkshake. I'll take a hickory switch to your hide if you don't forswear that tech-pop and them rank city dreams. Boy-boy: Yessir.","From the third act of ""Supper in the Stereo Shed"":

With Fingers Crossed EP,Poulain,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a10dc0084474cd0bfd0e/1:1/w_160/c49cdc39.gif,2002-07-17 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6441-with-fingers-crossed-ep/,Soft Serve,"Pleasantly inconsequential indie synth pop in the vein of Stephin Merritt, only more straightforward. Okay, there's the review, can I go now? What? You want more than that? Alright, let's see. With Fingers Crossed is the debut EP by Isaac Lekach, an unassuming Illinois resident who prefers to go by the stage name Poulain. But rather than playing the conventional singer/songwriter troubadour, he surrounds himself with like-minded friends for a fully fleshed indie-lite sound that carries his sleepy melodies to you on a bed of understated drums and gentle keyboard tones. The aforementioned similarity to Magnetic Fields isn't so much a sonic one as it is atmospheric-- Poulain's sound is definitely more hi-fi, despite being recorded in the home of producer/keyboardist Chris Holmes. The four songs here don't display a terrible amount of range, all falling squarely in the midtempo range and consisting of the same instrumentation. Instruments motor along in slavish service to the melodies, taking pains not to distinguish themselves too greatly. Occasionally, backing vocalist Erin Gipson will chime in to support Lekach, but she fits right into the production tapestry like just another line in the plaid. Given that Lekach's mellow, unhurried delivery means that his own voice doesn't really stand out much either, and what the whole EP comes down to is fifteen minutes of pleasant sonic wallpaper. As a lyricist, Lekach is still developing, though there are indications that something better sleeps inside him, as evidenced by lines like, ""I feel like I can do anything tonight, like a fighter jet crossing enemy lines,"" in ""Hollywood."" By and large, though, he concerns himself less with association and metaphor and more with stargazing nostalgia and romance. Opener ""Red Rover"" reminisces about sitting in a car with a girlfriend, listening to Dark Side of the Moon and gazing at the stars while parked next to a planetarium. ""Every Night Burning Bright"" has the best melody of the bunch, contrasting short, quick phrases with long, drawn-out ones for some semblance of catchiness, though it doesn't really stick around long after the song ends. But there are very few legitimate complaints you could level against With Fingers Crossed. None of it's actually bad, but it's not especially good, either. The sameness of each of the songs ultimately damns the EP to being pretty unmemorable, which in turn has damned me to trying to write a lengthy review of something that's pretty easily summed up in a couple of sentences. If there's to be any hope for Poulain in the future, it's going to require, at the least, an injection of variety.","Pleasantly inconsequential indie synth pop in the vein of Stephin Merritt, only more straightforward.

All-Time Quarterback,All-Time Quarterback,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a04e9d034d5c69bf26aa/1:1/w_160/cfe17bc4.gif,2002-07-16 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/116-all-time-quarterback/,Barsuk,"Ben Gibbard? Yeah, he's a really nice guy. And if you pay any attention to this music stuff, you can probably figure out from that nugget of information what kind of music Gibbard makes. Nice guys sure don't have the necessary bravado for hot hip-hop skeelz, nor, usually, the full-bodied mane required for properly pyrotechnical metal. Nope, the domain of nice guy music is largely restricted to the domain of intelligent, reflective, dare I say emotional guitar pop. Gibbard's usually found trafficking in the full-band variation on this theme with his fellow Nor'westers, Death Cab for Cutie. But nice guys generally tend to be solitary folk as well (possibly a sub-clause of the old finishing-order statement), so it's not all that surprising to find that Gibbard has All-Time Quarterback, a collection of solo bedroom recordings from 1999, up his sleeve. Split evenly between four-track overdub fiestas and one-track, one-take tape recorder ditties, the eleven-song mini-LP allows Benjamin to craft some saccharine introspections with minimum interference from other souls. Of course, Gibbard's already the lone song supplier for DCFC, and according to my media guide, there was no difference whatsoever between the preparation of these demos and the demos he brings to his fellow Cabbies before recording. So despite attempts to follow in the footsteps of fellow go-it-aloners Pedro the Lion and the Magnetic Fields (whose ""Why I Cry"" is covered), none of these solo apples fall far from the full-band tree. But at least the arrangements are of the stripped-down variety, closer to the fireplace intimacy of We Have the Facts and We're Voting Yes than the Big Time drums and production of The Photo Album. These surroundings fit the gentle nature of All-Time Quarterback's faux-full-band songs well, the shimmery likes of ""Dinner at Eight in the Suburbs"" and ""Rules Broken"" benefiting from the minimal Casio rhythms and endearingly slipshod drumming. A strident electric piano progression shows Gibbard's hitherto unknown resemblance to Ben Folds on ""Untitled,"" and ""Send Packing"" explores the tortoise-pace path DCFC would set upon with subsequent albums. In a slightly embarrassing turn of events, though, the highlight of the album is, in fact, the fairly straight run-through of Stephen Merritt's ""Why I Cry,"" with a sunny vibraphone riff and Gibbard's skilled female impersonation vocals highlighting a songcraft superior to that of its neighbors. Meanwhile, the ultra-minimalist tracks sprinkled throughout tend to suffer from their sketchpad settings, never really becoming more than mere staticky fragments. Part of the problem is the increased focus on the lyrics, few of which feature the light touch that keeps the more recent of Gibbard's literate lamentations from spiraling off into self-pity (for example, ""Cleveland,"" the kind of don't-move-away plea he's done better elsewhere). The rough draft status of these tracks is also pretty apparent (""Underwater"" was later fleshed out for a Death Cab seven-inch), marking them as future 25th anniversary bonus track fodder rather than stand-alone album cuts. Of course, anybody who doesn't already have a DCFC album filed away in their IKEA d√Øsk√∏ tower probably doesn't give a whut-whut about All-Time Quarterback anyhow, and rightfully so, since nothing on this record is exceptional or varied enough to appeal to non-members. Aside from keeping your home Gibbard shrine up-to-date, the disc serves no purpose for Death Cab haters, unless you maybe want to prank somebody into thinking you scored advance demos for the new Shins album. Then again, if you would do that, you wouldn't be a very nice guy, and Nice Guy Gibbard would probably want nothing to do with you anyhow.","Ben Gibbard? Yeah, he's a really nice guy.

Interpol EP,Interpol,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b97ac0084474cd0c260a/1:1/w_160/07ab2497.jpg,2002-07-16 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4114-interpol-ep/,Matador,"As the post-modern world rapidly rushes off to redefine itself for a new generation, the only certainty is the disorientation left in its wake; the stimulus avalanche we're now subjected to on a daily basis is just too much for many of us to capably grapple with. The Information Age is moving us, step by precious step, towards complete omniscience. But of course, the closer we come to one another artificially, the further disconnected we become in the physical world. Interpol, in the scant three tracks of their debut EP for Matador Records, may not be the first to address these themes of distance and loss, but given the present state of our society, these anxieties seem more relevant now than at any point since the dawn of the post-punk era. Like an antidote to the po-mo dilemma, Interpol convey all the ache of isolation and being driven apart from those you care about in just fifteen minutes, then do themselves one better by suffusing each track with an unmistakable serenity, reckoning with the problem. It's a credit to these unsung talents from the wilderness of New York that they've been able to craft an EP of such power and grace that all I'm left with is the pseudo-intellectual drivel you just waded through. So enough of my crappy armchair philosophy. This mercilessly brief offering is a tiny, self-contained opus of need and longing, damn near perfect in its haunted malaise. And before I go on, let me also note that it's only three dollars. Sweet Jesus, I dare you to give me a reason to pass on this disc, barring Mafia-related coercion or presidential mandate. Interpol is often compared to the late, great Joy Division, and at a glance, it's not hard to see why. But with deeper analysis, the likening is ridiculous-- Interpol has more in common with the hazy-sweet drones of Clinic or the propulsive rhythms and jangling guitars of Mission of Burma than any of Ian Curtis' brooding dirges. Superficially, Paul Banks does sound somewhat similar to Curtis, but only in his compelling delivery-- not his actual voice-- and certainly not enough to warrant the comparison. It's only after careful meditation that the underlying truth becomes clear: Interpol are reminiscent of Joy Division in atmosphere and brutal conviction alone. The instrumentation is tight and dynamic throughout, with elements continually dropping in and out to make way for changing progressions as song structures are subtly stripped and rebuilt in synth crescendos and warbling guitar washes. Opener ""PDA,"" the common-knowledge acronym for ""public display of affection,"" is just that: a heartfelt, last-ditch plea to save a failed relationship while simultaneously acknowledging the futility of the act. ""You will not reach me/ I am resenting a position that is past resentment/ And now I can't consider/ And now there is this distance,"" drives home the message before the band launches into a sublime, sweeping chorus, the music reflecting the emotional conflict by fence-sitting somewhere between gentle and driven. ""Specialist"" begins with poppy bass and a sweetly intoned verse until a surly guitar riff baby-steps its way into the mix like an elementary school bully slowly making his way across the playground. Then he puts you in a hammerlock until you agree to turn your fluffy love poetry into a slightly bent tale of devotion and dominance/co-dependence with lines like, ""Time away from me/ Will get you down,"" and, ""Put your little hand in mine/ Speak when you're spoken of."" Those two tracks bookend the glorious, lazy soaring of ""NYC,"" a paean to Interpol's embattled homeland riddled with mixed emotion. ""I know you've supported me for a long time/ Somehow I'm not impressed/ But New York cares,"" as sung by Banks, demonstrates a touching sincerity. And still, the constant undercurrent of isolation remains in the resignation and weariness of ""I'm tired of spending these lonely nights/ Training myself not to care."" From start to finish, Interpol's EP in preparation for their first full-length effort is vast, moving, and brilliant. Each listen reveals new layers, the band's appeal growing exponentially. The only complaint that can be leveled at this disc is that it's just too short, which in itself fulfills the first law of show business: always leave them wanting more. At this early stage, it's hard to know whether or not the success of this EP is based on the premise that these are simply the best songs Interpol has to offer. But if the boys can eke out a bargain with Old Scratch himself and pour thirty more minutes of sweet nectar like this into a few billion ones and zeros, their souls would certainly be a small price to pay.","As the post-modern world rapidly rushes off to redefine itself for a new generation, the only certainty is the disorientation ...

Mason Jennings/Birds Flying Away,Mason Jennings,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9e99d034d5c69bf5321/1:1/w_160/9717e533.jpg,2002-07-16 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11765-mason-jenningsbirds-flying-away/,Bar/NoneBar/None,"A great one-sentence review of a Butterglory release in some zine years ago: ""Now that Pavement is R.E.M., everybody is Pavement."" Now that Wilco is being inaugurated as heir to those bands, the race is accidentally on to be Wilco. Which is not to imply that Wilco is done being Wilco, just that they've become Wilco the Superentity, the much-prophesied ""American Radiohead"" that Modest Mouse was supposed to become, leaving a sizable gap where Wilco the mere Respectable Act once was. The re-release of these 1998 and 2000 records by Minnesota's Mason Jennings are evidence that he's poised on the brink of a brink: he could assume a lofty role at the pre-infallibility level of Tweedy's outfit, or he could plop into the nutrasweet realm and get stuck between Dave Matthews and Eagle-Eye Cherry. Even his name rides the fence, sounding as much like a wizened troubadour as it does the snobby soccer-prick from high school who wore his shinguards to study hall. The following consumers should take note of Mr. Jennings, assuming you've clung to some disposable income: fans of Hayden's upbeat moments, My Morning Jacket's cheesy moments, or Simon Joyner's short-winded moments, as well as fans of earnest acoustic Beck, and Royal City when they meander. Be warned, though, he poses for photos in fields with horses, leaning his guitar against his leg. I'm just saying. I want to be all perma-cool aesthete and slap Jennings down, but he's hard not to like as long as you aren't expecting lyrical profundity. What he's got is an original voice, an obtuse thing with look-Ma-no-youth heft that brings to mind, but does not sound like, sirs Farrar and Oldham. I would have mentioned young Dylan, but I have to deny the messianic delusion of Jennings' diehard fans (many, many of which, by the way, are heterosexual females, no doubt piqued by how well the self-consciously cute performer fits alongside Ryan Adams and Jeff Buckley in sideburn-themed CD collections). But to harp on the voice. It can be bulbous, then he can deflate it into a wisp. It can swagger, then go butt-naked love-whipped. The intonations can fluctuate within songs; words burp and then sail. On ""Godless,"" this cracker manages to sound, well, black. The song begins in a kind of yard-stomp and builds to a wailing punk anthem, a two-minute cross-section of all the years between the Smithsonian Anthology of American Folk Music and Stephen Malkmus' fetching brat-yelp. One thing Jennings' voice doesn't do well is get defiant-- a few of the in-yo-face bits come off a mite windy. The debut is a tight batch of love songs, during which Jennings isn't afraid to throw the eff-word into the most radio-friendly ditties. Classic songwriter hyper-self-referentiality is abundant here; the speakers use constructions equivalent to ""as for me, I feel like I verbed my noun."" Perhaps this is germane to the glaze of cosmic significance that lovers project, a quantity that peaks during the refrain of the otherwise sublime ""1997"": a couple perceive themselves to be at the center of a supernatural event. This is a tuneful, unpretentious record that allows some of its songs room to switch tempos or throw in some dissonant acoustic-skroid a la the Violent Femmes. On Birds Flying Away, Jennings dares to bring the party down by whipping out his politics and God and Jesus. A lot. The album opens in medias res with the great line ""And with the world comes misery,"" includes a song from a woman's perspective and one about people coming down from mountains with birds trapped in their minds (mere coincidence, I suppose, that a rare Neutral Milk Hotel track boasts a very similar topic), and ends with a pulsing, extended, screaming, clang-jam. ""Black Panther"" bursts into a horn section, and ""Stars Shine Quietly"" (as opposed to loudly?) is driven by breathy saxes, touches that season the guitar/bass/drum arrangements. The electric solos are estimable Americana, the brushed drums can be pimp, and some of the more epic chord progressions are reminiscent of Carter Burwell's soundtracks for Coen brothers films. He even acquits himself, I think, on two much-maligned white-liberal agit-pop tunes about MLK and Corporate America. The portentous plucking or reggae-venom doesn't falter, and Jennings is bold to expand his scope beyond that of acts who can't escape the diary-fodder of 'relationships.' Did I compare him to enough people? He's a male Edith Frost? If Jakob Dylan was Jakob Waits? If Barry White were white? If Jesus was into drummy neo-folk and was a ""Dawson's Creek"" regular? If you don't feel up to deciphering the irony-maze of the Drag City vague-abonds, or if you're a codependent in need of a safe bet for the closing number on a one-month anniversary mixtape, this man writes a decent guileless, baldly windswept love song. Still, you might be a hardcore indie-rocker who finds Jennings a tad too convivial. I admit there's something Corn Flake about him, but nothing that better packaging couldn't surmount. All he has to do is shave that pubic-testimony lower-lip tuft and get some worthy cover art instead of photos of himself (a tactic that smacks of Nashville-size idea-lessness). If he got tattoos and a scarf, he'd be ready to soundtrack a Wes Anderson slo-mo tracking shot. But if he ends up on the soundtrack to Scooby Doo 2, you never read about him here, my name at the bottom is a mistake, and Rollstone McSpin hacked his way into our FTP to post this.",,7.0,
Mortal Mirror,Quix*o*tic,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1b35e6ef9596932024e/1:1/w_160/cdca9df3.gif,2002-07-16 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6598-mortal-mirror/,Kill Rock Stars,"O, Canada, we need to sit down for some face time, just you and me. How's everything? How are all the trees? Good? Glad to hear it. How's the old national self-esteem doing? Only reason I ask is that I've been seeing all these ""Made in Canada"" stickers on things lately. This little plea for attention just seems kinda... desperate, you dig? Don't worry, man; we haven't forgotten about you. Do you feel like we've been neglecting you down here? Why, suddenly, is there this need to be all like, ""Hey! Remember Canada? We make things!"" It just worries me, that's all. You're like a washed up actor desperate for work, attaching your name to anything that crosses the border. Have you heard some of these CDs you've given your precious Canadian blessings to? Well, it happens that I've got one of the steaming piles that you've so lovingly manufactured right here. It's Mortal Mirror by Quixotic, and if it isn't a reason to reconsider pimping out your national pride on just anything, I don't know what is. I was kind of worried from the get-go-- I don't need to tell you that the all-girls-plus-testosterone-infused-drummer thing is rapidly flirting with becoming another indie-rock clich√©. But at least Mick Barr plays bass instead of drums, and Christina and Mira Billotte are sisters, so it's kind of a wash. The album art, a photo by Barbara Billotte, immediately made me wonder just when it was that Kill Rock Stars began signing Goth acts, but, ever conscientious and objective, I simply recalled that no matter how famous Richard Meltzer might be, you can't judge an album solely by its cover art. O, Canada, if only my fears had been dispelled. I was hoping my concerns were unfounded, but it was downhill from the moment I spun the disc. You should have nipped this in the bud, Canada-- I didn't know what I was in for. ""Ice Cream Sundae"" plodded lifelessly at me, nothing but irritatingly repetitive bass and off-key, apathetic vocals. It was stark, minimal, and frightfully unpleasant, and even though it was punctuated with a playful guitar solo motif, that wasn't enough to salvage such an ugly skeleton of a tune. Was she actually singing, ""Walking through a circus of/ Bloody ghouls and perfect fools/ Stupid little people who/ Think that they make all the rules""? I persevered against all better judgment, although by the third track, it was becoming alarmingly clear that this was little more than some copped blues riffs and traditional arrangements laced with misplaced folk-goth atmospherics and vaguely surfy guitars. It tasted like the recipe for musical Ipecac; things looked grim. How many times could they recycle weird, bass-heavy variations of ""The Worms Crawl In, the Worms Crawl Out"" with a funeral march arrangement (""Open Up the Walls"") and a surf instrumental arrangement (""Mortal Mirror"")? At times, they did manage to sound a little like some of the sparsest, most low-key offering from art-rockers Blonde Redhead (a compliment. Also, both bands were produced by the estimable Guy from Fugazi. Coincidence, or phenomenon?), but without any of the flare or vitality (not a compliment). The dismal trudge through the aural mud of Mortal Mirror wouldn't be easy, but duty called. Then, a shock! Track six... what was it? ""Sitting in the Park"" arrested with a pop bassline straight out of a slow crooner from the 50s, and vocals to match. The one thing I can say about Quixotic is that the vocal performances of the Billottes (they trade back and forth) were often quite beautiful, showing a great deal of range while maintaining enough ethereality to pass without a trace (if only the lyrics weren't so terrible). Christina's work on ""Sitting in the Park"" was astounding, and for once, the musical backdrop for her voice was up to the task. I wasn't surprised to discover, then, that it wasn't theirs. No, it was originally by Billy Stewart, and along with ""Tell It Like It Is"" by Aaron Neville and ""Lord of This World"" by Sabbath (Black Metal 4-Eva!), it was in a class by itself from the rest of Mortal Mirror. Bad band, good covers, imagine that shock. O, Canada, you know I love you and I'm only trying to look out for you. Why did you do it? Why export Quixotic and then stamp your good name all over it? Sure the covers are uniformly excellent, but that has a little something to do with the fact that they were written by other people. At the very least, it seems to me that if you listened to even one of the originals off this album, you'd want to keep your involvement as much of a secret as possible. It's not like you don't have plenty of fantastic national treasures to be proud of. It's misleading, anyway! Quixotic are from Washington, D.C.!","O, Canada, we need to sit down for some face time, just you and me. How's everything? How are ...

Afternoon Tales the Morning Never Knew,Birdwatcher,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2b913d197565213892f/1:1/w_160/62c94f8d.jpg,2002-07-15 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/718-afternoon-tales-the-morning-never-knew/,Arena Rock,"Most reviews of the 2001 collaboration between Michael Gira and Dan Matz, What We Did, focused, understandably, on the former's perspective. After all, Gira has steeped himself in the intensity of his musical projects, Swans and the Angels of Light, for the better part of two decades. Matz' work with his own (still extant) band Windsor for the Derby retains much less renown. What We Did marked a shift away from the Swans' thunderous intensity and the Derby's dronescapes, towards more conventional pop songwriting. Now Matz' solo work as The Birdwatcher continues the trend. The second in a trilogy of albums, Afternoon Tales the Morning Never Knew follows The Darkest Hour Is Just Before the Dawn, and will presumably be complemented by another thematic LP focusing on dusk and the night. The Birdwatcher bears all the hallmarks of singer/songwriter-produced music: progressive song structure, careful development, and a consistent sound environment. Matz plays folky ballads infused with elegant lyricism and pop melodies, like a less spacy version of his labelmate Illyah Kuryahkin. He composes songs with a small array of instruments-- acoustic and electric guitars, synthesizers and drums, mostly-- and has a smart sense of restraint. This, unfortunately, is possibly the reason that the album as a whole is kind of dull. ""Afternoon Tales"" opens with ringing chimes much like those of Spanish enviro-folksters Mus, soon layered over with acoustic strums and soft, clicking percussion. Matz breathes over the top a sighing ""aaahhh"" that repeats until the mood becomes rather doleful. Then ""Empty Boat"" clears the air with a light, pumping organ groove, and Anna Neighbor backs up Matz with her sweet voice on the verses. The lyrics are easily evocative: ""Flying now, over top of me/ I'm grafted to the floor/ An empty boat, there's no stopping me/ On the trusting sea, I'm sunken on your shore."" Complete with handclaps, it's a cutesy song, but it also drifts along on a contemplative atmosphere. That vibe gets picked up again on ""A Thousand Ants,"" one of the record's more affecting moments. In an interview, Matz mentioned that this song is about Gibsonton, a small town in Florida with a higher freak quotient than the usual. Having been a Floridian for two decades, I'm not sure what he means when he sings, ""In the hot Florida sun, you always find what you seek""-- surely one of the strange virtues of the state is that there's always yet another townie inlet you've never heard of. Backed only by blues chords on the acoustic, Matz' lonesome voice sounds endearingly matter-of-fact; it's when his pronouncements are more heavy-handed that he falters. One song later, on ""Country Music,"" he's laboring over a banjo and singing with all dramatic honesty that ""country music never lies/ It always tells the truth."" Right. Overall, Afternoon Tales the Morning Never Knew is competent, and intimate in a way that parallels peeping through someone's diary. Such illicit actions have their downside, though, and like the bluster of many personal journals, Matz tackles his subjects too literally at times. His delivery is so forced on many of these tracks that it draws your attention away from the thoughtful lyrics. I holed up in a corner office during a lunch break on a demanding day at work recently, and decided to give The Birdwatcher one last chance, to catch something I'd maybe missed before. I fell asleep.","Most reviews of the 2001 collaboration between Michael Gira and Dan Matz, What We Did, focused, understandably, on the former ...

Narc Beacon,Goodiepal,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf6dabf31b7dc71562e4/1:1/w_160/c3bf20c6.gif,2002-07-15 05:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3519-narc-beacon/,Skipp,"The early word on Dane Kristian Vester (aka Goodiepal, aka Mainpal Inverted) is that he made his living designing ringtones for cellular phone giant Nokia. Though the rumor turned out to be false, there is in fact a track on this record, his debut full-length, titled ""Nokia."" There's not a ringtone to be found on it, though; instead, the track consists of a gorgeous flute melody augmented by faint analog synth gurgles and spare use of metallic percussion. It sounds a lot less like the work of an algorithm-obsessed IDM musician and more like the yearning heart of romantic folkie. The fact is that the Goodiepal is both of these things, in proportions that vary from song to song, which makes for quite an interesting record. Narc Beacon is Goodiepal's first full-length album, but Vester has been releasing material since the early 90s, mostly in the form of 7"" singles (including many collaborations with Manchester deviants V/Vm) and split EPs (including a fantastic 12"" with Opiate.) When DAT Politics asked him to contribute something to their fledgling label Skipp, he complied with this, a mix of new and previously released tracks. What makes this record stand out is that Goodiepal melds his interest in standard instrumentation (he can passably play the recorder, flute, keyboard, lute, mandolin and guitar) with the more open-ended structures of contemporary electronics. The result is an album that occasionally feels quite organic in the acoustic sense, even as the sounds and melodies careen about wildly in a way made possible by modern sequencing software. Nowhere is this duality more evident than on ""Chupa Chups,"" a track where the main melody line is carried by a lute, evoking a medieval atmosphere that is toyed with relentlessly as computers have their way with the delightfully strumming. At times, the melody is doubled on recorder and acoustic guitar provides the chord foundation, but the unpredictability of laptop music continually shoves the lead line off course. Cleverly inverting these elements is the stunning ""My Robotic Skills Have Failed,"" which is, no shit, a five-part a capella composition for vocodered voices, meticulously arranged with counterpoint and unusual harmony. You only need to hear it once to remember it forever. A few tracks appear to draw inspiration from video games, and these are not among my favorites. ""Stomp Naffer"" is certainly an impressive feat of sound design, but the sing-songy melodies are too reminiscent of ""Super Mario Brothers"" to have any real emotional impact. But these few duffs are more than offset by tracks like the heartbreaking brief pair of tracks (only 47 seconds each) entitled ""Flap Nipper,"" where a chorus of recorders and flutes play a melody so gorgeous you want to hold your breath when you listen. All told, Narc Beacon is an engaging (and occasionally perplexing) record that hints at great talent. And since a follow-up full-length on Skipp is presently in the works, it may reveal itself fully sooner than expected.","The early word on Dane Kristian Vester (aka Goodiepal, aka Mainpal Inverted) is that he made his living designing ringtones ...

Have they surmounted their Royal Pussy stereotype to put together a dope hip-hop LP? Has the day finally come where Brits play on DJ mixes alongside Mystikal in a spirit of unity and black ass? Is New Flesh the new savior, the Tiger Woods, if you will, of British beats and rhymes? No! Good god, no, are you joking? Jesus! That's okay, though; this album got my hopes up, too. Aside from the buoyant packaging hype promising 'album of the year' quality, New Flesh also boasts cameo spots by two of the best and hottest underground emcees in the game: Beans (Antipop Consortium) and Gift of Gab (Blackalicious). The album couldn't possibly be anything less than spectacular, could it? Sure it could. As a matter of fact, it could suck. Lightly suck, as on a swizzle stick, but suck nonetheless. Problem is, assuming the greatness of this one rests on a false inference. Supposing Beans and Gift of Gab recorded Understanding by themselves, we'd probably have ourselves an all-time classic. Talent doesn't just disappear, after all. As it is, though, we have two classic tracks, and a bunch of dub/drum-n-bass drivel, melded together with raspy-throated dancehall vox and some other booshit (Sade-esque background vocals, mechanical beats, utter absence of soul, you know, the usual). This stuff is dubby dubby dubby, following in the funky footsteps of another Big Dada-ite, Roots Manuva. Oh wait, did I just call Roots funky? Pardon my British: I meant ""retarded."" Before you pass on your own piece of Understanding, consider this: there is such a thing as a two-song album. System of a Down had one of the finest two-song albums in recent memory last year, taking those two songs, ""Chop Suey"" and ""Toxicity,"" and magically winning top album honors with a few partially respected rock mags. Be ye fooled as I, though, and you found out that nothing else on that album was even close to decent. Confounding! So consider, then, that Understanding begins its spin with a dose of nasty verse on ""Move Slow,"" courtesy of Beans. Tight production, even, with a spacy synth vamp and a deep electronic bass groove. Wait six more tracks and you'll hear Gab standing at the mic for his turn, the smashing ""Communicate,"" with a delivery as fluid and mesmerizing as (almost) anything on Blazing Arrow. It's also got a nice, pulsing dance beat that fits well with the track; I guess New Flesh know how to treat guests. Give 'em good beats, a cup of Earl Grey, maybe some scones, clotted cream. As they say in Manchester: tizzle my schnizzle. Or something like that. You are a junkie, you buy. You are not, you don't. Either way, you go home with two songs, two songs for the price of 13 (or 14, counting the hidden track that JUST SCARED THE SHIT OUT OF ME). Don't grimace and say you were cheated, because now you know. To summarize, you now have understanding. And as I deduced as a child, understanding is the other half of the battle-- not the 'knowing' half, the other one.","I know what you're thinking: ""have the Brits finally done it?""

Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots,The Flaming Lips,by: Will Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdb3ea9e61561daa776c/1:1/w_160/33787706.jpg,2002-07-15 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3081-yoshimi-battles-the-pink-robots/,Warner Bros.,"I think it's safe to say that the Flaming Lips' Wayne Coyne is a genius, equal parts Thomas Edison and P.T. Barnum. Like Edison, Coyne is a relentless tinkerer, a visionary experimenteur with a sci-fi fetish and a soft spot for odd technologies. And like Barnum, Coyne is a consummate showman-- the hand puppets, the boombox orchestras, the oddball short films, the radio-controlled headphones. In 1984, Coyne was just another Oklahoma dreamer with an amateurish psych-rock garage band and a duffel bag stuffed with thrift-store effects pedals; 18 years later, Coyne finds himself in the position of following up one of the most universally regarded albums since Pet Sounds. So let's just come right out and say it: after the one-two punch of Zaireeka and The Soft Bulletin, Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots is a bold and inventive work, brimming with ideas and sublime moments of brilliance. But it's also unfocused and top-heavy, a concept album about robots and karate that, somewhere along the line, strays into languorous, contemplative songs about mortality and death. Nor does Yoshimi always put the Lips' best foot forward-- though Dave Fridmann's production dazzles, the overdriven drums and orchestral swoons that characterized The Soft Bulletin are often lost in a busy mesh of programmed beats and lazy synthstrings. The album gets off to a rollicking start with the winning ""Fight Test,"" a glossy rumination on the call to duty-- whether that's standing up to a playground bully or, as the Lips would have it, an army of rebellious androids bent on world domination. ""If it's not now, then tell me when would be the time that you would stand up and be a man?"" Coyne sings over a thick buzz of keyboards, bass and an almost hip-hop rhythm, offsetting his resolve in the refrain: ""I don't know how a man decides what's right for his own life/ It's all a mystery."" It's a stunning pop song-- easily this album's ""Waitin' for a Superman""-- with an intensely memorable melody and the conflict of Coyne's internal dialogue resonating positively on many levels. Yoshimi takes its first left turn with ""One More Robot/Sympathy 3000-21,"" a slippery detour into glitch augmented with falsetto choruses, reverberating vocals and haywire surges of digital clickery. ""Unit 3000-21 is warming/ Makes a humming sound when its circuits duplicate emotions,"" Coyne sings over a simple bass figure and ambient tones before the song explodes in a burst of overdriven clockwork. It's a dizzying, disorienting sound-- but once the novelty wears off, you've gotta admit it sounds a bit like Steely Dan. ""Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots (Part 1)"" rides a simple melody and ridiculously infectious butt-beat as it sets the stage for the album's short-lived 'concept'-- some entertaining nonsense about an army of Japanese girls training to take on the salmon-hued robots at a kung-fu compound right out of Enter the Dragon. In the chorus, Coyne plays call-and-response with a malevolent synth burble that sounds like a malevolent R2-D2. Its rollercoaster companion, ""Yoshimi (Part 2),"" scales a slinky, ascending wall of farty synth and distant Japanese babble before the bottom falls out, rocketing into chaotic instrumental breakdowns each a shade more intense than the last. It's the closest the Lips have come to writing straight videogame music, complete with crowd noises and bloodcurdling screams (courtesy of the Boredoms' Yoshimi Yokota). And this is where Yoshimi makes its first misstep, on the sleepy ""In the Morning of Magicians."" Though punctuated with bursts of instrumental energy, the arrangement quickly devolves into a thick lite-FM syrup. ""What is love and what is hate, and why does it matter?"" Coyne wonders over a flitty symphony of Muzak strings. Again, the production is flawless-- I especially dig the wavering tape-speed fluctuations on the background vocals-- but the song throws the album into a downbeat, overly philosophical malaise from which it never fully recovers. What happened to Yoshimi again? Pink robots... what pink robots? Yoshimi shines again with the superior ""Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell,"" which pits more existential lyrics over a far more satisfying collage of sounds (vocal samples, snippets of mellotron, a lumbering bass). ""I was waiting on a moment, but the moment never came,"" croons Coyne, echoing the issues of readiness and bravery ""Fight Test"" raised, but also betraying Yoshimi's greatest weakness: the moment never comes. The closest the Lips do come is on the divine ""Are You a Hypnotist?,"" if only for the brief return of some actual drums (brilliantly tracked to create some glitchy, idiosyncratic fills impossible to play in real life). Coyne indulges in wordplay such as, ""I have forgiven you for tricking me again/ But I have been tricked again/ Into forgiving you,"" as the song builds to a distorted swell of fuzzy static and some otherworldly choir. ""Do You Realize"" buzzes and clangs with overproduction, as Coyne breezes through a list of trite observations like, ""Do you realize that everyone you know someday will die?"" and, ""Let them know you realize that life goes fast/ It's hard to make the good things last."" Its parallels with Mike + The Mechanics' ""The Living Years"" are uncanny, and believe me, it hurts me more to say that about a Flaming Lips song than it does you to read it. The already unsubtle onslaught of church bells, woozy background harmonies, and strings ascends into supreme levels of cheese with not one, but two key changes midway through, becoming a near-parody of the genuine emotional weight that carried The Soft Bulletin. And the minor-key Beatleisms of ""It's Summertime (Throbbing Orange Pallbearers)"" are wasted on more childlike philosophizing: ""Look outside/ I know that you'll recognize it's summertime."" After the grandiose, symphonic universalisms of The Soft Bulletin, could it be this record's deepest message is ""stop and smell the roses""? Apparently so, as the self-explanatory ""All We Have Is Now"" retreads these themes for a third time, albeit with an uncharacteristically fragile beauty. All of this might have some ironic poignancy if, god forbid, Coyne were to be diagnosed with some terminal illness tomorrow (and indeed, the latter half of Yoshimi was reportedly inspired by the death of a Japanese fan). But in the context of this album, Yoshimi simply runs out of emotional punch, having expended its boldest moves and most resonant sentiments in the first five songs. Bafflingly, Yoshimi ends with ""Approaching Pavonis Mons by Balloon (Utopia Planitia),"" an anticlimactic instrumental punctuated with distant vocal warbling, laser-beam bursts, and sudden fanfares of trumpet. It didn't have to be this way, judging from the wealth of stronger material widely traded online by net-savvy Lips fans. The evocative ""The Switch That Turns Off the Universe"" (previewed in a 1999 BBC session) would seem to be a perfect fit with Yoshimi's cautionary tales of techno-doom. Or better yet, the Yoshimi outtake ""If I Go Mad/Funeral In My Head"" (now set to appear as a single b-side), an instant Lips classic in which Coyne seemingly conjures rainstorms, orchestras, and deafening applause on command. Despite this album's disappointing brevity (45 minutes, padded with two instrumentals), its dense production and well-crafted melodies offer long-term replayability. Moments like the Coyne-as-robot ""I'll get you, Yoshimi"" barely audible in the title track, or the interchangeable ""I must have been drifting""/""I must have been tripping"" background vocals in ""Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell"" seem tailor-made for bull sessions around the alien-head bong. Though Yoshimi could be considered guilty of adhering too strictly to a tried-and-true formula (fast beats, slow melodies), it's really the more disparate elements that keep this album from building emotionally into a classic. And so, like a double feature of Drunken Master and Terms of Endearment, or a surprise party where the surprise is that your best friend has cancer, ultimately Yoshimi is kind of a bummer.","I think it's safe to say that the Flaming Lips' Wayne Coyne is a genius, equal parts Thomas Edison ...

History That Has No Effect,Tyondai Braxton,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a38aea9e61561daa4cd4/1:1/w_160/a4fd2f22.gif,2002-07-14 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/921-history-that-has-no-effect/,JMZ,"It was impossible to see what was going on to cause all this noise through the crowd. There we were, a few dozen of us crammed into the upstairs of Charlie's Kitchen in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and I had the luck to be smashed in the back, behind a whole bunch of guys twice my height. I swear to God, even if I were seven feet tall, there would always be some guy taller than me at a show. At any rate, the noise was thick and layered, drifting between textures, avoiding structure, but still managing to seem perfectly well contoured. I managed to worm my way up to the front to see who was crafting all this sound, and when I finally got there, I just couldn't believe my eyes. There's this guy on the floor, surrounded by guitar pedals, deep in concentration. He tweaks a knob, he twiddles a dial, he hits a button, and the noise changes on his command. He changes a few patch cords, picks up a microphone and sings into it. You don't hear anything. Then, a few patch cords and buttons later, there's suddenly his voice, warped, mangled, processed and spit back out by about a dozen pieces of machinery. The sound is almost indescribable-- like a choir of angels sucked into a mechanical hellstorm and mauled by electronic demons. Soon, the eye of the storm approaches as things calm down, and this guy, still down there on the floor, picks up the microphone and begins to beatbox, looping these little processed human vocal beats in real time to create astounding rhythms and driving along his alien textures. Soon, he's grabbed a guitar from behind him and he's layering that, too, lacing little snips of rhythm in one at a time before unleashing a swooping lead line over it. People in the restaurant look at him in a mixture of amazement, confusion, and awe, and most of them, it's clear, have no idea just what the fuck is going on. Welcome to the world of Tyondai Braxton, a place where the guitar pedal is the first stop for any sound that might be on its way to your ear. On his debut album, Braxton essentially recreates the performance that I saw that Monday night at Charlie's, and then goes beyond it into territory that's only ever been boldly charted by a few. His realtime method of solo improvisation and looping may be a sight to behold, but it's even better to hear, and on this debut, he comes across like a veteran of the avant-garde, despite a track record that's only begun to run. Braxton opens with three pieces consisting of nothing more than voice and guitar through pedals, all created live. Those laser beam vocal drones I was talking about figure heavily at the beginning, but the best moment of the entire first third of the disc is the instant when Braxton adds a distorted beat and abruptly changes the texture to match it. In three words, it's utterly fucking brilliant. The third section bogs down a bit, with freakish noises panning and careening in all kinds of directions at once, but just when you think he's lost it, Braxton hits you with the album's best piece, ""Raise Yr Arms & Cross Them."" ""Raise Yr Arms"" is the only piece on the album that includes the contributions of other musicians, in the form of Karen Waltuch on violin and Jonah Sacks on cello. Braxton loops multiple guitar parts through his various effects and filters and heads for the drums, pounding out a basic rhythm and looping that as well. Various scraping guitar tones swell up and down, and the drums cut in and out, allowing the cello and violin to snake through a dissonant limbo of guitars. The two pieces that follow are more minimalist, with the ugly, dark guitars that sparsely strum their way through ""2am"" reminding me especially of the blackest passages of Low's Songs for a Dead Pilot. This music is slightly denser, though, and the little squirms of static that bubble up now and then help to unsettle the music even more. Braxton doesn't employ loops here, either, instead playing strictly out of time to keep you guessing when the next layer of grime will come your way. The third installment of the album's midsection plays similarly, though there's more electronic disturbance this time, and the guitars become seasick from pitchshifting. The album's final third is the most song-oriented swath Braxton offers. Whispered vocal loops and intravenous guitars form the basis for the aptly titled ""Violent Light Falling Through Shards,"" which explodes with frenzied, amelodic strumming on clean electric guitars after a brief buildup. The frenzied boil of the guitars lowers to a simmer on ""Struck Everywhere,"" and Braxton, bathed in glowing effects, starts to sing his ass off. His uniquely contoured melody and passionate delivery are haunting to the nth degree, even if what he's singing is completely unintelligible. The album closes with ""Hold On to Distance,"" a remarkable song built on echoing drums and beatboxing. A minimal synthline keeps things in place as Braxton proceeds to sing what would probably be an overblown anthem in anyone else's hands. He keeps it sparse, adding more and more percussive elements as the song progresses, eventually looping its refrain and allowing it to become a part of the texture. His fuzzy guitar chews at the song's foundations from every angle, but it never gives way, instead appropriately fading away. Fade-outs frequently feel like a cop-out on the part of an artist who just didn't feel like writing a proper ending for a song, but here it sounds utterly apropos, as this music doesn't really feel like it has a true ending. Indeed, I'm hoping it won't be very long before I get to where that fade out comes back in. Braxton is obviously a major talent, and I'm anxious for the day when he takes the avant-garde world by storm.","It was impossible to see what was going on to cause all this noise through the crowd.

Oxxxes,Oxes,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba2bc0084474cd0c27a9/1:1/w_160/ef26b8d4.jpg,2002-07-14 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6076-oxxxes/,Monitor,"Put your hands down, I'll get to all the questions about the Oxes' new album in just a second. Before this little farce goes any further, you've all heard about the ""storm"" of ""controversy"" surrounding the Oxes' original album art for Oxxxes. Oh, you haven't? Well, it was a joke, perpetrated by the band and record label in a well-planned bid for publicity. The real joke is that it worked. Put out some fliers and postcards exposing some genuine Ox dick and a hot scenester chick, next thing you know you've got the sexually frustrated indie geeks worked up in a frenzy of sweat and masturbation. Kind of brilliant. Also, kind of embarrassing. I find it a little hard to believe that Baltimore, the hometown of John Waters, was up in arms over the various sexual exploits taking place on the original cover (still available on 'collectable' vinyl!). About the only good things to come out of this manufactured controversy were some entertaining signs from the 'protest photos' on the CD cover reading SARCASM DOES NOT EQUAL IRONY and OXES SUCK COXES. I bring this up because this sort of despicably lame publicity stunt should immediately worry any sort of media savvy consumer (which, of course, you've all proven yourselves to be by coming 'round this hairy old website of ours). This ranks right up there with stunts like Bono going on a ""fact finding"" mission to Africa with the Secretary of the Freakin' Treasury, or Elvis ""dying."" And it's not like the Oxes even need this kind of help. Every single review of Oxxxes spends at least a paragraph on this (I win by wasting two), which just means less time spent discussing their patented brand of full-throttle metallic math rock. But maybe that's just to avoid the task of trying to funnel this sort of wordless aural acupuncture into text-- it just doesn't translate. Describing the Oxes' compositions for two guitars and some industrial strength drums as ""instrumental"" trivializes them. Regular rock bands break the pace of an album with an instrumental for a lark; the Oxes, in the grand tradition of the luminaries of Don Cab, make a valiant effort at instrumental communication. Simply calling it ""math rock"" isn't much good, either. In the immortal words of Mr. Waits, the content of Oxxxes is harder than Chinese algebra, and in every possible way. They know when to let the passive intellectualism of math (or, in the case of the Natalio Fowler and Marc Miller's smoldering guitar interlacing, calculus) give way to playful Metal God flourishes, lest things become too academic. Like a cathedral constructed entirely out of a monolithic slab of poured concrete, Oxxxes is simultaneously complex, stylized structure and dense, dense, dense. So instead of talking about the album, the live show talk gets trotted out. Everything nice that's ever been said about the Oxes' live histrionics is truer than true; they do take full advantage of their wireless kits and put on a fantastic show. The biggest problem with Oxxxes, aside from being just not quite as fun as their self-titled debut, is that even when played at organ-rupturing volumes, it doesn't give the listener anything to latch on to like a guy barreling through the audience with the intent to cause bodily harm does. ""Boss Kitty"" kicks it out Helmet-style in the opening moments for some good old-fashioned, tongue-in-cheek fun; the exultant rhythmic shifts and tricks of ""Half Half & Half"" spark precision riff frenzy hot enough to burn the song down to its foundation. But they certainly don't build the kind of fire that made Don Cab such an institution, and god help me, I can't even sing along! That's not to say I can't enjoy lots of instrumental music; I just expect more from it than lyricless rock. Put it this way: Oxes are not the Autechre of rock and roll. This is an album you can throw on for shits and giggles, if that's your thing. The blistering guitar work on Oxxxes doesn't quite live up to the standards they've set for themselves, but it's sick hott and sharp enough to split the atom, not to mention a hell of a lot more fun than atomic fission. But without vocal help, the visuals of a live performance, or anything beyond mutating time signatures, this album loses a little something that it can't quite replace.","Put your hands down, I'll get to all the questions about the Oxes' new album in just a second ...

Read & Burn 01 EP,Wire,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa565e6ef95969321581/1:1/w_160/11c1e5c6.gif,2002-07-14 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8712-read-burn-01-ep/,Pinkflag,"There are storm clouds looming just over the horizon, kids, and that can only mean one thing. Legend has it that when the planets come into a very careful misalignment, and the economic climate is just so, it's possible for one of those seminal, gone-but-not-forgotten punk bands of yesteryear to rise from the ashes. And now, as the mighty, infinite cosmos would have it, it's Wire's turn to have a go at resurrection. It's a risky prospect-- one that so often detracts from the legacy of legends-- but if they succeed, they prove themselves beyond any talent we could ever have conceived they originally harbored, because to re-enter the rock-making fray after 11 years of silence spells certain doom for anyone except the truly mighty. If you're acquainted with any Wire beyond ""Eardrum Buzz"" or ""Outdoor Miner"" from some awkward punk compilation, feel free to play through, but as minority whip for my Rock Historians Union local 154, I'm obliged to inform the uninitiated. When punk first crossed the Atlantic and crash-landed in England, Wire hit the ground running, and as the flag-bearers for the artier end of the movement, they strip-mined pure gold from its crusty veins while scores of imitators simply half-assed it Sex Pistols-style. Pink Flag, to this day one of the finest statements the genre ever produced, was followed by the more experimental 154 and Chairs Missing, proving that Wire had eclipsed the limitations of mere punk. But rather than burn themselves in effigy as many of their contemporaries seemed content to do, they soon bowed out, claiming they'd plain run out of ideas. It was a move so tasteful it's a wonder that more deserving bands haven't done it (I'll give you a second to think of twenty). Of course, Wire didn't completely heed their own advice, coming back from 86-91 to be swept along in the tail-end of the new wave riptide. But for better or worse, after more than a decade's absence, Wire has fired a warning shot of the coming onslaught, and they call it Read & Burn. By its second track, Read & Burn had far surpassed my expectations. This is indeed the Wire we all know and love, but not exactly as they are known and loved. Here, they've cultivated a sound as lean and raw as anything off even Pink Flag (like they decided to forget their instruments all over again to get a fresh start), but where there their old songs had a minimal sterility, the hooks on this album drip with a wicked venom. Maybe I'm just a sucker for a sneering cockney accent, but the nasty vocal tone and angry, droning guitar buzz employed on most of these six tracks comes as a pleasant surprise; old men that they are, what a shock that they can still summon teen rage on a whim. Any vestiges of their old electronic forays have been mostly abandoned, and they take it to the streets with nothing but the basic elements of rock: guitars, bass, and drums. The newer, more aggressive Wire seems like the right tack for the boys from across the pond, and they've warmed to the role capably, cutting through all eighteen minutes of this EP like an industrial-strength arcwelder through a tub of Parkay. It's comforting to know that beneath it all, though, the same vital, driving energy that Wire has always had forms the foundation of this release. After ten years, ""I Don't Understand"" seems just like a more forceful version of ""Brazil,"" right down to the clanging bass and spitfire vocal delivery. There are echoes of ""Reuters"" under the screeching assault of ""Comet"" (albeit echoes of a much, much faster version). Fundamentally, Wire's minimal approach is still present in the arrangements, even if it's a little harder to detect due to the single, blistering tempo of most of these cuts. ""Germ Ship"" shows up about ten minutes in and immediately shifts the feel of the record, however briefly. The bass is set apart from the frantic grind of the guitar work, which relaxes things ever so slightly before the disturbing vocals come in. Whispered as faintly and insidiously as a death sentence before the chorus shows up to pull the lever, the track stands out from the pack on vocal strength alone. It's excellent, though admittedly, it's also the least Wire-y offering presented. For those die-hards, they've included ""In the Art of Stopping,"" which almost approaches the ultimate paragon of Wire's career, ""Ex-Lion Tamer,"" in sheer anthemic power. Yep, Read & Burn is still Wire, and without even retreading the past. Instead, they've kept much of their essential Wiriness and filtered it through the post-punk filter of years to arrive at sort of a hybrid. It's not going to win them a place in the hearts of Wire fans who can't handle a little change, but if not for a need for change, why else did Wire break up in the first place?","There are storm clouds looming just over the horizon, kids, and that can only mean one thing.

Shockadoom,Freestyle Fellowship,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be22ea9e61561daa7857/1:1/w_160/b97e2302.gif,2002-07-14 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3190-shockadoom/,Whig MusicZen Beats,"To say that Freestyle Fellowship significantly influenced west coast hip-hop is like saying that Jesus was a pivotal figure in Christianity. Before Freestyle Fellowship, the Old Testament of left coast hip-hop consisted of either the soon-to-be-played-out gangster funk of Dr. Dre or aloof oddities such as the Digital Underground. With their seminal debut, To Whom it May Concern, Freestyle Fellowship ushered in a new era of minimalist, bass-heavy tracks and progressive, socially astute lyrics that incorporated both harmonies and spoken word interludes. Not only did they define the genre's musical aesthetic, they also developed the keep-it-underground ethic that has defined the movement. Unfortunately, after reaching a pinnacle with 1993's Innercity Griots, the Fellowship were forced to go on a hiatus due to Self-Jupiter's incarceration. Although they reunited briefly in 1998, only one single was released from that session, and for eight long years, fans of west coast underground were forced to feed off the scraps of inconsistent solo albums and innovatively challenged imitators like Jurassic 5 and Dilated Peoples. When word hit the street that the group was reforming to record what would become 2001's Temptations, the hype was so heavy you would've thought they were about to reinvent sex. Although the universal ridicule that greeted that album was a bit overstated, no one could argue that Temptations was anywhere near the level as their previous two masterpieces. The beats were light and forgettable, and although the individual verses were still strong, the members didn't stay in synch with one another lyrically, which was always a vital essence of the Fellowship dynamic. Although Freestyle Fellowship had repeatedly promised us ""we will never fall the fuck off,"" they appeared to have done just that. In the aftermath of that colossal disappointment, emcee Mikah 9 announced that Freestyle Fellowship had once again disbanded. In light of the dismal chain of events that were to follow, the brilliance of the recently released, from-the-vaults collection Shockadoom is bittersweet. Its songs are taken from the aborted '98 sessions and, while bootlegged on the Internet, have never officially seen the light of day. Listening to this album is like hearing the dark, challenging album we had anticipated from Temptations. There are only eight tracks on this album, including one skit and an extremely brief freestyle offering, but the density and uniqueness of each song makes it seems as though this is much more substantial than a long EP. ""Can You Find the Level of Difficulty in This,"" the album's lead-off track, was originally released in '98 and showcases Freestyle Fellowship at their lyrical best. Mikah 9 provides what may be the best verse of his career, assaulting the uptempo beat with a barrage of mathematical assonance that seamlessly flows off his tongue like a phonetic blitzkrieg. The liner notes indicate each emcee was given thirty minutes to write their verses, and after Mikah dropped his first, Aceyalone and PEACE ended the recording session with Aceyalone commenting that he ""had got to come with something to match that!"" Apparently, the extra time paid off, as Acey's verse is every bit as goosebump-inducing as Mikah's. He raps, ""Rap rhyme designer/ Purely Indubitably Excellent Brilliant Intertwiner/ Kinda Off-Beat Off-Center/ Simple yet confusing/ God Sunshiner with a Twist/ Can you find the level of difficulty in this?"" As on every other track, the lyrics are dazzling. Omid (aka OD), the incredibly underrated producer who was responsible for 1999's bizarre but brilliant compilation album Beneath the Surface, supplies most of the album's beats. His production ranges from dark to darker, incorporating equal-parts cool jazz and fuzzy basement hip-hop that results in a noirish ambience both foreboding and rhythmic. Although OD's tracks have elements of '98 trip-hop, its grittiness helps it age a bit better than most of that genre's offerings, and at times suggests a missing link between the jazziness of early Tribe Called Quest and the industrial soundscapes of El-P. The production on ""Desperate"" is particularly impressive. A loud, thudding bassline provides a brilliant counterpoint to the track's shuffling, jazzy drum loops and perfectly complements the abstract paranoia of the lyrics. By providing such a dark accompaniment, OD seems to be pushing the emcees into a darker terrain, a move that produces-- particularly on the first half of the album-- some of the most complex and morally ambivalent work of their careers. It's a lyrical density that was present in some of their earlier material, but sorely missing from the lightweight Temptations. For ""We Will Never Fall the Fuck Off,"" a sax player and a trumpeter are added to the mix with very positive results. Freestyle Fellowship has always incorporated a healthy dose of jazz into their tracks, so this seems like a very natural progression. And as the track fades out, the horn players reference the sample from ""Inner City Boundaries,"" which is a knowing nod to all Fellowship devotees. Unfortunately, the track's lyrics are of the boring braggadocio variety that tainted much of west coast hip-hop from that particular era. That minor lyrical misstep aside, Shockadoom is absolutely brilliant. The energy and creativity here is on par with anything from either Innercity Griots or To Whom It May Concern. And it makes one wonder what would have been possible if Freestyle Fellowship could've stayed together long enough to record a full length in '98, and not waited until 2001 when the synergy between the four emcees had diminished.","To say that Freestyle Fellowship significantly influenced west coast hip-hop is like saying that Jesus was a pivotal figure in ...

A Different Kind of Listening,Nationale Blue,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3b1c0084474cd0c3519/1:1/w_160/6085f730.jpg,2002-07-10 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5725-a-different-kind-of-listening/,Iodine,"You remember back in high school when they made you take all of those math classes you never thought you'd use? Sure you do. You used to sit behind that weird kid Jimmy, who always picked his nose and stuck the goobers to the bottom of his chair. And for the life of you, you couldn't figure out when the hell you were ever going to utilize your extensive knowledge of quadratic equations. But you sat through it all-- you learned the FOIL method and the difference between a sine and a cosine, and you were glad when it was all over and you'd never have to deal with complex math again. Well, get ready for a time warp, because math is back, girlfriend. And this time, it rocks. On their debut album, Boston's Nationale Blue throw more numbers in your face than you could possibly comprehend without running for that graphing calculator you first mastered ""Tetris"" on all those years ago. Seems these boys are fickle fellas, rarely staying loyal to any one time signature for very long. The trio wastes no time letting you know what's up, opening their debut with a skittering programmed beat and laying sounds on top of it like gathering clouds before letting loose in a torrent of pure rhythm. The instrumental, ""Silver Alien Pyjamas in II Movements,"" bursts free with keyboard ostinatos and hovering, alien guitars, moving quickly onto charging guitar heroism before finally settling for a while on a more relaxed groove. Taken for what it is, it's perfectly exhilarating, though my major complaint-- and this applies to several tracks on the album-- is that melody isn't a constant enough presence. Occasionally, the band will simply be jamming, with nothing to support, a fact that weakens the album somewhat. Over half of A Different Kind of Listening is instrumental, and it's pretty easy to see why. The band is highly skilled at hitting the listener with hairpin turns and laying down intriguing guitar textures, but their songwriting and vocal skills haven't quite caught up to their compositional mastery. In much the same way that melody's absence can be felt during some stretches, a lot of the vocal parts feel underdeveloped and a little too amelodic, especially early in the disc. To the band's credit, the album actually gathers strength as it wears on-- the band seems to have saved some of the best parts for last. For instance, ""Unraveling Secret Codes,"" an instrumental deconstruction of the vocal tune ""Secret Codes."" The instrumental effectively takes the most basic musical elements of song and stretches them like rhythmic putty to their logical breaking point. The shouted, punkish vocal parts also start to fit in better, as the band builds rhythmic environments for the verses that house them more appropriately. ""Hearts and Knives"" manages a thrashing chorus with its repeated mantra of, ""In the river, you'll fall."" It's one of the dirtiest tracks here, too, crying up from a blanket of distortion that the band is only too happy to fold up and stow away on most of the tracks. This works to the band's advantage, as their intricately interlocking parts come through best when the guitars are clean and well defined. Instrumental ""Where the Hawks Fly"" creeps along on one of the band's most steadfast rhythms, as bassist Dave Altman and drummer Adam Kriney lock in with each other and guitarist Reuben Bettsak allows himself to wander a little more. As much as their fast and furious rhythmic shifts and u-turns can be frequently engaging and interesting, it's nice to hear them stick around in regular old four for a while. Of course, you can't get off the hook that easily. There's plenty more complex math to be had on the galloping one-two combination of ""Made Up Meanings to Made Up Words"" and closer ""Your Head Is in the Dark, I Cannot Extract You."" ""Your Head"" is one of the band's finest offerings, clanging along mightily on a thick bassline and charging drums outlined by rapidly strummed guitar. After the last vocal section (you could hardly label things choruses and verses in this realm-- the songs have far too many sections and breakdowns), the band rolls up their sleeves to reveal some surprisingly thick biceps, pummeling one last time signature into the ground before careening to a tightly wound finish. And there you have it. By this point, your ass has been math-rocked six ways from Sunday, and you'll rarely hear it done with more conviction or facility. When they're not out graphing new directions for their music, the Nationale Blue like to smash their head pretty hard on the punk rock, too, and it shows in the energetic and convincing performances they put up. As well as they present it, though, there's a certain emotional distance to the music that means it's definitely not going to be everyone's bag. But the Nationale Blue do manage to pull off what none of my teachers ever managed to: they make math appealing, and I don't even have to sit behind Jimmy to enjoy it.","You remember back in high school when they made you take all of those math classes you never thought you ...

Extreme Bukake,Simon Wickham-Smith,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa30ea9e61561daa5b65/1:1/w_160/ac109cc1.jpg,2002-07-10 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8675-extreme-bukake/,VHF,"So yeah, I spent some time at a Tibetan monastery. I don't want to brag, but it was pretty cool. You probably have an image of us sitting around moaning all day or sipping tea with the Dalai Lama. But this was a really cool monastery: we prayed hard, we played hard, and we studied the deadliest martial arts. We'd go maybe four hours in morning meditation, two hours study, break to get a bagel, and then five hours of beating each other bloody. Then we'd chant bird songs. I can't really describe how much I learned in that time. We lived the life of the spirit and the mind. But we had some worldly conveniences: we had a snack bar in the basement, and you could shave your head with an electric razor. Movie types came through all the time-- heck, Jet Li wanted to make a film about us-- and we also had guest lecturers. That's how I met composer, astrologist, and all around swell guy Simon Wickham-Smith. We called him the Punk Monk. He spent two years in a monastery, and he could actually speak Tibetan. (I never learned the language. It's like Icelandic-- everyone you want to talk to speaks English, so it never gets on your 'to do' list.) We weren't expecting him: he just showed up one day, climbing up the side of our mountain with a didjeridoo and an iBook laptop computer strapped to his back. ""I feel heartened by my climb,"" he greeted us. ""Yeah, it's a real ab-slammer. But next time try the ski lift. It has a coffee bar!"" Wickham-Smith could be as serious as your ancestor's grave-- he'd hunch over that iBook for hours, composing long, intense pieces of music. But when he wasn't working it was all play. The guy liked his whiskey older than his women, and when it came to sex... well, you try catching some zzz's while someone's banging your roommate's head into a humble stone headboard all night. No wonder I failed my triple-flip-kick-in-the-jaw test for my ""Flying Feet of the Gods"" class. But as I was saying, Wickham-Smith was serious about music, and he was an enlightened man of faith. He brought us an early release of his album Extreme Bukake, which he recorded on a laptop in Oxford, England. 'Bukake,' or 'bukkake,' means... well, you're online, you'll have more fun looking it up yourself. The three pieces on the disc, abstract, sometimes drone-like soundscapes that run from seven to forty minutes in length, were inspired by three stages of his religious life. Wickham-Smith grew up Catholic, and then spent a couple years with the Hare Krishnas, before joining what we kiddingly call ""the winning team"": Tibetan Buddhism. Each piece reflects one of these faiths. He built the two-part ""Ave Regina Celorum"" around a Catholic hymn, sticking excerpts of choral singing on top of sustained synthesizer chords and jarring sound effects. The track's second part has distorted wind sounds and intermittent clicking. It sounds like he pitch-shifted one of the sopranos right through the steeple, and he distorts the vocals to make them sound near and then far, clear and distorted. Wickham-Smith refuses to let the heavenly sounds soothe us: we glimpse the ""Ave Maria""/Gorecki's 3rd Symphony potential through the lo-fi rasp, but he won't give in to it. Wickham-Smith suggested this would make good meditation music, but it lasted about five seconds with our group; if I'm not serene all morning I get a neck crick. Another piece, ""Sri Guru Vandana,"" contains a... chant? from the Hare Krishna tradition. It blasts out at full volume with the vocals turned into a scratchy, distorted mess; they're wrapped in glitches, hiss and other sonic barbed wire. Between the vocals, Wickham-Smith inserts long notes like drones from a horn, with static and wind-like groans layered in. This, one of the record's better tracks, combines the vulgarity of the album title with 'pure' spirituality. But it's a brutal experience: Wickham-Smith claims the piece reflects the 'positive' side of his experience with the Krishnas, but if that's true, I don't want to know what the downside was. The real winner here, though, is ""The Self-Immolation of Thich Quang Duc,"" a representation of the inner thoughts of a Vietnamese Buddhist monk. Thich Quang Duc had himself set on fire in 1963 to protest his government. I know what you're thinking, that the piece about the dead guy is always going to be the most impressive. But this is also the shortest and most intense piece of music: it's just a glitchy beat that sounds like a heart, racing in anticipation of what's about to happen, with abstract swells representing street noises. The day before Wickham-Smith packed up and left, I didn't have time to talk to him: that was the day of the big Monks/Ninjas game, and I'm the second-string quarterback. I regretted that, because this album left me with a lot of questions. The music itself is okay: aside from ""Thich Quang Doc,"" it could stand to be more compelling. I think calling ""Ave Regina Celorum"" a 'meditation' piece is just a dodge around how slack it sounds at forty minutes. But the ideas are fascinating. Wickham-Smith takes spiritual content and ships it under the most corporeal title possible. He sets themes about religious life in the real world-- the dedication of a spiritualist who kills himself for politics; the distortion of the abject beauty of religious music. Nothing pure gets out of this album without some dirt on it. And it's deep listening music that makes you think, instead of drift off-- way better than 'that hippie New Age shit' our guru's always ranting against. I had a lot to talk about with Simon, but we never had a chance to discuss it. When I got back from the game, he was drunker than the sixth Dalai Lama. He had a nun under each arm and was yelling at everyone to get in the rec room: ""Last one in the hot tub gets bukkaked!""","So yeah, I spent some time at a Tibetan monastery.

Heathen Chemistry,Oasis,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b993eb335119a49ec7f9/1:1/w_160/b761752a.jpg,2002-07-10 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5931-heathen-chemistry/,Epic,"Q: So I'm told you have a rather controversial theory about art, is that true? A: [laughing] Yes, and it's gotten me in quite a bit of trouble. Q: Could you explain it for us? A: Well, first of all, it's not the most original of ideas. I actually stole it from Mrs. Hennesey, my fourth grade art teacher. She always used to say that there's no such thing as bad art, which, for many years, I just wrote off as a meaningless self-esteem booster. But the more I've thought about it, the more it makes sense. So nowadays I say All Art is Good Art. Q: All art is good art... intriguing. A: Yeah, it seems like a bold statement, but it's really not that crazy. Any endeavor that strives to be art necessarily involves a certain amount of effort and thought, and thus has meaning regardless of skill level, originality, or audience appreciation. A teenager's doodles in social studies class-- that's fine art. The guy at the bar doing a herky-jerky dance to Billy Joel on the jukebox-- that's modern dance, whether he knows it or not. Q: So by extension, criticism is irrelevant? A: That's right. Who is anybody to judge the relative worth of an artistic product? And it's ironic, because by writing a criticism, the critic him- or herself is also making art! [laughing] But criticism is hopelessly subjective, one person's opinion can't possibly take into account how every single person would perceive a given piece. To use a musical example, take the band Journey. Journey is reviled by music critics everywhere, but my brother and I love driving down the coast singing along to ""Any Way You Want It"" at the top of our lungs. It's all relative. Q: Well, if I may give you another musical example, what would you say about a band like Oasis? A: That's another band that critics turn their nose up to, but they have some great songs. ""Wonderwall,"" ""Champagne Supernova,"" ""Supersonic;"" good stuff, but universally panned for being too derivative. There are a lot of people out there who don't care how much Oasis cops from the Beatles though, they just want to hear a good song they can sing along to. Again, relativity. Q: Have you heard Oasis' new album? A: [coughing] Excuse me, sorry... they have a new album? Q: Yes, Heathen Chemistry. It came out last week. A: Didn't they break up or something? I thought I heard on VH1 or somewhere that the brothers weren't speaking to each other. Q: No, the Gallaghers are still together. They replaced the rest of the band, but they still lead, in their quarrelsome way. A: Well, since I haven't heard the album, I can't really intelligently comment on it. Q: Oh, but I have a copy right here. I'll put it on. A: Oh, gee... okay. Q: [music starts] While we're listening, I'll quote some lyrics-- I'd like to hear how they fit in with your theory. The lead single, ""The Hindu Times,"" revolves around one of Oasis' favorite topics with the chorus, ""I get so high I just can't feel it."" Songs like ""Little by Little"" show that the brothers are growing up, though, expressing thoughts like, ""We the people fight for our existence/ We don't claim to be perfect but we're free,"" and bemoaning that ""my God woke up on the wrong side of His bed."" But the most frequently touched upon topic is that of the woman who done them wrong, such as the harpy in ""Force of Nature"" who is castigated for ""smoking all my stash/ And burning all my cash."" A: No, wait a second, you had to have made that last one up. Q: Just listen [""Force of Nature"" plays in background] A: My God. It's the chorus, even! Q: So, is it art? A: Well, the... um... lyrics, as clunky as they are, still reflect a certain point of view. Q: That of the hedonistic rock star, head full of cocaine, bemoaning his lifestyle of promiscuous sex and striving for an easy quasi-spirituality? A: Yeah, sure. It's still a point of view... I guess. But the lyrics are just one aspect of any musical piece. Q: You're exactly right. And I think Heathen Chemistry's instrumental, ""A Quick Peep,"" is the purest example of Oasis' musicality. Here, let me play it for you. A: See, now you're putting me on. I've heard that before, it's the Allman Brothers or Clapton or somebody. Q: Nope, still Oasis. A: Hmmm. Well, at least they're not stealing tricks from the Beatles any more, right? [laughing] Q: No, they still are. [plays ""Born on a Different Cloud""] A: Wow. Well, as I said before, originality isn't necessarily a prerequisite for artistic achievement. Many great artists have been deeply influenced by their forebears. Q: So if, say, somebody Xeroxed the entirety of Crime and Punishment, changed the title to Russian Psycho, and released it to the public, that would be okay? A: Um... well, that's an extreme example. Q: Oh. Well, it gets better. Because Heathen Chemistry also takes the time to cop riffs and progressions from previous Oasis hits: ""Stop Crying Your Heart Out"" has the same string syrup as ""Wonderwall,"" ""Hung in a Bad Place"" recycles the noise and whine of pretty much every Definitely Maybe track, and so on. So it's like our hypothetical artist repackaged the text of Russian Psycho as Latvian Maniac and passed it off as his newest work. Still art? A: Leave me alone.","Q: So I'm told you have a rather controversial theory about art, is that true?
A: Yes, and it ...

Soundbombing III,Various Artists,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7cab1335d7bf1699116/1:1/w_160/c5d741ee.jpg,2002-07-10 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1961-soundbombing-iii/,Rawkus,"""I miss Rawkus,"" I caught myself mumbling as I leafed through vintage Mos Def singles at Amoeba Records. Once upon a time (or 1997, to be exact), in a metaphorical doublewide far, far away, Rawkus stormed into my musical trailer park, yanked that softcore gangsta shit off my decks, and dropped some of the illest, freshest sounds since EPMD and Brand Nubians rocked the mic. Remember Blackstar? Company Flow? Pharoahe Monch? Sure you do. And so what if Rawkus hasn't released a decent full-length in the past two years? So what if their business plan faltered and they were forced to enter into some sort of shady agreement with Universal? The sentimentalist in me wanted to believe that there was still enough NYC underground magic for Rawkus to reclaim its throne, or at least produce another headnoddin' classic. So when they came knockin' with the latest addition in their previously excellent Soundbombing series, I plopped down my 15 bones and held my breath, hoping to be reassured that Rawkus was still a viable, relevant hip-hop label. Unfortunately, Soundbombing III is about as reassuring as spotting your girlfriend in a porn getting gangbanged by AIDS patients. And the worst part is that, not only does Rawkus seemingly systematically undercut its own credibility, but also the credibility of the other formerly 'conscious' emcees that helped propel it to prominence in the late 90s. Q-Tip, Common, Talib Kweli, Pharaoh Monch, the Roots, and Mos Def are all dragged down into the heavily commercialized inferno with some of the worst performances of their respective careers. The Mos Def track ""Freak Daddy"" is the most disappointing here. I'm not even sure where to begin describing how god-awful this track is, but I will mention that Destiny's Child's Beyonc√© Knowles, of all people, shares the songwriting credits. And it's even a sub-par outing for Beyonc√©. To start with, the production is the ill-begotten marriage of pointlessly dissonant, over-the-top rock with the stuttered, pimp-swaggering stylings of the ever-popular Rockwilder. Mos also makes the unfortunate choice of eschewing his previously conscious, poetic lyrics in favor of a more materialistic, straightforward style. At one point he raps, ""Make way when my truck rolls through/ Or get rolled over like you was new road.../ Act wrong and get bl-bl-blasted on."" Ugh! If Mos can't come any stronger than this, I suggest that he either retire from the hip-hop game or hire himself a ghost writer. Rumor has it that he's placed his hip-hop career on hold while he finishes a new movie with Marky Mark (of Funky Bunch fame). I applaud that decision because, frankly, the Funky Bunch have delivered stronger, more lyrically on-point songs than ""Freak Daddy."" Fellow Blackstar alumnus DJ Hi-Tek contributes ""Crew Deep,"" a surprisingly understated 70s-funk number that's really just a relaxed retread of Sugar Hill's ""Rapper's Delight."" It's pleasant enough until you realize that, while Missy Elliot is billed as the guest emcee, Hi-Tek merely uses a sample from last year's hit, ""Get Ur Freak On,"" to augment the chorus. And this isn't the only case of blatantly false and manipulative advertising. Although he's listed alongside Styles P. from the Ruff Ryders, Pharaoh Monch only graces the mic for the brief chorus of ""My Life"" and leaves the verses for Styles P, who's nowhere near being in the same league. ""What Lies Beneath"" finds former Tribe Called Quest emcee Q-tip further dissolving into a half-assed parody of his former self. Although his rhymes aren't quite as jigga-fied as on Amplified, his thoughts are random, his flow is stale, and his voice carries a downtrodden inflection that seems to betray his newfound apathy and cynicism. Listening to this song was like watching Muhammad Ali fight Larry Holmes: you shut your eyes and pray that the man retires before he further damages himself, but you know there's too much money involved for that to happen. Though I hate to concede anything to this album, I should state that not everything here is complete shit. Jonell's ""Round and Round (Remix)"" retains the light and lovely Spanish guitar line of the original, and although the verses-- supplied by Method Man, Kool G. Rap, and Pharaoh Monch-- aren't exactly revelatory, they are adequate. And R.A. The Rugged Man contributes the album's finest song with the old-skool nostalgia track ""On the Block (Golden Era)."" As R.A. references everyone from Slick Rick to the Juice Crew, you find yourself wishing for just a little taste of that old-school charm. But really, you're just wishing Rawkus hadn't pawned off their name and credibility for the giant glistening crack-rock of pop suckerdom. You're just wishing that you hadn't bought this bummer of an album in the first place and forever tarnished your image of your hip-hop heroes. And finally, you're just wishing someone would just turn this shit off.","""I miss Rawkus,"" I caught myself mumbling as I leafed through vintage Mos Def singles at Amoeba Records.\n\ Once ...

Astronaut EP,Quasimoto,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1bfb1335d7bf169832e/1:1/w_160/414a91ab.gif,2002-07-09 05:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6611-astronaut-ep/,Antidote,"Legend has it that somewhere in Southern Cali, buried beneath stacks of vinyl and jars of kind bud, hip-hop maestro Otis Jackson Jr. (aka Madlib) hunches over an old and battered SP 1200, relentlessly coping samples and building tracks so rich and smooth that they can only be called musical butter. He rarely sleeps, and some days he never even leaves his lab, preferring to spend in excess of 15 hours honing his craft. There are over a dozen completed albums in the can (including two additional Quas albums and 12 from his jazz group Yesterday's New Quintet), as well as numerous beat albums and mix tapes that are recorded on a daily basis. But, like an imprisoned Genet scribbling Our Lady of the Flowers on toilet tissue, Madlib doesn't hold any illusions that a large majority of his material will ever be released-- due to both their sheer quantity and sample-clearance issues (fuck intellectual property!). But when the muse calls-- and apparently she's got the man on speed-dial-- Madlib never hesitates to light a splif and start diggin'. Madlib's latest, the vinyl-only EP Astronaut, was recorded in the same time period as The Unseen, the '00 classic that introduced us to Madlib's bugged out alter-ego Quasimoto. While the album is technically a Quasimoto release, there's only one song on the three-song EP where Madlib affects the classic, helium-tinted Quas voice. But don't despair, the Quas vibe permeates the album, and the songs on this one are as good as anything on The Unseen. After a short jazz interlude, the album kicks off proper with the gleefully blunted title track. ""You ain't no astronaut,"" a sample voice declares, quickly followed by Quasimoto's retort: ""but we've been out here in orbit, walked further than the moon, ain't we."" A string and horn based sample, which is both psychedelic and sad, anchors the song and perfectly compliments Quasimoto's nearly nonsensical lyrics. In addition to the music, Madlib liberally sprinkles a spoken word sample that functions as yet another narrative voice. This is a device Madlib often employs, and it further decenters the track as it adds a 70s blaxploitation vibe central to the Quas persona. Although the song ""Astronaut"" is a nice addition to Quas' catalog, the real gem here is the second track, ""Am I Confused?"" The title's rhetorical question, which is repeated in the chorus, reflects the artist's inner-turmoil as he deals with issues of self-destruction, loss, and community. Thematically speaking, this is one of his most self-reflective, complex and rewarding songs to date. Recalling Marvin Gaye's classic ""What's Going On,"" the song addresses Madlib's feelings of confusion and helplessness as he witnesses the deterioration of his friends and family members. But whereas ""What's Going On"" took a more reductionary, macrocosmic view, ""Am I Confused?"" suggests the ills that infect its inhabitants are a result of their own deeply embedded self-destructive urges. The song is populated with adulterous fathers and cancerous break-dancers, an AIDS-stricken sister and inner-city derelicts ""drinkin' nightrain and pumpin' needles in their vein."" Throughout the song, Madlib constantly modulates his voice so that it appears there are numerous emcees on the track. This is a nice touch in that it lifts the veil of anonymity and breaches the gap between the two personas of Madlib and Quasimoto, suggesting that the tragedies described are something both sides of Otis Jackson can agree upon. The song's production is anchored by a xylophone sample that's a melancholy, downbeat slice of classic 70s soul-- in other words, vintage Madlib. Astronaut's import- and vinyl-only status may make it difficult for the average American consumer to access, but the songs on this record are just too precious to be trusted to anything other than vinyl. The only complaint I had-- and the only reason that I didn't give this a higher rating-- is that the label left one whole side of the record blank, not bothering to press the instrumentals, a rarity for the DJ-friendly Madlib. But that somewhat petty and selfish complaint aside, this is one record every Quasimoto fan is gonna need to cop.","Legend has it that somewhere in Southern Cali, buried beneath stacks of vinyl and jars of kind bud, hip-hop maestro ...

Go 2 / Black Sea / English Settlement,XTC,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aad7c0084474cd0c127c/1:1/w_160/72f7aea4.gif,2002-07-09 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8833-go-2-black-sea-english-settlement/,Virgin,"Nothing bugs me more than 'digitally remastered' reissues of discs that I already own, with their improved liner notes and superior sound. Why do we need to replace our old copies? Because the label screwed up the first time! They half-assed the original release and they expect us to buy it again now that they've fixed it up. Until now, I was happy with my XTC CDs. The liner notes were skimpy, but the discs sounded fine, and most of them came with bonus tracks. Now Virgin is reissuing the whole batch again, from 1978's White Music to 1992's Nonsuch, the band's last album with the label. For a test, I picked up the new edition of English Settlement and compared it to my twelve year-old CD-- which, by the way, has no scratches or flaws, and the ink, contrary to legend, hasn't eaten through the plastic and corroded the disc. There is no reason to replace it. Except that the new one actually sounds better. Comparing it on a good stereo, it's obvious that the sound is bigger and crisper, and the instruments are more clearly differentiated. Check out ""Yacht Dance"": it's like somebody wiped off a layer of grime. And now that I've listened to this, even my old copy of Drums and Wires sounds muddy. Bastards. These reissues are now trickling into the States, and Go 2, Black Sea, and English Settlement-- their second, fourth and fifth records, respectively-- came at the end of last month. Each disc gets 24-bit remastered sound and a better booklet. They include the same bonus tracks as the original CD releases: Black Sea has three extra cuts, Go 2 includes the single ""Are You Receiving Me?,"" and English Settlement, a double-album, is packed by itself onto a single disc. The only difference is that this time, the bonus tracks are at the end instead of the middle. That preserves the flow, but it also assumes you're ready to listen to any more music after, say, Black Sea's ""Travels in Nihilon"" or Drums and Wires' ""Complicated Game."" Those closers were so right for those albums that I'd rather have an intermission than an encore. Let's say that you've led an XTC-free life and you've never heard these albums. These three take us from the band's first struggling line-up to (arguably) their best album, English Settlement, which is also (inarguably) one of the best albums of the 1980s. But when they recorded Go 2, the band had just begun to garner attention. Their Buddy Holly-on-amphetamines sound merged with punk to make music that was noisy and jittery, danceable enough for the crowds at the clubs, and suspiciously poppy thanks to the catchy hooks and their trademark verse-chorus-verse-chorus-explode pattern. Go 2 captures the moment, but it was rushed out too quickly. In fact, it could be the worst album they've ever made. The songs are even weaker than the ones on their debut, White Music. You have to like the infectious tune and whoomping rhythm section on guitarist Andy Partridge's ""Meccanik Dancing (Oh We Go!),"" or bassist Colin Moulding's rocker ""Crowded Room."" But even the good songs get weak performances, as the band has trouble staying 'on message': ""Battery Brides,"" Partridge's nod to Brian Eno, sounds lackluster, while other songs sound too spastic. Partridge is still working out the kinks here as a singer, and his guitar would become more focused after Dave Gregory joined as the second axe. But the album's biggest weakness, and the line-up's worst misfit, is Barry Andrews, who plays the hockey rink-style organ. The instrument is great in small doses (the buzzing on ""Life Is Good in the Greenhouse,"" for example), but after hearing it needle and pierce every song on this album, I'm ready to smash it, shred the blueprints and burn down the factory. And Andrews himself is no prize. He writes one track and co-writes another, and they're the worst songs the band ever played: one is a fake reggae called ""Super-Tuff,"" and the other goes, ""I don't know what she done wrong but I want to hurt her/ Take it out on her/ With my weapon."" A lot of us can take misogyny in valid artistic contexts, but this guy's as dim as a sack of rocks. Andrews left the band after Go 2, and Dave Gregory joined to play guitar and keyboards. With Terry Chambers remaining on drums, this is the line-up that finally clicks. My friends and I argue about which is the better classic: 1979's Drums and Wires or 1980's Black Sea. On the former they nailed the visceral sound described by the title-- the jagged, jittery guitars and earth-thudding drums. Songs like ""Helicopter"" and ""Scissorman"" owed a lot not just to the hooks and tunes, but to the impact of Gregory and Partridge shredding fingers on strings, and Chambers and Moulding's loose-necked rhythm section. On Black Sea, however, they act more like a pop group. The guitars are less nervous, and the songs-- sharper and catchier than ever before-- get more room to breathe: ""Generals and Majors"" sounds jumpy but the guitars play melodies instead of textures. ""Respectable Street"" and ""Burning with Optimism's Flames"" slow down enough to let the riffs sink in, and ""Towers of London"" paints tall images with its stone-laying guitar lines. Partridge also finally shows his talent as an expressive pop singer, stretching and mauling the words of ""No Language in Our Lungs."" Black Sea has tunes like ""Sgt. Rock"" that-- as much as Partridge has disowned the lyrics-- will never vacate your brain. (Sing it with me: ""If I could only be tough like him..."") But ""Rocket in a Bottle"" is one of their most jet-fueled songs, and ""Travels in Nihilon"" is one of their strangest, with the arena-sized drums, Komodo dragon-like bass, and guitars that sound like flaming stacks of wood. Partridge deserves credit here for experimenting with avant-pop yet never ignoring or undermining the song. (He left the really indulgent stuff for his solo albums.) Two years later, XTC released English Settlement. I can complain about Virgin's rerelease policy as much as I want, but the nice thing about buying this is that I revisited an album that's been in my life for years. I first listened to this with my high school sweetheart, and I'm playing it now a week before I get married. I'm far from the first person to say that it ages well-- in fact, it sounds just as fresh now as it ever did, and there are some songs like ""All of a Sudden (It's Too Late)"" that I didn't even like until I was in my mid-twenties. English Settlement marks the change from the jumpy live band that preceded it to the assured studio band that came after. It's all drums and wires-- with some bird-like sax honks that suit the vaguely African expanse of the sound-- but they're slowed and simplified into the two components that, to crib an image from David Toop, most resemble the human body: the nervous music of the head, and the deep, heavy music of the heart. The skittering guitars on ""English Roundabout"" would have fit in their earlier work, but this time they're acoustic and softer. And the songs run longer: the killer beat at the end of ""Melt the Guns"" takes all the time it needs to play itself out, and ""All of a Sudden"" lets Partridge wring every nuance from what could be the best lyrics he's ever written, making broad statements about life and love through simple, sharp imagery. It's the only song on the album that's not about something specific: it could be a breakup song, but it turns into a lament from a young man who's just realizing that he has years of sad aggravation ahead of him. From the first song, the album sounds more serious and self-assured than anything they'd yet recorded. Moulding's chase theme, ""Runaways,"" opens the album with an urgency that's almost disturbing until it fades to the street anthem of ""Ball and Chain."" I came this close to writing that Partridge's ""Senses Working Overtime"" was ""a cornerstone of modern civilization."" And how about ""Snowman,"" with the bitter lyrics that are totally overturned by the tooth-rottingly sweet melody? ""Jason and the Argonauts"" feels simultaneously like sailing the high seas and getting thrown in a trash can and rolled down a hill. And as for the drumming and percussion, it's clear that though XTC is underrated, Terry Chambers was even more ignored: on every song here his playing is impeccable. But what gets me most about hearing this album is the way it captures their 'earnest young men' phase. It's that transitory time in their mid-to-late twenties when they could make political statements with easy conviction (""melt the guns,"" ""knuckle down, love his race,"" ""science once again robs us of our jobs"") or toss off songs as beautiful as ""Yacht Dance"" without overworking or overthinking them. This is earnestness that doesn't make excuses for itself, doesn't fret over bold statements, and doesn't even seem aware of how clearly and confidently it's proceeding. English Settlement catches that moment, as they change from a young band to a mature one: this is the pivot on which their entire career hangs, and a vantage point from which both ends of it make sense. It's timeless.","

"Orange Twin Field Works, Vol. 1",Jeff Mangum,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c389c0084474cd0c34ba/1:1/w_160/31b3b7f0.gif,2002-07-09 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5069-orange-twin-field-works-vol-1/,Orange Twin,"As frontman for what was arguably one of the most admired psychedelic pop bands of the last decade, and as the primary creative force behind two of the most admired indie rock albums ever, Jeff Mangum's decision to put his work with Neutral Milk Hotel on the backburner (some suspect permanently) came as a surprise to music fans everywhere. Even more shocking to many was what followed: a trip to Europe and the announcement of a new project. Titled Orange Twin Field Works, Volume One, Mangum's newest work has none of the precisely layered instrumentation or eminently empathetic lyricism of Mangum's earlier work. In fact, Mangum's distinctive, shaky voice is nowhere to be found. That's right, Orange Twin Field Works is just what it claims to be: a collection of field recordings made by Mangum during his travels of Europe. And this may be surprising to some. But it shouldn't be. While Mangum's fellow Elephant 6 chums were busy taking inspiration from the Beatles, the Beach Boys, the Zombies and their ilk, Mangum was peppering his work with bagpipes, tape loops, singing saws, and a whole slew of other instruments and sounds too bizarre too identify-- yet he always made them easy to identify with. When one takes into account both Mangum's ability to present atypical musical ideas to typical American audiences, and his seeming desire to push the limits of his form, the contents of Orange Twin Field Works make perfect sense. The music of Bulgaria is actually the amalgamation of the native music of a handful of tribes that first settled the land in the seventh century. By traditional Western Music standards, it has an incredibly unique sound. It's performed largely with strings, wind instruments and vocals; made up of asymmetrical structures, dueling vocal parts, and time signatures some of us would call awkward even after spending the better part of the 90s marinating in math-rock. For hundreds of years, this strange music has evolved, all the while playing an almost crucial part in the lives of many Bulgarians; it accompanies everything from work to dining to relaxation. The annual festival which Mangum documents here lasts three days and nights, generally draws over 20,000 singers, dancers and players, and over 200,000 captive witnesses to the town of Koprivshtitsa. Mangum does more here than just present the music at hand. Given the important role it played in the development of modern Western Music (Bulgaria was playing around with stuff like 5/16 time signatures centuries before most notable European Composers ever walked the earth), compilations of Bulgarian music are fairly easy to come by. So rather than rehash the same ol' same ol', Mangum makes a point of assembling these sounds in such a way that it might make sense to typical American ears. These recordings are presented as one long track, with songs blending not only into one another, but also into sounds of traffic, the conversation of onlookers, the whooshing of the wind. Clearly, Mangum wants his listeners to feel as though they're experiencing something as magical as what he experienced, and not just listening to 'another CD.' Orange Twin Field Works couldn't sound less like Neutral Milk Hotel if it tried, but much of it is curiously on par with some of Mangum's best work, despite that the only instrument he plays here is the record button. When you listen, keep in mind that there's a reason Mangum was driven to the Balkan Peninsula by this stuff. There's something in this music that mattered to him, some quality so distinct he felt it must be captured and exposed to a culture that would otherwise have no access to it. Some of the best music produced by the Western world-- from Louis Armstrong's ""St. Louis Blues"" to even Neutral Milk Hotel's ""Ghost""-- stems not only from the musicians letting go and having fun, but from the musicians openly communicating that joy to the listener. And the people making the music on Orange Twin Field Works are obviously having a blast. Mangum may never make another Neutral Milk Hotel record, and instead dedicate himself to field recordings (he's considering traveling to Romania for Orange Twin, Volume 2), playing back-up in his friends' bands, and working on John Oswald-style sound collages that no one but his close friends may ever get to hear (check the Pitchfork interview and marvel at the very idea). But perhaps that's what he needs to do, for himself. And this is why Mangum is a consummate artist. He realizing that producing the material others want and expect from him isn't always what's best for him. Sometimes the most important thing an artist can do-- both for himself and for his work-- is to halt everything and take a chance, to step back, to observe, and to learn. Perhaps we would be wise as listeners to step back and learn with him.","As frontman for what was arguably one of the most admired psychedelic pop bands of the last decade, and as ...

Dirty Vegas,Dirty Vegas,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b99dea9e61561daa7019/1:1/w_160/dbc5a88e.jpg,2002-07-08 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2333-dirty-vegas/,Capitol,"Used to be, way back in the twentieth century, that advertising was based on products, and told consumers all sorts of crazy crap like what the thing did and how much it cost. Somewhere along the line, though, advertisers wised up and realized that consumers didn't care that their Ford Gas Crisis got just under a mile to the gallon as long as they thought they looked cool behind the wheel of sixty-five tons of American Pride. Now we market image, and things like quality and efficiency have fallen to the wayside. Fortunately for Dirty Vegas, they got in on all this when the getting was good (a 2003 Mitsubishi Eclipse won't even start unless you've got ""Days Go By"" blaring from the sound system and some Girl in a Hat seizing in the passenger seat), because in any other sort of climate, they'd be completely unknown, and rightly so. Dirty Vegas' self-titled release is the stuff Top 40 charts are made of, yet it's been getting lots of play on the college stations in recent days. And as you know, it's the Pitchforkian duty to set these studious DJs straight. Now, for what it's worth, Dirty Vegas won't rob you of the gift of sight or make your ears bleed; it's just boring. At no point on this album does the 'band' even approach the production of anything remotely like a fresh spin on the dance/electropop sound they've co-opted. Instead, they try desperately to coast on the strength of a single (and one that's pretty shoddy in its own right, I might add) recycled over and over again in the most predictable and derivative of fashions. The resulting sonic territory is standard electro-acoustic fare-- nothing but homogenous dancefloor bass and acoustic plucking for eleven tracks, with minor variations only to justify the different song titles. The musical foundation laid by Ben and Paul Harris (no relation), while completely uninspired, at least put a smile on my subwoofer more than once, which is more than I can say for the vocals. Steve Smith's voice is the woeful centerpiece of nearly every cut, and whenever he and the music vie for attention, he comes out on top, which isn't generally a good thing. The man's got a voice you'll either hate or really hate, like a cross between Michael Stipe and Dave Matthews, but with less range. Therefore, I expect he'd be better suited to some faceless commercial alternative band than a hackneyed electronic outfit. But hey, I'm not signed to Capitol so what the fuck do I know? The real irony is that despite Steve's misplaced vocal attempts, Dirty Vegas would be tragically incomplete without him. It's hard for me to imagine a musical concept more inept than building dance music around a vocal, but here it is; these songs are skeletons, and his voice is designed to hang on them. It's no surprise, then, that ""Throwing Shapes,"" the lone instrumental offering, is the closest Dirty Vegas comes to pulling off anything worthy of a second listen. But if you threw these guys that bone, you'd run the risk of hearing the first few seconds of the next track, ""Candles."" For all of its three minutes and twelve seconds, this DMB cast-off made me curse the hand that gave me ears; I'm bitter just thinking about it. So what does it all mean? What does all of this ranting and raving portend for Dirty Vegas? Why, naturally, they're going to do pretty well for themselves, because no one with an image like theirs needs something as trivial as talent or new ideas. And just think-- if you've got crispy hair and a shiny shirt just like Steve Smith (blue-tinted shades are optional), or look like a casualty from a fight between Ratt and Flock of Seagulls like one of the Harrises, they might let you into their club. Otherwise, I think you'll agree that music this tired should be put to sleep. Thanks, Mitsubishi.","Used to be, way back in the twentieth century, that advertising was based on products, and told consumers all sorts ...

Last Night Something Happened,Monster Movie,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3a9eb335119a49ed778/1:1/w_160/bccce889.jpg,2002-07-08 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5409-last-night-something-happened/,Claire,"The fade-out always made the most sense with shoegazer bands. Something about tides of distortion and steady chord progressions suggest an endless continuum, no real starting or stopping points. You can imagine each layer of guitar still echoing somewhere out in the cosmos. Despite their short-lived, tumultuous history, Slowdive were masters of the art, resting at an apex of pop songcraft in contrast to My Bloody Valentine's noisy psychedelia. Slowdive mainstay Christian Savill is now making music with fellow Brit Sean Hewson as Monster Movie. A bit of a misnomer, the band's combination of pedal-drenched atmosphere with soft melodies has led to a super-satisfying, solid full-length. Coming at the heels of an earlier EP on Clairecords, Last Night Something Happened may be a bit more subdued than other offerings from the genre, but no less affecting. The album begins with an instrumental, ""First Trip to the City,"" a nice nostalgic drift through gentle pedal fuzz and layered keyboards. Then ""Shortwave"" continues with introspective piano, building into a poignant little chorus as the falsetto asks, ""How do you feel, when your days are behind you?"" Monster Movie have a way of multi-tracking their harmonies so thickly that it all blends with the instruments into an irresistible surge of sound. ""Home"" adds backing vocals from Louise Hewson, whose lovely sigh gets caught up in blustery synth swirls and the crisp drum crack that punctuates the mix. Like most dream-pop records, Last Night Something Happened is oriented towards album listening. Just when you think the whole disc is about to be filled with gloomy mid-tempo romanticism, ""Waiting"" charms you with sunny guitar strumming and sing-song vocals. ""Sleeping on a Train"" begins with a chugging locomotive riff, and takes the pace up a notch with an electrified jangle almost reminiscent of the Verve. Monster Movie flirt somewhere at the edges of Britpop, but the mellow nature of the softer songs here suggests Liverpool as much as Manchester. A brief change of pace arrives with ""Star City,"" a forlorn piano instrumental with whupping helicopter noises and television chatter in the background. After the interlude, the album rises to another peak. ""4th and Pine"" tells the story of a supposed suicide, though details are not revealed. She's left behind only a note about her disappearance, sung with heartfelt sincerity by the boys: ""Shadow, shadow, that's all I seem to be/ I am a shadow of who I used to be."" On paper it may sound cut from the rather clich√© cloth of urban alienation, but the way that chorus wells up so hopefully and yet ends unresolved turns this into a moving sketch. These songs may be about the unavoidable sorrows of life, but they're delivered with such compassion that the record takes on a medicinal quality. The slow, uncurling bassline of ""Winter Is Coming"" signals the end of the album, and the aforementioned fade-out lasts measure after measure, easing you off. Monster Movie may not be blessed with the absolutely ecstatic summery pulse of Slowdive, but it's clear they're aiming at a different season anyway. Like many songwriting duos, Savill and Hewson know when to cut a good thing short, and you're left wanting more than thirty-seven minutes. Last Night Something Happened ends at just the right moment, though, and there are few records I can recommend more this year in terms of pure pop replayability. The sleeve photos, all cut from glossy Thingmakers cardstock, show rainy highways from the first-person perspective, all running beyond the horizon line. It's clear that the album's meant to be a traveler's diversion, so maybe you'll enjoy it as a detour from your next trip to Souvlaki Space Station.","The fade-out always made the most sense with shoegazer bands.

Obtainium,Skeleton Key,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4415e6ef9596932081e/1:1/w_160/a4295a56.jpg,2002-07-08 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7220-obtainium/,Ipecac,"I don't even know where to begin talking about how worthless the Grammy awards are. Aside from basically being a poster event for the RIAA and its associated labels to puff up their big, fat egos, the awards are invalidated for me simply by the fact that they ignore nearly every album released in a given year-- i.e. those released on independent labels. Figure in the ridiculously over-the-top musical performances (Britney Spears dancing with a robot army, anyone?) and you've got yourself a pretty sorry event, punctuated only by the occasional bright spot, like those kids a couple years back who could play jazz really, really well. But the talent involved doesn't really matter when you consider the exclusive nature of the award. In my readings over the years, I've come across a lot of little interesting facts about the Grammys, but the ones that always get me are the curveballs the industry occasionally throws. And I can't recall a bigger curveball than the nomination of Skeleton Key's 1997 Capitol Records debut, Fantastic Spikes Through Balloon. Clarification is in order: Skeleton Key were actually nominated in the best artwork category, and they deserved it. The artwork for that record, with its punch card display of band photos and ephemera, is unique and very well executed. But still, for an album like Fantastic Spikes to even be mentioned at a ceremony like that was odd. You know the drill for bands like Skeleton Key: release a great debut EP on a tiny indie, get 'discovered' by major label A&R;, record an equally excellent debut album, receive no promotional push, then politely fall by the wayside. It's hard to believe it's been five years since Skeleton Key first fell through the cracks. The band initially burned out after two years of touring, trading percussionist Steve Calhoon and multi-instrumentalist Rick Lee to upstart Enon and sinking into dormancy. Calhoon has since departed the fold entirely, but Lee is maintaining dual citizenship in both bands, and thankfully, he's brought back to Skeleton Key his distinctive found-object percussive assault. Singer/bassist Eric Sanko and guitarist Chris Maxwell are still around, and Calhoon has been replaced by skinsman Colin Brooks. And to cap off their return, the band has moved to Mike Patton's Ipecac label, thus removing themselves from the Grammy equation entirely. All the better, then. The result of all this recalibrating and time off isn't exactly a work of undisputed genius, but it's a better return than could be expected from a band everyone thought long dead up until now. Obtainium's primary flaw is that it lacks some of the persuasive energy that shoved Fantastic Spikes straight down your throat. The visceral power of a song like ""Watch the Fat Man Swing"" or ""Vomit Ascot"" is just nowhere to be found here, which could likely be blamed on the somewhat flat production work of a mysterious entity called the Dubious Brothers. As for the band, they do what they can in their over-quantized environment, and the results are generally good, from the swaying junk funk of opener ""Sawdust"" to the Tom Waits-ish broken carnival ride of ""Roost in Peace."" The quartet seems to be making a conscious attempt to vary their sound, resulting in an eclectic yet oddly (and again due to the production) monochromatic album. ""Sawdust"" leads the pack, stringing an intermittent bassline out on a wire of funky guitar, cutting the whole mix through with divebombing synth noises. Sanko does his best not to sound like J Robbins, but the vocal similarity can be uncanny sometimes. ""One Way, My Way"" is one of a few songs that feels a little constrained by rhyme scheme, with lines like, ""One way/ My way/ What I Say goes/ My opinion is fact/ And if you react/ Then it's gonna' come to blows."" The song grooves so idiosyncratically around it, though, that such minor complaints fade easily from the mind. The addition of several slower songs to the fray feels like a genuine step forward for the band, as they have a facility for brooding, molasses tunes like ""Candy,"" which manages to be both slow and jittery. Noises squirm at all levels of the mix, while deliberate, steady guitar and bass parts drone on. Meanwhile, when the drums enter, they're placed in such a way that it feels like everything else is supporting them, when the opposite is actually true. Lee has clearly brought back a few tricks from the Enon bag, and he uses them to great effect. The album closes with ""Say Goodnight,"" an understated lullaby haunted by a rusty music box and what could be electric cello or bowed bass that sounds like a song crumpled to the ground from exhaustion. It's the perfect antecedent to careening rockers like ""King Know It All"" and ""Panic Bullets,"" and also a perfect ending for the album, as it's one of the few moments that doesn't feel just a little stifled by the production. If they can mange to maintain focus and release another album soon, it's my hope that Skeleton Key will work to harness the dementia and rawness so inherent in their sound and really run with it. For now, Obtainium is a certainly an ample offering, if a little too tame.","I don't even know where to begin talking about how worthless the Grammy awards are. Aside from basically being ...

The '92 vs. '02 Collection EP,Prefuse 73,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a11713d1975652138545/1:1/w_160/9148c6f5.jpg,2002-07-08 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6451-the-92-vs-02-collection-ep/,Warp,"Whenever I'm making a public appearance-- be it a guest lecture at an Ivy League institution, a poetry slam in the East Village, or a Costco outlet opening in Yuma, Arizona-- I'm often asked the same question by some concerned audience member. ""Rob,"" they ask, ""as a world-renowned Internet music critic, can you please explain to me what 'IDM' is?"" Chuckling to myself and stroking my salt-and-pepper beard, I reply, ""First of all, as a little joke, I like to say that the 'I' in 'IDM' stands for unlistenable. Ahahahaha. Ha."" The laughter and applause is usually deafening, save the few pale kids in the back wearing Geogaddi shirts who choose to scoff and shoot dirty glances rather than salute my delightful witticism. Ahh, but I kid, Grooves subscribers; I kid because I love. It's just hard not to mock a genre whose very name reminds people that the music within is 'intelligent,' lest any of us confuse it with the low-brow disrobing anthems of Nelly and Tweet. Also amusing is the D-for-Dance part, since a lot of the music in this pigeonhole seems to require a minimum of six legs and a mild case of epilepsy to actually dance along. Yeah, so IDM is a label dreamt up by critics stretching for words to describe bleeps and bloops, though the Very Serious attitude of a lot of artists in the IDM neighborhood does little to wash away the stink of elitism. Of course, even I recognize that there are exceptions to this snooty caricature, and it's these exceptions that usually pace the field in terms of exposure and influence. The 'It' Boy of the IDM beauty pageant at this very second is Mr. Scott Herren of Atlanta, Georgia, for whom Prefuse 73 is the best known of a Stephen Merritt-like stable of aliases. Herren's turned a number of ears lately by setting up camp at the crossroads of the two most fertile sounds going right now-- your hip-hop and your electronic-- and catering to the forward-thinkers of both crowds. Herren even threw out a little bait named Sam Prekop on his last LP to get the indie rockers' attention, proving that the underground also knows how to sell a few more records with the ""Ft."" credit. But being king of the hill in either electronic or hip-hop is generally a short-lived affair, and flirting with both scenes simultaneously makes Prefuse 73 an extra-juicy target for a coup d'etat. Hence his new EP, The '92 vs. '02 Collection, is receiving more scrutiny than an Arab-American at an airport security checkpoint, the rabble itching to throw Herren on the washed-up pile with Richard D. James and Dan Nakamura. Thing is, Herren's not going down easy. This EP's neither a retread of Vocal Studies + Uprock Narratives' inventions, nor a needlessly abrupt U-turn away from that album. Though they're subtle, there are definite changes afoot. Most noticeably, someone seems to have scared the hiccups out of Herren's music; after Vocal Studies moved the word 'glitch' from troubleshooting manuals to hipster dictionaries, he seems to be letting the style go its own way. And save a short chest-beating sample in the prologue to ""When Irony Wears Thin"" (""you want my style so much"") and a diva given the blender treatment on ""Love You Bring,"" Herren leaves behind the nothing-but-vowels linguistic deconstruction of his previous outing. Filling in the empty spaces instead is a busier, more jittery undercurrent, full of taps, snaps, and claps, clicks, flicks, and thwicks. What's thankfully left intact is Herren's ability to present his art in digestible three-to-five-minute portions, or 'songs,' if you will. As with the similarly deified DJ Shadow, writers confronted with Prefuse 73 music tend to get so tied up with describing the artist's technical accomplishments and cultural relevancy that they forget that both men possess the remarkable ability to make innovation fun. There's a reason Vocal Studies turns up in more CD towers than Autechre; like a novel or a movie with both literal and allegorical meanings, Prefuse can be enjoyed on either a visceral or intellectual level. And if you haven't already figured it out, I'd rather listen to The '92 vs. '02 Collection as a record than as a thesis. Forget musical evolution, I like ""Desks, Pencils, Bottles"" because the central sample of clanking glass bottles sounds really fucking neat alongside the window-rattling bass and astral synthesizers. ""When Irony Wears Thin"" is good, too; with brassy orchestration like a cop-show theme song coasting over a skyline of beeps and tests of the emergency broadcast system. ""It Never Entered"" and ""Love you Bring"" are slightly less ear-catching; the first concentrates on the same synthesizers (the '02, I assume) against handclaps (the '92?) battle as the rest of the EP, and the second comes closest to a Vocal Studies leftover with its R&B; vocals and looped acoustic guitar snippet. That's an EP for you, though-- a low-profile snack between meals to tweak one's sound and hint at future directions. As a strategic move, releasing The '92 vs. '02 Collection is probably good policy, as it'll hopefully deflect some of the required backlash when the true follow-up to Vocal Studies is released (something, ahem, the Shadow knows about). For the rest of us, '92 vs. '02 is an entertaining fifteen minutes, thanks to Herren balancing out the I with enough D, and making pretty darn good M.","Whenever I'm making a public appearance-- be it a guest lecture at an Ivy League institution, a poetry slam ...

Cinemathique,Tuatara,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a826ea9e61561daa574f/1:1/w_160/4788318e.jpg,2002-07-07 05:00:03,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8180-cinemathique/,Fast Horse,"Ever since the untimely dissolution of Temple of the Dog, music fans everywhere have been asking themselves, ""Where, oh where is that next great Seattle-based supergroup?"" Likewise, zoologists everywhere have recently been overheard asking themselves, ""Where, oh where is that next great band named after a small burrowing reptile indigenous to New Zealand and small surrounding islands?"" Well, rejoice, because the wait is over. Actually, the wait was technically over around 1996 when this here band Tuatara formed and recorded their first album, but everyone pretty much forgot about them about two months after Breaking the Ethers was released straight to cut-out bin. That record, to put it gently, sucked the almighty ass. Hence, when Trading with the Enemy got issued in 1998, nobody gave half a shit. Let's cut to the chase, though: Cinemathique is really terrible, especially for a third album. So bad is this record, in fact, that I can't even manufacture any smartass sarcastic excitement over it. Part of what I've told you so far is true, though: Tuatara is a 'supergroup,' in at least a few different senses of the word. They are large in number-- 11 to be exact-- so you could safely say they are a super-sized group. And counted among the lofty ranks of Tuatara is a fairly stellar group of individuals in terms of name recognition. Completely tracing the bloodlines of this group would take a Church-of-Latter-Day-Saints-trained genealogist. Peter Buck of REM is the supermost of said supergroup, followed in superness by fellow Minus 5 member and former Young Fresh Fellow Scott McCaughey. Justin Harwood from Luna and Screaming Trees' drummer Barrett Martin are both somewhat super, I suppose. And this core is joined by a who's-who of indie rock sidemen and session pros, men and women who have appeared on albums ranging from Les Claypool's Frog Brigade to Trout Fishing in America. However, just because you're a supergroup in a purely technical sense doesn't mean you're a super group, understand? As you might expect, Cinemathique presents us with soundtrack-style music. And judging from the cover art, you might presume that the film being soundtracked here is some sort of unholy Tron-meets-Caligula project (sorta like Femalien), but you'd be wrong. There actually is no film. If someone got it in their head to make one based on the music of Cinemathique, though, it'd end up something like a South Pacific/Bollywood-sci-fi-noir-porn (think Tron-meets-Caligula). Back in the day (circa Temple of the Dog), tossing light instrumental jazz, by-the-numbers lounge groove, and bongo-fueled world beat onto one record might have been a pretty risky move. But here it is 2002, and the soundtrack music renaissance has passed its golden age, allowing this bastard horror of an LP to come off like a clueless cash-in. In its defense, Cinemathique's range is impressive from a strictly musical standpoint. Tuatara offer a proficient exotica vibe, a decent 70s-style cop show car chase theme, a funky porn-style number, and even a bit of Gamelan. Problem is, I just don't buy it. The strange thing is that the pitfalls that usually plague these sorts of all-star gatherings-- namely the ""too-many-cooks-in the-kitchen-syndrome""-- isn't the issue here. You see, perhaps wisely sensing this potential problem, the entire cast of Tuatara decided to step into the background, opting to leave at home any personality they might have brought to the project. And with this many distinct voices involved, the strategy might have worked-- that is, if somebody, anybody had picked up the ball and ran with it. I waited patiently for this to happen. It didn't. And so, nothing ever stands out: no idiosyncrasy, no weirdness, nothing. Supergroups are supposed to chock themselves with an overabundance of personality; this one just kinda coughs up a gray lump of room-temperature phlegm that could have been the product of any sick little boy, or halfway proficient (i.e. far from super) group of musicians. The closest thing Cinemathique has to a lead voice is the saxophone, but even this fine instrument fails them. Oftentimes, it has the group coming off like a peppier Morphine-- which is to say, Morphine devoid of darkness, which naturally defeats the whole purpose. Actually, it's like the sax player for an airport hotel bar band found a Morphine cassette in his daughter's car and thought it would be fun to try it out with the boys in the band, aiming for a smoky distant vibe of which he has no real clue. Even so, Cinemathique is not unbearably irritating, and the musicianship is technically admirable if you're into proficiency for proficiency's sake (Dream Theater fans, I'm talkin' at you). As for me, I'd actually rather listen to Temple of the Dog-- something I can't say for too many records-- because at least then I might have some sense of who's doing what. Hey, better yet, where's that Flying Lizards album?","Ever since the untimely dissolution of Temple of the Dog, music fans everywhere have been asking themselves, ""Where, oh where ...

I Get Wet,Andrew W.K.,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a097c0084474cd0bfbf7/1:1/w_160/380a6a71.jpg,2002-07-07 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/184-i-get-wet/,Island,"Alright, this is bullshit. I've had it. Is this what we've been reduced to? Michigan metalheads copping ESPN Jock Jams*, capitalizing on the shameful worst of the 1980s and bellowing incessantly about the wondrous virtues of the all-nighter? Rock critics who dissed this entire genre in its heyday now glorifying its second coming as somehow superior? If this is what the future of music has in store for us, why no apocalypse on New Year's Eve '99? Doesn't God care? Shit, maybe Y2K really* was Armageddon, launching us headfirst into a great black xFC-metal abyss, and maybe Andrew W.K. is just the first of four pending horsemen. And that, boys and girls, was about all I could muster on March 20th, just as the stormclouds began to crash together for what would soon spin into a torrential whirlwind of one-sheets and NMEs-- maybe one of the scariest hypes this planet's ever seen. I was overwhelmed! But now it's July, and almost as quickly as he arrived, Andrew Wilkes-Krier has been rudely ushered off the Apollo soundstage and scribbled as a footnote into history's textbook of rock novelties. Been months since I last heard ""Party Hard"" on the radio or saw WK thrashing about on M2 like a hyperactive retarded kid whose parents failed to give him a disciplinary shaking. If it hadn't been for this meddling CD-R I was sent by Island Records' promotions team, I might already have forgotten the guy. Ahh, but yes, in due time. I take immense comfort in the realization that, at some distant point in the future, I won't be able to recall any of I Get Wet, and whether that'll be due to its legitimate forgetability or a future struggle with Alzheimer's I don't much care, so long as I never again have to envision his mangy ""RAW is WAR"" hairswath (wash it!), or listen to these unshakable cro-magnon shoutathons. And so, this is where I get to say that, as evidenced in italics above, I almost told you so. A few weeks prior to my first attempt at taking down this sorry sack, my old pal Brent DiCrescenzo, who as a culture addict spends a fair bit of his spare time scouring the British music rags, had swung by to write up the Promise Ring's Wood/Water. He'd read about I Get Wet in Mojo or something, and saw it amongst the promo stacks on my windowsill. ""Have you heard this?"" Now, Brent and I like to hook up and get cynical from time to time-- we'll even bash the bands we're into just for shits-- so I was patiently waiting for D to reel one off so I could start in, casting to the wind that fact that I, in fact, hadn't yet heard it. ""It's pretty funny, it's basically these huge guitar riffs, sort of soccer anthems."" He quickly unloaded Von Bohlen from the disc-changer (well into Wood/Water's second half, any excuse would have sufficed) and tossed in the CD-R. Instantly, blaring multitracked guitars and shooting-range stadium drums came accosting. I tried to yell something, but my exclamation was swallowed by the immense wind-tunnel attack of the clenched-fist maelstrom. ""WHAT?"" It was hopeless. Nothing could penetrate a sound that dense. I was overcome. I tried to remember the last time anyone dared to push rock so poppily over the top, and figured it must have been some time around Hysteria. I sat rapt by the simple barbarity of that sound, Andrew barking adamantly over the exploding plastic fury. The gall! WK demanded respect, whether he deserved it or not. His conviction was startling, and the sound so scrutinously polished it lapped itself back into rawness. Indeed, it was time to party. The party, as it just so happened, lasted all of three minutes-- appropriately, about the same lifespan as a pinch of Big League Chew. For this was bubblegum in its purest, stickiest form, designed for the sole purpose of imminent pop. To be packaged, marketed, and shipped by a grand corporation, and to be enjoyed by the consumer for a few moments before being spit or swallowed. I spat, and with the poisonous substance expelled from my system, I saw it for what it is: I Get Wet is an insidious beast, planting itself into the deepest instinctual recesses of your brainstem, where it instantly detonates in a visceral adrenal charge. There is suddenly no respect for proper behavior, just the urge to turn acrobatic flips and smash everything within a fifty-foot radius. You're Genghis Khan in the San Dimas Sportmart somersaulting over Nike racks to the Slippery When Wet synth-metal of Beethoven's Schmidt Music foray into Bachman-Turner Overdrive. And then you wake up the next morning, hazy-headed and groggy, humiliated by the preceding night's incidents. Don't blame yourself. This music is evil in its purest form, wafting through air, waiting to possess every decent person in the entire room until they're flat on their backs in bed, wrists tied to the headboard, with drunken priests standing holy at their sides to exorcise the demon. And the demon is a tricky sonofabitch, spinning you in circles of confusion and chanting its life-affirming message to brainwash you into truly believing, right to the core of your soul, that what it speaks is the Good Truth. Read any interview with WK (they're all the same-- just like the songs!) in which he spews na√Øve positivity like dad's warbly old self-help cassettes. There is no irony about Andrew. He is, in fact, so earnest it sends any straight-thinking individual into epileptic fits of shivers and winces. For christ's sake, the man opens the second paragraph of his self-writ bio with ""I will work every day to feel O.K."" before finally getting around to calling the music ""perfect"" because ""all it wants is for people to be happy."" LIES! This here is about as empty as rock music gets, right down to the tinny, digitally processed tonebank noise that passes for 'guitars.' You think otherwise? Then let's have a moment to look at the obvious points of reference-- the songs and bands to which I Get Wet rightfully owes a sizable chunk of its royalties: Def Leppard: ""Pour Some Sugar on Me""
Oooooh, in the name of love! This one boomed from your older sister's boyfriend's Thunderbird all 1987 long. You'd look out on the driveway with envy from your bedroom window. Dude is BAD!, you'd mouth, examining just exactly the angle and velocity at which he'd bang that head, his bleached-blonde mane tossing about in a fire-eyed, glorious salute to Rick Allen's one-armed colossus. But that one time he drove you to your girlfriend's house and you excitedly rummaged through his tapes, you saw truth in his glove compartment: this guy only listened to Def Leppard! And you turned to him wondering, ""Hey, don't you have any real rock in here?"" And that's when he stomped the brake and charlie-horsed your bicep with the force of ten silverbacks. Gary Glitter: ""Rock & Roll, Part Two""
You know this one, even if you don't know it by name. Bah-badahhhhhh-- HAY! Bah-badah. And repeat. That's all there is to this one, kiddies. You hear it at soccer games. Maybe football half-times, too, or anywhere there's a bunch of boneheaded fools spraying each other with keg nozzles in fits of homoerotic glory. ""HAY!,"" the song's sacred battle cry, really drives home the victory, even when the hometeam gets their ass handed to 'em by Kansas City. You only need to hear one bar of this song to know it forward and back for the rest of your days. It also screams ""beer"" louder than any Anheiser-Busch logo or beef-eating Steelers fan un-pantsing himself to reveal a secret team-praising message on his pimpled asscheeks. Baha Men: ""Who Let the Dogs Out?""
A song whose chorus roused Arsenio crowds and 6-year-olds with the life-bending lyric, ""OOF! OOF! OOF OOF!"" Like an inescapable, overlong Geico commercial booming from Jeeps, Escalades and Honda Civics across this nation's every city, ""Who Let the Dogs Out?"" was at once your worst nightmare and the everyman's personal nirvana. If this song had a verse, it was added as an afterthought to give this asinine catchphrase the illusion of being an actual song. And it's not over yet: I'm thinking three months tops before we see it pushing Beggin' Strips between 'boot camp' segments on Maury. Hmm, incriminating. Not the kind of legacy one works toward securing, and certainly not the kind of music you'd find in the collection of any self-respecting rock elitist. In fact, if I knew a rock elitist with this record, I'd smack them up 'long side the head, 'cause who the fuck are you to tell me I can't own the Sophie B. Hawkins ""Damn, I Wish I Was Your Lover"" CD5 when just last week you subjected the entire fucking interstate to ""Fun Night""? I'll cripple ya! And yet, some of these 'punk' and 'indie' kids are still willing to back WK up with a number of ridiculous excuses that they deep-down know are inherently flawed. ""It's catchy"" is no kind of argument. Every pop song you've ever truly hated is catchy. ""It's ironic"" is wack, too, since there's exactly zero irony to be had on any of I Get Wet or in WK's motivational interviews. ""It's fun"" is about the only legitimate excuse a guy could come up with-- and that's the one thing I'll give it to warrant the .6 in the rating-- but this world of music which history has graced us with is loaded with fun music. Even fun music with substance, fun music that doesn't talk to you like you're some kinda total dipshit that wouldn't know Boredoms from buzzworthy. And you don't even have to look that hard! So then, what is the excuse for a typically elitist music nerd to bow to Andrew WK's blistering tard-rock? That's right, folks: there isn't one.","Alright, this is bullshit. I've had it.

No!,They Might Be Giants,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a76cb1335d7bf1699054/1:1/w_160/82e765dc.jpg,2002-07-07 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7995-no/,RounderIdlewild,"Many folks maintain a soft spot for They Might Be Giants in this, their twentieth year. Poor guys, they survived John Henry, one of the least interesting albums ever released. And bless their hearts, their last album-- their most fun since the eighties-- bore the ugly street date of September 11th, 2001, and Pitchfork centurion Matt LeMay crucified it, etching 2.8 onto its tomb. Crawl into my porcelain Nostalgidildo: back in the day, TMBG lingered in a strange new section at the Oak Nook Mall's Record Bar, a section called ""alternative"" which they shared with a host of quirktastic acts such as Suicidal Tendencies, The Pixies, Dead Milkmen, Siouxsie with Banshees, and Violent Femmes. The big time didn't want them. On MTV's ""Randee of the Redwoods"" special (a production that Flansburgh told me in an interview was run by some cocaine-pocked simps), they opened for Run-DMC. Everyone in the crowd froze, allowing their rejection to manifest. Hard to believe that these Brooklyn art-punks would go on to earn a grubby Grammy for the theme song to a clunky TV show. In 2002, this children's album is a logical move, since any hardcore fans who still swear by this band are obviously suffering from arrested development, and since any passive fans who remember when TMBG were the freshest thing going now have ten grandkids to babysit. But what song from the band's first ten years wouldn't already multitask as kiddie fodder? As-is, ""Toddler Hiway"" and ""Whistling In the Dark"" were safe for the I-can-poop-solo set. Cartoon shows were already co-opting their standard fare. ""Particle Man"" is otherwise known as ""Smells Like Toddler Spirit."" What the hell-hey? That's where they get ya: this album is really a subversive, anarchic manifesto, brimming with songs about cultural revolution and plunging hypodermic needles into scrotums. Aw, I'm just joshing. It's this spiked Ovaltine, making everything feisty and asymmetric. The album is surprisingly agenda-free, considering how dread-mired and literately jaded their best work is/was. I was thinking, ""TMBG's going to get their depressive hooks into the whippersnappers of the Baby Gap Generation-- thass tight!"" But nay, a thousand times nay, this album mercifully prefers to dangle kids over their toyboxes rather than over the abyss of their potentially meaningless existence. Several songs provide that patented, relentlessly melodic, fitful polka you either love or hate. Among the best are the lie-happy ""Fibber Island,"" the quantum-leaping ""Four of Two,"" the exponentially multiplying ""The House at the Top of the Tree,"" and the kinda-dumb ""Sleepwalkers."" ""Robot Parade,"" one of several old songs reworked here, is a vocoded nightmare of a cyborg utopia and it's just as grand on disc as it is live (I'd prefer TMBG's smarmy, vaudevillian anti-banter over some Indie-Cum-Lately's Junior Jeff Buckley leers and deepness-displaying segues any day). The song ""No!"" manages to be an effective, mildly nihilistic look at how much of kids' conversations and desires end in negation. ""Violin"" is as insane and surreal as classics like ""Boat of Car,"" as it repeats the words ""hippo"" and ""mop,"" and then slices up the head of George Washington. ""In the Middle"" covers a public service announcement about the hazards of pedestrianhood. Live nugget ""I Am Not Your Broom,"" and ""I Am a Grocery Bag"" are sung, predictably, from the point of view of inanimate objects, though only ""Broom"" sustains a metaphorical heft, as the pre-leafblower organic tool tires of being exploited. The consumer-product-listing ""Grocery Bag"" is particularly a stoop for the band that penned Flood's ""Dead,"" a song that presented the plight of yon coupon-clipping grocery shopper as being on par with the cyclic horror of Sisyphus pushing his rigged rock up a pointless hill. The rest of No! consists of oddly considerate and patient full-on kids' songs, meaning that they're repetitive and sometimes even ""Teletubbies""-caliber stupefying (although ""Wake Up Call,"" which repeats the syllable 'bo' 135+ times, is somehow still a hit). The disc is enhanced with gleefully absurd, marginally interactive cartoons, and packed with that Eisenhower-era zip-twinkle. And never once do the Johns go so nasal that you wince with their every exhortation. Those of you who arrived at Pitchforkmedia.com via a sick, degenerate teleology of Tool-to-Promise Ring-to-Pinback might not understand the need to give TMBG props, at least as talented multi-instrumentalists. Well, keep sewing those patches on your Eastpaks, and try to understand that this kid-disc was critic-proof. Who wants to be the dickhead to trash something for the wee demo? It's like those Michelin commercials with the ""whole lot riding on your tires."" They beg the question: do you want to kill babies, FREAK? You unhurdlable ASSHOLE! Respect is due, yo. TMBG still runs a dial-a-song service. They're the focus of a flick, Gigantic, coming to an arthouse near you and featuring the praise of empowered pop-vulture Dave Eggers. They used to quote Wallace Stevens and sing that youth culture killed their dog, and that they hope they get old before they die. But now, all crick-nicked, they don't give a damn that Shakespeare's kid-unfriendly Lady MacBeth said that she would handle a kid by acting ""while it was my smiling in face;"" she would ""have plucked my nipple from his boneless gums/ And dashed the brains out."" TMBG doesn't care that poet Phillip Larkin noted that ""they fuck you up, your mum and dad,"" and that you should ""get out as early as you can/ and don't have any kids yourself."" Or that Nickelodeon prints up pamphlets like the ""What We Know About Kids"" dossier that a friend smuggled to me, arguing that kids are ""armed with brand influences"" and that ""kids' fast food preference is confirmed!"" A They Might Be Giants record is one of the last places from which you'd expect hope for a generation of attention-bags that won't remember ad-free space, and that begins every sentence with ""I want."" And TMBG are probably harbingers of an era when old-guard 'alternative' standouts reach out to kids. Look forward to Sonic Youth's Playpen Cesspool and Unca Lou Barlow's Don't Rub Flimsy.","Many folks maintain a soft spot for They Might Be Giants in this, their twentieth year.

Show Your Face,Nad Navillus,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3b469fc7814a47cd6e7/1:1/w_160/cd107ec4.gif,2002-07-07 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5727-show-your-face/,Jagjaguwar,"Finally, a sad-rocker with more than just tear ducts and an ex-girlfriend. Hell, Nad Navillus might not even have either of those. Thanks to his choice of musical approach, though, this guy will almost always be immediately grouped with forebears like Nick Drake and Van Morrison, a singing, songwriting wayfarer with an acoustic guitar and a penchant for the harmonic and soothing. Unfortunately, this also gets him grouped with some of his less talented indie contemporaries: the singing, songwriting wayfarers with acoustic guitars and a penchant for the self-absorbed and mind-numbing. Good old Nad, though, is fortunate to have talent. He can actually play his guitar, and play it well. Super fucking well, to be honest, like 40 minutes of the Leo Kottke workout. Lots of that folksy arpeggiation here, nailed with dead-letter precision. This, my friends, is the calling card of dear Nad, and that which separates him from his oft-clumsy genre mates. Good thing, too, that his real name isn't Nad, which would be a dreadful stroke of misfortune, given that 'nad' is the singular of 'nads,' conversely either a feminine hair removal product, or slang for testicles (i.e. 'deez nutz'). Rather, Nad Navillus is, more or less, the golden-fingered Dan Sullivan, the man behind all of this album's songwriting and production work. He enlists some help on the album to play instruments he can't play quite as well as his six-string (e.g. the musical saw, courtesy of Joss Moorkens), but from what I can tell, Nad Navillus is Dan's baby. Cute baby, too. It's a good, well-behaved little bugger, if not one that tends to sleep a lot. But sleepytime may be the name of your game once you've reached track eight (""The Longest Straw""), where the fingerpicked guitar begins to glaze your senses like an ear-fog. By track ten (""Processional""), Show Your Face has definitely morphed from an ""I'm listening to this because it's interesting"" album to an ""I'm not paying attention, but I'm feeling alright"" sort of album. If only the ""Hot Licks"" guitar education series had a ""Hot Songs"" or maybe a ""Song Licks"" analogue to help Dan with his songwriting. Then he would inherit the Spirit of Nick Drake and his apotheosis would be complete. For now, however, Dan Sullivan awaits his anointing. Oh shit! Did you notice this? Nad Navillus-- do you know what that is? It's DAN SULLIVAN fucking backwards. I just noticed that. How sneaky! We should call him Clever Dan from now on. Or would it be Nad Revelc? Hmmm? And hold on here just a damn moment: now that I'm getting into this whole ""find out who the artist actually is"" thing, I'll have you know that Danny boy is a 'touring member' of Songs: Ohia. Who'd have figured that? Hey now! I just sat here for 10 minutes, thinking of how I could totally waste Dan for tricking me so bad. But alas, I cannot, for Dan is pretty stinkin' good. Not great, but on the scale of stinkin' goodness, Dan is definitely above average. He's got the talent, he's got his calling card (read: distinctiveness), and he's a clever piece of work. If you own a coffee shop, you could surely buy this disc and play it for the benefit of your stimulant-swilling customers. Similarly, if you have time to waste on Sunday mornings and don't have money for a jazz brunch at the Hilton, Dan may also be your solution (I hear he goes well with sausage). And finally, if you're a member of Songs: Ohia, you could pay Dan a few bucks, take him on tour with you, and maybe even teach him the virtues of quality songsmithing. Then we'd really have something worth writing about!","Finally, a sad-rocker with more than just tear ducts and an ex-girlfriend. Hell, Nad Navillus might not even have either ...

God Loves Ugly,Atmosphere,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a136c0084474cd0bfd65/1:1/w_160/dbe8bddb.jpg,2002-07-04 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/341-god-loves-ugly/,RhymesayersFat Beats,"Although us critics would lead you to believe that we are all independent, objective thinkers, the truth is that we're often very predictable marketing tools who can be easily manipulated by using a proper set of variables. And God Loves Ugly is chock full of critic yumminess: ""emotionally resonant"" lyrics that ""betray an inner-vulnerability""; ""minimalist"" old-school beats that ""shimmer"" with an ""understated grace""; the requisite indie record label that is surely a ""breeding ground for unearthed genius""-- you get the picture. But a funny thing happened on the way to Atmosphere's coronation; instead of effortlessly wearing the crown of critic's darling, God Loves Ugly is a whiny, heavily affected mess that tries oh so hard, yet ultimately seems as empty and manipulative as the latest Ruff Ryders or Bad Boy album. For those of you unfamiliar with the Atmosphere plotline, Slug (born Sean Daley) is the sort of self-depreciating, slacker anti-hero that we've all come to love over the years. Shit, slap a flannel on him, give him a guitar, and he could easily pass for a grunge god (MC Vedder, perhaps?). His resume includes a Midwestern upbringing that left him both disaffected and rootless, a failed romance that he endlessly obsesses over (a la Eminem's ""Kim""), and a streak of self-depreciation that both preempts any potential criticism and conveys a veneer of detachment and apathy (a modern hipster must). Together with producer Ant and MC Spawn (who has since departed), Slug released one brilliant but underappreciated gem (1999's Overcast) and a string of widely heralded but rarely purchased EPs that were collected on last year's widely revered Lucy Ford. After constant touring, Atmosphere silently became the 'next big thing' in underground hip-hop, a particularly impressive achievement considering the bi-coastal regionalism of the genre. Their recent show at San Francisco's Slim's drew one of the largest hip-hop crowds the place had ever seen. What's more surprising is that a majority of them were the under-21 suburbanite crowd that has made Eminem so popular. So the expectations for God Loves Ugly have been very, very high. And it doesn't always disappoint: ""Blamegame"" boasts some of the dopest dub on the mainland; ""Hair"" is an amusing enough account of an initial foray into groupie-land; and Slug injects the album with some great lines. On ""A Song About a Friend"" he raps, ""It'll all be so simple if I were rich, but I'm not/ So I compensate with thought/ I got a lot of nothing that you need to know."" And the moments of pseudo-philosophical, backpacker-attracting navel-giving are still there. On ""Loveline"" he ponders: ""A soul is a soul and a shell is a shell/ The border in between is full of everything you felt.../ Everytime I look within I recognize the darkness/ Familiar to the image of the artist."" Deep, yo. Really, all the elements that made Lucy Ford and Overcast so hot are still present. But whereas those two albums sounded like the intellectually complex basement revelations of an emotionally exhausted yet stubbornly resilient young man-of-the-world, God Loves Ugly has a forced and formulaic undercurrent that, despite how hard I tried to look past it, was unmistakable and pervasive. No longer are we hearing the confessions of Sean Daley. Those sweet, innocent days have been replaced by a more violent malaise seemingly calculated to resemble a certain white rap phenomenon who melts in your mouth and not in your hands. Instead of Slug, we have the caricature of Slug: a deeply disaffected young man who, in ""The Bass and the Movement,"" even makes a somewhat tepid attempt to flex, threatening those who don't feel him to ""stuff them full of dick 'till the hole rips."" Good fucking God! That's almost as nice as Tyson telling a reporter that he was going to ""fuck [him] up the ass 'till [he's] not a faggot anymore."" Aside from the album's faux-aggression, I can't help feel that Slug has dumbed down some of his sentiments for the sake of accessibility. ""The Modern Man's Hustle"" may be Atmosphere's most popular song to date, but it's also their most easily disposable. Even Ant's beats have lost their charm. Instead of being delicate, lo-fi constructions, they now sound monolithic, commercial, and just plain boring. ""Flesh"" even resembles a bouncier D12! I really hope that I'm wrong about all of this. I hope that what I'm hearing on this album's just growing pains-- the transition from the private to the public and the self-consciousness and uncertainty that goes along with that. I still have much love for Atmosphere and will be quick to pick up their next effort. They have mad talent, no doubt. And although I'm sure that God Loves Ugly will be their best-selling album (maybe even allowing them The Big Crossover), artistically speaking, this is Atmosphere at its damndest.","Although us critics would lead you to believe that we are all independent, objective thinkers, the truth is that we ...

Good Health,Pretty Girls Make Graves,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1269d034d5c69bf28c5/1:1/w_160/713b3b4f.jpg,2002-07-04 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6465-good-health/,Lookout!,"I was surprised as hell when I read that existential crises were back in vogue. I mean, you give a fancy overseas war with high production values to a country of TV-addled youth whose social outreach extends to the local pharmacy waiting line, and what do they do? They don't even wait for their nation to be occupied by a warring fascist state before chronicling their tribulations with emotional isolation in a post-millennial millennia. And here I was thinking retro was the new retro! Well, as an established music critic, I was obligated to prove that I had my finger on the national pulse. After countless conference calls, it was decided that I should employ Pitchfork's patented 'Literary Introspection through Comedic MeansTM' and proffer a surgically sliced portion of my psyche to the readers for analysis; the way Dostoevsky, ""Weird"" Al, and Brent DiCrescenzo used to kick it. After authoring an admittedly incoherent expose on my grappling with sexuality in a ""Lester Bangs world,"" Editor Ryan courteously emailed me with some well chosen words of advice: At some point, talk about music Keep whippet-induced confessionalism to a minimum Don't step on my cape So how was I to convincingly marry the time-honored and humorless topic of philosophy to a webzine: the ultimate manifestation of ultra-modern technological excess? With a joke! Q: ""How many nihilists does it take to screw in a light bulb?"" A: ""Who the fuck cares?"" Congratulations, you have just taken part in the world's first documented 'interactive litmus test by means of musical criticism.' Judge yourself accordingly. If the pointlessness of that premise aggravated the shit out of you, you may be ready to listen to Pretty Girls Make Graves. If it was the pretentious upper-crust literati ambience that hung on every word like that layer of filth you just can't wash off, I advise you to go out and pick up the band's Lookout! Records debut, Good Health, before your roommates finish funneling last night's meal of crumbled snack crackers into your gas tank (go check outside). But, if you actually followed along with the introduction, finding it to be replete with factual and historical inaccuracies only to relish the idea of writing an email to point out your humble reviewer's misconceptions and snobbery, you'd fuggin' hate this record. Likewise, if you actually enjoyed that thing: we don't want you as a reader. Excuse me if I'm a little selective in which faction of my demographic I actually reach, but, you see, I've developed a pretty tenuous relationship with Good Health over the past month or so, and I don't want just any underprivileged twenty-something getting their hands on it. The truth of the matter is, Pretty Girls Make Graves are in your town right now recruiting the disaffected, cynical, and pissed off to join their cause. Finally, another group that the impoverished slacker bourgeoisie can champion as 'a really good punk band.' Seriously, Tim Harrington's shoulders feel so much lighter now. The album opens innocuously enough, as a bubbling synth rises warily up and down an infectious melody that lingers just long enough to establish itself before dissipating into a torrent of guitars. The knowing lyrics of ""Speakers Push the Air"" chime: ""I found a place where it feels alright/ I heard a record and it opened my eyes."" Elsewhere, an untitled epilogue to ""The Get Away,"" one of the record's finest moments, exposes the 'epic' song's skeletal foundation to the listener for thirty seconds or so, allowing us some time to breathe. Fortunately, oxygen breaks are few and far between. While underground America's musical landscape seems ruled by a vast court of unskilled musicians content with simply bastardizing their lo-fi influences whilst betting on the medium's once-staple-now-long-lost-and-forgotten 'cute and intimate' card (an infamous artifact from the early-to-mid-nineties which has recently been sighted somewhere near Olympia, Washington), Pretty Girls Make Graves wear their technical prowess like a badge of honor. Though never letting the 'Guitarist's Grimoire' set the parameters for their sound, PGMG manage to juxtapose riff-concentrate with enough perspective and focus to escape even the faintest grasps of what could have devolved into 'virtuoso punk' under less inspired hands. However, the fact that ex-Murder City Devils bassist Derek Fudesco established Pretty Girls Make Graves only months after the dissolution of his former group, insinuates that the nine songs comprising Good Health were written in an inordinately condensed period of time. Where such circumstances are, more often than not, a hindrance to the potential quality of a final product, Pretty Girls are clear beneficiaries of this situation, as the short allotment of time seems to have contributed to the sense of urgency found in both the group's writing and performance. Conjuring up a direct musical comparison to Pretty Girls Make Graves proves difficult, as the album plays like an aural amalgam of the past 40 years or so of rock music (though Sonic Youth, Unwound and Les Savy Fav all serve as dandy reference points). Similarly, it's tough to ferret a particular quality to scapegoat in the name of objective criticism. But, if there's any negative criticism to be had, it should be focused solely on the disc's hit-or-miss lyrical content. The unfortunate truth is that even a slight misjudgment of the line delineating revelation from callow self-concern can render a modest album/song unlistenable. Luckily, there aren't any cringe-worthy moments to be found here-- just a few lines written from inexperience and masked by singer Andrea Zollo's innate sense of melody. It's her commanding voice that's truly the group's most effective instrument, infusing the genre with formerly unseen emotional layers. When each track is a struggle to contain as many Pixies-by-way-of-Archers-of-Loaf riffs and hooks as humanly possible in less than three minutes, you need someone manning the controls well enough to keep the music's instinctual and emotional appeal intact. Bolstered by engineering guru Phil Ek's gracious production (which never oversteps its bounds, more than making up for his overbearing work on Ancient Melodies of the Future), Good Health serves as a testament to the punk idiom-- a homogenate product of the genre's countless guises and forms. ""Ghosts in the Radio,"" the album's obvious highlight, even boasts a successful Fripp/Eno-esque breakdown mid-song, indicative of the group's ability to meld rampant experimentalism with an evocative and accessible commodity. Though not as epic and cinematic as the Trail of Dead's galvanizing Source Tags & Codes, Pretty Girls Make Graves act as yet another healthy pulse sign for indie-rock outside of M2's adopted garage-rock revivalist spectrum. While it's true that everything contained herein has been done before in some form or another, Good Health succeeds on its own merits due to its impassioned delivery and inexorable performances. More than just a faithful document to the group's incendiary live prowess, the record somehow approximates the environs of a good indie-rock show. That, in itself, is always worth the price of admission.","I was surprised as hell when I read that existential crises were back in vogue. I mean, you\n\ give ...

River Walk Riots,DJ Jester,by: Keith Brasel,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9bb9d034d5c69bf52b9/1:1/w_160/9ccecf21.gif,2002-07-04 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2362-river-walk-riots/,Two Ten,"Back in 1066, William the Conqueror had a big idea: invade England. So ol' Bill rowed over from France with a big army, landed on some sunless beach and set up camp. He and his cronies then rode around the country, bludgeoned the serfs, raped the horses, and rode off on the women. Pretty soon, Bill had the whole place under his thumb. Then, to add insult to injury, he made everybody speak French, which was kind of a bastard thing to do, but he did it anyway and we continue to bear the scar to this day with all our '-tion' endings and whatnot. So you can't really blame the medieval Brits for-- when forced to consign this indignity over to history-- choosing to transcribe the conquest into pictures instead of words. What they ended up making to explain the whole invasion is called the Bayeux Tapestry. Many a teacher makes a big deal out of it in art history classes. It's one of those precious works of art you might run across on PBS to the drone of some fantastically boring British historian. Altogether, the 'tapestry' is about the size of a roll of toilet paper rolled all the way out, so it's not really a tapestry in the big, square, wall-hanging sense people are used to. It's a lengthy, linear deal that never truly completes itself. It is woven history that runs on like the number pi, the events like beads on a string. Kinda the same thing with DJ Jester, aka the Filipino Fist out of San Antonio, and his debut album River Walk Riots. Jester has gone off and made a genuinely entertaining album by blending some of the most utterly disparate recordings ever. There's a lot to be said for the amount of weaving that goes into an album of this kind. The man effortlessly references a plethora of movies, songs, voices and hooks without boring you for a second, and creates three cohesive 12-minute-long ""segments,"" as he calls them. So it's completely natural to go off calling it a tapestry, or even a quilt if you're so inclined. Thing is, that would be implying there's a completeness here when, in actuality, there is certainly not. On River Walk Riots, Jester's all about stringing it along, following one crazy track with another, one-upping the last goofy song till he's got yards of 'em behind him. His samples, no matter how catchy, tend to pass by like billboards. At points you start to wish he'd produce something resembling a traditional song, or that some sort of pattern would emerge from the long string of mixes-- a long series of cleverly intertwined songs does not a song make. Still, the man does a good job of keeping your head bobbing, and you begin to understand that he's not necessarily out to create a turntable opera like Q-Bert or Kid Koala. Rather, this guy's about keeping the party moving, and this is one hot mix. There's no shortage of turntablism tricks and maneuvers. His scratching is fresh and innovative, and the mixing is absolutely seamless. His sense of humor is on par with Koala, and it comes off in the joy he elicits by slapping a drum beat beneath an otherwise hokey cowboy ballad or by sampling Richard Simmons. Jester does, however, pull off a small coup with a Willie Nelson track he exploits to transform into a sort of emcee's lament. Willie pines away over a drumbeat courtesy of Jester and gets hip-hop relevant when he waxes nostalgic and croons about his ""life and times"" and ""some bad rhymes."" To top it off, there're Jester's unassailable credentials: the likes of Ice-T, Rob Swift, the Invisibl Skratch Piklz, Rahzel of the Roots, and of course, Willie Nelson all provide their props before the album gets underway. You know there ain't no messin' around when Ice-T's gotcha back: ""Yo, shut up, this is Ice-T, nigga, chilling with my man DJ Jester. Act like you know bitch, 'cause this shit is all real."" What else do you need? Jester samples Iron Butterfly, Run DMC, MARRS, Ennio Morricone, Hank Williams, Black Sabbath, the Beastie Boys, James Brown, Charles Manson, Bob Marley and even Pavement. You have to hear it to believe it. So just silence yourself, get in your inner tube and enjoy the ride. The river may be long, but it is also funky.","Back in 1066, William the Conqueror had a big idea: invade England. So ol' Bill rowed over from France with ...

This Is Where I Belong: The Songs of Ray Davies and the Kinks,Various Artists,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbb3c0084474cd0c2906/1:1/w_160/d1f6a28f.jpg,2002-07-04 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4455-this-is-where-i-belong-the-songs-of-ray-davies-and-the-kinks/,Ryko,"On the record store social ladder, tribute albums are firmly entrenched in the untouchable class, somewhere between interview picture discs and free record label samplers. In the days before file-sharing made cherry-picking your favorite band's every comp contribution wallet-free, tribute albums were certified quick buy-and-sell-back items (Sweet Relief, anyone?). But while the durability of such cover collections is questionable, tribute albums have a certain reference tool value, allowing listeners to suss out connections on rock 'n' roll's gigantic influence web. In the case of the Kinks, this research is especially interesting, given that the Davies Bros. & cast have one of rock history's highest influence-to-sales ratios (in the colonies, at least). Were it not for MTV oddity ""Come Dancing,"" the Kinks would rank as the most important sixties band my parents have never heard of, and Joe Middle America would probably think the masterpiece whine of ""You Really Got Me"" was by the same band that did ""Wooly Bully."" But as Britpop dance nights, Wes Anderson soundtracks and prep school blazer sales figures show, the Kinks legacy still maintains a subcutaneous legacy in the global music economy. Add to that list of evidence This Is Where I Belong, which, with bands like Lambchop, Yo La Tengo, Jonathan Richman, and Josh Rouse all kissing the papal ring, has a hipster quotient through the roof. The collection also scores high on the stylistic variety scale, with bossa nova heiress Bebel Gilberto, soul-patch endorsers Queens of the Stone Age, and traditional bluegrass picker Tim O'Brien making their first and last unified appearance. All comers are subjected to the highly mathematical tribute album formula, as explained by guest commentator John Nash: ""How much their chosen cover (C) resembles the original (O) is directly proportional to the percentage of influence (I) the band-of-honor exerts over the artist. C/O=%I"" Thanks, John. Unsurprisingly, the people who score the highest on this formula (and, thus, are certified as the most notorious Kinks imitators), are America's power-pop elite: Fountains of Wayne, Matthew Sweet, The Minus 5, Fastball. All turn in barely altered takes on Kinks catalog items, adding little more than guitar volume to the original. It's pleasant to hear, as songs like ""Big Sky"" (Sweet) and ""Better Things"" (Fountains of Wayne) are like batting practice pitches to their cover artist, but the lack of tweakage makes for a rather inessential product. On the other hand, hearing Queens of the Stone Age turn in a note-perfect (down to the piano pounding) take on ""Who'll Be the Next in Line"" is more rewarding, given that it's completely unexpected from the stoner rock revivalists. Even better are the more risky reimaginations of Klassik Kinks by bands whose admiration for Davies is kept separate from any significant sonic influence upon their own aesthetic. Lambchop's choice of the creepy 80s pedophile tale ""Art Lover"" falls right in place with Wagner's trademark lyrical oddness, but it's given the sleepy quasi-lounge lushness of the band's pre-Is a Woman work. Also choosing atmosphere over skinny-tie attitude are Yo La Tengo (longtime Davies' worshipers) who craft a psychedelic haze around early artifact ""Fancy,"" and Josh Rouse, whose ""Well Respected Man"" is nicely lacquered with the Chicago sound. Then you've got the gimmicky stuff, like the endorsements of Kinks genre explorations by authentic practitioners (Gilberto's ""No Return,"" O'Brien's ""Muswell Hillbilly"") and the big finale appearance of the honoree himself, alongside Kinks Fan Club President Damon Albarn. All told, it's a stout compilation-- the only real stinker of the group is Cracker horribly mauling ""Victoria"" with their American accents-- but with the general handicap of all tribute albums (the scale only goes up to 7 for 'em), it's still nowhere near essential. Worst of all, given recent RIAA action, Lambchop and Fastball archivists might just have to buy the darn thing.

Yeah Yeah Yeahs EP,Yeah Yeah Yeahs,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab0c5e6ef959693216b6/1:1/w_160/aa7406db.jpg,2002-07-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8885-yeah-yeah-yeahs-ep/,Touch and Go,"We might be suffering a garage rock revival, but it's nothing compared to what the British are dealing with; confronted by America and Sweden's two-front onslaught, I think they're finally cracking. Case in point: the British music critics who're calling the Yeah Yeah Yeahs ""the next big thing."" Get in line, you say. The press is drooling over the band's U.K. tour, and succumbing most of all to singer Karen O, a self-described female Iggy Pop whose nutty performances and beer-soaked minidresses have won over everyone from NME to John Peel. The band doesn't play the States again for a couple of weeks, so all I have to go on is this debut EP, and even that's only thirteen minutes long. I don't know what kind of an impression these kids can make in that time, but I settle in, get comfortable, jack up the volume, and give it a whirl. The opening track, ""Bang!,"" sure sounds like the real deal. Nick Zinner's ultra-raunch electric guitar kicks off the riff while Karen O whispers, ""The bigger... the better."" It's catchy, and sure enough, it's sexy. Credit goes to Boss Hog's Jerry Teel for recording this to sound like it's playing out of a $39 boombox on a stripper's windowsill: whether he meant to or just had to, he nailed the sound of a hard-working band with no cash. O's vocals sound like 5% inspiration and 95% perspiration, but there's nothing wrong with that; if the singing were flat we'd have a problem, but O works every single syllable of the lyrics, taunting, dodging and oozing across the song. The ""aw aw aw hey yeah"" adlibbing says way more than the words. Brian Chase bangs open the next song, ""Mystery Girl,"" with primal drumbeats under Karen O's teasy squeals. This is b-movie rock with lyrics about every drive-in clich√© they could find: ""They found her under the sea/ She said she came from cell block 3! [squeal]"" I don't have a photo of O in front of me but an image is coming to me: she's leaning against a convertible, in a denim miniskirt and cowboy boots, and there's hot, hot steam radiating from the car. She tells me she has a problem with her trunk, and I tell her I can help out. I'm reaching for my tool-- --and what the fuck is a Cake song doing on here? Listen to the phrasing on the first line of ""Art Star""! A total knock-off of John McCrea's monotonous sing/speaking! And that's not even mentioning the ""do do do do do da do da do"" melody. This is poppy enough, and they fuse it with bursts of noise and diaphragm-ripping shouts, but it seems out of place. O uses the song to play the part of a celebrated New York artist with a ""madhouse"" life. It's a persona, but the whole album sounds like a role-playing exercise anyway. When they expand to a full-length O might take this farther, in the mode of PJ Harvey or a garage-rocking Tori Amos, perhaps-- maybe she could sing each song as a different character, like a randy widow, a teen harlot, and a rock 'n' roll nun. But for now, could we just have the woman from that last song again? And then we hit paydirt. ""Miles Away"" opens with the guitar strumming menacingly while O's voice twangs like every bad girl kicked out of a po' white high school. ""You wonder... you wonder... you woondddeerrrrrrr. PANT PANT PANT PANT."" When they hit the chorus, Zinner explodes like a small town muscle car rally, O screaming ferociously in an attempt to drown him out. There's no teasing or artifice now, she's wailing like a twanging banshee. Here comes the ferocious climax... and I'm spent. I'm so satisfied, in fact, that I let the ultimate high school burn-out anthem, ""Our Time,"" just drift by: ""It's our year to be hated,"" she belts on the chorus atop shimmering guitars. Time for the ugly kids to slow-dance. Zinner hands out some more of those ten-story chords, and the switch from rock to pop starts to make sense. For such a short debut, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs have put together a pretty sharp survey of their capabilities. This isn't a record, it's a portfolio: it's noisy but catchy, it lets them try out different styles, and it makes you give a good goddamn. And I don't know who Karen O really is, but I think I know what she wants me to think. I'm intrigued.

Consonant,Consonant,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a64e13d197565213915c/1:1/w_160/f7e7f682.jpg,2002-07-02 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1587-consonant/,Fenway,"It's like Clint Conley has been thawed out of hibernation. After years off the Boston rock scene, he's jumped back in as if he was never gone. First he plays a handful of raved-about reunion shows with Mission of Burma-- the most famous out of a legion of great rock and pop bands that played Boston in the 80s. Now he's got his own project, Consonant, whose debut album has just been released. There's nothing wildly new or innovative about the band, and nothing unfamiliar about the music; it's just an extremely likeable power-pop band playing a bunch of great songs. With Burma, Conley played bass and wrote some of their best songs, including ""That's When I Reach for My Revolver."" As Eric Van of Boston rock rag The Noise reports, Conley kept writing for a while, and then stopped until recently; this album includes both post-Burma songs and brand new ones. When he decided to record them, he worked with Holly Anderson to turn her poetry into the lyrics, and lined up an indie all-star band featuring Chris Brokaw of Come and Winston Braman of Fuzzy, plus Matt Kadane of Bedhead and Silkworm on drums. Consonant is more accessible than Mission of Burma, and less jittery and abrasive. It veers towards power-pop, though it's usually more propulsive than jangly. It sounds as if it was recorded in a worn-out Allston rehearsal space, which gives the band room for their rough edges and loose professionalism. The opener, ""Blissful,"" immediately grabs you with a slick hook and ebullient drumming. From there, the moods switch from dirges like ""Call it L---,"" to soaring pop like ""What a Body Could Do"" (which cribs from a song by the Busted Statues). ""Details of Attraction"" has precious overtones and almost folky, fragile vocals; like most of Anderson's lyrics, the words can be lined up to spell out the names of flowers, which admittedly ain't too rock. But ""The Kiss""-- and ""John Coltrane's 'My Favorite Things'""-- blare full bore on top of Conley's and Brokaw's guitars. Anderson's and Conley's lyrics are full of fumbling sexuality and vulnerable moments. Aside from a few misfires (the ""Love, glove, moon, June"" line in the song ""Post-Pathetic""), they're a perfect match for the vocals. High and a little thin, Conley's isn't the most assertive rock voice, but the songs turn that into a strength: for example, the shouted grind of ""Buckets of Flowers, Porno Mags,"" or the amused frustration on ""Post-Pathetic."" And he sounds genuinely unguarded on the slower numbers-- for example, on ""Not Like Them."" One of the stand-outs, ""What a Body Could Do,"" has lyrics about teenagers learning to mess around with each other. It's as blaring and tensely excited as the adolescent sexuality that these guys should have forgotten years ago. When the song drifts into a quiet bridge, you can see from a mile away that the band's about to come crashing back, rocking harder than ever. It's the biggest clich√© in the lexicon, but when it happens, it's like nobody's ever done it before: you have to crank up the volume and pound on the dashboard. Maybe it's the spontaneity of the playing, or the honesty of a mature and experienced man who can still talk about fumbling around and figuring things out. Or maybe it's the excitement Conley projects from getting back in a band and realizing he's as talented as ever. Consonant's debut sounds fresh even though it's steeped in years of indie rock and, best of all, Boston rock. It could be my hometown prejudice, but this is one of the most flat-out enjoyable albums I've heard this year.","It's like Clint Conley has been thawed out of hibernation.

Jane Doe,Converge,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a655ea9e61561daa5347/1:1/w_160/573ec528.jpg,2002-07-02 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1594-jane-doe/,Equal Vision,"The Pitchfork Global Positioning System Satellite tells me that most of you are in the northern hemisphere. As such, it's summer, and you need a good metal album. Jane Doe wasn't released this year, but sometimes you've got to pay dues when they're owed. And Converge might not exactly be heavy metal, either. They got their start in their hometown of Boston in the early nineties, playing covers of their favorite punk and hardcore songs. The blistering fusion unit they've evolved into has been called many things-- hardcore metal, math metal, metalcore-- but they could be ultra-core for all I care. Let's ignore the niceties. Converge is a smart, aggressive, brutal quintet, and Jane Doe will kick your ass repeatedly until it leaves its long imprint in your flabby buttflesh. The album opens in a throttling surge of bass and drums courtesy of ""Concubine."" If you're not familiar with this kind of music you might be blown back by the apocalyptic screech of frontman Jacob Bannon's vocals. It's clear with each gritty blast that the guy is screaming out his lungs for you. Naturally, you can't follow a single word but the vox bleed into the furious guitars and it's all acidic corrosion. With the emphasis lately on Fennesz and the pixilated laptop set, it's easy to forget that there's whole realms of sound to be found in the lethal decay of metal guitar's radioactive isotopes. In less than a minute-and-a-half, this song churns from a murderously fast-paced midsection to a slow stomp and back to a breakneck pace. ""Fault and Fracture"" picks up seamlessly where the last left off. Once again, the instruments lose their origins, blending in sonic onslaught. Ben Koller's harsh yet amazingly nuanced drumming ties it all together, and the one standout are these hilarious metal trills that peal out from the guitar. Until you reach ""Distance and Meaning,"" it's not clear where the hardcore influence lies. The band slows the pace just enough so you can understand Bannon snarling, ""That's where they die, that's where they suicide,"" amongst the lines wrought by the wiry rhythm. Jane Doe weaves different weights of heavy music together like this, careful to keep the listener interested. As the album moves on, you realize that Converge aren't just showing off their impressive stylistic range; they're telling a story. ""Homewrecker"" reaches an awesome peak as Bannon's ""No love! No hope!"" chorus transmutes to a howl so searing that even veteran scenehounds will be looking for a pit to flail around in. But it's during the tug-of-war vocal trades on ""The Broken Vow"" that the tale solidifies, one of missed phone calls, old bridges being burned, and lost love. The narrative builds up again and climaxes with ""Phoenix in Flight,"" which begins as a mournful dirge but soon sweeps up through a series of blazing guitar lines that make the elegy even more powerful. You get the sense that the mysterious female mentioned in the lyrics reaches apotheosis with ""Phoenix in Flames,"" an absolute cataclysm of noise that sounds like contact mics were stuffed in a bass drum and tossed down the side of a mountain. At the end you think back, scratch your head and wonder what the hell it was you listened to. Ultimately, Converge resists easy taxonomy; they're not going to play into that guy's game of ""Who's Metal?"" As it is, the artwork is strangely concerned with women. A series of faces arise out of stippled dots, all black-ringed eyes and pouty lips vamping from behind the cover of lyric text printed across the page. Is the message that this woman is just like any other, now that she's lost to him? The archetype is unsettling, but no more so than applauding as success the picture of a woman removing her burqa in a country still overrun by thugs and warlords. At least anonymity won't curse Converge for long with an album like this so full of intelligence, skill and intensity that it's simply masterful. Otherwise, I don't know what to call it. That's probably a good thing.","The Pitchfork Global Positioning System Satellite tells me that most of you are in the northern hemisphere. As such, it ...

Duck Season,Babu,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1e89d034d5c69bf2a7d/1:1/w_160/473f7a3f.jpg,2002-07-01 05:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/511-duck-season/,Sequence,"In a perfect world, DJ Babu would have been kneeling next to Mick Jagger's old, withered body when the Queen recently dispensed knighthoods. Whether as a member of uber-DJ crew the Beat Junkies or with his more recent stint as resident DJ of the nearly crossed-over Dilated Peoples, his Zen-like demeanor has been a fixture in the underground hip-hop scene for nearly a decade. His landmark DJ mixtape, Beat Junkies Vol. 1, and break record, Super Duck Breaks, were blueprints for turntablists from the Bay Area to Tokyo. In fact, the man not only perfected turntablism, he coined the term. For better or worse, hip-hop never sleeps, and many of the tricks and techniques that seemed superhuman and revolutionary three years ago sound pass√© and redundant today. But you have to hand it to Babu; he realized that he could no longer dazzle the underground masses with a 60-minute marathon of lightning crab scratches and juggling gymnastics. Instead, he uses Duck Season as a song showcase and adopts the party mixtape vibe that his peers (e.g., Peanut Butter Wolf, the Triple Threat DJs, and fellow Beat Junkie J-Rocc) have recently championed. Unfortunately, while the aforementioned DJs have redefined themselves as vinyl archeologists by sprinkling their playlists with obscure hip-hop and R&B; tracks, Babu relies upon a roster of artists for Duck Season that are generally too dated to be considered relevant, yet too young to be considered classic. But don't get it twisted-- while this album shows signs that Babu's days as a turntablist/hip-hop innovator may be behind him, he can still put together a collection of scorching jams. For one thing, the beats on this album bump harder than an East Flatbush block party, and while the lyrics do generally rely upon the one-line braggadocio theatrics that have threatened to strangle hip-hop lyricism, they complement the album's late-night, club-bangin' vibe nicely. The album kicks off with De La Soul's ""Watch Out,"" recycled from last year's AOI: Bionix. While I've heard that this is one of the album's better tracks, I haven't been able to listen to De La since they blew up and went pop on their shameful collaboration with boy band LFO. Next up is L.A.'s finest, Phil Da Agony, on ""Kronkite."" For this track, Babu unleashes the full force of his awesome turntablist skills, juggling Phil's vocal intro before dropping the track's thunderous and ominously pimping beat. The mix loses some momentum with Major's ""Concrete N*igga"" and Bumpy Knuckle's ""Patch Up the Pieces,"" but fortunately picks back up with the M.O.P. track ""Follow Instructions,"" an ammo-drilled anthem that boasts typically sick production by the legendary (if a bit overextended) DJ Premier. Soul Brother #1 Pete Rock keeps things moving with ""Cake."" Although this track falls short of his classic early-90s material with C.L. Smooth, how could anyone be expected to duplicate the simple street soul of ""T.R.O.Y.""? After the Pete Rock song, the album shifts gears and moves from the east coast to the west with mixed results. While Defari's ""Behold My Life"" is perhaps the finest Babu-produced track on the album, the Kankick and the Visionaries sound stale on ""Sight for Sour Eyes."" The Quasimoto remix adds nothing to the original (although it certainly never hurts to have Lord Quas on a mixtape), but the Souls of Mischief/Dilated Peoples collaboration is nice. Duck Season's last two tracks almost make it a classic. Legendary old-school MC Big Daddy Kane may have exchanged his trademark flattop for an afro, but his '89-style flow remains as raucous and authoritative as ever on the Alchemist-produced ""The Man/The Icon."" The gem of the whole collection, though, has gotta be Jurassic 5's politically charged ""Ducky Boy."" What makes the song so refreshing is that Jurassic 5, who with their endless harmonizing and soft beats have long sounded like Freestyle Fellowship lite, seem to be making a conscientious attempt to challenge both their sound and their audience's expectations. The beat is heavier and less backpacker bouncy than usual, and the first line-- ""I've never been hesitant to say fuck the president""-- immediately sets the song's confrontational tone. Unfortunately, the energy and willingness to expand that distinguishes the Jurassic 5 track is missing from the rest of the disc. Duck Season lacks the vitality of the earlier Beat Junkies releases because it not only refuses to deviate from an admittedly successful formula, but it also doesn't even attempt to stay fresh by bringing some new blood into the fold-- which is both depressing and boring. The album also suffers from the same identity crisis as the Automator's Wanna Buy a Monkey: it seems stuck somewhere between a mixtape and a production showcase. The mixes between songs are generally weak, and Babu rarely attempts to even match his beats up. While there are definitely some hot songs on here, Duck Season just doesn't compare to other Beat Junkies mixtapes-- which had both fresh songs and hot mixes. So that leaves Duck Season in merely adequate territory. If you want the real Beat Junkie flavor, my suggestion would be to pick up J-Rocc's Sex Machine or Beat Junkies' Vol. 1-3.","In a perfect world, DJ Babu would have been kneeling next to Mick Jagger's old, withered body when the ...

Recorder,Twine,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a84dea9e61561daa57b3/1:1/w_160/390acd94.jpg,2002-07-01 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8217-recorder/,Bip Hop,"Abstract electronic music is exciting in part because it sounds like it comes from its own world. There is no material reference point for something like Oval's Szenariodisk or Autechre's EP7. No object and no living thing can make these sounds; they are instead birthed from the unknowable guts of a cold, calculating machine. It is these limitless sonic possibilities that have driven composers to electronic music since before John Cage was calling his early experiments ""Imaginary Landscapes."" But there's also something to be said for electronic music that remains grounded, emotionally accessible, and clearly of this earth. And it's in this class of electronic records that Twine's Recorder falls. Rather than sounding like the outgrowth of endless experiment, Recorder sounds like it was laid out carefully before the first mouse had been clicked, the whole thing designed to realize very specific musical goals. This is no pile-up of exhaustively rendered Max/MSP patches. Despite the fact that the album is composed on computer, Recorder sounds orchestral, with dense layers of sound reverberating in a defined space. It's the anything-goes spirit of abstract IDM applied to sweeping dramatic gestures, a laptop version of the soundtrack to Apocalypse Now. And at this moment in the music's development, it sounds refreshing. Strummed electric guitar is the first sound heard on ""None Some Silver,"" setting a dark emotional tone that Recorder beautifully sustains. The chords are distantly spaghetti western, but the menace and tension behind them feel like more than just a cinematic homage, possibly aided by the electronic noise that bubbles beneath. Eventually, the synthetic whine envelops the track completely, subsuming the familiar instrument in a cloud of harsh noise. The following ""Cign"" begins with a whistling tone that leads to tribal beats that ping-pong between the speakers, rising and falling along with the restless drones behind the beats. This track showcases the electronic/organic nature of Recorder, as the percussion, so clearly synthetic, conversely seems beaten out by a drum corps. The feeling of dread conveyed by ""Cign"" is incredibly vivid. A much slower emotional burn is evident on ""Fine Music."" Here, Twine seem to be coming from a place similar to Stars of the Lid circa The Ballasted Orchestra, combined with Labradford's respect for the power of a stalking bass drum. ""Curved"" is another drone piece in a similar vein, but the elongated tones are a bit less dreary, and are constantly being interrupted by percussive whooshes of sound that sound like they're caroming off the walls of a cavern. While maintaining a similar atmosphere, ""Player Piano"" delves into collage, with randomly chopped piano notes that fall into place in a pretty melody bumping against sampled voice, odd instrumental snippets and assorted clicks and pops. None of the raw material on Recorder is particularly new, and there's nothing to convey on paper what makes this record so good. It simply achieves exactly what it set out to: 56 minutes of carefully assembled texture meant to convey feelings of loneliness, isolation, fear and tension. It's dark electronic music sticky with human fingerprints.","Abstract electronic music is exciting in part because it sounds like it comes from its own world. There is no ...

Suicide Invoice,Hot Snakes,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c123eb335119a49ed4ec/1:1/w_160/46218970.jpg,2002-07-01 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3930-suicide-invoice/,Swami,"Christ almighty, it's the Hot Snakes! Maybe you've heard of 'em. Back in 2000, they released a fine, upstanding debut called Automatic Midnight. Wasn't nothin' groundbreaking, but it spared no man caught standing in its crosshairs, filling mop-topped hipsters countrywide with bullets of mercurial death. It didn't concern itself with paltry academic nonsense like innovation and progression. Hell no! It came for one purpose and one purpose only: to bludgeon. And now the Snakes come again, slithering diligently between the feet of still-standing concertgoers, sensing the sweat of unshowered ankles, arching their backs, preparing to strike. These are the snakes you fear most: the kind that bite. Combining the angular lashings of Drive Like Jehu with the strut and bravado of Rocket from the Crypt and a healthy dose of pure menace, the Snakes have assembled a sound straight from the heart of rock itself. You won't find them toppling the tower of convention to its very foundation, or even shaking their fists at it, and if this sound ever seems familiar or predictable, it's only because you've remembered it from your immortal soul. (Plato, next round's on me.) These guys capture the essential, timeless threat of rock music with every track they lay down. And damn straight-- the raw, naked aggression that pours out the speakers is intimidating. That's beauty of it. Hot Snakes aren't putting themselves out there to push rock music to another plane; they're thrilled just to refine it through a series of lean, caustic numbers full of bared-to-the-bones malice and spite, punctuated by occasional moments of subtle, perceived vulnerability. It's clear from the get-go that there's danger lurking just beneath the surface of this music, and if given the chance, it'll chew you up and shit you out. The jagged, stutter-stepping guitars of John Reis and Rick Froberg (RFTC frontman, ex-Drive Like Jehu, respectively) skip the ears and drill straight through the skull. Steve Albini would be so proud of the heavy metallic rumblings produced by Gar Wood's bass guitar, and Jason Kourkounis simply shreds his skins. Together, these men create a musical backdrop that's hard as gaw-damn nails and not afraid to repeat itself until you understand exactly where it's coming from. Froberg's vocal tone is the perfect emotional center of each and every one of Suicide Invoice's twelve tracks. Most of the time, he sounds like he's trying with all his might just to make it to the surface of the mix, like he's calling out across a vast distance. His desperation adds essential emotional impact to what would otherwise seem to be quite obvious subject matter, giving it a truly convincing edge. And once in a while, on songs like ""Why Does It Hurt"" and ""Paperwork,"" Froberg drops the rage almost entirely, and all that's left for lines like ""I know your heart is in the right place/ So why does it hurt?"" is the sound of alienation. It doesn't happen much, but when it does it's damn powerful, and not for a second undignified. Otherwise, tracks like ""I Hate the Kids"" (""Grab a spade, get in the dirt/ The older you get, the less you're worth"") and ""Paid in Cigarettes"" are callous and cruel enough to punch you in the stomach and steal your lunch money. The only tropes these guys know are 'kicking ass' and 'taking names,' and the rest can go to hell, because Suicide Invoice is nothing but rock viscera in its most elegant simplicity. And sometimes, that's all you need.","Christ almighty, it's the Hot Snakes! Maybe you've heard of 'em. Back in 2000, they released a fine ...

You Don't Need Darkness to Do What You Think Is Right,Various Artists,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7909d034d5c69bf3818/1:1/w_160/030fccec.jpg,2002-07-01 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1896-you-dont-need-darkness-to-do-what-you-think-is-right/,Geographic,"The premise behind You Don't Need Darkness to Do What You Think Is Right was to introduce to Japanese listeners the bands of Domino Records subsidiary Geographic, a vanity label of sorts curated by those ambassadors of twee, the Pastels. It was commissioned by the Japan's Trattoria, the vanity label of Cornelius. And if that isn't enough vanity for you, check this out: the Pastels saw fit to hand themselves the first two slots on this comp. How generous! Somehow (we'll call it fate), this comp missed Japan entirely and ended up on my desk. And while my life hasn't been changed by it, it does contain a number of redeeming qualities. The songs gathered here, with a few exceptions, are exclusive to this release, and I imagine most people who would consider buying this are either Kevin Shields completists (I've been told they still exist) or diehard fans of pasty Scottish indie rock. As for the first count, all I can say is don't bother. The Shields track that ends this collection, ""Outro,"" is by far the most worthless and unmemorable moment here: a very unremarkable interpretation/remix of the Pastels' song that opens the disc, ""Intro,"" which was fairly unremarkable to begin with. But I guess if you're a completist, by definition, this little tip won't make much difference. Sucker. As for the other contribution from the Pastels, it's a cover of Sly Stone's ""Everybody Is a Star"" (the compilation's title is culled from one of its lines). And if you've ever wanted to hear a decent song drained of its lifeblood and anaesthetized into oblivion, here's your chance. Me, after forcing myself through it a few times for the sake of reference, I now skip directly to track three, which is a ramshackle pop tune from Glasgow's International Airport called ""Cordial Arrest."" Frontman Tom Crossley (himself a member of the Pastels, as well as Appendix Out) has a voice like a less gruff and more tuneful Damien Jurado, and the music sounds a lot like the early work of fellow Scots Belle & Sebastian. Must be something in the ale. Future Pilot AKA follows, offering up a fun, if somewhat cold, reggae chant with pling-plong beats, bells, and a tad bit of scratching (turntables or guitar strings, I'm not completely sure). Bill Wells Octet continues in the goofy (yet, again cold, ironic, and distant) vein with a jazzy, happy-go-lucky, whistle-led instrumental that sounds like it comes from a Sesame Street skit-- you know, the one where the kid is walking in the rain, skipping mud puddles, wearing a bright yellow raincoat and shiny red galoshes. Two Japanese bands come next (giving the Japanese listener a sense that Geographic really cares, I assume): the quixotic Zappa-esque Maher Shalal Hash Baz and Japan's resident Neil-Young-o-philes, Nagisa Ni Te. I've never heard the music of Maher Shalal Hash Baz before, and to be honest, after hearing their ""Stone In the River,"" I'm not exactly rushing over to Forced Exposure to catch up with them: boring, and with an annoying affected weirdness to it, like Zappa at his worst. Nagisa Ni Te's effort, on the other hand, is something that would get me interested in their music had I not heard it before. As it is though, I have. ""Me On the Beach"" is a re-recording of a song from their excellent On the Love Beach album. The song begins with Harvest-like acoustic guitar and harmonica, and ends with a blast of feedback echoing Rust Never Sleeps. Yet the band's dual male/female vocals (and, well, the fact that they're Japanese) helps rescue them from the ranks of banal American imitators. The mid-section of this comp is where things begin to really drag, though, with a handful of uneventful and interchangeable electronic instrumentals, an almost stereotypical German techno number, and an obligatory half-assed Low imitation. On the plus side, there is a excellent Appendix Out song. ""The Language of Things,"" while kinda wordy and didactic, is beautifully expressed through Ali Roberts' creeky chords and one-of-a-kind moan. He is the Scottish Will Oldham. Or maybe Oldham is the American Ali Roberts. You get my point. Both call upon the spectre of history through their updated folk without crumbling under the oppressive weight of the past. And speaking of Will Oldham, wasn't ""No More Rides"" a Palace song? Well, it sounds like it. Either way, National Park has a song here by that name and it's good. Not as frazzled or unpredictable as the Bonnie Prince, but getting down to a pretty bleak vibe through a similar route all the same. If I could use one word to sum up this comp it would be 'chilly.' Sometimes austerity is used for some greater good, but elsewhere its sole purpose is to leave an arty gloss upon everything. You Don't Need Darkness left me feeling like I'd just watched a particularly bleak European (maybe Scandinavian) film: while it peered honestly into some dark corners and a faint glimmer of truth was told, its primary purpose seemed to be to leave you feeling cold about yourself and the universe around you.","The premise behind You Don't Need Darkness to Do What You Think Is Right was to introduce to Japanese ...

Dekkagar,The National Trust,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3af69fc7814a47cd6db/1:1/w_160/14af32e8.jpg,2002-06-30 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5723-dekkagar/,Thrill Jockey,"500 hours is a long time no matter how you look at it. Try to imagine doing anything for that long-- say, grocery shopping, surfing the web or standing in line at the DMV. To put it in perspective, that's more than 20 days: three whole weeks of your life. To further qualify it, let's also mention that over the course of an entire lifetime, the average human spends just barely two cumulative weeks kissing-- about 336 hours. According to sources, it took over 500 hours to record Dekkagar, the debut album from Chicago's National Trust. Naturally, that's not 500 straight hours, but for a self-funded, independently released album, that's a lot of studio time. In many ways, the time investment shows. Dekkagar is, to say the least, a lush, heavily layered album flooded with overdubs and elaborate arrangements. And on a cursory listen, almost no one would guess that Brian Deck was mostly responsible for its smooth sound, as the resemblance to his other work with Califone, Red Red Meat, Modest Mouse, and any number of other Clava Studios projects is passing at best. You can hear his clang-and-trash approach peeking through occasionally-- for instance, in the way the harmony vocals are recorded and layered, or in the odd analog tape noises that surface in the middle of the bongo-fueled ""Lachrymosa""-- but by and large, he keeps his messier tendencies reined in out of respect for bandleader Neil Rosario's need for a smoother sound. Rosario, formerly of Chicago blues-rockers Dolemite and, briefly, Red Red Meat, is said to have funded the recording of Dekkagar with money he won from gambling while visiting his dying father in Las Vegas-- though the honest thing for Rosario to do would've been to kick some of that back to The Impressions for his appropriation of their rough-hewn Chicago soul. He could've tossed in a few greenbacks to Curtis Mayfield's estate, too, for traces of the old soul king's more progressive and elaborate solo work. Rosario's debt to Mayfield manifests itself somewhat in his vocals, which frequently rise to a falsetto croon that unfortunately falls about halfway between Mayfield and Lambchop's Kurt Wagner-- it never reaches the majesty of the former, but also never grows as utterly tiresome as the latter's. Of course, his voice is also rarely out there on its own. I swear to god, there must be about 17 vocal tracks on some of these songs, and you've gotta wonder just what in the wide world of sports they were thinking spending hour-upon-hour layering dozens of vocal tracks when about five would have sufficed. And therein lies the fundamental problem with Dekkagar: there's simply too damn much of it. In a similar manner as Spiritualized's Let It Come Down, the arrangements sometimes simply overwhelm the proceedings and things become soupy instead of bracing. And then there's the issue of length. Every song here is well over four minutes, and some would definitely benefit from a bit of tasteful trimming. Opener ""Making Love (In the Natural Light)"" opens with a steamy bit of hot-buttered indie soul that's frankly quite stunning, but by the time the eleventh minute rolls around, you're most likely somewhere else. Similarly, ""Neverstop"" possesses an amazingly well-composed melody and an engaging progression you might expect to hear from a band on a label like Bobsled or Sealed Fate, but the hazy production and neverstopping length prevent it from ever being hammering home. While it may work only fleetingly as a collection of songs, though, Dekkagar certainly works as a whole to create a mood. The Rhodes piano that could have been lifted from an old Isaac Hayes acetate, the smoky bedtime bongos, clean wah-wah guitars and subdued, yet soulful vocals build atmosphere to spare, and under the right circumstances might even help you pad out those two weeks of kissing we're each allotted. In the midst of his 70s soul fixation, Rosario also reveals an affinity for old-school Wall-of-Sound pop, a la Nitzche and Spector. It surfaces most visibly on the floating harmonies that blanket closer ""First Time That,"" as a whole roomful of Rosarios glide through an ocean of reverb over a jazz-inflected rock groove. It certainly stands as one of the prettiest things I've heard all year, even if it drifts on too long. To reiterate: it took 500 hours of several peoples' lives to make this record. So I suppose now all that's left is for you to decide whether or not it sounds like it might be worth one hour of yours. If you're looking for a revelation or something immediate, you'd best turn away, but if you just want something nice and mellow, take a chance. Ultimately, I think Rosario and crew are capable of making something really amazing, but for now we have Dekkagar, an overambitious record from a band who may yet have Great Things in store, provided they can stop being so damn anal.","500 hours is a long time no matter how you look at it.

Emergency Rations EP,Mr. Lif,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3ef5e6ef95969323942/1:1/w_160/7ef3df0f.gif,2002-06-30 05:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5475-emergency-rations-ep/,Definitive Jux,"Apparently, Ari Fleischer forgot to CC: Mr. Lif when he sent out the e-mail that warned people to ""watch what [they] say"" when questioning the moral authority of America. Mr. Lif, who professes that ""my eyes are wide open 'cause my television is off,"" has been one of the more socially conscious emcees on the recent scene, but with Emergency Rations, an EP released last month, he's crafted his most overtly political work to date, and the most inflammatory album of the post-9/11 era. That's not to say that hip-hop artists haven't addressed this country's current political climate. Sage Francis' Makeshift Patriot and J-Live's Satisfied both did a wonderful job of addressing their respective misgivings of America's revised nationalism. But while the aforementioned songs express only vague reassurances of continued political consciousness, Emergency Rations is a straight-up, name-calling, policy-specific work of dissent. Think Noam Chomsky with a beat. Brother PC and frequent Lif collaborator Akrobatik kick off the album with a skit about the apparent abduction of Lif by government agents determined to stifle his free speech rights. It's an unfortunate and sophomoric concept that's referenced both in the liner notes and on brief skits between songs. But on the dancehall scorcher, ""Jugular Vein,"" Lif leaves the silliness behind as he takes the mic and sets shit off properly. The beat is infectious and Lif's observational randomness and aggressive, plainspoken vocal delivery recall both Guru and Rakim. While the slashing cadence can be a bit repetitive over the course of the album, there's a smoothness in his flow, and an intelligence and wit in his observations that rescue him from mundanity. ""Home of the Brave"" is the most politically direct and thematically focused song on the album. On the track's second verse, Lif gives us his polemical take on the hype following 9/11: ""When they realized we didn't support their attacks, they needed something to distract: Anthrax/ So America's chant while we kill innocent families.../ Here's what the history books won't show, you're a dead man for fucking with American dough."" Finally, Lif concludes that ""they killed us because we've been killing them for years."" Lif debuted the song earlier this year at a club less than a dozen blocks from the WTC site-- an act of American courage that isn't likely to be heralded by George Bush or William Safire. Although the sentiments are uncompromisingly confrontational and radically political, there's something about both Lif's tone and his flow that don't exude the hard-boiled rage of Chuck D. In his own words, he keeps things on ""a positive tip,"" and his rants are generally more informative and instructive than they are inflammatory and zealous. On ""Pull Out Your Cut,"" Lif even addresses the cultural forces that create eating disorders in girls and dictate ""that boys should never cry""-- both topics that I'm pretty sure have never been addressed in hip-hop. The song is astute, kinda quirky and endearing, if not a bit lightweight for hip-hop-- which are all qualities that could describe Lif's persona in general. This quirky charm is nicely complemented by the album's musical production, which features Lif, Eden, and El-P. With the exception of ""I, Phantom"" (which is El-P's single contribution), the entire album has either a laid-back dancehall reggae or old-school vibe that's a pleasant departure from the glitch-core futurism that generally distinguishes Def Jux artists. At times, however, Lif's randomness becomes too much and entire songs spiral out of focus and come off like untouched freestyles. On ""Pull Out Your Cut,"" Lif abandons his dissection of the media's pervading influence and goes off on a tangent about how much he likes GZA and Guru. It's a fair enough opinion, but it's oddly placed and disrupts the song's consistency. And it must be said that nothing on this record demonstrates that Lif can place his political message in real social settings, e.g. The Coup's ""Kill Your Landlord"" or Public Enemy's ""9-1-1 Is a Joke."" But minor flaws aside, Lif shows on this album that he's both topical and talented. Although it lacks the revelatory, genre-melting impact of Cannibal Ox's The Cold Vein or El-P's Fantastic Damage, it stands on its own amongst the Def Jux heavyweights-- which is no small feat. If Lif can maintain his message over the course of an entire album and not be distracted by odd tangents, his forthcoming LP has the potential to be a classic that ranks alongside The Coup's Steal This Album.","Apparently, Ari Fleischer forgot to CC: Mr. Lif when he sent out the e-mail that warned people to ""watch what ...

Martial Arts Weekend,The Extra Lens,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcdaabf31b7dc7155dfb/1:1/w_160/2c47ec5a.jpg,2002-06-30 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2884-martial-arts-weekend/,Absolutely Kosher,"Things I would give Mountain Goats charter member John Darnielle for his birthday: 1. an editor
2. a band
3. one of those golf-tee brainteaser peg games from the Cracker Barrel
4. an electric guitar Of course, a real Darnielle fanatic would find most of these suggestions to be downright heretical. With a veritable mountain of cassette tapes and compact discs, the California nurse/rock critic has carved himself a distinct sound; one of hard-strummed acoustics, nonexistent recording budgets, and razor-keen lyricism. While this approach continues to exhibit strong vital signs-- this year's All Hail West Texas served as one of his best records yet-- I can't help but speculate at the potential of a more fleshed-out sound. Chalk it up to the 'Stick With What Works' vs. 'Explore New Directions' dilemma that confronts any artist stable enough to find their way beyond album #3. Fortunately, along come the Extra Glenns to test my hypothesis that Darnielle's eccentricities would survive, and maybe even be enhanced by, additional musicians and instruments. The setup: a collaboration with Franklin Bruno of Nothing Painted Blue, who contributes piano, backing vocals, and one of those newfangled guitars that plug into an amplifier. A full band it's not; there are still no drums, bass, or gospel-trained backup singers. But it's a step in the direction of appeasing my curiosity. Too bad Martial Arts Weekend leaves out my favorite member of the Mountain Goats team, the Panasonic RX-FT500 boombox that gives the bulk of Darnielle's discography that wonderfully no-fi, transistor radio character. Recorded on actual functioning equipment, Martial Arts Weekend has none of the tape hiss and EQ-red-zone distortion that fills in the empty space around Darnielle's solo jobs. And since Bruno prefers to use a light, shimmery guitar tone that provides little in the way of low-end, everything has the skinny, half-finished sound of your favorite 80s records (when treble was king). As a result, a dozen typical, but strong Darnielle compositions (plus one absolutely unbearable Leonard Cohen cover) are brought down by an over-abundance of empty sonic real estate and a shared songwriting byline. To his credit, Bruno's embellishments are kept simple enough to not be distracting, and they manage to add a little extra flavor to back catalog echo songs like ""Baltimore"" or ""Malevolent Seascape Y."" But then again, neither his six-string or ivory-tinkling work is particularly revelatory-- nothing he plays jumps out as being so essential that a track might collapse without it. The real culprit here could actually be Darnielle, whose parts already sound fully realized without Bruno's flourishes, which lends the project a largely inorganic feel like that of Robert Pollard's recent tapes-by-mail experiments. Still, I'd be lying if I said there weren't enjoyable moments to be had. While the album doesn't have the consistency of recent Mountain Goats LPs, it hits as often as early albums like Zopilote Machine and Nine Black Poppies. Bruno adds a mournful harmonica to the jaunty ""Somebody Else's Parking Lot in Sebastapol"" and comes up with a neat complementary riff and jazzy piano solo to soup up ""Twelve Hands High."" Meanwhile, Darnielle calls upon all his tried-and-true lyrical themes: flora, geography, and acrobatic mentions of historical figures like Verdi and Kierkegaard. Especially nice is the 'road-trip-battle-over-car-stereo-privileges-as-metaphor-for-decaying-relationship' in ""Going to Michigan,"" and the love-is-harder-to-kill-than-Freddy-Kreuger track ""Going to Marrakesh"" (choice line: ""Our love is like Jesus/ But worse""). But after the initial novelty of hearing more than your average instrumentation beneath Darnielle's literate whine, Martial Arts Weekend comes off as a semi-pleasing but second-tier Mountain Goats effort. And as a test of my 'try it with a band' theory, the results are strictly inconclusive-- after all, only one of my four birthday gifts really turn up full-fledged. At least I won't have to take back that Cracker Barrel golf-tee game.","Things I would give Mountain Goats charter member John Darnielle for his birthday:

Mong Hang,Mong Hang,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c39cc0084474cd0c34ea/1:1/w_160/f57e96a6.jpg,2002-06-30 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5396-mong-hang/,Bad News,"What's the point of this? It's not as if the kind of music I usually write about for Pitchfork is much more coherent than Japan's Mong Hang, but at least it's usually less frustrating. The music here is not so much impressive as it is calculatedly eclectic and raw. Of course, I've come to expect progressive rock flourishes and heavy-handed virtuosity from bands of this sort, and the celebrity connections are right on time (drummer Atsushi Tanaka has played with Acid Mothers Temple). And just as the worst thing you can say of the Acid Mothers is that they sound like the a thousand other psychedelic jam bands, but juiced up on steroids, Mong Hang, at their worst, merely sound like a second rate Acid Mothers or one of many Tatsuya Yoshida projects. That's a shame because at their best, they're a good poor man's symphonic prog band-- something like Gentle Giant being forced to use Tom Waits' instruments and Gary Wilson's budget. I'll start with the good stuff: the opener, ""Bi,"" begins with some broken-English emceeing and a boisterous tympani roll which bursts into good old fashioned pomp-rock fanfare, not unlike what Queen thrust on the world before they got rich. The drums are loud and distorted, pounding out entire orchestral percussion parts, and the vocals are pure operatic shout-song. It's probably as bombastic as they could muster, but since I doubt their advance could cover Roy Thomas Baker's shoe polish, the overwhelming effect is fairly quaint. ""Orange Seximo"" is the first of a few tunes to feature Mong Hang's secret weapon: the steel drums. Percussionist Yohei Bohemian plays a melody on them that sounds close to traditional Japanese, and background vocalists 'la-la' their way through some nice helium-voiced counterpoint. About midway through, the guitars crash in, and Mong Hang becomes Ruins, Jr., but the brief acoustic does offer a glimpse into the startling refined musicianship on display. Bassist Keitaimo Wuja Bin Bin wrote most of the music here. I haven't seen his name around anywhere else, but from what I gather, beyond the usual avant-prog-psyche elements, he seems to have a preference for epic concepts. Many of the tunes share motives, bringing back a familiar melody here or a hard groove there. Of course, this is old hat for proggers, but Mong Hang's greatest accomplishment appears to have been making their music seem a lot more simple than it actually is. ""Mangcha"" brings out Waits' marimba and drunken waltz beat, almost fooling me into thinking they'd go for the bizarro pomp again, but soon enough, the helium vocals are back, and son of junior Ruins makes an appearance. And then they break into a Santana-style Latin rock solo section. They sound like good enough players, but the overriding goofiness threatens to tumble all their hard work into a round of laffs. This effectively kills momentum in legitimate prog symphonies like ""Mountains II: Harasu,"" and might keep folks from staying tuned until the last tune, ""Gommos,"" a ruggedly pretty traditional Japanese ballad. The absolute worst? Try ""Mesopotamia,"" wherein Mong Hang attempts to transcend third-rate cartoon music by injecting fake kids' vocals and a limp polka beat. If that doesn't sway you, then try ""Sap Alan on the Tellial,"" which may actually the best thing to ever repeat the same grating line of verse 100 times and feature Elmo on lead vocals. The otherworldly percussion coda comes too late to save me from TV Land psychosis. But as much as I'd like to ignore tunes like that, I'm afraid they're only symptoms of a greater call to clowning that draws the band. You can be sure they tear it up live, and parts of this album have doubtlessly planted the seed of curiosity in my head enough to at least download whatever they come up with next. Here's hoping it's more jam and less ham.","What's the point of this? It's not as if the kind of music I usually write about for ...

Camphor,David Sylvian,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a61f5e6ef95969320c6e/1:1/w_160/c8c8d33e.jpg,2002-06-27 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7683-camphor/,Virgin,"Pitchfork's thinking person's male crooner continuum places David Sylvian not so very far from the male crooner who guards the right-hand extremity of the continuum, Scott Walker. Sitting on the left-hand extremity is Bono, nearby him Peter Gabriel, Marc Almond, Lou Reed, Gavin Friday, and the Laughing Gnome himself, David Bowie. Sylvian is clearly indebted to Bowie. His previous band, Japan, mined Bowie's glam and Berlin periods and derived some memorable songs. Sylvian thinks of himself as more than a pop star and leader of a long-defunct new wave band; he's an artist-in-sound, luvvie, and he's going out of his way to prove he could be more of an egghead than Brian Eno if he really wanted to be. As last year's two-disc retrospective Everything and Nothing demonstrated, David Sylvian has always strived to experiment and to challenge his audience. Without resorting to Scott Walker's allusive abstractions, Sylvian takes banal sentiments and, through quirky metaphor or idiosyncratic musical arrangement, never fails to distinguish himself. However, the watchword here is 'experiment.' Sylvian's back catalog is more interesting, to my ears, for its lush failures rather than its successes. And no question that Everything and Nothing-- and now Camphor, its instrumental companion-- abounds in fascinating imperfections. Sylvian is capable of achieving flawlessness. As I noted in my review of Everything and Nothing, his song ""Ghosts"" has every right to ascend to the canonical status of standard. It would take a brave singer to start the trend, but as Dave Douglas and Susana Baca have both attempted to make a case for Bj√∂rk's ""Unison"" and ""The Anchor Song"" to be as widely performed as unworthy material, it's not inconceivable that someone might have a go. Flawlessness is not Sylvian's goal. If it were, he'd repeat ""Ghosts"" over and over again. Rather, in order to further his pretensions to art, Sylvian has bought into an aesthetic dualism that Leonard Cohen summed up succinctly with the line, ""There's a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in."" For Sylvian, true beauty must have a flaw. Camphor sure has flaws, but it also possesses instances of true beauty, too. Drawn from his solo as well as his collaborative works, the cerebral instrumentals that comprise Camphor mark Sylvian's consistent voyage through acoustic soundworlds. Where others would content themselves with the sonic equivalent of CGI, Sylvian means to take fresh approaches using sometimes centuries-old instruments. Of course, unlike some unknown or obscure manipulator of soundfiles, Sylvian's reputation affords him the time and luxury to ask Bill Frisell, Marc Ribot, Robert Fripp, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Talvin Singh, Mark Isham, Nils Petter Molvaer, and sundry members of Can to drop by the studio for a spell. And the folks at Virgin Records kindly obliged when confronted with the bill for studio time. Camphor opens with ""All My Mothers' Names"" and Marc Ribot performing a Robert Fripp impersonation of John McLaughlin's Inner Mounting Flame period while Ryuichi Sakamoto dapples on his Rhodes piano in deft approximation of same-era Jan Hammer. The jagged guitar work will disrupt wherever this track is placed, and in its original context on the Dead Bees on a Cake album, ""All My Mothers' Names"" really got on my tits. But acting as an overture on Camphor, the track epitomizes Sylvian's wantonly brainiac and sometimes misguided fusion of awkwardness and serenity. In this capacity, if you can appreciate the track jags and all, you'll find the thirteen other tracks far easier going. ""Red Earth (As Summertime Ends)"" is placid in comparison. Taken from the sole Rain Tree Crow album (essentially a Japan reunion in all but name), the track is a mildly Afro-funk ambient piece, not so dissimilar to the second half of Brian Eno's and David Byrne's My Life in the Bush of Ghosts. Also from Rain Tree Crow, ""New Moon at Red Deer Wallow"" blends curious bass clarinet lines with call-and-response percussion. The effect is similar to that which Jon Hassell and Eno achieved on their highly influential Possible Worlds album. In addition to remixes of previously released tracks, Camphor features two new songs. Both ""The Song Which Gives the Key to Perfection"" and ""Praise (Pratah Smarami)"" display Sylvian's devotion to Hinduism. Sylvian's vocals on the former are some of the most heartfelt and restrained I've ever heard from him, and the instrumentation he chooses to set them in is movingly unadorned. It's such a pity that the accompanying booklet offers no translation of the lyrics-- I'd love to know what wisdom inspired his reverence. Sylvian gives equally Spartan accompaniment to ""Praise (Pratah Smarami),"" featuring Shree Maa, a guru whose devotees consider an embodiment of the Hindu mother goddess, Durga. Sylvian surrounds her mournful inflections with soft sheets of ambience, akin to those that he and Holger Czukay used on their must-have 1988 blissful lament Plight and Premonition. As obnoxious counterpoint to the simple elegance of ""Praise (Pratah Smarami),"" ""Big Wheels in Shanty Town"" is Frankie Goes to Hollywood's Welcome to the Pleasuredome prepared for the WOMAD crowd. ""The Healing Place"" (excerpted from Gone to Earth) approximates the plaintive grandeur of ""Ghosts"" with Bill Nelson's guitar replacing Sylvian's sorrowful-opulent vocals. Yet, once again obeying his doctrine that for every success he must stump up a lush lapse of judgment, Sylvian plunges Camphor into ineptitude with the title track. Here, he gives his dilettantish take on glitch, and Fennesz or Stefan Betke he's not. He gloms, stutters and rips to his trademark moody ambience without understanding the wealth of expression that glitches can afford. ""Camphor"" spins around asking, ""Isn't this what the youngsters are doing?"" and all the listener can do is gape at the incoherent coalescence of sounds. By re-recording the vocals for Everything and Nothing, Sylvian went part way to impose a unity of performance on compositions drawn from many periods in his career. And by remixing a few of the tracks here, Sylvian's attempting a similar trick for Camphor. Unfortunately, the almost unnoticeable tweaks to the remixed tracks don't force a new stylistic continuity that would dupe listeners into considering this record worthwhile. Therefore, I'm left to conclude that Camphor is very much a flawed digest of Sylvian's moody experiments. If purchased as a gateway to Sylvian's catalog, it'll lead you to far more significant records. Otherwise, this scattered selection will leave you wondering if Pitchfork's thinking person's crooner male continuum is guilty of producing an egregiously false positive result.","Pitchfork's thinking person's male crooner continuum places David Sylvian not so very far from the male\n\ crooner ...

CBGB's and the Birth of U.S. Punk,Various Artists,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7f613d1975652139549/1:1/w_160/dbedfc00.jpg,2002-06-27 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2009-cbgbs-and-the-birth-of-us-punk/,Union Square,"I was sold on the Ramones from the moment Joey first lamented the loss of his girl at the hands of the KKK. With every salvo of their 'cartoon-simple' brand of battery acid, they came one step closer to demystifying music, and in my pre-jaded, pre-cynical youth, I idolized them for it. Now, of course, my ironclad contract with the Hegemony of Music Critics (HMC) prevents me from idolizing anyone because of 'ironic distance,' so the best I can do is admire them as genre-defining artists. Just between you and me, though, they rock. As of June 5th, 2002, fully half of the Ramones-- Joey and Dee Dee-- are gone. Two Ramones in two years! It's selfish, but I feel robbed. Naturally, there will be tributes, posthumous releases, and more compilations, but somehow, a document like CBGB's and the Birth of U.S. Punk seems more fitting, as well as timely. As good as they were, the Ramones were just a single aspect of the seminal punk scene they came to symbolize. The 'garage rock revival' that holds the music world in thrall has them to thank, along with a dozen other bands who came before; not only the classics like the Velvets and Television, but scores of influential also-rans like the Dead Boys, the Sonics, and the Electric Eels. So for anyone who can't get enough of the Strokes, the Hives, or the Plural Nouns, The Birth of U.S. Punk stands not only as a damn fine album, but an even better history lesson (that is, assuming you don't already know it). CBGB's, the legendary heart of the 70s New York punk scene, is really of secondary importance here-- despite any stints in-house, most of the groups compiled here were showing elsewhere before they made their pilgrimages to Hilly Kristal's club. Instead, this album is a love letter to an era. These eighteen tracks try to capture the punk movement sweeping the U.S. at its raw, nihilistic roots, and mostly succeed. The record has all the necessary anthems, from the pogo power of the Ramones' original demo of ""Judy Is a Punk"" to the unbridled cynicism of ""Blank Generation"" by Richard Hell's Voidoids. The Velvet Underground ends up waiting for the man, and Iggy and the Stooges even stop by to talk about ""Tight Pants"" (a nice touch, considering everyone already knows ""Search and Destroy"" and the other obvious choices). Almost all the big names drop by, save the Talking Heads because Union Square couldn't get them licensed, and the MC5, who never played CBGB's. More importantly, The Birth of U.S. Punk highlights those bands that missed out on the spotlight. The Sonics' rendition of ""Louie Louie"" sounds more like the soundtrack to a slasher pic about a guy named Louie than the Richard Berry original and hits like a train wreck. The original mix of the Dead Boys' explosive ""Sonic Reducer"" and the New York Dolls' ""Trash"" encapsulate the aimless desperation of the mean streets of NYC in convenient three-minute bursts. And after that, there's still Suicide, Johnny Thunders, and Pere Ubu to round out the generally stellar guest list for this little shindig. Too bad being a great album and educating America's Strokaholics don't always coincide, because the interests of serving history have led to the inclusion of a few truly wretched pieces of the curriculum. The Seeds and the Electric Eels may have held some sway in the early days of U.S. punk, but subjecting people to the unrelenting whine of ""Excuse, Excuse"" or ""Agitated,"" respectively, is a lesson this album could live without-- not to mention the single-handed butchering of the Electric Prunes' classic psych nugget ""I Had Too Much to Dream Last Night"" by Wayne County. Some of this is revisionist history, as well, like seeing the 13th Floor Elevators and the Dead Kennedys alongside Television. No disrespect to Jello, but he's more of a by-product of this movement than a cause. The one truly inexplicable decision, though, was not arranging the tracks chronologically. Honestly, that's just retarded. When chronicling the progression of anything, what would possess someone to do it out of order? It's not like you're gonna come up with any kind of cohesion with a compilation. And considering that this information is readily available through obvious sources, Union Square doesn't have much of an excuse. But somehow, even for all of its preventable shortcomings, CBGB's and the Birth of U.S. Punk still holds up pretty well. From the punk ballistics of the Ramones to the minimal hum of Suicide's ""Speed Queen,"" this is where so much of what's out there right now takes root. There's enough soul and fire on this release to gently remind everyone that no matter how much this garage revival looks like a movement, most of the kids are really just going through the motions.","I was sold on the Ramones from the moment Joey first lamented the loss of his girl at the hands ...

It's a clear response to Richie Hawtin's DE9: Close to the Edit, in which Hawtin took a microtome to his collection of minimal techno. Using an advanced piece of software, Hawtin spliced these fragments into a seventy-minute mix of precision aloofness. With Loudboxer, Speedy J seeks to trump Hawtin. Because the constituent tracks are his own, Loudboxer has a compositional unity and a personality that DE9 sorely lacked. The track titles Speedy J has given to Loudboxer are there mainly to signify points of transition, or first instances of introduced sound elements. As is customary, the mix builds in intensity until the halfway point, at which Speedy J offers a brief respite in the form of a mumbled interlude. After that, it's another blast-off into unapologetically muscular techno. Though the overall tenor of Loudboxer is the uncompromised violence of kick drums and searing hi-hat patterns, Speedy J contrasts the percussive thrust with tranquil elements, similar to those he spliced into the outstanding industrial funk of his two previous Novamute albums, Public Energy No. 1 and A Shocking Hobby. But these ambient elements predate J's bangin' style. His albums in Warp's early-90s ""Artificial Intelligence"" series, Ginger and G-Spot, belittled beats in deference to drifting, ambient nebulae; Loudboxer reverses this arrangement. As well as outscoring Hawtin's DE9, Loudboxer also outplays the two volumes of Frankie Bone's Computer Controlled series. For those two releases, Bones came up with his own tracks, cut them onto twelve-inch acetates and mixed them live before a riled-up crowd of Californian ravers. Apart from a minute-long track recorded live, Loudboxer doesn't document the reflective energy of thousands of ecstatic punters. However, the album does offer the listener the high-quality mix CD that techno purists have long suspected Speedy J could deliver. Yet, I must confess I'm disappointed with this release. I had hoped that Speedy J would continue his exploration of cyborg funk, begun with Public Energy No. 1 and furthered and peaked with the mutant beauty of A Shocking Hobby. I trust that Speedy J, satisfied that he's KO'd his labelmate Hawtin, will drop his battle stance and return to his pioneering experimental style.","Loudboxer, Speedy J's third album for Novamute, is essentially a mix CD with a twist: Speedy J (Jochem Paap ...

St. Arkansas,Pere Ubu,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a03013d1975652138311/1:1/w_160/a72ee1d7.jpg,2002-06-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6230-st-arkansas/,spinART,"Some of you might be unaware that Pere Ubu is even a functioning band anymore. Hey, that's understandable; they've kept a low profile stateside for years now, and have been hopping from label to label since their post-hiatus comeback, The Tenement Year saw release on Fontana in 1987. But the truth is they never really went away. They've taken a few multi-year hiatuses, sure-- even gone through more line-up changes than the '87 Indians-- but they've been out there, hitting and missing with a slew of albums since the mid-70s. And if you are haven't been keeping up with Cleveland's finest export since Roberto Alomar then it might surprise you to find out they're still pretty much on top of their game (which you can't say for Alomar). All 14 people who bought their '98 effort Pennsylvania, back me up on this. I too was a Ubu-doubter, believing they'd faded into irrelevance around about 1983, but then I happened upon Griel Marcus' ""Best Albums of '98"" list and found Pennsylvania sitting pretty at #1. I wanted to believe Marcus-- after all, I do stay up late into the night bent over my heavily worn copy of Invisible Republic, peering Kabala-like for eschatological insight and stock market tips, but I must say I was a tad skeptical. Figured Marcus was just putting us on, trying to be difficult and outspoken. Still, the curiosity had me. So after doing some recon, I located a copy of that record in a little shop just south Terre Haute, Indiana, and to my delight I found Marcus' estimation of the album to be pretty freaking accurate. ""Best album of 1998"" is a ridiculous claim, but it's solid straight through and its hermetic vision of the American cultural landscape was novel and pleasantly confounding. It was the kind of album that, had it been a young band's debut, would have caused a much bigger fuss, but as it stood it was an album from a bunch of arty geezers led by a washed-up Beefheart imitator, and so it passed largely unnoticed by the small chunk of listening public that might have possibly cared. Gentlemen, now's your chance to get in on the ground level with the follow-up, St. Arkansas. When ol' Griel releases his Best of 2002 and maybe a dozen people rush to their local wax-monger, you can be all, ""Shit, dude, I've had that album since summer,"" and appear really wise. Mind you, I'm not saying this is the best album of the year-- although, barring the absolutely unexpected, it will race neck-and-neck with Neil Young's Are You Passionate? for worst cover art of the year. They share that first-year Photoshop quality usually reserved for only the best Blue Oyster Cult double live albums on CMC International. As for the music, though, St. Arkansas is roundly excellent, which no one in possession of their critical faculty and any one other Neil Young record can say of Passionate. It's a companion piece of sorts to Pennsylvania and shares much the same vocabulary, though St. Arkansas is the darker of the two. Which is to say, it's more subdued and less rock-oriented, relying more on beat-style spoken-word storytelling and found sound. There are some decently angular post-punk guitar moves here though-- something to show the kids who's boss-- but this incarnation of Pere Ubu relies just as much on its rhythm section. Singer and frontman David Thomas (who somehow finds time to lead this band in addition to running like a bajillion burger joints and also recently dying) is in top form. He sounds less and less like Captain Beefheart as time goes on, and more like what you'd get if Jim Henson had been commissioned to create an animatron android of William S. Burroughs, like for Chuck E. Cheese or something. I realize this description is a bit ambiguous (these supposed to be good qualities?) but so is Thomas' voice-- it can be funny and scary simultaneously, both annoying and enthralling. Exploring the difference between wheezing and whining, sometimes brooding and sometimes absurdly chipper, it's an incredibly expressive instrument. As far as I can tell, St. Arkansas is the complex tale of a sharp-dressed trucker (a ZZ Top fan, one might assume) whose passion in life is the open road. He also has a thing for AM radio that I don't really get; the only good thing I've ever heard on AM was Art Bell and Cincinnati Reds broadcasts, and neither ever offered anything like what I'd call salvation. I can only assume Thomas is talking about some bygone era of AM, maybe the one Jonathan Richman so joyously celebrated in ""Roadrunner."" The tone here is wholly different, though. When Thomas repeats the mantra-like refrain, ""The radio/ AM radio/ Oh, the radio will set you free,"" on album-closing ""Dark,"" it's not a hopeful assurance but rather a mournful, wistful recollection of a promise heard long ago during a simpler, more innocent time. To make a long and oblique story short, the trucker loses his hold on reality, ditches his wife and friends, and drives off a bridge or cliff or something, or maybe into a deep dark forest. It's obvious the songs form some sort of larger narrative, but beyond that, it's hard to know exactly what's happening. There's some water involved, and a ""ring of fire"" he must ""feed,"" and some greasy spoon diner where everyone is welcome. I don't exactly think this was meant to be some sort of mystery to be unlocked like a David Lynch movie. You can have fun trying to figure it all out and connect all the recurring imagery, but likewise, you can just let it roll and enjoy the ride.","Some of you might be unaware that Pere Ubu is even a functioning band anymore. Hey, that's understandable; they ...

A Prayer for Every Hour,Danielson Famile,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a89dc0084474cd0c0e76/1:1/w_160/f7c8ea40.jpg,2002-06-26 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2165-a-prayer-for-every-hour/,Tooth and NailTooth and Nail,"If you're like most Americans your height, you probably fornicate more than you'd like to. Next time you need to ditch a spare mate, toss this afflicted opus into your 85-CD changer. Your partner will first perceive the swirling goulash creeping from your speakers as a vote of confidence: ""Hey, all right-- some purposefully obscure sounds! This ain't no Yo La Tengo date! We're committing carnal sins to some rarities!"" But as soon as Daniel Smith unleashes his voice-- an agitated palsetto that performs spastic cartwheels on the outer rim of aural bearability-- your guest will take the hint, get spooked and pack up, and your night will be stain-free. Ahhh, but now you're alone, and the Smith clan begins to work their way toward your brain like Christian-engineered versions of the parasites in The Wrath of Khan. You could keep your cool through the simple, sweeping rhythm of head-bobber ""Nice of Me,"" which sounds like the pre-looping loopers Silver Apples if they played different instruments. You might even think you've got these guys figured out: it's mid-fi, psych-folk, faux-outsider music, like Johnny Dowd, or the Tinklers, or Jad Fair. Song two, ""Feeling Tank,"" also goes down relatively easy, the closest this record's 71 minutes comes to a singalong. The rest of the album is a shambling, cacophonic, insane, and very original journey through several minty-fresh themes: avoiding physical pain, seeking comfort, suppressing loin-burn, abandoning self-ownership, and fleeing nothingness. Daniel Smith rides both sides of Kierkegaard's seesaw-- dreading the subjugation of your own will to an Other, while simultaneously being grateful for the offload. In one song, God demands ten pushups when Dan ""screws up,"" so Dan offers to do a thousand. In another, someone's funeral is running a bit early, so God ""gets the DJ"" and there's a dance party. This is definitely not the low-frequency ponderance of moral dilemmas a la Pedro the Lion or Starflyer 59, but it ain't white-boy gospel either. Smith's bizarre voice, occasionally multitracked, so consciously pursues caricature that he somehow evades it, ably handling universal tensions with a bluntness that circumvents the ready-set-sincerity of someone like Elliott Smith. Daniel Smith comes across as embattled as the God-wrasslin' poet Gerard Manley Hopkins when he confronts fleshly desires (this album was-- groan-- his thesis at Rutgers). ""God Bless"" is about feeling soiled by ""the everyday,"" and the refrain of ""Burnin' Heart"" is ""I am afraid of sex"" (or is that 'sects'?). On the great ""Be Your Wildman,"" Smith sings with his sisters about where his brains and loins differ, and how he deserves to be ""drop-kicked."" Maybe the high voice is a homage to eunuchs, but I guarantee you've heard nothing like this song. In addition to the theodicy, these songs expand the band's scope. ""Bless"" eventually morphs into a rickety, pre-teen Slint impression; ""Burnin'"" busts into Sonic Youth Group Hayride thrash; and ""Headz"" uses every pedal in the DOD catalog to create a samplable kind of wiggy, avant-""Kumbayah"" dub, complete with dissonant, rubbery Thinking Fellers-style breakdowns. Ultimately, though, this no doubt earnest art project seems like a documentary of an anthropological oddity, a connection made stronger by this re-release's CD-ROM of presentations, performances and videos. Seeing the Danielsons live, with Smith in a trippy, McDonaldland tree costume and his adopted 'siblings' in medical uniforms can fill you with a kind of rapturous spirit, even if the albums don't inspire you to repent. But I can't imagine that anyone will want to replay songs such as the tempoless ""Like a Vacuum,"" which, for all its philosophical lyrical force, trails off, starts over, erupts into tambourine chaos and then into fake laughing (reminiscent of the cackling spirit-moved, truck-hungry, sleep-deprived Christian in the documentary Hands on a Hardbody). You can't drive to the beach to a documentary. You can't even drive to the liquor store pumping this disc. The record's only reward for those who patiently revisit it is an appreciation of Smith's uniqueness. But give the blonde redheads in this Garden State Social Club props for trumping the boredom of status quo American Christianity with their raw-nerve madness. Anybody could have thrown something tinny together, but as the rollicking drums and doom-carnival xylophones of ""In the Malls, Not of Them"" prove, this almost-listenable stuff is meticulously assembled. This family's tradition of having a spontaneous song hour should make anyone who suffered through a standard fundie childhood jealous of their relative culturelessness-- like when your Jewish neighbors went to gymnastics at their community center. Our rec center just gave us tater tots and put on ""Mr. Belvedere."" Though the Danielsons' atmosphere occasionally out-sophisticates their primitivity, this record is a few hinges short. You can tell a person about all the extratextual stuff, get 'em interested and then play the album, but no stereo can equalize it to give it even a toehold on your already-slippery reality. Few albums so aptly yelp, in form and content, ""Up, up, and shirts on. Let's not have sex.""","If you're like most Americans your height, you probably fornicate more than you'd like to.

Ballads,Derek Bailey,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1fb13d197565213876f/1:1/w_160/0ba40131.jpg,2002-06-26 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/530-ballads/,Tzadik,"John Zorn owns Derek Bailey. The poor old guy has enough to deal with-- his jazzbo peers are playing it close to trad bop, and the whippersnappers are either copycats of their elders, or are off on some experimental Klezmer trip-hop tangent. And it's not as if Bailey ever really fit in with jazzbos in the first place, what with the whole idea of 'spontaneous' music and improvising with no preconceived set of parameters, much less precedents. Zorn steps in, makes a few calls, and Bailey ends up playing sets with noisemongers like Ruins, or is somehow booked into sessions making drum-n-bass records, or playing world-funk with Ornette Coleman's bassist. Come on, man, let the guy be! But Bailey has been above and beyond the call of jazz duty for a good 40 years now, and his latest Zorn-provoked project of playing ultra-classy standards might just be the pendant on his spiky-splendored coat of a career. He was playing free jazz in London in the mid-60s with Tony Oxley and Dave Holland (before Miles Davis tasted his first crumpet). He formed renowned Incus Records with Oxley and Evan Parker in the 70s when turning skronk into profit was but a twinkle in Zorn's eye. And he's outlasted all but the most shamelessly devoted to the biz by playing an improvised sound so idiosyncratic it effectively defies analytical criticism. Still, there's something to be said about an old dog, new tricks and a lifetime of artistic expression: Ballads is a remarkable record for Bailey. As on recent efforts such as 2000's Mirakle or 1998's Play Backs, the concept places Bailey in a strange context and observes the outcome. However, instead of putting him in a group or adding strange studio effects, the gimmick here is Bailey's interpretations of classic tunes written by the likes of Hoagy Carmichael and Victor Young. Bailey actually started out playing straight ahead small group jazz in the 50s, so this material isn't actually so far from his palette. Furthermore, his acoustic guitar playing is so delicate and sympathetic to the tunes, it's hard to believe he ever left those old standards behind. Bailey's improvisations here are at once impenetrable and immediately familiar. If you've followed his work, you know that he can make his guitars sound as if they were made only for him, and in this case, he actually went to the trouble of finding one that was ""totally inappropriate for playing standards."" Marc Ribot writes in the liner notes for Ballads that Bailey's playing draws on sources ""far wider than those employed in jazz"" and how his striking sounds ""don't sever the relation of song to improvisation, but [create] deeper, less predictable relations."" This will undoubtedly come down to the listener, as there were definitely a couple of occasions when I lost track of the standard, and slipped into a world completely of Bailey's making. ""Laura"" opens the CD, as Bailey strums light harmonics, and jumps into David Raskin's rather romantic original melody. The guitarist sounds so at home playing the chords that, though he freely mixes in atonal ornaments, it never really sounds juxtaposed. He sometimes settles on angular figures, breaking the romantic mood, but rather than erase the beauty of the melody, he seems to contemplate it, effortlessly letting his mind wander when it will. If you're used to hearing the Wes Montgomery side of things, this will be a bit disorienting. All of the tunes on this set run together, like a stream-of-conscious classic pop revue. Johnny Burke's ""What's New"" is born out of the improvisation from ""Laura,"" passing by so quickly you might miss the melody. Even as it segues into ""When Your Lover Has Gone,"" you might still be reveling in Bailey's forceful free-strum of the previous tune. However, he does come down every now and then to reveal the tune's inherently nostalgic, almost cinematic charm-- only to launch into flighty, jarring figures that wouldn't have sounded out of place on his Ruins albums. This is one of those times you might forget he's playing standards. The most beautiful moments on Ballads come with the completely unexpected instances of clarity in Bailey's improvisations. In ""You Go to My Head,"" after the tune and typically restless commentary, he begins to rest on eerily perfect octaves. Even though he can spend a lifetime following his muse to the chagrin of anyone that ever wanted to break free of convention, Bailey still has the discipline, dedication and love for the sound all around him that he can make simple unison lines speak as resonantly as the most chaotic fanfare of dissonance. Bailey's ability to let the song go where the improvisation takes it-- while resisting the temptation to veer completely off course-- is the mark of a true artist, and Ballads is a fine entryway to the appreciation of Bailey's art.","John Zorn owns Derek Bailey.

"Provisions, Fiction and Gear",Moth,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3cceb335119a49ed7d2/1:1/w_160/47d2e419.jpg,2002-06-26 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5443-provisions-fiction-and-gear/,Virgin,"Moths are so freakin' disappointing. After a lifetime of hardship and struggle, the caterpillar emerges from its cocoon, soaring majestically over all of creation. The world is its oyster, and what does it do? It flies off to the nearest bug-zapper and incinerates itself, or gets eaten by something. There aren't many bigger letdowns in the animal kingdom. With Moth's debut, Provisions, Fiction and Gear, rock imitates life as an album that emerges as a solid, infectious effort, but eventually collapses under its own weight, unable to keep all its stylistic efforts coherent. Moth's basic nature is fairly simple. Bristling, guitar-driven melodies and sometimes-too-cutesy, only slightly irritating vocals are their primary tools for survival, in addition to ex-Rocket From the Crypt drummer Atom Willard's exceptional percussion (and awesome name). However, being clever creatures, Moth camouflages their sound throughout Provisions with plenty of variations on this theme in order to confound potential critics. Constantly alternating between crunchy and smooth, loud and soft, bouncy and sober, the album never sits still long enough to let listeners settle in or second-guess. This sonically varied defense mechanism works to prevent Moth from being easily pigeonholed, but leads to a few forays into some ugly territory. No matter what a person's tastes, it's tough to imagine that anyone will be pleased by every track if taken sequentially. In its larval stage, Moth has a soul of solid pogo punk, which they combine with the brains and sensibilities of art-rockers like Les Savy Fav. Provisions barrels out of the gate with ""I See Sound"" and ""Thinking Please,"" two mighty anthems of pop energy that immediately set a blistering pace. ""Burning Down My Sanity"" really starts to show signs of this entity's development, building slowly on top of a pulsing drum rhythm that absolutely owns your hips until it's punctuated by a Yankee Stadium-sized guitar solo. The faint hint of southern drawl in the vocals gives the song a surreal edge, somewhat akin to the otherworldly experience of watching Ron Popeil hock food dehydrators at four in the morning. At its zenith, Provisions is all set to metamorph into something truly spectacular with ""Lovers Quarrel."" Here, a Merritt-esque song about feelings gets into a fight with a massive, bass-spewing robot, while droning guitars and piano cheer them on. The resulting brawl is the auditory high-water mark, some of the impact of which is lessened with the paranoid schizophrenic ""Cocaine Star"" that immediately follows. A touching tale of love, drug abuse, and snowplow killing sprees, this song and ""Lovers Quarrel"" are like matter and anti-matter colliding. It's a jarring, not-altogether-pleasant experience, but the resulting emission of rock power is still pretty impressive. Like a gyroscope faltering before completely losing its axis, Moth now puts on the air brakes and steers Provisions directly into the ground. I might be exaggerating a bit-- the last three tracks aren't really awful; they just let the upbeat, slightly absurdist tone that works so well in the earlier tracks fall by the wayside. No, wait, that's not entirely true either. ""Straight Line"" is pretty damn bad-- if you check, you might be able to find it in heavy rotation on KSUK 66.6 bookended by the latest Papa Roach single, ""We're Rich and It's All Your Fault (Verizon Wireless Mix),"" and the Enrique Iglesias hit, ""I'm Talentless (No Tengo Ning√∫n Talento)."" Also, the chorus to ""Not Really"" reminds me so much of the opening seconds of ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" that it triggers eighth-grade Wayne's World acid flashbacks. (Queen, from Lucifer's heart, I stab at thee!) In and of themselves, these closing tracks are semi-palatable, but together they're truly hard to stomach. There's a lot to like about this album, and these guys might have what it takes to make it in the wild somewhere on down the line. But for now, like their ill-fated namesake, Moth's Provisions, Fiction and Gear moves into the light just when it finally starts to get somewhere. I couldn't bring myself to downgrade it too harshly since most of the album is pretty enjoyable, but be warned: this album is all over the place. If you're like me-- and for your sake, I hope not-- you hate disappointment, and Moth's debut never quite finishes what it starts.","Moths are so freakin' disappointing.

The Egg,Shiner,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3cec0084474cd0c034b/1:1/w_160/fad8a9e0.jpg,2002-06-26 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7111-the-egg/,DeSoto,"Hey, everybody-- it's summertime! Time for puppy dogs playing in the grass, sundresses billowing in the breeze and discreetly trying to air the sweat off your back when you enter your air-conditioned workplace. Oh, and did I mention the rock? You gotta have a soundtrack for your summer, and like Bob Seger, you gots to have some kind of music that just soothes your soul. By coincidence, I just happen to be holding a copy of The Egg, the fourth album from Kansas City's Shiner. Sounds groovy, crank it! Ummm, wait a second here. This music isn't groovy at all. Well, it's got some neat grooves, but they're better for contemplating the shiny edges of razor blades than for driving around with the windows down. Time to look around for some info. What's that? This record came out last winter? You're kidding me! Anyway, it seems like Shiner and the good folks at DeSoto had the right time all picked out to release an album like this: late November 2001, in the height of seasonal affective disorders, anthrax paranoia, and gloomy, grey weather presiding over stark, bare trees. Not that you couldn't listen to The Egg in any given month-- it's just best suited to the time of year when the days are short and brutishly cold. The band doesn't waste any time letting you know where they're coming from, opening with the harsh, heavy salvo of ""The Truth About Cows,"" a ragged slough through the sludgy bog of post-grunge. It's the kind of stuff that major label A&R; has been cleaning up for mass consumption since 1994, only played with more authenticity and feeling than the schlock-angst posterboys of Creed and 3 Doors Down could ever muster. Needless to say, this stuff sounds a lot better when it's dirty and raw, and Shiner's six-string bloodletting beats the crap out of anything you'll hear on commercial FM these days. A large part of what makes Shiner's sound so visceral and engaging is the production work of ex-Jawbox guitarist and Burning Airlines CEO J Robbins, who keeps things distinct, but exceptionally jagged. He lends the pitch-black doom-rock of ""Spook the Herd"" and ""Stoner"" an austere, rough-edged sound that drives them straight home with no detours. The crunch of the bass on the mathy and Jawbox-esque ""Surgery"" alone makes the song an engaging listen, but the interplay of the chorused guitars on top uses it as a remarkably effective springboard for even more compelling guitar leads and interlocking rhythms. That black-eye bass tone is at the root of several of the album's most successful rockers, including the excellent title track, with its vaulting melody and frenetic drum pattern. The guitars play it clean most of the time, making it all the more effective when the distortion kicks in for a chorus or the coda. The end of ""Play Dead"" employs this dynamic particularly well, as sheets of distortion bring the song crashing to a close. Despite the band's efficiency with their hard-rock bread and butter, they're at their most interesting when they deviate from it, as they do for the appropriately icy ""The Top of the World."" You get the impression that this is what Shiner might sound like if Jonny Greenwood got his hands on them, as it basically sounds like a normal Shiner song collapsed into a bed of thumping rhythms, slow-motion music boxes and oozing guitar noise. The bass throbs and smears while vocalist Allen Epley lets his vocals slide dejectedly into the mix. More interesting, though, is ""The Simple Truth,"" which opens with fractured bass and drum rhythms under pulsing guitars and breaks down into a long, spooky coda full of vibes, synth washes and ghostly guitar accents. The instrumental ""Andalusia"" sends swelling synths into orbit around a stuttering rock axis, giving Shiner a chance to display some of their impressive chops without stepping into an all-out wankfest. If there's a criticism you could level at Shiner, it's perhaps that despite the obvious attempts to diversify their sound, they still come off a little monochromatic-- their brand of precise, jagged rock can get a little numbing. Otherwise, Shiner are a pretty good bet if you're looking for some dark, rough post-grunge to accompany your allotted brooding time. Just don't come looking for sunshine. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to blow the table fan in my cubicle up my shirt sleeves.","Hey, everybody-- it's summertime!

Last Clouds,Mirza,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c35713d197565213bcf7/1:1/w_160/89bb7fdc.jpg,2002-06-25 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5333-last-clouds/,Ba Da Bing,"By now, the circumstances regarding the recording of Last Clouds have reached the level of myth. For a week beforehand the band slept little, instead embarking on an epic binge fueled by psychotropic drug consumption. Trailing off into hazy waking periods filled with lucid dreams, the musicians prepped themselves for the approaching chaos. On the eve of the first night, a torrential thunderstorm arose, leaving the four landlocked in the studio amidst reports of flash floods and hail. And after the tumultuous sessions, during which their producer collapsed in a nervous breakdown, an accident in the factory caused the vinyl lacquer to catch fire, torching most of the machinery and all but roughly 100 of the press run. It seems the gods themselves had conspired to destroy Mirza's extraordinary epic. Okay, so none of the above is true. But if you have even a trace of drool dangling from your lips, you've been diagnosed with obsessive collector's syndrome. The fetish for owning racks of rare records seems even less justified in these Internet days, when digital media pretty much ensures that a copy of just about any piece of music will live on in some form. So you've got to wonder about the merits of any rarities collection-- does the material stand on its own as art, apart from the needs of sonic anthropology? Case in point: Last Clouds, which actually collects a hard-to-find twelve-inch released by Mirza on their own label Autopia back in 1996, along with other previously unreleased jams. Critics have been calling it the finest document of the now-defunct band, but the lo-fi noodling here smells a bit more like leftovers. Mirza's four members included Glenn Donaldson on guitar and Steven Smith on drums, both of whom now feature prominently in California's Jewelled Antler collective. Unlike the careful cadences of their work as Thuja, Mirza was all about loud, psychedelic rock. The disc kicks off with ""Nostalgia,"" which accurately characterizes the feeling invoked as an epic peal of guitar suddenly bursts from the two-minute build. The doorbell buzz of the bass guides the flight back down to a bed of cymbal crashes. Echoes of Thuja can be heard on ""Charity,"" which moves at a slower, blissed-out cruise. Donaldson drops ringing stalactites from his guitar, lulling the listener before the amped-up end section. It glows like Mogwai's deceivingly contented moments, or even the Smashing Pumpkins' old live jams. The first four songs (which comprised the original EP) were recorded on 8-track, bringing a satisfactory level of detail as well as the appropriately rough edges. ""East,"" in particular, doesn't suffer at all-- the heavy pedal-fed guitar lines spiral around and around and eventually converge in cacophony. But the other seven tracks are basically a handful of improvisations recorded on 2-track cassette between 1995 and 1998. They're all extremely visceral and energizing, but the sound quality is poor and the atmosphere isn't much different from a Cul de Sac album. Again, beneath all the fuzz and strange time signatures, this is essentially rock music, and you can expect each song to end in a freakout. It's the ambling along the way that makes things interesting, as with the ghost-in-the-machine feedback on ""Pomegranate"" and the orange swaths of distortion colored by the tunings on ""Dust Crushed from a Moth."" I'm most fascinated by ""Acts/Volcano of Birds,"" which seems to be two separate sections conjoined by tape edit. The first absolutely blisters out of the speakers like a bizarre take on hardcore punk, or an attempt at covering To Live and Shave in L.A. Still, eleven solid instrumentals won't make it to the top of many wishlists. A lot of the musicians reading right now have probably done similar things in the studio and aren't rummaging through practice tapes looking to release a compilation. Last Clouds will be a nice treat for psych-rock completists, but improv purists and others curious are encouraged to move right on to Thuja's two amazing albums. Another option would be Steven R. Smith's recent solo album Lineaments, where the soundscapes are tempered by a greater degree of patience and silence.","By now, the circumstances regarding the recording of Last Clouds have reached the level of myth.

Murray Street,Sonic Youth,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4bdc0084474cd0c0567/1:1/w_160/6614ec74.jpg,2002-06-25 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7343-murray-street/,Geffen,"Meet Jeremy. Jeremy likes Sonic Youth. His favorite album by the Youth is Goodbye 20th Century, their self-released cover album of avant-garde works by various modern classical composers. The CDs currently in his five-disc changer are Shalabi's St-Orange, Xiu Xiu, Merzbow, the Boredoms, and Fennesz. Meet Erica. Erica likes Sonic Youth. Her favorite album by the Youth is Dirty, the band's most direct flirtation with mainstream rock. The CDs currently in Erica's five disc-changer are the Breeders, Blonde Redhead, Wilco, Neutral Milk Hotel, and Sleater-Kinney. Oversimplified personifications? Sure, but chances are, if you're a fan of the twenty-year-old Sonic Youth franchise, you probably exist at some point on a continuum between my little creations above. The band itself has been running a zig-zag pattern on the same scale its entire existence, constantly oscillating between their art-noise laboratory and major-label rock band personae while covering all points in between. As a result, you don't see the Jeremies and Ericas of the world coming together over a single Sonic Youth record too often-- if one is jammin', the other's likely scoffin' or wincin'. Not since the sprawling Daydream Nation (and arguably, its predecessor and follow-up) have the two been able to slow-dance to the same song collection. Movie Trailer Voiceover Guy: ""Until now...!"" Yup, Murray Street is Sonic Youth's first successful convergence of envelope-pushing guitarwork and accessible songery since 1988. I'm smart enough to not go too far down the dead-end alleyway of Daydream Nation comparisons, but I'll admit it reminds me a helluva lot of that masterwork-- more so than any of their records between then and now. And I don't think it's coincidental that the two albums showcase a band more relaxed than elsewhere, letting songs stretch out to their maximum length while still coming back for a singalong-able section or two. As everyone probably expected, that whole 'this is our classic rock album' gambit was a big goof. While the band's new quintet structure offers the potential for some Skynyrd-style three-guitar freakouts, the guys and gal limit themselves to the occasional old-school namedrop (Lou Reed, ""Tiny Dancer"") and a handful of FM-ready riffs. No, Sonic Youth still sounds like good ol' Sonic Youth, albeit with a focus on melodic improvisation only rarely heard before. If the band is revealing its roots to any oldies act, it's to Lee Ranaldo's long-cherished Grateful Dead. Three tracks here run long-distance events in the six-to-nine-minute range, and one (Ranaldo's ""Karen Revisited"") rides a long ambient section all the way up to 11:00. Sonic Youth's always had long songs, but not too many that stay as tightly focused and listenable as these; they're finally capitalizing on the jammy possibilities suggested by ""The Diamond Sea."" ""Rain on Tin,"" for example, gets the singing over with in a hurry and dwells mostly on long, instrumental passages that intertwine the three guitars like a fourth-grader braiding friendship bracelets. Importantly, these astral flights are usually filling in the space around semi-traditional song structures, avoiding the spoken-word incantations and directionless instrumentals of recent albums on both DGC and SYR imprints. If vocal duties can be considered representative of songwriting leadership, it's Thurston Moore who's leading the charge here, as he takes the mic on more than half of Murray Street's songs. His twisty ""The Empty Page"" and spooky ""Disconnection Notice"" are certainly no new directions for the lankiest man in rock and roll, but offer up foundations as exciting to hear as the unscripted passages. Kim Gordon's contributions, meanwhile, are curiously backloaded to the end of the album-- a sequencing that would have been merciful on the last few albums, but is surprisingly unnecessary for the double shot of goodness found here. ""Plastic Sun,"" which may or may not be about Britney Spears (have we forgotten our Madonna fetish, Youthies?), packs more rhythmic punch than anything since the ""Eliminator Jr."" portion of ""Trilogy."" Likewise, her ""Sympathy for the Strawberry"" hits slow-motion crescendos as bombastic as Godspeed, with a mere fraction of the personnel. The centerpiece, ""Karen Revisited,"" finds Ranaldo again claiming his crown as the band's best hook-writer before exploding into ultraviolet feedback-- a segment that'll have Jeremy doing cartwheels, but'll have Erica jumping for the fast-forward button. And then, there's Jim O'Rourke. Ahhh, Jim; say what you will about the guy, but he's now worked his mysterious influence over not one, but two of the year's finest albums (and it's only June)-- I fully expect him to announce production duties on some kind of afterworld-bridging Beatles reunion any day now. It's hard to tell exactly what he's doing or playing on Murray Street, but for the stop/start bassline of ""The Empty Page"" alone he's a valuable addition. Hardcore fans may resist his presence like baseball traditionalists despise interleague play, but Murray Street is good enough to mercifully displace memories of the band's wobbly first steps with the omnipresent O'Rourke on NYC Ghosts & Flowers. At the very least, the perplexing twenty-years-along addition of a fifth member seems to have given the Youth just the kick in the ass they needed to stop making merely good albums that hit with segments of the fan population and get back to making great ones that resonate with everybody. Journalistic integrity aside, it gives me great pleasure to be able to like a new Sonic Youth album without having to force it, and to finally give their back catalog a nice, long rest. You can bet your hat there's gonna be Jeremies who say Murray Street isn't far-out enough, and Ericas who would prefer the band kept things under four minutes, but a whole lot of in-between folk are going to be pleased as punch with the results.","Meet Jeremy.

Nashville,Various Artists,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a134ea9e61561daa4746/1:1/w_160/e0912418.jpg,2002-06-25 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1938-nashville/,Mint,"Tribute albums are a funny business. In a best-of-all-possible-worlds scenario, the tribute album can be mutually beneficial for both artists and the industry. They theoretically allow artists the ability to both honor their influences and appear more musically sophisticated. If you're unable to appear on a tribute album for a highly obscure, yet supposedly seminal Danish psychedelic band, you have to go out of your way to find the most obscure song ever recorded by the recognizable band you're covering. Labels, in the meantime, reap the benefits of audience identification with both the coverer and the coveree. Strictly hypothetical example being: ""People love Tom Petty. People love Incubus. If Incubus also happens to love Tom Petty, we may be able to move some serious units."" Mint Records' recent Nashville tribute targets diehard fans of both Robert Altman and Neko Case. And, just so you know, all twelve of them have already purchased this record and cancelled their Short Cuts screening party to write poison pen letters to me at first sight of that 5.9 (never fear-- I'm a fan of both Robert Altman and Neko Case. I'll be nice, I promise). It's not a particularly intimidating demographic. Nashville is a brilliant film, featuring a superior script and a fairly astonishing ensemble cast. It's one of the best films of the 1970s-- a decade synonymous with great filmmaking-- and I don't think I'd be overstating if I called it a classic of American cinema. In spite of (or perhaps because of) its reputation, I didn't get around to seeing it until just last year; it didn't change my life or anything, but I liked it. So, I can't exactly hold it against you if you haven't rushed out to the local Pic-A-Flic to rent this musical/comedy/satire tour de force about politics and country music. Mint Records' tribute is an almost perfect replica of the movie's soundtrack, with the artists on the album playing the part of the actors singing as their characters from the film. In the filming of Nashville, Altman gave each of the actors the opportunity to write their own songs for the characters they portrayed. On the tribute, Canadian alt.country performer Carolyn Mark doled out the songs to her circle of friends and/or Mint labelmates. On Mint Records' Nashville, the part of sleazy, self-righteous town greeter Henry Haven (originally played and subsequently sung by Henry Gibson) is sung by both Dave Lang (the preachy, hilariously maudlin ""For the Sake of the Children"") and Dave Gowans (the jingoistic bicentennial tune ""200 Years""). Both do a competent job emulating the smarm factor in Gibson's original delivery. Like most of this album, there's not a considerable amount of originality in the Mint artists' versions versus the original. It's not a completely re-envisioned album, it's just Nashville replayed by a bunch of Canadians and a couple New Pornographers (note, however, that New Pornographer Carl Newman's ""Memphis"" is not among the album's high points). Neko Case does a fine job with ""Rolling Stone,"" eclipsing Karen Black's original by sheer vocal power alone. Likewise, Carolyn Mark's renditions of the Ronee Blakley numbers (""My Idaho Home"" and ""One, I Love You"") romp all over the original material. But outside of stirring up interest for an admittedly good movie, and occasional moments of stellar vocal work, I can't really figure out why one would want to buy this album on its own merits. Even the original soundtrack (found on vinyl with some ease at many friendly neighborhood Goodwills for about a dollar, give or take some scratches), removed from the film, is little more than a novelty piece. Nashville is a non-linear sort of musical, so you can't exactly follow the story by ear alone the way you could, say, Oklahoma. Maybe all those Altman/Neko Case fans will eat it up, but I'm holding out for the Drag City tribute to Gosford Park.","Tribute albums are a funny business.

Dyed in the Wool,Shannon Wright,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa769d034d5c69bf3e52/1:1/w_160/1c88ad04.jpg,2002-06-24 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8744-dyed-in-the-wool/,Touch and GoQuarterstick,"Shannon Wright's music is defined by a number of unchanging elements: a tremulous, bellowing voice, melodramatic lyrics, and disquieted, impatient orchestration. It's an edgy enough sound she's procured, and she deserves her share of props for solid execution. Despite owning the trademark sound, though, Wright does blend quite appropriately into the clich√©d pantheon of bitter songstresses (a la Fiona Apple without the collagen, or Tori Amos without the mental instability and drag-queen mascara). Despite Wright's dispossession, she is by no means without a home. Undoubtedly, there's a place in this world for her, and to some ears, I'm certain Dyed in the Wool is sheer (shear?) brilliance. These people are likely those who empathize with Wright's self-conscious acrimony and enjoy marinating in other peoples' distress or wallowing in their own. So, as you might imagine, Wright delivers some pretty thick lyrics. On ""A Vessel for a Minor Malady,"" for example, Wright yelps: ""There's no cure so why should I care/ You have fled into this blackness/ Ir this sling I must contain."" There's plenty of that sort of dense, oblique poeticism in effect on just about every track, but it's balanced with more direct stuff, like on ""Hinterland"": ""Hinterland, I shall descend/ Hinterland, I crumble within."" As long as the very mention of the word ""hinterland"" doesn't make you retch, and you can get past the 'descending/crumbling' metaphor this song shares with so much high school poetry, you may enjoy Dyed ir the Wool. Perhaps too much. As for orchestration, Shannon Wright has definitely found the formula to match her attitude. The music mimics the dramatic effect of the lyrics, painting bleak, uneasy portraits of distance and resentment. Minor key piano vamps and mournful string accompaniments are especially prominent, as are guitars-- both acoustic and electric, either arpeggiating chords or providing shrill melody with treble up the ass. Wright's backing band (including members of Rachel's, the Rock A Teens, the Boxhead Ensemble, and Edith Frost) actually does a fine job, and with the engineering assistance of Andy Baker and Steve Albini, the overall sound is solid and striking, albeit not exactly soothing to the ears (it's fair to say that the music here is 'difficult,' even while the lyrics are most certainly not). The axis on which this album turns likely rests in your brain. Do you buy the schtick? The melodrama, I mean. Do you empathize with Wright's pain? Are her lyrics convincing to you? Can you handle high notes with maximum vibrato? Perhaps more importantly, have you recently been used by an asshole with a Y chromosome? Answer 'yes' to a few of these questions, and you may have yourself a winner. For a good chunk of humanity, though, this album is just as likely to be frustrating as it is therapeutic.","Shannon Wright's music is defined by a number of unchanging elements:\r\n\ a tremulous, bellowing voice, melodramatic lyrics ...

Feel,Nagisa Ni Te,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c392eb335119a49ed73e/1:1/w_160/c6673167.jpg,2002-06-24 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5698-feel/,Jagjaguwar,"What's the difference between psych-rock in 1967 and 2002? It's the drugs, man. Chiefly, the folks who used to trip the visions fantastic via brown ones and orange ones have mellowed out on a cannabis tip. Freak-outs have been replaced by blissful highs, and acid flameouts like Brian Wilson's and Syd Barrett's have been replaced by stoner warlocks like Yume Bitsu and Richard Youngs. Or, if the hemp weed isn't your thing, just try slacking a bit more and take it easy. Today's psychedelic experience is peace, love and very, very slow tempos. And it can be a beautiful thing, brother. Nagisa Ni Te is the main event for Japanese hippie-titan and Org Records head Shinji Shibayama. Shibayama's been at it since the 1980s, when he started playing hyped up dada-psych with Idiot O'Clock and the more toned-down Hallelujahs. Well before mystic folk became fodder for VW commercials, Shibayama was conjuring up the spirits of Tim Buckley and Tim Hardin to the delight of the Japanese psychedelic scene. Nagisa Ni Te carries on that tradition, opting for natural highs and frequent moments of na√Øvet√© via slightly out-of-tune vocals and perfectly amateur acoustic guitar dedications. Shibayama started the band as a solo venture, but has gradually included his girlfriend Takeda Masako and various percussionists, as well as working with members of Eastern psych powers Maher Shalal Hash Baz. Feel is the band's fourth album, and is generally a step in a clearer direction, even if its relative clarity never really threatens to push the music into mainstream realms. The instrumentation is quite full, featuring guitar, percussion, classic Leslie organ and group vocals to emphasize general communal harmony. All of the lyrics are ir Japanese, and all of the songs are very slow, so any disorienting sensations you experience here might be due to more than just the forest green haze (which radiates not just from the rather gorgeous cover). Opening epic ""The New World"" starts things with a brief brainfreeze, as feedback guitar and backwards cymbals introduce a very earnest ballad-dirge. Pixie-vocalist Masako carries the solemn tune, as Shibayama strums his guitar and provides distant backing vocals. The prevailing mood is quite close to low-key Sigur R√≥s, or any number of symphonic post-Floyd balladeers. Masako never even attempts to inject any extraneous passion into the song, and comes across as being completely content to drag alongside her partner in carefree melancholy. When the mellotron strings come in, things take a turr for the spacey, but the fact remains this is pretty peaceful stuff. ""Strength of the Wind"" pulls out all the retro stops, pumping up the mandolin and Leslie switches to summon the ghosts of the Small Faces and The Band, while simultaneously staying true to Nagisa Ni Te's folkish roots. This time, Shibayama takes the lead, and his modest tenor is a bit more confident, though never more aggressive than a child of nature should be. It's still a dirge, and when the ocarina comes in, straight out of Sherwood Forest, medieval chanson becomes the mode of choice. The backing vocals are still quite thick, and though the clear stereo separation betrays the modern recording, this tune could have been performed exactly as it appears here any time ir the last 35 years. Since most of the tunes share the same basic feeling of molasses-lader harmony, small variations tend to stick out. ""Morning Glory"" plays up the haunting triangle resonance and the elastic slide-guitar accompaniment; ""Speed of Fish,"" featuring the Boredoms' Seiichi Yamamoto on 'seaweed guitar,' emphasizes the pattering percussion and ambient overtones floating around the band. Closer ""Stars"" features a full ensemble of dual drummers, guitars, piano, mandolin and Leslie organ, and is probably the closest to an uplifting anthem as you'll find on Feel. Shibayama sings of the ""ancient light of stars"" and ""gazing at the retreating sail"" of some distant ship over music that is emotional without ever becoming maudlin. Reference points might be solo George Harrison or, again, Sigur R√≥s or early Small Faces, but the story is the same: benign psych-folk can cure your ills, and if it doesn't, at least it's got a shot at curing your insomnia. That's not an insult, but you should know Nagisa Ni Te are quite comfortably numb.","What's the difference between psych-rock in 1967 and 2002? It's the\r\n\ drugs, man. Chiefly, the folks ...

On,Imperial Teen,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b956ea9e61561daa6f88/1:1/w_160/8bd5d998.gif,2002-06-24 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4082-on/,Merge,"No matter how hard the Powers That Be might try to suppress it, the desolate nighttime streets of suburbia will always echo with music-- just as sure as they will never truly be desolate. After all, what's a suburb without a legion of teenagers cruising the well-trimmed boulevards-- numbed by boredom, aimless but intent, their windows rolled down and their stereos cranked to overcome the rushing noise of the wind hitting their faces? Imperial Teen sound a lot like those suburban young'uns: aimless but intent, satisfied with what they've got but longing for more. And though they haven't gone so far as to tell me so, it seems to me that they really want is to be the band blasting on repeat from some trapped teen's crappy stereo. They make music that's devoid of purpose and they're proud of it. Just like The Big Lebowski's would-be nihilists and that dude with the mohawk that hangs in front of the White Hen smoking cloves, Imperial Teen want you to believe they don't give a shit about anything, but something about the delivery-- be it a glint in the eye or a hint of fire in the vocals-- betrays them. The upbeat opener to On, the third record from ex-Faith No More keyboardist Roddy Bottum and friends, is a fast-paced ditty with a racing bassline complimented by simple, subtle guitar and female ""doo-be-doo's."" All four band members-- two girls, two guys-- trade off the lead vocals, each with a different take on the same quick, breathy delivery. It's a race to the finish that sets a tone of urgency and import for the album that follows. Which is funny, because Imperial Teen spend most of On indulging a near-fatal case of apathy-- the kind that anyone whose formative years were spent wasting away in suburbia will know all too well. Like the legions of lackadaisical teenagers wandering the fake neor streets, Imperial Teen is fed up to the point of madness with the seeming inconsequentiality of it all, yet comforted by the predictability and ease of suburban malaise. A recurring theme of impassivity manifests itself again and again in lines like, ""Those who I speak of are my friends/ Gentlemen and gentlewomen/ Can't wait for their lives to begin/ Oh so exciting then."" There's also a hint of uncertainty in the delivery-- or maybe it's a sarcastic nudge-- that suggests this scenario is more thar a little familiar to the members of Imperial Teen. On is filled with stories of people waiting for their lives to begin, about people too busy doing nothing to do much of anything, too content with the pointless parts of day-to-day life to seek an overall purpose. The band adds yet another layer of irony by employing upbeat, catchy-as-they-come melodies to these detached, dogged narrations. The band's sound hasn't changed much since 1999's What Is Not to Love, save the addition of a few acoustic guitars and drum machines. Imperial Teen is still all about the upbeat melodies, the Pixies-flavored basslines, lots of backup female vocal harmonizing, and lustful, throaty vocals that border on self-parody. But it's effective, and the able production by Anna Waronker (ex-That Dog) and Steve McDonald (Redd Kross) beefs up the sugary tightness of their sound. While much of the album leans toward typical rock song clich√©s (songs about wanting someone, losing someone, or loving someone) there are moments where uncertainty comes into play. Like any young, wistful suburbanite, Imperial Teen find themselves perplexed and intrigued by sex and issues of sexuality, and they take a small bit of pride ir their confusion. On ""Million $ Man,"" a self-proclaimed perfect catch reads off a list of accomplishments and wonders why he's alone; or ""My Spy"" Schwartz delivers lines like, ""We are partners in crime/ You're always the bride.../ You don't have to decide until it's light,"" and, ""You're dating boys but you have a girlfriend on the side."" The only true passion here is for apathy itself. On ""Captain,"" Schwartz & Co. simultaneously reject both the importance of the world around them and the possibility of success and fame as a music-making unit, matter-of-factly stating, ""On the possibility/ Of us making history/ Let the captain choose the teams/ I'm not as worried as I seem."" Sure, we've all heard a thousand songs like these before, but Imperial Teen aren't about innovation; they're about appreciating the ordinary, even as you long for something more. There are no bells and whistles here; no lyrics of colossal world-shattering importance. Yet On succeeds not in spite of its simplicity, but because of it. Imperial Teen are happy with what they do, they're good at it. It's fulfilling for them, yet they're too human not to long for something more. This is music best suited for drive-thru drive-throughs and unchanging landscapes of strip malls and condos. Or better yet, for lying in the last pure patch of undeveloped land left in your suburban wasteland of choice, staring at the stars and pondering your own inability to do anything about the forward march of progress.","No matter how hard the Powers That Be might try to suppress it, the\r\n\ desolate nighttime streets of ...

Textstar,Farben,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd50eb335119a49ece5a/1:1/w_160/005671fe.jpg,2002-06-24 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2993-textstar/,Klang Elektronik,"Farben (German for 'colors') is a poetic moniker for a Berlin's Jan Jelinek, because he claims to be influenced more by painting than music. It's not hard to imagine Jelinek's music as the aural equivalent of a Rothko canvas-- clear geometric structure made soft and ambiguous through warm tone, blurred hue, and an exacting sense of detail. As Jelinek has made albums under his own name and as Gramm (derived from 'kilogram'), he's continued to release EPs under the name Farben, and the good folks at Klang Elektronik have been kind enough to collect some of highlights as Textstar. This nine-track CD draws material from the EPs Farben Featuring the Dramatics, Beutone, Raw Macro, and Farben Says: Don't Fight Phrases. An expanded vinyl set called Starbox contains all the original EPs, complete with a total of six tracks not on the CD. Yet, despite this being a collection of material from previous releases, Jelinek's sonic style is so distinct and consistent that Textstar feels like a singular work. The borders are porous, but generally speaking, Jelinek uses Farben to represent his most upbeat, danceable music, the stuff that would fit nicely under the heading 'microhouse.' Most of the tracks here have a house foundation, usually a sub-bass kick drum deep enough to blow the speakers in Luke Skyywalker's Jeep paired with a high-hat cast from a tiny scrape of static. The tracks have a structure much closer to pop music than Jelinek's later work, with variations that seem analogous to the verse/chorus/bridge/chorus template, and short melodic phrases that could be best described as riffs. Tying it all together is a supremely dubby production philosophy, where each sound is endlessly tweaked and filtered until it serves the overall design of the track. Despite the consistently bare-bones approach of the sound, Jelinek always keeps things interesting. He has an uncanny ability to make a handful of sounds do an enormous about of work. Rhythmic, textural and melodic elements are handled by an array of squelches, clicks, and washes, all anchored by wall-rattling bass. The instruments are juggled into compositions that seem constantly in motion. Unlike an artist such as SND, Jelinek's songs are loose, wet, rubbery and unpredictable, unfolding according to some odd internal logic. Take ""Beautone."" After an intro comprised of a slightly awkward rhythm tapped on a virtual woodblock, a commanding house beat takes over. The bass is a squelchy 303 that seems to be running in unpredictable circles around the programming, and the chords just might be the ghosts of some Hammond organ Jelinek pulled off one of his jazz records. A couple of minutes in, a sample of an easy-listening wash of strings and flute punctuates the chorus, providing the track with a disorienting and humorous twist that nonetheless seems like it was designed to fit into this precise spot. Another dizzying but funky track is ""Live at the Sahara Tahoe, 1973"" (titled after the Isaac Hayes live LP). Several elements each seem to be keyed into their own separate, but complimentary rhythms: a churning synth loop and sampled cymbal lag slightly behind the crisp beat; an electro-inspired breakdown of faint laser-gun sounds repeats for two bars and never returns; a gorgeous orchestral sample, heavily processed and seemingly beamed in from another dimension, forms the track's emotional core. By contrast, ""Farben Says: So Much Love"" is Jelinek at his sleekest and most elegant. The deep, sensual bass hammers home an elastic riff of pure technofunk, and the microscopic high-hat is like the smallest possible unit of what can be considered a sound. Between these sonic poles is an ever-shifting pool of warm chords, off-beat, jazz-inspired rhythm accents executed on glitchy percussion, and a sexy, whispered female voice saying something about getting a haircut. Textstar is a sonic feast if you want to dissect the myriad timbres and underlying structure, but you'll probably just want to turn off your mind and dance. And that's alright. Either way, it's clear that Jelinek is one of the most inventive producers working in this field today. This compilation is a must-own.","Farben (German for 'colors') is a poetic moniker for a Berlin's Jan Jelinek, because he claims to be influenced ...

Tremulant EP,The Mars Volta,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3b9ea9e61561daa7fb7/1:1/w_160/5ed075e2.jpg,2002-06-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5116-tremulant-ep/,Gold Standard Laboratories,"""Three tracks. Seven dollars."" As a dirt poor student, the thought stung like hornets chasing the half-melted Big Kat bar in my cargo shorts. Would the CD contain a coupon for a free egg at the local Faberge Hut? Was it hand-etched? I sighed. One of the greatest triumphs (indirectly) of the Industrial Revolution had been that, thanks to the wonders of mass-production, I never had to pay more than, like, $1.50 per song-- until today. Staring at the seven-dollar EP I held in my hands made that bygone era of child-labor, workplace fatalities, and people who lit cigars with C-notes (like the Monopoly Guy) seem like a wonderful, wonderful pipe dream. Audiogalaxy! Why hast thou forsaken me in my hour of need? But, as the old saying goes, ""A fool and his money are soon parted for the new Tremulant EP by The Mars Volta."" As I put down the greenbacks, these guys-- including Cedric Bixler and Omar Rodriguez of At the Drive-In fame-- instantly had one strike against them. I'll be honest. If the album sucked, paying seven dollars for three tracks would make it suck so much harder, and even if it were really good-- $2.33 per song good-- three tracks would just be a tease. I tossed and turned all night, imagining Bixler & Co. having a friendly cash fight in their McDuck-like vaults, but then figured that if that were the case, they'd have been able to afford decent haircuts by now. Regardless, my expectations for this disc were high. Skepticism struck first, but luckily, the thrashing, distorted guitar lacerations and numbing, effects-driven interludes on Tremulant form a pretty convincing counter-argument. The influence of At the Drive-In is immediately evident, unsurprisingly, and The Mars Volta seems to pick up where their old band left off. Gone are previous missteps like the awkward spoken-word beat poetry jams and all-out howling Bixler has been so prone to in days past, distilling their sound to its most brutal immediacy. Ironically, The Mars Volta has a leaner, meaner edge despite the fact that almost half of this album's nineteen minutes are spent on aimless, noodling instrumental segments. Funny enough, these have been touted as ""free-jazz entropy"" and ""like Can"" by the label's website, so logic says I, a contemporary indie thug, should like them. Maybe even more than the other stuff. But nope, you read right: aimless, noodling. I mean that. Aside from the two minutes of straight tape hiss that start the disc, ""Cut That City"" and ""Concertina"" manage to keep the solo-type material presentable, although the final minutes of ""Eunuch Provocateur"" nearly enter the dreaded realm of jam-band jackin' around. The guitar interaction in these tripped-out effect-storms is often interesting and complex, and they're actually just fine within the scope of this EP, but they could easily drain all the vitality from the EP if it weren't for Jon Theodore's absolutely stellar drum work. Even when Tremulant seems lost in a mire of screeching distortions and echo-pedaling, a constant undercurrent of desperate urgency is preserved by the frantic drive of Theo's shifting tempos. The musical intensity is matched capably by Bixler's vocals, which have wisely been somewhat reined in; it's like having all the intensity of At the Drive-In with 20% less pretense. He gives an impressive performance, but it's what he's saying that makes Tremulant really shine. The content of the EP has a surprisingly global feel to it, and is a drastic departure from the personal trials and tribulations that formed the basis of his prior work. In just three songs, topics range from urban stagnation to personal betrayal to political upheaval, while Bixler drops fifty-cent words like Martha Stewart's stockbroker on an inside-tip selling spree. The strangely stream-of-consciousness composition makes phrases like ""The labefaction is venal"" and ""Neo-Caesaristic phallic ruins"" sound like excerpts from an unpublished Burroughs cut-ups project or a Mensa Mad Libs party, but amazingly, it works. But be warned! The Tremulant EP gets an even 7.0-- one for each dollar I paid for it-- by virtue of quality, but I still wish I had a month's supply of ramen instead. But hey, if you simply must keep tabs on the latest ATDI projects, the nervy, tension-filled grooves and hooks should satisfy. Just know that this EP heralds good things on the horizon, and wait patiently for the sixty-dollar full-length.","""Three tracks. Seven dollars.""

Buzzkunst,Shelleydevoto,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3cb5e6ef95969320704/1:1/w_160/5a367373.jpeg,2002-06-23 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7108-buzzkunst/,spinARTCooking Vinyl,"It's been more than 20 years since Howard Devoto and Pete Shelley last made music together. Even during their original mid-70s partnership as the founders of Manchester's indomitable Buzzcocks, they didn't make very much music-- only one full album's worth of songs ever came out of their partnership before Devoto split and formed Magazine. But what a great batch of songs those were, from the frustrated sexual rumble of ""Orgasm Addict"" to the insightful musings of ""Boredom."" Shelley continued to front the Buzzcocks on and off for two decades, while Devoto wrapped up Magazine and dipped in and out of the music industry, ultimately ending up at a photography agency in the early 90s. Now, long after the punk movement the two helped nurture in its infancy has been co-opted for the more scripted and watered-down theatrics of commercial-minded revivalists, Devoto and Shelley are back together with a brand new album. Needless to say, expectations are high for a release like this-- the towering legacy of their original collaboration (coupled with the outstanding work each has done since they parted ways) amount to a pretty big cloud of expectation. It's important, however, to remember not to let that cloud obscure the final product, because, after all, this isn't a Buzzcocks reunion, nor do the pair intend to visit past glories. Rather, the duo seems to have simply felt like working together again, and you're not going to notice many musical similarities between the electronic throb of Buzzkunst (kunst is German for art, by the way) and the primal pounce of the Spiral Scratch EP. Whereas the Buzzcocks drew from the pummeling attack of the Stooges and the noisy offhandedness of the Velvet Underground, Shelleydevoto is more indebted to the synth-driven end of the post-punk spectrum. Think Shriekback, the Human League and Depeche Mode at their darkest and most frenzied, and you're just about there. Of course, those are just reference points, as the Shelleydevoto never end up sounding completely like any of those bands. First of all, Devoto's vocals are quite distinctive-- he hasn't lost a bit of the quirk and ease of delivery that he was gifted with early on in his career. Secondly, Shelley's electronically sequenced arrangements are more given to chaos and dissonance than any of their likely influences, and his guitar playing is still razor-sharp and not afraid to cut. It's not as though Devoto and Shelley haven't been in synth-pop territory before-- Devoto's late-80s duo Luxuria and Shelley's own solo work both anticipate a project like this. Buzzkunst doesn't exactly offer any revelatory music, but it certainly is good, sometimes even great. Devoto's panache as a vocalist certainly helps things a lot, and the duo's smart enough to realize that they work best together when the music moves at high speeds. They burst out of the gate with the Kraftwerk-on-uppers groove of ""Can You See Me Shining?"" Devoto's melody is superb, setting up some wonderful tension in the chorus before releasing it with swooping, melismatic passages. The shiniest gem in the bunch is ""Til the Stars In His Eyes Are Dead,"" with its driving synth-punk rhythms, atonal guitar workouts, and a spooked delivery from Devoto that picks up right where Magazine left off. ""Self-Destruction"" lands the two on the dancefloor at a demented rave, with backing vocals from Kay Hoffnung coolly playing foil to Devoto's multi-tracked weirdness. Shelley's drum programming is at its best, fluidly switching between frantic beat patterns to support Devoto's ear-friendly melody. Alongside such successes, though, are a few tracks that don't work quite as well-- especially the instrumentals sprinkled through the disc. Though not exactly bad, none of them really do much for the album, with the possible exception of ""On Solids,"" featuring Harrison Smith's soprano and tenor saxes. The new texture is a nice interjection for the middle of the album and helps to brighten an otherwise fairly dark mood. More generally, some of the home-recorded, sequenced backgrounds occasionally sound a bit limp, especially when Devoto gives his most passionate delivery on top. Still, I personally take some relief in the fact that Devoto and Shelley haven't made Spiral Scratch II or tried to replicate their past from the pieces that are still left. If I want to hear the magic of the original Buzzcocks, I can just go listen to ""Breakdown."" What I have here is an honest, uncompromised record that also happens to be pretty damn good. It honors Shelley and Devoto's considerable history together and brings two of punk's most original voices back on convergent paths.","It's been more than 20 years since Howard Devoto and Pete Shelley last made music together.

Future Songs,Cranes,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a69dea9e61561daa53e1/1:1/w_160/eb463d4c.jpg,2002-06-23 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1660-future-songs/,Instinct,"Once upon a time, in the not-too-distant past, there were a lot of bands that sounded kind of like the Cranes-- bands whose sound and general aesthetic placed them somewhere between My Bloody Valentine and the Cocteau Twins. And those bands were frequently played at the sort of parties I once imagined I would like to attend, where attractive young artistes with flawless skin hobnobbed under unusual lighting and talked about their conceptual art installations at the local gallery, while taking in considerable amounts of some archaic, yet highly literary drug, like, say, opium. My enthusiasm for such gatherings has dwindled over the years, more or less in direct proportion with my attention span for ethereal pop. However, I suspect that as we speak Futuresongs is soundtracking someone's monologue about the need for wider public support of performance art, as the demystified soul in the corner rolls her eyes and asks: ""Hey, is this the Cranes? Are they even around any more?"" As it happens, the Cranes are still around, and though they've tweaked their sound to keep up with the times, vocalist Ali Shaw still sounds like she's inhaling enough helium to send her spiraling into orbit. The Cranes have also included a handy lyric sheet to counter the claims that Shaw has been speaking in tongues for years. With some imagination, one can follow along with the printed words and almost believe the songs are written in a terrestrial language. Unfortunately, one discovers pretty quickly that without the incomprehensible vocal stylings, the lyrics are trite as shit. You might expect a song titled ""The Maker of Heavenly Trousers""-- with its trancelike melody and placid, repetitive crescendos of guitar-- to offer a little more than, ""I know that I'm gonna find something this time/ 'Cos I just made up my mind."" Come on, that's a compelling enough title-- let's have a little elaboration! But the lyrics aren't really the problem. I mean, all apologies, but songwriting doesn't have to be brain surgery. The Cranes started out pretty way back in the early 90s, but with the passing years they've shifted towards more typical alternative pop. Futuresongs sends the Cranes into an odd niche, a more contemporary version of how they sounded in their heyday. If you can imagine a musical scale with Boards of Canada on one end and Mazzy Star on the other, Futuresongs would fit neatly in the middle. It sounds interesting, and in all fairness, Futuresongs does have its moments. By dispensing with a whole lot of traditional instrumentation and beefing up their electronic edge, the Cranes have effectively stopped sounding like a 'band,' and more like a producer/vocalist outfit with occasional loops of guitar. The best tracks are the instrumentals (the blissed out ""Everything For"" and the eerie, string-enhanced Autechre-lite of ""In the Reeds""), and the songs where Shaw's idiosyncratic vocals work more as an instrument than a would-be narrative device. Lyrics aside, there's nothing distinctly unappealing or half-assed about this album. It's a smart, dreamy, well-produced ambient pop record that will likely appeal to aficionados of hipster transcendental meditation, sugary-sweet sex scenes in independent films, and, yeah, suburban art parties. It just feels awfully familiar. If the early 90s produced a significant number of bands that sounded like the old Cranes, it's pretty obvious that the last five years have created a regular glut of this stuff. At the end of the day, will the Cranes be the band you remember as the electronic trailblazers of the early 00's? Doubt it.","Once upon a time, in the not-too-distant past, there were a lot of bands that sounded kind of like the ...

Universal Truths and Cycles,Guided by Voices,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfbbeb335119a49ed28b/1:1/w_160/24a3bfdb.jpg,2002-06-23 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3588-universal-truths-and-cycles/,Matador,"There was a time when Robert Pollard was on the verge of becoming an indie-rock Peter Pan-- with a beer gut. Though he was already well past the age of 98% of his audience by the time Bee Thousand was released, his music carried with it a kind of child-like enthusiasm and appreciation that set it apart from the pack of whiny 'alternative' rockers. It's easy to imagine Pollard, way back in 1993, sitting in front of his four-track, staring with determination at the cover of Who's Next and thinking to himself, ""One day, I'll be able to use a real recording studio-- then I can be a real rock star!"" Four brilliant albums and countless excellent EPs later, Bob Pollard finally got to live out his rock star dream. With TVT (Sevendust, anyone?) and herr jackass Ric Ocasek in his corner, Pollard finally had the resources at his disposal to make a shot at the big leagues. Unfortunately, it seems that Pollard was too busy with his shiny new toys to actually figure out something to do with them. Thus, Do the Collapse, the last album by Pollard the man-child, bore all of the whimsy of his earlier works with none of the substance. It's hard to imagine an experience more sobering (figuratively, at least) than your big break doing little more than pissing off the people who were sticking up for you way back when. And to top it all off, Pollard went and pulled a Howard Stern, as domestic turmoil cast a more sinister light on his once-charming hedonism. Isolation Drills, though a more solid effort than its predecessor, marked the end of the child-like charm that Pollard had sprinkled throughout his earlier work. Effortless hooks and fantastical storytelling gave way to chugging riffs and darker lyrics. This new direction went over with a mainstream audience about as well as all of the band's older directions did, and Guided by Voices quickly found themselves off the label, before being scooped back up by their former boosters at Matador. Which brings us to Universal Truths and Cycles. To make a long story short, it's the best thing Pollard's done since Mag Earwhig!. And while it doesn't recapture the magic of the Sprout-era Guided by Voices records, Universal Truths and Cycles marks the return of some of the most sorely missed qualities of early Guided by Voices: strong vocal melodies and refreshingly atypical song structures. The album's 35-second opener, ""Wire Greyhounds,"" provides a brief high that's far too quickly brought down by ""Skin Parade,"" a song that relies on a jarring, barely interesting riff to take up the space surrounding the memorable chorus. After this brief misstep, though, the album genuinely takes off, with the brief acoustic number ""Zap"" setting the stage for the album's two greatest songs. ""Christian Animation Torch Carriers"" begins with a bit of melancholy, as Pollard harmonizes with himself over a simple yet compelling chord progression. The band enters, building towards a thrilling climax that utilizes some of Pollard's most tried and trusted songwriting techniques. The result is one of those inimitable moments where it sounds like Pollard, while sliding an open chord up and down the neck of his guitar, happened to stumble upon a perfect song. While ""Christian Animation Torch Carriers"" does sometimes meander as it builds towards its explosive ending, ""Cheyenne"" wastes no time making its brilliance known. Built around a lovely chord progression and developing towards an endlessly catchy finale, ""Cheyenne"" could easily be the most blissful Guided by Voices song since Waved Out's ""Subspace Biographies."" Aside from ""Cheyenne,"" there aren't any other tracks on Universal Truths and Cycles that unquestionably qualify as classics. ""Back to the Lake"" comes close, perfectly contrasting its rhythmically relentless drive with a simple, laid-back vocal melody. The slightly overlong ""Car Language"" marries Joy Division darkness with Sonic Youth guitar lines, reaching a great instrumental section with rapid-fire drums and squalling feedback. Yet, other songs, like the minute-long ""The Ids are Alright"" and ""Factory of Raw Essentials"" meander in typical Pollard fashion without ever really registering. At this point, it's clear that the days when Bob Pollard could effortlessly create perfect pop songs are gone. There's blood and sweat all over these songs-- even ""Cheyenne,"" this album's standout, contains a few moments of awkwardness, as Pollard chokes the song's melody with too many syllables. Still, Universal Truths and Cycles has more than its share of wonderful moments-- moments when the rock crunch of Isolation Drills blends seamlessly with the steady melodic sensibility of Under the Bushes, Under the Stars and the charming eccentricity of Bee Thousand. So, Robert Pollard has grown up. The question now is whether his newfound maturity will be able to replace the ambition and vivacity that came with his perpetual youth. Whatever hopes he might have had of bringing his sweet rock and roll to the masses have been crushed, trampled, and stomped into the ground. Thankfully, Universal Truths and Cycles suggests that Pollard may still have a few choice treats for those of us who are still paying attention.","There was a time when Robert Pollard was on the verge of becoming an indie-rock Peter Pan-- with a beer ...

Old Blood,Mayday,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3ebea9e61561daa8023/1:1/w_160/d8181ece.jpg,2002-06-20 05:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5161-old-blood/,Saddle Creek,"It's hard to imagine how many people have made the word 'mayday' their last. It's a word inherently filled with panic and dread, originally descending from the French m'aider-- literally ""help me."" It's certainly never a good thing to hear it coming over your radio, as it means death might be just around the corner for whoever's out there in the air or on the ocean calling it out. The members of Mayday seem like an unlikely bunch to relate to a primarily nautical distress call, having spent the majority of their lives adrift in the oceans of grain that cover Nebraska and the rest of the Great Plains. But frontman Ted Stevens has always seemed to view life itself as a vast ocean that we're simply cast into-- forced to struggle against currents and undertow, not to mention all the sinister surprises lurking in the depths. During his tenure with breadbasket troubadours Lullaby for the Working Class, Stevens once referred to himself as a ""pale white torso, complete with two struggling oars,"" and it only seems fitting that the imagery of that line should come to the fore in his latest project, as that's what Mayday's music largely seems to address. Since Lullaby had their final cadence, Stevens has gone on to become the guitarist for southeast Nebraskan post-punks Cursive, and musically, Mayday falls somewhere in between his two other bands, occasionally utilizing the rhythmic push that makes Cursive's music so urgent, but using it mostly to support the grandly humble gestures and ramshackle navel-gazing that characterized Lullaby for the Working Class. His singing has come a long way since he first cracked and groaned his way through songs like ""Show Me How the Robots Dance"" half a decade ago. Though there are still some rough spots, he sounds more confident on the microphone these days, displaying his widest expressive range ever. Old Blood fades in on ""Cinquefoils,"" with a pulsing electronic rhythm that's almost enough to make you wonder if Stevens and co. haven't given over to Depeche Mode-styled synth-pop. The subtle, room-miked drums and banjo/guitar plucking that enter soon after, though, make it immediately clear that that isn't the case. It's simply a broadening of a sonic pallet that was already pretty broad, and it's impressively well-integrated. It's followed by the gorgeous ""Come Home,"" which moves gracefully from a slow ballad with male-female harmonies to a soaring climax. ""I'm trying to remember where I went wrong/ I only want to talk you into coming back/ I won't even ask you where you've been/ Or who you've been staying with,"" Stevens sings, as though staring out his window, watching some memory of domestic bliss. After the second refrain, the tempo doubles and slide guitars rise up to meet the vocals as the song moves to its stratospheric heights before coming back down for one last plea of ""Come home, babe."" ""Captain"" is an old school working-class lullaby complete with imagery of planes colliding with mountains and ships being tossed like toys in storms. ""Lullaby for the Sleeping Elephant"" plays off the old Canadian saying that being adjacent to the U.S. is like ""sleeping next to an elephant,"" with its tale of parents sending their child off to war. The anguished bridge turns the plodding tempo into sludge with dark, distorted guitars as Stevens hollers as though relating his own son's plight. The band takes ample opportunity to spread their wings wide on songs like the tense ""Pilot,"" with its ominous opening line, ""The pilot is tapping the gauges."" The song moves from claustrophobic verses to gorgeous, violin-led instrumental passages that play foil to the ragged nerves of the lyrics. ""Confession"" drips with desert-fried guitar and loping, Latin-inflected rhythms that would feel right at home on a Pinetop Seven or Calexico record. Most impressive, though, are the album's two suites, the meditative ""Tone/Atone/Atonal"" and the epic, twelve-minute closer ""Temple/Temporary/Extempore/Tempo."" ""Tone"" moves from a stark, minimal opening to tribal beats smothered with organ and smatterings of slide guitar, eventually building to a stormy ending. ""Temple"" is an epic in the true sense, blossoming from an opening salvo of drones and dissonance into a complex series of freely composed verses full of shifting rhythms and textures. It's the rare twelve-minute song that earns its full keep without tossing in anything unnecessary. Mayday have put together an impressive debut that's exceedingly difficult to pigeonhole. Mike and AJ Mogis' recording is immaculate, yet dirty enough to make the sci-fi folk vibe work perfectly. Mayday have turned the desperate cry for help into a thing of fragile, spontaneous beauty, and the result is stunning.","It's hard to imagine how many people have made the word 'mayday' their last.

September 000,The Secret Machines,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a395ea9e61561daa4cf3/1:1/w_160/e2e39414.gif,2002-06-20 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7056-september-000/,Ace Fu,"Not long ago, Texas was just a barren desertland reserved for TV fantasies of glamorous oil magnates equipped with ten-gallon 'skypieces' and oversized rose-tinted shades, a place where grandparents could still find a Butch Cassidy-style bar brawl and desert creatures fought over passing Dodge Rams for the sweet mercy of an air-conditioned afterlife. Can you still feel the ghostly wind of J.R. Ewing blow through the very fabric of your being in downtown Dallas? Wouldn't be Texas without it! You can even sense his spirit mingling with the stink of sun-dried horseshit on the open prairie, if you're bored enough. Ahh, but after all these years of proudly sustaining its stereotypes, Old Lone Star's finally ready to contribute something worthy of the endless expanse it so greedily hogs. The past couple years have seen countless unknowns barreling out of Texas' scorched earth, like the bloodthirsty groundworms lunging for Bacon gristle in Tremors: Lift to Experience brought religious fanaticism to Spiritualized guitars; Stars of the Lid breathed hypercolor cinematography into stagnating ambient drones; and our boys in the Trail of Dead built a monument to indie's darkest string-shredders, delivering such visceral elysium it earned them their very own caravan of Deadheads. Folks haven't seen that kind of loyalty in those parts since Pee-Wee gumshoed for his hijacked Schwinn at the Alamo. But it gets better with Secret Machines' freshly issued debut, which at last pushes America's waning psych-pop movement beyond the four-tracked Beatles bounce of the Elephant 6 crew. The trio draws from the same pool of influences that informs the Flaming Lips' recent work, and shares Wayne Coyne's talent for rapturous melodies. But where the mighty Lips rarely veer from psych-pop traditionalism, Secret Machines spend as much quality time with extended instrumental passages as they do with instantaneous pop hooks. Secret Machines aren't completely innocent of the jam-band aesthetic that's colored so much of psychedelia's fluorescent history; they build repeating patterns and layer effects in crescendos taller than Chase Tower. Fortunately, these moments never come off like academic experiments in drum-circle theory or languid, aimless noodling. The band prefers a more engaging and concise approach to their epic sound collages-- these beasts never run past the four-minute mark, and all of them burst into glorious pop songs sooner or later. There's not even an ambling tabla/oud/sitar setup to contend with-- just the creative deployment of comfortably conventional instrumentation and textured sci-fidelity backdrops. But let's get hypothetical and imagine that these kind of build-ups aren't your cup of Godspeed. Hey, great! Those only comprise about a fifth of the disc's 28-minute runtime; the rest is a triumph of classic indie rock tradition: tuneful immediacy, thundering choruses, and forward-thinking ingenuity. Recorded at Chicago's Clava Studios with producer Brian Deck, Califone guitarist Tim Rutili, and drummer Ben Massarella, September 000 sparkles with the intensity of the rhinestone bling the Secret Machines' Dallas hometown built its oil-playboy rep on. Some of Deck's recent work is marred by digital over-processing, but the subtle effects that underscore this record achieve a largely organic space-rock sound. Chiming keyboard tones communicate with the inventive creaks and whispers uttered by Ben Curtis' treated guitar, adding an abyssal depth to the hummable pop gratification that gives the disc its magnetic pull. Two songs titled ""Marconi's Radio"" bookend the record. The opener builds from a sparse, repeating keyboard figure into a squalling burst of dense noise before U-turning into a beautifully arranged ballad where Josh Garza's taut, snapping drumkit collides with Brandon Curtis' plaintive vocals. The second version is a shorter, upbeat instrumental variation with chaotic junkyard percussion and intricate multilayers of ear-candy adornment. As sounds are piled on, the track quickly builds to a frenzied upset, and the rhythmic handclaps that punctuate its spirited melody erupt into enthusiastic applause. ""What Used to Be French"" is more immediate, with its pulsing bassline, wailing guitars and explosive chorus, but the three-minute burner ""Breathe"" comes away the clear winner-- a raucous, energetic pop basher that contends with (and to a large degree, sounds like) the best moments of the New Pornographers' Mass Romantic. The Secret Machines recently relocated to New York City, presumably because they were tired of people referencing the Ewing dynasty in their reviews. But they're proud of their Texan heritage, and they should be. Life is finally emerging from its cracked soil, and I'm taking this disc as a sign that this new scene's prepared to produce enough great music to finally scrub the Fabulous Thunderbirds' greasy prints off the pop culture cerebellum. Grab those brushes, men, ""Tuff Enuff"" ain't coming off without a fight.","Not long ago, Texas was just a barren desertland reserved for TV fantasies of glamorous oil magnates equipped with ten-gallon ...

The Departing of a Dream,Loren Connors,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3f569fc7814a47cd78a/1:1/w_160/9cc18ebf.gif,2002-06-20 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5171-the-departing-of-a-dream/,Family Vineyard,"Like fellow traveler Roy Montgomery, New Englander Loren Connors (who, until the release of this record, recorded as Loren Mazzacane Connors) has dedicated his life to exploring the emotional possibilities of the guitar, having released more than 30 albums in the last 25 years. While Connors' work varies in style, he's a master of quiet, meditative pieces for electric guitar, and this is his approach on The Departing of a Dream. The makeup of the music is simple enough. Connors' guitar receives some reverb and equalization, the latter mostly a gentle roll off the high end, imparting a distinctly sub-aquatic tone. He makes disorienting use of the wah-wah pedal, deploying it much as Miles Davis did, to destabilize long, drawn-out phrases. And then there are some assorted effects, scraping sounds as such, added for color. Enhancing the unsettling atmosphere, the album was recorded in a very 'natural' environment, with plenty of room noise and tape hiss, and with the VU meters well up into the red, lending the glow of analog distortion to what is essentially a very sparse record. This is without question one of the most focused and single-minded records you are ever likely to hear. Containing ten tracks of slow, murky electric guitar tones, the mood never budges from the intersection of dread, sadness and exhaustion, and varies only in relative intensity. Describing individual tracks is pointless, as they sound so similar (the first eight are titled ""The Departing of a Dream,"" the last two are a NYC 9/11 tribute called ""the Silence"" and ""and Sorrow."") The record can only be taken whole. In Connors' favor, it's incredible how palpable an atmosphere he can conjure with so few ingredients. The word 'alien' is overused in music discourse these days, but no other word can describe the uncanny setting of The Departing of a Dream. It truly feels beamed from another realm, a blurry, dizzying world of grainy black-and-white images and suspended time. The guitar phrasing occasionally hints at melody, but in a way that feels closer to speech than singing, almost like a six-string recitation of a Gregorian chant. Chords are few; hell, notes are few, gently tumbling out every second or so. This music sounds like meditation. And that's important to note. This album comes from and is geared toward solitude more than any album in recent memory; it almost seems obscene that this might be listened to by more than one person at a time. An album so completely gripped by a crushing sense of loneliness should probably carry some kind of warning label, to turn away people who actually socialize. In any case, this beguiling record is definitely a specialty item.",,7.5,
Things Shaped in Passing,Six Parts Seven,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a430b1335d7bf16988d0/1:1/w_160/e2872159.jpg,2002-06-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7204-things-shaped-in-passing/,Suicide Squeeze,"A friend of mine manages a coffeeshop in Arlington, Virginia. About a month before I ever heard The Six Parts Seven's latest LP, the band played a rock and roll show there, opening for Denison Witmer. ""They were good kids, I liked their music"" she would later comment, ""but they need a singer."" Although not exactly among the indie-cognoscenti, I took my friend's comment as a critique of post-rock more generally. The genre has seemingly become the catch-all term to describe rock without words (excepting, of course, bands like Gastr del Sol). But when one pigeonholing buzz word manages to rope both Don Caballero and Sam Prekop, its descriptive utility is obviously suspect. Avoiding a general critique of post-rock, though, allow me simply to pare it down a bit: The Six Parts Seven play delicate, subdued post-rock a la Rachel's or the Album Leaf. There-- is that better? Unlike many who have traveled the same course, The Six Parts Seven avoid the dreaded curse of droning boredom, executing their craft with a surprising and beautiful depth. Compositions are generally guitar-based, formed from simple hooks and patterns repeated hypnotically. On most tracks, the guitar hooks manage to sidestep at some point, allowing for variation in a bridge or interlude, or perhaps reprieve with a piano melody (as on ""Sleeping Diagonally"" and""Where Are the Timpani Heartbeats?""). The guitar driving the melody is accompanied by a second axe playing background counterpoint. The band also makes tasteful use of samples, as on ""Spaces Between Days (Part 4),"" where something that sounds like a bagpipe in reverse occupies the guitar's usual drone, repeating the same six-note patterns throughout. The compositions on Things Shaped in Passing are uniformly tender, reflective, and soothing-- the sort of record to soundtrack a Sunday slumber, or induce the same. There's something very personal about the music, something evocative in the simplicity that invites closeness. It's really quite stunning. Yet, although the parts are strong, the album as a whole still comes up somewhat short since each track approximates the tempo and mood of its immediate predecessor. It's as if The Six Parts Seven decided to write an absolutely perfect song for one occasion, then recorded slight variations on its theme eight times. As a result, I'd recommend you either take Things Shaped in Passing in small bites, or listen for a few tracks and let it dissolve into the background. Still, I'll contend that they do just fine without a singer, and that they've managed to create a pretty solid outing considering the current post-post-rock climate of independent music.","A friend of mine manages a coffeeshop in Arlington, Virginia.

Unsavoury Products,Black Dog and Black Sifichi,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2dc9d034d5c69bf2cc3/1:1/w_160/34d06c9d.gif,2002-06-19 06:01:40,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/753-unsavoury-products/,Hydrogen Dukebox,"Before he releases his travel guide to Interzone, Ken Downie (aka The Black Dog) gives the world a twenty-track intelligent techno appreciation of the essence of William Burroughs. Aiding Downie in this meticulously wrought homage is performance artist/poet and fellow traveler on the Road to the Western Lands, Black Sifichi. Downie put together Unsavoury Products as he was constructing his as-yet-unreleased album featuring Burroughs himself. But this album is far from just a bric-a-brac jumble. Unsavoury Products shows that there's more to the Black Dog/Black Sifichi partnership than just a shared admiration for the darkest swatch in the Pantone color chart. Neither takes center stage; free of ego, the pair allow the album to impart its provocative energy unhindered. Avoiding gauche parody or drooling idolatry, Sifichi's spoken word contributions are unmistakably Burroughsian. Yet nowhere on Unsavoury Products can I justifiably accuse Sifichi of ripping off Burroughs' idiosyncratic delivery nor his emotionally distant factional narratives. In fact, Sifichi's voice sounds more like an amalgam of Ken Nordine and James Mason! Sifichi possesses Burroughs' canny ability to present unreal phantasmagoric events as incontrovertible truth. From expositions on musical theory (""Let's Talk Music"") to enthusiastically goofy parodies of catalog shopping (""Inconspicuous Audiometric"") via comic routines in questionable taste (""Mental Health Hotline""), I find myself challenging Sifichi's narratives. Is he really informing me of undisputable facts, or just yanking my chain? Which is exactly how I respond to Burroughs' works. Referencing the time Burroughs spent in Tangiers and Morocco in which he and Paul Bowles became devoted listeners of the mystical Master Musicians of Joujouka, Downie surrounds some of Sifichi's expositions of possible parallel realities in mock Arabic accents. The prime example of this on Unsavoury Products is ""Dogbite,"" in which Downie introduces an oud and the Maghreb wail of a female devotee to his AI techno. Downie's contribution is not all quarter-tones and ululations, though. ""Secret Biscuits"" and ""Interview"" nod to the industrial funk of Michael Franti's Disposable Heroes of Hiphoprisy and that act's collaboration with Burroughs, Spare Ass Annie and Other Tales. ""If I Were King"" is distinctly UK techno in origin, with spindly synth lines and Venusian jazz chords. But instead of constructing a Derrick May rhythm pattern, Downie surprises by dropping some dread hip-hop weight. ""B4 The Sky Was Built"" is as dense as kif smoke and just as hallucinogenic-- indistinct voices mumble as trap drums beat out a dubby bassline. A solo violin swoops through this disturbing vapor, bringing to mind the repetitive forms of waterless dunes. Since the tinny ""Invisible Things"" sounds self-consciously like early-90s techno, I'm convinced Downie's joining Sifichi in kidding the listener, especially when he brings in the rinky-dinkiest vibraphone solo of all time. ""Science Tells Us"" takes the skippy rhythm of ""Invisible Things"" and transforms it into something far more serious. As the rhythm patters along, Downie surrounds it in twisting microtonal movements of primitive reed instruments to produce squalls not unlike feedback. Buried in the mix, Sifichi's barely formed vocals populate the soundspace abandoned by sanity, driven unintelligible by the ceaseless cruelty of the desert sun. Rather than bearing the offensive stench of rotting meat, Unsavoury Products is a heady blend of spices and aromas. However, I find that it's often too much for me to take in one sitting. This is more a criticism of me than of Downie and Sifichi. But if I'm to give this album its due, I can't just put it on in the background and potter about my business. It demands undistracted concentration. For Unsavoury Products is a fascinating and multi-layered album, and one the Black Dog will have to enlist the wildest of Interzone trippers to better.","Before he releases his travel guide to Interzone, Ken Downie (aka The Black Dog) gives the world a twenty-track intelligent ...

Fantastic Damage,El-P,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc1f5e6ef95969322d8b/1:1/w_160/91df6087.jpg,2002-06-18 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2712-fantastic-damage/,Definitive Jux,"Back in '97, El-P released Funcrusher Plus with his seminal group Company Flow. The album's tense, hypercreative backdrops laid such a sturdy foundation for the underground hip-hop world that it still echoes five years later, and has since been widely recognized as one of the genre's greatest achievements. Unfortunately, after only a few additional singles and an instrumental album, Company Flow was officially sent off last year with a blistering farewell show in Boston. And while El-P's remained busy with production work (most notably Cannibal Ox's The Cold Vein) and running a record label (the estimable Def Jux), heads have been hungry for the man to step back up to the mic. Now, after a series of frustrating delays, El-P's finally kicked out his first solo LP and exceeded the expectations of everyone who anxiously awaited its arrival. Fantastic Damage is an unrelenting, end-to-end burner that not only heralds the resurrection of El-P, but also provides a milestone for post-millennial underground hip-hop. The music is carefully constructed and sonically intricate. Distorted guitars, cacophonous, high-pitched ringing, and spiraling screams comprise its musical motifs. Lyrically, El-P eschews hip-hop's straightforward style for fits of associative word clusters (a la Kool Keith, or even early Pavement) that sound like a freestyle battle between a Marxist pamphlet and a technical manual. ""Motherfucker, does this sound abstract?"" El-P howls on one early track. ""I hope that it sounded more confusing than that."" Like Funcrusher Plus, the themes on this album are predominantly political. ""I am not a mechanism borne for the state,"" he spits, ""I had to be trained."" In ""Dead Disnee,"" he fantasizes about visiting a post-apocalyptic Disney World-- a bleak prospect considering recent threats from the al Qaeda network. El-P even takes a sharp-witted stab at the Star Wars phenomenon on Fantastic Damage's title track, charasmatically ranting, ""Operate catapults and goosestep over the innocent/ Vagrant of Reganomics phase with books to burn at the pod race.../ This is that Bronx magic, without Lucas Arts graphics/ Crayon colored green monsters and horrible child actors."" But while anti-capitalist anthems have always been his specialty, El-P's greatest accomplishments on this album are his newfound lyrical abilities, at once emotionally resonant and conceptually creative and consistent. On ""Stepfather Factory,"" he fuses his personal and political rage and delivers the record's most fully realized concept song. Affecting the voice of a CEO for a corporation manufacturing abusive guardians, El-P softens his caustic howl as he rhymes over a dark, looming beat that vividly conjures a corporately oppressive near-future. If Sly Stone phoned up Stockhausen for a presidentially mandated collaboration with 10,000 hours of government-granted studio time at Abbey Road, they still couldn't have crafted a soundscraper this abrasive, complex, and primal. An infectious retro-futurism informs the parting beat of ""The Nang, The Front, The Bush and The Shout""; the chorus of ""Dead Disnee"" is what Devo might sound like after spending a few days spun on PCP and meth; and ""Lazerfaces' Warning"" approximates industrial circus funk. Then there are the guest appearances: while Aesop Rock comes on with a surprisingly disappointing verse, Vast Aire drops another nugget of noir swagger on the ""Dr. Hellno and the Praying Mantis."" As tight as Fantastic Damage is, subtlety is definitely not its strong suit, and its esoteric and indulgent moments might have been better executed with a little smoothing over. Still, with a sphere of oppression and violence hanging over this country, El-P's trenchant examination of our environment and inner space is like manna in a desert of irony. No doubt, El-P has delivered both what we'd hoped for and what we need right now. This is his statement for these times, and it's one of the finest hip-hop records I've heard all year.","Back in '97, El-P released Funcrusher Plus with his seminal group Company Flow.

SOLA,Global Home Project,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf38ea9e61561daa7a10/1:1/w_160/245f5bdb.gif,2002-06-18 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3468-sola/,Amigo,"Keyboardist and composer Lars Hollmer came to prominence in the 70s as a member of the famed Swedish avant-prog outfit Samla Mammas Manna. Theirs was a particularly warm brand of out-there rock, especially as it took into account Scandinavian folk influences, polka and children's music as much as flashy instrumental virtuosity or the usual extraneous indulgences most people associate with prog. As bands of this sort go, they were actually quite popular in their native country, as well as having ties to Henry Cow and the gone-almost-as-soon-as-it-started Rock In Opposition collective. Fred Frith would use them as his backing band for much of his solo record Gravity, and after the demise of Samla (or more accurately, Zamla-- it's a long story), Hollmer started the short-lived Von Zamla ensemble, based on similar principles of carnivalesque folk melodies, improvisation and heady instrumental workouts. Since then, he's released a series of accordion and keyboard-based solo albums, and even received Sweden's equivalent to a Grammy award. Okay, so what I really need to tell you is to pick up some Samla records now. Start with Klossa Knapitatet and Maltid, and then work your way through Schlagerns Mystik and Famljesprickor. After that, check out Von Zamla, and possibly one of their side projects like Ensemble Nimbus. Enough? No? Then you're in luck, because Hollmer's latest project, the Global Home Project, is one of his best. The project features some of the best musicians in Japan's underground experimental underground (whom he met in Japan, playing Samla tunes as his touring band in that country), playing a mix of cinematic vignettes and good-natured avant-prog. ""Nationsjazz"" begins things on a very hectic note-- a repetitive violin melody is doubled by clarinet, giving it a quasi-Klezmer feel-- pushing to the breaking point by Tatsuya Yoshida's manic percussion and Hollmer's completely in-control accordion. The bridge opens the sound considerably as the melodies become more stretched out, and the clarinet (courtesy of de facto band organizer Wataru Okhuma) begins to wander into jazz-skronk territory now and again. If I had to pick a genre, I might go with circus-prog. The very different ""Ljuva L√§gen"" features a restless, sentimental piano line from Hollmer and a gorgeous violin melody played by Yuriko Mukoujima. The overall feeling is not unlike what you might hear in a colorful CGI-animated short about a love story between a bee and a fish or something-- it's superficially pretty, but also a bit juxtaposed, as the melodies are always pushed by Yoshida's drums and Hollmer's perpetually moving piano lines. ""Continue"" features Hollmer's modest vocals over an elegantly propulsive arrangement featuring accordion, violin and clarinet. The melody is at once reminiscent of modern Euro-ambiencd along the lines of Enya (in a good way, if that's possible) and the 19th century art-song of Franz Schubert. Once again, the accordion serves as pulse keeper, and Yoshida is content to color around the edges with his cymbals as the violin plays descant to Hollmer's tenor. ""Arp Violin"" keeps the classical motif running with its chamber group arrangement, airy violin melody and accordion ostinatos. The entire record seems to have been mixed to simulate a stage performance-- full of natural reverb and a great big ensemble sound. My complaint with the record is not much to do with the songs themselves, but rather that Hollmer never really taps into the greatest strengths of his band to push the music into higher realms. For the most part, this is a very good Hollmer solo disc, though it might have been something incredible had he opened the floor to the group interaction that Samla used to do so well. A tune like ""Parallel Angostura,"" with its angular figures and operatic baritone vocal lines, seems to have been written to suit Yoshida, though it comes out a tad on the rigid side because the musicians may be playing too close to the score. On the other hand, those vocals are pretty great-- it's not as if anyone outside of the RIO bands ever played this stuff better anyway. Again, you really should steal the first Samla disc you come across before diving in to this one-- though in the end, you can hardly go wrong with Hollmer. I can honestly say he's the coolest accordion-prog-improv-circus-experimental-Nordic-folk-polka-all-around generally eclectic musician I've heard. Can you really live without that?","Keyboardist and composer Lars Hollmer came to prominence in the 70s\r\n\ as a member of the famed Swedish ...

Too Late to Die Young,Departure Lounge,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b964ea9e61561daa6fa0/1:1/w_160/46a9934e.jpg,2002-06-18 05:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2280-too-late-to-die-young/,Nettwerk,"Too Late to Die Young features the unlikely pairing of London's Departure Lounge (a band led by Tim Keegan, former member of Robyr Hitchcock's Egyptians) and √ºberstoned French trip-hopper Kid Loco. Though the wisdom of the collaboration at first seems suspect, it turns out these guys knew what they were doing. Most of the credit is due to Kid Loco, who apparently left his ego behind when he assumed the producer's chair. There are some lovely gurgling electronic flourishes here and there, but nothing makes a bid for clubland, and Kid Loco clearly based his treatments on what their songs required, rather than going out of his way to leave his mark. The album is warm, thick and lush, but firmly rooted in the guitar pop tradition. With Loco steering the songs someplace interesting, the x-factor is the songwriting, which turns out to be first rate. The record's first step is a mighty one: opener ""Straight Line to the Kerb"" is such a killer song, there's no way the rest of the album could upstage it. Starting with a cloud of fluffy electronic noise, the tune turns into melancholy British guitar pop equal to the finest XTC, complete with the kind of trumpet that adds that extra layer of sadness to certair Belle & Sebastian songs. It's among my favorite songs of the first half of 2002. After that auspicious beginning, the dip in quality is slight but noticeable, as Departure Lounge draw from a variety of sounds and styles, with generally positive, but rarely brilliant results. Keegan's laconic delivery on the midtempo ""King Kong Frown"" is a dead ringer for Lloyd Cole, and ""I Love You"" is a wide-eyed Spectoriar extravaganza with a vocal arrangement indebted to Brian Wilson. The instrumental ""Tubular Belgians In My Goldfield"" offers Kid Loco the rare indulgence, and he transforms a ho-hum guitar instrumental into an epic, proggy slice of trip-hop that could be a Psycence Fiction B-side. ""Tubular Belgians"" segues into ""Be Good to Yourself,"" a bouncy pop song with a background of wailing free-jazz horns a la Radiohead's ""The National Anthem."" ""The Good Side"" is a solid country-ish duet between Keegan and Sing Sing's Lisa O'Neill, rather in the vein of Mike Johnson's pairings with Tiffany Anders. Mr. Hitchcock himself shows up for ""Coke & Flakes,"" a bluesy, noisy, psychedelic shuffle that is ultimately directionless and boring. The spare, affecting acoustic balladry of ""Silverline"" shows that Keegan's gifts are melodic, not rhythmic or instrumental. The album is about a quarter filler, but the songs that hit on Too Late to Die Young make the tedium worth sitting out.","Too Late to Die Young features the unlikely pairing of London's\r\n\ Departure Lounge (a band led by ...

Where Were We?,The Lucksmiths,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd8f5e6ef959693230a2/1:1/w_160/75e7e36b.jpg,2002-06-18 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4907-where-were-we/,Matinee,"So is the beer bottle half-empty or half-full? If you're one of those crazy optimists who went for the latter, boy, do the Lucksmiths have an album for you. Where Were We? foams with the effervescence of summer, yet it's lightly soured with the melancholy of slipping into autumn. The lads get girls and lose them; they have a pleasant evening at the pub, but the local football team loses a match. It's an album-- hey, a life-- of light highs and okay lows. And did I mention that the weather's great? This Australian trio follows a tradition going back to Chad & Jeremy in the 60s, singing ""A Summer Song"" to your mom on her 45 player. The Lucksmiths have a small but manic batch of fans, and not many people do the folky acoustic pop thing this well. They're often compared to tourmates Belle and Sebastian, and it's a toss-up which band sounds more sensitive and fey. The Lucksmiths are sharper, and more into rhythm than color: Tali White's vocals sound wistful, but they're also jockishly sturdy and clear, and his drums lock into Marty Donald's jangly acoustic and Mark Monnone's limber bass like a one-band argument for a Merseybeat revival. Depending on your taste, this may sound intriguing. But Where Were We? is a bad place to start with this band-- a compilation of slim rarities, this record collects fourteen singles, tracks from comps, and gimmick songs. The title talks about all the travel that took place while they made this-- the material was recorded over three years and three continents-- but from the songs, you'd think they never left the mythical Aussie town where they grew up and plan to die. The album is catchy and crisp; good enough to show why people like the band, but the material isn't there. Out of context, there's nothing to like about ""The Cassingle Revival,"" which was originally released in that much-maligned format. White opens the song with, ""Another summer slipped away without me noticing,"" and a little later he's talking about ""the palest afternoons"" of autumn on the dull ""A Downside to the Upstairs."" And just when you've heard enough about the climate, the album's big frenzied peak announces it's ""T-shirt weather!"" That song is so bright and bursting that it almost works, but for every catchy number like that there are two limp ones, dragged down by awkward rhymes, thin melodies, or shallow subjects. Songs this breezy sound even more lightweight when they hang on something as simple as pop culture references or wistful nostalgia (""I Prefer the Twentieth Century,"" written for-- you guessed it-- a New Year's 2000 single). And when the otherwise winning shuffle of ""Myopic Friends"" uses the phrase ""affaire du couer""-- or when they close ""Tmrw vs Y'Day"" with the line, ""If I don't see you in the future/ I'll see you in the pasture""-- they lose tangible amounts of dignity. ""Southernmost,"" which first came out in a better version on Happy Secret, is the only song that doesn't feel like getting thwacked in the face by a balloon. The genuinely poignant melody fits the relationship-gone-sour lyrics, with images from great vacations in the past: ""The sky was swimming-pool blue/ And the swimming pool was, too."" It's an ode to summer memories that actually feels real, in the middle of songs that take the same sentiment and flog it to death. Happy Secret is the only other Lucksmiths album I've spent time with and it's much subtler-- even recommended, if this sounds like your kind of warm-weather driving music. But Where Were We? is strictly for the fans, and it's too bad that a band this obscure would take a chance on releasing it.","So is the beer bottle half-empty or half-full?

All That Glitters,MRI,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3f913d197565213be54/1:1/w_160/e3d35a17.jpg,2002-06-17 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5484-all-that-glitters/,Force Tracks,"MRI (that's Stephan Lieb and Frank Elting from Frankfurt, Germany) are major players in a burgeoning scene that some are calling ""microhouse,"" an overly broad label that's been attached to artists as varied as Luomo (experimental producer Vladislav Delay in vocal house mode), Jan Jelinek (primarily for his work as Farben) and artists on the Kompakt label. I'm not going to embarrass myself by attempting a definitive explanation, but generally, microhouse happens when minimal house beats meet the glitch approach to sound, a combination that's been hinted at for years but is only now beginning to flower. Like an absurd number of trends in electronic music in the last ten years, microhouse is hitting its stride on a subsidiary of Force Inc., the German label that counts Mille Plateaux, Force Tracks, and Force Lab among the specialty imprints under its umbrella. Two Lone Swordsmen's Andy Weatherall selected and mixed a breathtakingly smooth and appealing compilation on Force Tracks last year called Hypercity, documenting one strand of the scene to date. Three tracks on that comp, including the airy and weightless leadoff ""Human Patterns,"" were by MRI. ""Human Patterns"" was from MRI's debut Rhythmogenesis, a collection of earlier EPs. All That Glitters is their first full-length of original material, and it marks a shift to a more pop direction. The final track on this excellent new album is called ""Nightclubbing at Home,"" a brilliant title that highlights a smart way for listeners to approach the record. Though they're lumped in with these other microhouse producers, on All That Glitters, MRI approach this meeting place for house rhythms and sonic experimentation from the perspective of the dancefloor, and a song-friendly one at that. Befitting the club setting, the tracks are long (ten in 70 minutes), but they're crammed with interesting stuff. This album is not a clinical exercise in the textural possibilities inherent in static; MRI are tracking pop hooks and disco beats, and they even throw a couple of fine vocal songs into the mix. It's big fun to move to, no question, but open-minded Maxell guys can still dig it from their low-rider La-Z-Boys. All That Glitters reflects the wide range of Lieb and Elting's musical interests, and some of the homages are blatant. ""Data Boogie"" contains the same vocal sample that opens DJ Shadow and Cut Chemist's Brainfreeze (""Hey! Martial arts fans!""), while the downtempo ""Blue"" is a weird, inverted cover of Aaliyah's ""Try Again"" (All That Glitters is posthumously dedicated to her). ""Sane and Sound"" has the odd distinction of being the glitchiest track (in terms of beats) as well as the more conventional (in structure), as the sputtering electric squelches that stand in for percussion smack away behind a breezy vocal melody. Uptempo, danceable instrumental house dominates the album, but the detours are frequent enough to make All That Glitters work as a varied and complete document. The track that made me fall in love with this record is ""Tied to the 80s."" The first three minutes or so build steadily, as one new sound after another is folded into the mix. First, the squelchy synth hooks come in, then the kick drum, then a slightly dubby bassline. At the end of every 16th bar, the beat breaks down and you can tell the track is about to be given an extra thrust in the form of an additional element or variation in the sound. But the crowning moment is when an unashamedly goofy string sample is introduced-- it sounds to these ears like the theme to the pitiful early-80s television drama ""Hart to Hart."" This playful and joyous track is representative of MRI's approach on All That Glitters. Though they put as much care into microscopic sonic detail as any of their contemporaries, they use their sound fetish in service of feel-good body music.","MRI (that's Stephan Lieb and Frank Elting from Frankfurt, Germany) are major players in a burgeoning scene that some ...

Are You Down?,PANTHERS,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb54abf31b7dc7155a78/1:1/w_160/28250110.gif,2002-06-17 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6151-are-you-down/,Troubleman Unlimited,"Hey, man, remember when rock 'n' roll really meant something? When the political message of the music reflected the American youth's disenchantment with our country's capitalist, war-mongering system? Hard to believe now, but thirty years ago, people genuinely thought a new American Revolution was right around the corner, with rock as the soundtrack. The Rolling Stones were accused of endorsing riots in ""Street Fighting Man,"" John Lennon waffled over change-by-violence on ""Revolution,"" and the Jefferson Airplane canvassed the Woodstock mudfolk for ""Volunteers."" And yeah, if you weren't high on the demon weed, it probably all sounded about as stupid then as Panthers' political spiel does today. With a CD booklet chock full of manifestos lyrical and otherwise, the Panthers' brand of politico-punk none too subtly hearkens back to the days when hippie idealism transformed into the Manson family. You don't need a protractor to figure out the Panthers' primary influence: the MC5's early incarnation as John Sinclair's White Panther Party house band, before future Springsteen wrangler Jon Landau watered down their white 'fro sound. To their credit, Panthers got one aspect of revolutionary-era Motor City Five down: the moronic ramblings of manager Sinclair-- whose dope, guns, and fucking plan of action did more damage to the legitimate anti-status quo youth movement than Nixon ever could have. Outlining their own militant policy in bite-size fortune-cookie segments, Panthers drop such wisdom as, ""We stand for the destruction of art in all forms,"" and, ""We are RECKLESS! Fuck the law!"" Boy, that's controversy! And it's all echoes of Sinclair's 1968 White Panther Manifesto, with its own deep thoughts like, ""We are bad,"" and, ""Leaders suck,"" or the MC5's most enduring statement: ""Kick out the jams, mothafuckas!!!"" Of course, all this radical mumbo-jumbo is nothing more than a smokescreen to hide the fact that Panthers are just a really, really crappy band. It'd be one thing if an act with songs like ""A Panther Is a Motherfucker"" and ""Up Against the Wall"" turned out to be chamber twee or bluegrass, but it's about the least surprising development in the world to find out that their repertoire merely runs the gamut from hardcore to punk. Above the usual mix of boom-thak drums and oh-so-angry power chords, vocalist Jayson Green recites tuneless lyrics organized in paragraph form. The one break from the Ian MacKaye rulebook is the electric piano intro to ""Sex Ed,"" an absurd moment quickly smothered in distortion and Green's boast that Panthers ""fuck whomever we damn well please."" Hey, at least they've got their grammar down. Basically, the music and the message meet and shake hands somewhere around the maturity level of an angstful 15-year-old. In light of this, the fact that the members of Panthers' ages (helpfully provided in the liner notes) fall between 23 and 31 make Are You Down? either one of the saddest things I've ever heard, or a ""Mr. Show"" sketch I haven't gotten to yet on the DVD. But, you know, maybe what's really sad is living in a world where a heartfelt goal like ""make pigs pay"" comes off as ludicrous instead of thought-provoking.","Hey, man, remember when rock 'n' roll really meant something?

The Skull Mailbox and Other Horrors,Bob Drake,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba0a9d034d5c69bf5376/1:1/w_160/e233962e.jpg,2002-06-17 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2440-the-skull-mailbox-and-other-horrors/,Recommended,"So much in music seems mysterious, though it's carefully dissected and explained in textbooks and newsgroups everywhere, to the point of sterilization. So it's become the acceptable social practice not to delve too deeply into how the music works. If music didn't contain some inherently mysterious quality, analysis and deconstruction would threaten to strip away anything that made it unusual, and consequently our interest. But we still love the stuff. What theoretical analysis of music cannot uncover is the inherent mystical understanding we have with it. If notes and words and beats are the parts, and if the sum of any piece worth its mortar is always greater than all of those, then pinning down anything concrete about good music seems to have been a fairly odd objective for me to write about from the start. The Skull Mailbox and Other Horrors is a free-form narrative about all things strange and dark, related to rural horrors and deep-seated fears mistakenly diagnosed as insanity. Bob Drake sings about being pulled upstairs against your will, and not trying to fight the ghosts. His macabre vision, with a preference for skewed beauty and purposely misleading moments of clarity, is the driving force behind some very colorful music, and probably the reason why describing his music is so difficult. This is unsettling stuff. Sometimes it seems funny, in a humiliatingly hopeless kind of way, as he lets on with the ghost-upstairs song (""You Can't Outwit That Thing""). The mix of psychological stress, garage-symphony grandeur and folk-ish retelling of very familiar horror stories (or at least scenarios) tends to defy analysis. Drake has been around. He started out playing bass and singing a bit in the 80's with indie-prog heroes Thinking Plague and Hail. Their brand of quirky, dissonant music has made them very popular in straight prog circles, though Drake really didn't cross into the mainstream until he began engineering and producing pop acts. His resume includes work with Ice Cube, Quincy Jones, Tina Turner and George Clinton, in addition to lending his hands to recent Faust and Henry Cow remasters. Drake is big fucking time, though is apparently none too fond of the spotlight, holing up in the south of France in his home studio. The Skull Mailbox is his fourth solo release, and similar to his previous records, features his highly unorthodox production effects, bluegrass-meets-Steve Howe guitar playing and immediately noticeable vocals. To my ears, he sings like Van Dyke Parks in the low register, Jon Anderson in the high. As mentioned, this record covers hauntings and other horrors. ""They Live in the Well"" opens with a bit of semi-classical guitar, mixed with a slight folky lilt. Drake's phrasing is off-kilter to a fault. A typical line of verse goes: ""If you take the wrong turn off that old dirt road, near that town where they all went insane/ There's a patch of blasted weeds where a house used to stand."" No extraneous rhyming or anything, though the melody wouldn't sound out of place on a Tom Waits record. And like Waits, Drake isn't afraid to strike up the pump organ for color. The opening guitar figure returns at the end, and the whole thing is wrapped up in a minute-and-a-half. The Skull Mailbox crams a whopping 27 songs in the span of about 45 minutes. ""The Tower"" features more trad-folk guitar and accordion, and could almost pass for an outtake from The Band, if they were going for a cornfield-haunting vibe. ""Cellar of Madness"" goes a bit over the top, with Drake's chorus of moaning near the middle, though the upbeat violin and accordion take some of the edge off the song's general paranoia. Taking the edge off seems to be one of Drake's strengths, as the gorgeous arpeggios of ""The Box in the Orchard"" and its accompanying slide guitar solo almost make you forget he's singing about finding someone's old hair and bones inside a buried box. Elsewhere, Drake's more experimental background comes to the fore. ""The Miraculous Reliquary"" begins with about a minute of approaching noise, like a rusty old train grinding its way closer to your right speaker, stopping just short of a rake in front of the station. Drake places shadowy guitar figures underneath a few layers of ambient unrest (and this is real ambience, recorded in his barn studio, outside noises included), while he sings of hidden items kept in a church room ""that should not be."" The song's coda leaps out of the muck as Drake holds back for a second, before proclaiming he saw a light ""ascending into heaven!"" over a distorted symphonic crescendo. If movie soundtracks were this good, no one would have to go to movies. The best thing about a record like this is not in its cool little vignettes, but in the way they all seem to be woven together. Most of the tunes pass by before you really have a chance to discern what has happened, and by the end, you might feel like you missed something. In truth, Drake's music is rather complicated, with plenty of intricate guitar playing and dense arrangements. Furthermore, despite his pedigree as a producer, he favors very messy mixes, usually with stuff most people would consider 'mistakes' left in.

The White Stripes/De Stijl,The White Stripes,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa179d034d5c69bf3d99/1:1/w_160/35ee143b.jpg,2002-06-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8650-the-white-stripesde-stijl/,Sympathy for the Record IndustrySympathy for the Record Industry,"Hell yeah, hot freaks. Jack and Meg White's first two raucous platters are coming back at you in the biggest redistribution by a major label of still-available albums by fake-sibling bands beginning with the letter W since Elektra fancified Gene and Dean Ween's early catalog! For you efficient readers resistant to some patented Pitchfork scaffolding because you spent the night deciding which Gargamel quote to use in your chat profile, here's the quick review: once upon a time, the White Stripes were the half-mortal, half-Godzilla missionaries sent to lead rock to its promised land, and their rekkerds measured up to the hype. These albums contained thunderous, honky-soulful, lacerating pop at various stages of evolution. De Stijl is better, but only by noses. The end! Anyone still Stripe-hungry, read on: You probably weren't given the choice of not admiring this fine pair. Their charm is so bullying that their fans have become like hog-tied soldiers in the days of impressment, and their sudden crossover ubiquity threatens to vault them into a saturation-backlash a la the Spice Girls. This week's highlights: BLOOMINGTON, INDIANA: An undergrad Design major turns in her final project-- a giant, circular red-and-white UPC symbol, inspired by the White Stripes' peppermint motif. SANTA MONICA, CALIFORNIA: Two nervy fellas with hopes of being Jerry Bruckheimer's production assistants become the it-boys of their apartment building's pool when they pump White Blood Cells; their Aiwa boombox's shuffle feature begins fortuitously with ""Fell In Love with a Girl."" CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA: A group of conscientious dropouts walking home from a coffeehouse drumming circle are hooted at by some ballcapping Thads in a Pathfinder. One of the dropouts yells a retort. The Thads park, exit, and dry-gulch one of the group's males, who will require stitches. Blasting from the Pathfinder the whole time: the Stripes' ""Expecting."" ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO: Taking his cue from a canny jukebox selection of the treacly ""We're Going to Be Friends,"" a well-meaning mouth-breather out on the town seduces a tat-dappled Zippo-grrl with his knowledge of the White Stripes. When he goes to pee and service his coifed mane, he hears the kitchen staff jamming on ""I Think I Smell a Rat."" MTV: Yep. GAINESVILLE, FLORIDA: After the forced closure of her aquarium store, a girl gets high and goes to a 24-hour Wal-Mart with a permanent marker. Her plans to vandalize the pet department are thwarted by a potty-mouthed fifteen-year-old who runs a shopping cart over her left foot, dismantling her flip-flop and her pinky toe. The cart's sole contents: a copy of Is This It and a notepad listing the Strokes and the White Stripes, with the Strokes crossed out. WASHINGTON, D.C.: Packed venue Black Cat becomes a hub of debate when a guy, sporting a stocking cap despite the broil, claims that every incarnation of the garage-blues revival is better than the Stripes. A straight-edge female eventually punctures his facade by tricking him into praising a nonexistent Detroit Cobras album. SOY-BASED AIRWAVES: National Public Radio does a feature bit on the White Stripes. The band's shtick gets more airtime than their music. Fans are reportedly color-coordinating their outfits at Stripes shows, further shearing the curtain between indie rockers and Delta Chi Omegas at homecoming. 'Brother' Jack righteously plugs the blues, and 'sister' Meg joins him in a shout-out to Mom. EAU CLAIRE, WISCONSIN: General Mills test-markets White Stripes cereal. Participants report a rise in general sexiness; the swagger index quadruples. People greet each other with cool, quick nods, slightly puckering their lips. Mail carriers make devil-horn hand-gestures to suggest that tailgaters pass. See, Ryan Pitchfork makes us wear these teal beepers 24-7, even if we're going to a waterslide park. I was working at Cinnabon at the mall last week, and he beeped me, and I called him back and he said he wanted to hear me eating a Cinnabun while I talked to him. I reminded him I'm hypoglycemic; he reminded me that he was the boss. He promised me free Barfsurfer and Hymenella promos. I ate for him, and then he said, ""Let's review the old Stripes records that Sympathy never sent us."" And I said, ""What's the point? Nothing new can be said about the Stripes."" And he said, ""Just compare and contrast, like in high school. Reinforce their greatness. And leave yourself out of the review this time; you're like an aborted fetus trying to win your parents' love. Richard-San doesn't pull that needy shit."" Then he asked if there was a Gingiss Formalwear at my mall, because he wanted to hear sequins crumpling next time we talked. ""Get gussied up,"" he said, and I said, ""Ai'ight,"" and he said, ""Audi 5000."" Cinnabon fired me, but I was tight with this skeezer at Successories, so we just switched aprons. I'm delaying actually confronting these records because they don't conjure a hunched-before-a-besotted-Compaq vibe. This band's rock is so imposing that you want to be in some kind of motion to describe it. You shouldn't wuss around it, or intellectualize to it. You'll headbang involuntarily. You've got to hear the Stripes' albums; if I explain them to you, you'll picture a novelty band that peaks on a public access talent show. But Jack White's in that league with Isaac Brock; some weird, earnest quantity about their best work (realness, maybe?) deflates irony-dependent artholes, pointing out how lodestone-free our hands and pockets remain. You don't want to be the lame-ass clicking a Microsoft mouse in the presence of this adrenal crunch. Witnessing White Blood Cells and then De Stijl and then the self-titled debut is similar to watching the undeveloping photograph that begins the film Memento's retrograde arc. The listener can hear how the band leapfrogged to greatness with each release. The first adjustment that De Stijl requires is that you get used to the guitar not taking up as much awesome space as it does on White Blood Cells. And in places, the first-day-with-the-new-rhythm drums are ""Hotel Yorba"" sloppy, infinitesimally behind. And Jack sounds nasal every now and then. That said, these strong songs hold their own against Cells, as Jack scrapes the strings here and lets them shriek there-- and when she's on, Meg's channeling of Little Red Riding Bonham leaves potholes. People pounce on the Stripes' Zep-a-billy, but damn, you've got to respect a band that, while covering Son House's ""Death Letter,"" compresses all the atmosphere of stadium dinosaurs into a streetcorner act. No mere duo's made this much noise since Eric B and Rakim. The acoustic sweep of ""I'm Bound to Pack It Up"" manages to homage the Who, Floyd, the Kinks and Zep, not to mention its lofty adherence to the rambler-wanderer tradition. The crisp ""Apple Blossom"" could be a Revolver outtake. The Stripes' blues obsession is more evident here than on Cells; in addition to the dedication to Blind Willie McTell, songs 7-9 feature some mellow, mellow slide leads, and ""Hello Operator"" rips into a harp solo. These gestures are performed with the same heedful regard as the Stones' similar nods-- a hymnic tone prevents them from oozing into blues-aping caricatures, or the diluted Caucasian appropriations that clog rock history. The wailing vox of ""Let's Build a Home"" suggest AC/DC's Bon Scott, another blues-influenced metal god whose act was great when it stuck to making brassy rock about the hollowing universals of fumbled desire and spiritual homelessness. You can barely buy the heartbreak because it's delivered so cockily. I've alluded to a lot of old-school bands (whoops-- left out Sabbath), but I contend that De Stijl is progressively derivative, as opposed to, say, the Mooney Suzuki, who should be paying royalties to a handful of bands, some as recent as Mudhoney. The Stripes' oddly conventional subjects (domesticity, marriage, optimism) distinguish them, and they have heartiness of style to spare. The disc's packaging juxtaposes the band's Willy Wonka fetish with museum pomp; the liner notes contain a manifesto on simplicity, and God comes first on a list of ""those who helped in the making of this record."" Opener ""You're Pretty Good Looking"" best combines the band's skills, and hints at Cells' heavy gleam. This song flexes serious pop muscle, and contains the non-sequitur and surrealist touches that give Cells its mystic, mythic penumbra (backs are broken, thoughts are stolen, the year 2525 looms). Only Cells' guitar ballast keeps the legitimately exciting De Stijl in check; the skeleton of the Stripes' breakthrough was clearly already intact. The debut is, predictably, an altogether more raw affair, with not enough variations on the theme. Meg's balancing presence is the only thing saving the album from induction in the saloon-door-violating big-dick guitarchives. The album's Detroitness is transparent, and its blues aren't nearly as reconciled with its punk. Some of the staccato riffs seem to have speech impediments. No Beatles ghost triggers the Ouija board. A slightly distorted Jack yelps and squeals and sounds tinny by about the twelfth cut, a far cry from the visceral prophecy and pronunciamento of Cells ""Dead Leaves and the Dirty Ground."" The record is saucy, but ultimately not as arresting as the others, even though the arrangements are just as winningly unadorned. Well, except for the tunes where Meg's approaching army tank-tread drums are reverbed, as if the band is masking their spare sound the way straight-to-video horror movies attempt to camouflage their low production values. ""Sucker Drips"" is uncharacteristically thin, and the sassy plod of ""Astro"" dates back to the, uh, (cough) Cramps. The cover of Dylan's ""One More Cup of Coffee"" displays excellent taste and replaces the original's violins (and Emmylou Harris) with some dope organ, but the tempo-- and Jack's half-tribute sinus inflection-- bring the party down. Colossal offerings abound, though: the three chords that constitute ""Little People"" embody the sound of rock insisting on its own supremacy. The ode to alienation ""When I Hear My Name"" is rife with blistering ""mmmms"" and ""whoah-ohh-ohh-ohhs."" A different Blind Willie, this one a Johnson, gets an uncredited updating on ""Cannon,"" a rousing rendition of the apocalyptic ""John the Revelator."" Robert Plant's quivering androgyny gets a thorough reworking on the bratty, double-timing ""Screwdriver."" Every Brit band who's ever blown an amp before you were born gets amalgamized on ""Jimmy the Exploder."" And ass is simply kicked by the falsetto twists and Pepsi-bottle percussion breakdowns of ""Broken Bricks."" The debut rocks in turbo-increments, but its statement is fussy and loping. A standoffish, reclusive element (manifesting itself in Jack's scream of ""don't wanna be social"") is more disagreeable and difficult than the entirety of the other, more accommodating records to follow. The puerile veneer that has driven some to judge the Stripes as stunted in their tweens is yet to emerge, although many fans in their thirties have voiced gratitude for a band that can be counted on to help them forget that they have kids to beat and dishes to break. This scrappy band's not dumb and it ain't a fluke-- the Stripes could do their rock 'n' roll homework in their sleep. They linked underground noise to American roots, validating it at long last! Thank fate that the Stripes are finally making the indie rock lobby less effing stuffy, after all those tweedy, post-Tortoise Ph.D'd doops cramped everybody's style! I want somebody to play their guitar like the four horsemen just unplugged all the teleprompters! Who else could pull off the two-person thing? (Not Swearing At Motorists.) The uniform thing? (Not The Make-Up.) The candy? (Not Sammy.) Feel no shame in climbing aboard the Stripes' double-decker fanwagon. Just act like you're getting one of these albums for a less-hip friend, or purchase something really obscure along with it, like a Vocokesh or When People Were Shorter and Lived Near the Water album. Hooray for civilization, I didn't talk covetously about Meg's bod! We don't need another hero! Uncross your eyes! There's gravel in the bubblegum! This ain't juvenilia, bitch, it's rawk!","Jack and Meg White's first two raucous platters are given the reissue treatment.

Heathen,David Bowie,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a360ea9e61561daa4c71/1:1/w_160/086a0cd9.jpg,2002-06-16 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/882-heathen/,ColumbiaISO,"I'm tired of attending funerals for David Bowie's career. I mean, they're always pleasant, catered affairs, and the chance to hobnob with a star-studded crowd of washed-up mourners like Lou Reed and Iggy Pop is undeniably great, but David never actually shows up. Critics have tried to write him off for more than a decade, and his work has been mostly sub-par even longer. But somehow, some way, he's managed to scrape together enough of the old Bowie charm on every release to keep alive the hope that he might just have one final hurrah left in him. Unlike some of his contemporaries (I'm looking at you, Iggy), he might, conceivably, still have a fighting chance. But while everyone's busy measuring his latest work against the towering legacy of Ziggy and the Spiders and looking ahead to his next last gasp, it would be easy to overlook that Heathen is the best Bowie release in years. But so what? Bowie committed the unpardonable sin of being too good, too soon. For an artist to produce an album as exquisitely relevant and inventive as Hunky Dory is rare, but to follow it with the colossus of Ziggy Stardust, and even Aladdin Sane, Low, and Scary Monsters-- he made genius sound so easy. With those first few groundbreaking albums, though, he utterly screwed himself. The shadow of his early work will follow him forever, and having hit the twilight of his career after tripping and falling over that 1987 snot-rocket, Never Let Me Down, it has loomed larger than ever. Heathen will surely be condemned by those who cannot forgive him for his past greatness, and will likely be loved by a few who still imagine strains of ""Space Oddity"" beneath its refrains. It's hard to shake the thought that even thirty years later, some people still seem to be expecting another Ziggy. Yet Heathen doesn't herald a second coming for David Bowie-- not by a longshot. The youthful urgency of his early work is long gone. But that hasn't stopped him from making an album that is easily his best work since the halcyon days of faux-cockney accents and gender bending theatrics a la Scary Monsters, and that's good news. Bowie seems to have finally realized that he's just been trying too damn hard. Where 2000's Hours was a brooding, wrist-slitting account of Bowie's laments about growing old and irrelevant, Heathen is the sound of acceptance. He's relaxed, even serene, and the songs clearly reflect this with a nonchalant charm reminiscent of the Bowie of old. This is not a particularly cheery record: ""Sunday"" is a somber, almost sinister chant that builds into an ascending chorus of warm synths and percussion-- a tense, minimal remix of the best moments of Earthling, if you will. In what will surely be the song most often quoted by record critics, ""Slip Away,"" Bowie muses: ""Some of us will always stay behind/ Down in space it's always 1982/ The joke we always knew,"" a brief moment of smiling recognition at the state of his career, fans, and detractors in the wake of his past glory days. Gorgeous and sad, it evokes the simplicity of the past as Bowie sings of ""sailing over Coney Island"" to a lone piano melody and a compelling Moog-y electronic refrain. ""Slow Burn"" is the strongest of Bowie's original material on Heathen-- a moody, bouncy piece with a bass/sax combo that vaguely elicits a 60s pop undercurrent with guitar work from Pete Townshend (yeah, that Pete Townshend!). Townshend's help here is appreciated, mostly because it means the guitar isn't being played by Reeves Gabrels. If Bowie had considered bringing him in earlier, he could have avoided the horror of a car crash like Hours' ""The Pretty Things Are Going to Hell."" Fortunately, Townshend's guitar noodling never steps into the realm of being entirely gratuitous, and as with all the best songs on Heathen, Bowie's vocals are wisely left to dominate. But oddly, it's the covers that are truly the highlight of the album. Bowie tries his hand at the Pixies' ""Cactus"" (a move which might make the album's title sound ironically appropriate)-- but take a deep breath. Everything's going to be okay. Mercifully, he handles the song very faithfully, and actually does it justice. He's a far cry from Black Francis, but Bowie's voice is so amazingly distinctive that it almost sounds like a different song. He then moves on to Neil Young's ""I've Been Waiting for You."" I don't know what's caused the current rash of Neil Young covers lately, but at least Bowie's old enough to make this sound a little more natural than most might. Bowie hasn't touched rock 'n' roll like this in years, and that he can still carry it off this well is a pleasant surprise. Heathen's piece de resistance, though, is the phenomenal cover of ""I Took a Trip In a Gemini Spaceship"" by The Legendary Stardust Cowboy. Name-based alter ego issues aside, this song is smooth. It's got a fast-paced electronic rhythm to quicken the pulse, and dulcet tones to soothe the ear-- nothing but laid-back electropop fun from start to finish. It's the kind of thing they'll be playing in the lounge of the International Space Station in about ten years or so, assuming the capsule doesn't get pimped out as an orbiting bachelor pad for N*SYNC or something stupid like that. Bowie is obviously never going to recapture his trend-setting finesse of yesteryear, but at least he seems okay with that. And that's this record's greatest strength. Back when he was busy reminding everyone how out of it he really was by touring with Trent Reznor, he started to play ""The Man Who Sold the World"" and I actually heard a kid, maybe only two years younger than me, say, ""Oh, cool. He's covering a Nirvana song."" If that's not a warning sign, I don't know what is. Yes, David, the music world is moving on without you, but you can't end things with Heathen-- some of us, myself included, are still waiting for that final blaze of glory. Before you go, you've got to let the kids know what they missed out on.","I'm tired of attending funerals for David Bowie's career. I mean, they're always pleasant, catered affairs, and ...

Loss,Mull Historical Society,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c40aea9e61561daa8069/1:1/w_160/b9943fa5.jpg,2002-06-16 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5499-loss/,XL,"Do you long for the pop of a past era-- say, the early 70s? Do you like lots of instruments, whether they all belong in a song or not? Are you into artists who seem to be full bands at first, but then turn out to be just one guy with lots of musical friends? Well, if you answered yes to any of those inquiries, come with me, I'd like to take you on a tour of the Mull Historical Society. If you answered no to all of them, come along anyway-- we won't be long. As your guide to the Mull Historical Society, I'd like to note that it's not my job to stick up for the Society's output so much as it is to inform you about the Society and all it has to offer. With this in mind, let's proceed directly to an overview before delving a little more deeply: Mull Historical Society is not a full band, nor even a society, but rather the creative vehicle of songwriter Scottish Colin MacIntyre. MacIntyre nets a massive haul of guest players, choirs and orchestras to serve his compositions, in much the same way that Neil Hannon used to for the Divine Comedy, or, perhaps more aptly, in the same way that Jake Shillington does for My Life Story. The vintage of his songcraft is probably about 1971 or so, though the production and arranging techniques he implements are more modern. MacIntyre's voice is a high, nasal whine, extremely similar to Kevin Junior of the Chamber Strings, or kind of like Lindsay Buckingham with a slight cold. It serves his classicist pop melodies quite well, and you could never accuse him of writing out of his range or being off in his delivery. The real problem arises from the fact that, while his songs are fundamentally simple, MacIntyre would prefer you didn't realize how basic they are, piling on everything and the kitchen sink in a transparent attempt to cover up the lacking songwriting. The supersize approach works for some of the songs, but by and large, these tracks suffocate under overambitious arrangements. The good news is, there are some really good songs here-- even if some of them are hidden under impenetrable piles of arrangement. And there are even a few that aren't hidden at all, like ""This Is Not Who We Were,"" one of the few songs that gets up off its ass and ramps up the tempo up a bit. It almost rocks! ""Animal Cannabus"" gets by mostly unscathed, too, though a preponderance of add-on synths and bells threatens it several times. The best song, though, is probably ""Watching Xanadu."" Why, if it had only been released 27 years ago, you'd be hearing it on those midnight ads for those AM Gold CDs that nobody actually seems to have in their collection when you come to visit. Still, it'll certainly get the guilty pleasure juice boiling in your loins, with its remarkably infectious chorus and swooning Burt Bacharach candor. But then there's the rest, and though you could hardly call any of it flat out bad, most of it suffers from one or more afflictions that keep it from being all that engaging. ""Barcode Bypass"" is probably the sparsest song here, and its weird, dark choral ending is pretty neat, but god only knows why they chose to drag it out to the seven-minute mark, stretching it further than it could realistically stay interesting. ""Public Service Announcer"" and ""I Tried"" collapse under their own weight before they can really get going anywhere; ""Only I"" is like Rufus Wainwright Jr. with a bigger orchestra and an overload of trumpet bombast. ""Mull Historical Society"" functions not only as MacIntyre's signature song, but also as his project's aggressive human resources department, beckoning ""Come on and join us"" over and over again amidst a ridiculous arrangement of horns, synthesized steel drums and electronics that's so cluttered it makes my desk look orderly. The Mull Historical Society Children's Choir struggles to inject life into the leaden beat of ""Instead,"" but can barely be heard over the orchestra and a barrage of effects. And that concludes our little tour. At this point, you should have a fairly good idea of what to expect from Mull Historical Society. Really, if MacIntyre didn't overpopulate his songs with so many sounds, he could have a pretty decent record on his hands. But as it stands, he does, and it hurts this album a lot. Less is more, and Loss is middling.","Do you long for the pop of a past era-- say, the early 70s? Do you like lots of instruments ...

The Big Ka-Boom,Jello Biafra,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a299ea9e61561daa4aa6/1:1/w_160/97fcfec7.jpg,2002-06-16 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/687-the-big-ka-boom/,Alternative Tentacles,"This morning finds our erstwhile reviewer sipping the last of the coffee, periodically going to the porch to check up with her loafing roommates, investigating the dust on the baseboard. So I've got two things to do today, basically: a) find meaningful, and well-paying employment in Chapel Hill; and b) review a Jello Biafra spoken word CD. I have successfully managed to put off writing this review for so long that my Pitchfork editors have hired surly tough guys to shadow me and threaten to feed my fingers to a vice. (It's in the contract.) The cunning student of letters and/or psychology will note I have employed an oft-used rhetorical device to avoid saying anything about the record at hand. For some inexplicable reason, I'm drawing a complete blank on witty remarks and scatological epithets to hurl at the one-time San Francisco mayoral candidate, ex-Dead Kennedy, and master of Lard, so I'll just say in my defense: The Big Ka-Boom is a 35-minute anti-war speech delivered to a rip-roaring crowd of enthusiastic sophomore political science majors and art students at the University of Wisconsin in November of 2001. Biafra's riffs on the 9/11 incident, the Bush Administration's mode of dealing with the 9/11 incident, the Middle East crisis, America's oil habit, the suspension of civil liberties-- none will be particularly revelatory to the erudite readers of this screed; Biafra and I sit on roughly the same side of the ideological fence. Very little of what he says is objectionable-- in fact, he's fairly reasonable and articulate. Even his tone is friendly. Consider it Chomsky Lite, if you will. All the energy and left-wing populist appeal of the MIT linguist/political theorist without the high calorie, multi-syllabic vocabulary and self-adulation; One could make a valid argument that Biafra resents the growing popularity of Chomsky among sub-25-year-old punk rockers turned radical namedroppers, and has resolved to do something about it, but that person is not going to be me. I fear the wrath of the activist, anarchist, anti-globalization, pseudo-intellectual horde who might convene in my front yard to demand my head on a pike, to be thrown through the window of the Starbucks on Franklin Street; Most of you, understandably, come to Pitchfork for a welcome reprieve from political rhetoric. The people have spoken, and the people want to read about Eminem, The Strokes, underground hip-hop, puzzling electronica, and Elephant 6 side projects; How in holy hell am I supposed to apply the existing Pitchfork rating scale to a speech given to a bunch of college students at the University of Michigan? You want to know if it's good? Well, compared to what? Radiohead? Abbie Hoffman? What constitutes a 10.0 speech, anyway? The Gettysburg Address? Strictly speaking, The Big Ka-Boom doesn't even conform to the conventional aesthetic excesses of spoken word. You can nod, clap politely, shake a fist every now and then, and maybe raise your voice for a good ""By God, you are right, sir!""-- but dancing is patently out of the question; If I tell you precisely what is said, what reason would you have to listen to the CD? I mean, I probably couldn't accurately capture the exact tone with which Biafra derisively snorts ""Don't Mess With Texas"" when speaking of Dubya, but really, it's a speech, people. While I'm in general agreement with the gist of what is said, I'm not completely enamored with the sideshow histrionics of its delivery. So, if you were already planning on buying this CD, there's nothing I could possibly say to dissuade you, though I will say that none of the ideas present on this record are particularly original. Better-informed, more articulate political analysts and theorists have dedicated pages to the same issues addressed by The Big Ka-Boom. By and large, they don't happen to be former punk rock figureheads-- which is ultimately the end-all-be-all of this CD, and the source of my reluctance to recommend it.","This morning finds our erstwhile reviewer sipping the last of the coffee, periodically going to the porch to check up ...

Witchcraft Rebellion,Old Time Relijun,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9b6ea9e61561daa7050/1:1/w_160/34fbaf8a.jpg,2002-06-16 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5968-witchcraft-rebellion/,K,"It's a fine line that separates the ragged stomp and swagger of Old Time Relijun and the borderline blackface routine of Jon Spencer and his Blues-ploitation, but it's an important one. Rather than rely or clich√©s, milking them for comedic effect or just for a strutting, self-congratulatory wank-off, Old Time Relijun takes the blues and twists it into a contorted, freakish figure similar to the way Captair Beefheart's early Magic Band did, complete with lyrics that seem pulled out of a peyote-eater's dream journal. Old Time Relijun revolves around Olympia-based songwriter/multi-instrumentalist Arrington de Dionyso. The band started as a one-man deal, but over time de Dionyso recruited other Olympians to help his cause. For some time now, Old Time Relijun's drummer has been Phil Elvrum from the Microphones (lo-fi indie rock's great white hope). He also recorded Witchcraft Rebellion, and it features a few of his by-now-expected marks of idiosyncratic brilliance, though he mostly keeps the twists and turns to a minimum, relying instead on a trebly, tense sound. As his name would seem to suggest, Dionyso sings like some drunker ecstatic lunatic when he's not doing his best Beefheart imitation. At his strangest and most compelling, he sounds like a Mongoliar throat-singing Popeye. Needless to say, it's one of those voices you're going to either love or hate immediately-- I happened to love it. As for his lyrics, here's a good sample from the disc-opening ""Mystery Language"": ""I can take off my head and so can my dad/ In the grocery store it falls on the floor..."" You get the idea-- even the band's name is cribbed from Beefheart (Mr. Van Vliet's refrain or ""Moonlight on Vermont""). Yet Old Time Relijun have clearly developed their eccentricities to such a high degree that they distinguish themselves beyond mere imitators. Those with the aural endurance to make it through Witchcraft Rebellion's early sonic assaults will discover hints of dub, Motown, post-punk angularity, and hipster-jive poetry strewn throughout the album. ""Cuneform"" starts out like classic Beefheartian chang-ba, but ends sounding like a vintage Nick Cave rant-- uh, if Cave had ever ranted about archaeology. Elsewhere, ""Mercury Snake"" is a dirty slow jam coupled with the strangled blasts of a sax trying to turn itself inside out, and ""King of Nothing"" sounds like Sebadoh as fronted by the aforementioned spinach-eatin' sailor man. The problem with most modern bands who take a lot of their cues from Beefheart is that they almost always ignore the wild sense of humor present in a lot of his music, focusing instead on Beefheart's more serious, conceptual, and high-minded aspects. I'm mainly thinking of U.S. Maple here, and they serve as a good foil to Old Time Relijun ir terms of bands heavily influenced by the good Captain. Old Time Relijun takes Beefheart's more playful elements and runs, synthesizing them with a shambling melange of clatter and junkyard funk. And in doing so, they transcend their influences by out-conceptualizing the conceptualists.","It's a fine line that separates the ragged stomp and swagger of Old\r\n\ Time Relijun and the ...

It's long been a source of speculation in the Detroit techno community: Who is Drexciya? Mike Banks from Underground Resistance? An alias for retired auteur Derrick May? Who? My personal take is, ""Who cares?"" If those guys want to keep their identities secret, that's fine by me. I don't much need a face to put with instrumental electronic music anyway, and you can count on two hands the number of producers with something interesting to say outside the studio. As far as I'm concerned, Drexciya are really a race of underwater humans descended from the pregnant slaves thrown overboard from slave ships, as their lore suggests. My lack of knowledge about Drexciya hasn't stopped me from enjoying Harnessed the Storm, their release early this year on Berlin's purist techno label Tresor, and it's not going to affect my enjoyment of this record by The Other People Place. On this evidence, it certainly sounds like The Other People Place comes from the same mind as someone in Drexciya. The beats are similarly rigid, the synth programming is likewise rooted in early electropop, and the track structure walks the line between electro and techno. Still, the differences between the projects are significant. Lifestyles of the Laptop Cafe is much more relaxed, with slow-to-mid tempos and a velvety sonic palette. It's almost downtempo meets techno; the beats are leisurely but stiff as the most uptight Kraftwerk, and they never nod in the direction of syncopation. There's a fair amount of weird humor here, too. ""Eye Contact"" has a recurring sexual grunt serving as a riff and contains a monologue featuring a latte-slurping narrator suffering from ""transmitter overload"" as he spies a gorgeous babe in the cafe, all delivered in a tone like Barry White if he suffered from autism. ""Running from Love"" brilliantly combines a frightfully deep and churning bass pattern, assorted high-end synth squelches, and a pinched, robotic voice saying something about moonlight and love. But not all the vocal accents here are emotionally constipated or used for humor. The vocals in ""You Said You Want Me,"" though clipped and incomplete, are from the melodramatic Depeche Mode school, and it's chilling how well they compliment the melancholy piano theme that winds through the track. ""Let Me Be Me"" is straight Detroit techno, with 4/4 beats and cheap high-hat flourishes, but the booming ""let me be what I want to be"" vocal refrain ratchets up the tension. This is not a record that stand up and says, ""Hey! Look at me!"" Much of the charm of Lifestyles of the Laptop Cafe comes from its subtlety. The beats, sounds and attitudes are muted and expertly designed. Where it came from, we may never know, but whoever put this thing together knows what (s)he is doing.

Italian Platinum,Silkworm,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3ff13d1975652138bed/1:1/w_160/7812f576.jpg,2002-06-13 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7157-italian-platinum/,Touch and Go,"Tour the Art Institute on Silkworm's Chicago turf and use reverse chronology as the organizing principal of your walkthrough. Start in the contemporary art rooms and move through four-hundred-plus years of Individual Masters, then a long ways back to the rooms showcasing ancient pieces. You can work up a pretty good bummer realizing how you're forced to herald the lone, rare Singular Geniuses, only to end up looking at treasures made by anonymous members of communities in which most people were artisans of some kind, capable of at least perfunctorily creative craftsmanship. If you're in the right pissy, generalizing mood, you can wonder if we slather over Geniuses out of a kind of guilt because they tap into something that we deep-down know shouldn't be so rare. Since most of us can barely figure out how to feed ourselves, we jump at the chance to applaud anyone with some leftover specialness. The whole mess is enough to make you tired of the accidental fascism of Geniuses filling supposedly organic 'leadership vacuums,' offering us chances to confirm our inferiority as we stand in the crowd at their concerts, or go to their movies, or read their books, viewing our consumption of them as sufficiently sophisticated and 'artistic' enough to justify the rest of our afternoon's being spent playing video games or bitching at our sex-pals or staring at the ceiling or crying into our cans of Surge. Okay, that kneejerk theory is stoops: I know that 'the people' aren't going to rise up from quoting Aflac commercials to start an artistic revolution, and even if it did happen I bet I'd sleep through the best parts. Even back-burner geniuses have consistent work ethics. Plus, those shangri-la ancient art-cultures probably didn't have access to convenient toilets of every personality-reflecting color. Alls I'm saying is that we gotta practice moderation and stop demanding that every album announce an Elvrum or Mangum or Yorke. As soon as you ease up on the need for a new disposable Jesus to mimic, you realize that there's a lot to be said for the refreshing geniuslessness of bands like Silkworm. Silkworm has no star to fantasize about sleeping with. No dominating image or attitude emerges to influence your hairstyle. The lyrics never leave you throttled by the image of them being read out of a Damn-I'm-Clever Notebook #47. Instead of life-affirming passion, their albums, Italian Platinum gloriously included, offer subtle slapstick nihilism. Their website makes several references to how shocked they are that they still exist, and it dubs their own discography ""shit we have shat."" Their concert journals humbly acknowledge that their slippery fit-rock is often incidental music for drunks to fidget and commingle to. Maybe the Genius thing is a factor in sustainability; it's hard to listen to what Pavement and Silkworm were doing ten years ago and conclude that Silkworm would outlast the other. They get overlooked as old-guard almost-weres, but an elite armada of folks with extensive CD budgets remain rightfully grateful for their unambitious clamor. Italian Platinum, whose packaging is so minimal that it's a waste of paper, is the band's best release since 1996's whoopass and splashy Firewater, though it just sounds like uninviting racket the first time you hear it, and it continues Firewater's preoccupation with alcohol. In other words, if Firewater is their OK Libations, this disc is their Kid AA-- slightly more penitent and therefore a great soundtrack for a punitive post-hangover jog. Anyone who has ever dropped a bottle opener and then broken their finger trying to get it out from behind the fridge will appreciate ""Bourbon Beard"" and its sloshy, regretful counterparts. Coach Albini once again corroborates their convulsive assault, micing the guitars and vocals warmly, while the bass and drums maintain his standard warplane-hangar dynamics. The sound is earthily underscored by all manner of piano, organ, clavinet, and synthy touches, as well as guest vocalist Kelly Hogan's counterintuitive heartthroat. Silkworm brings the chops, working odd pauses into their solos like J. Mascis undergoing physical therapy. Riffs abound, some Kirk Hammett fretfests go down, and whammy bars occasionally peer out to inspire air-guitarists everywhere. The abundance of classic tropes (axe histrionics, anthemic refrain buildups, epic breakdowns, backup 'bops' and 'oohs') will leave you trying to gauge the band's sincerity. Are they spoofing what's been done to death, or nominating themselves as deserving candidates to give the oft-resurrected rock horse a respectful, hellacious kick? Italian Platinum is a slow-burner, an acquired taste, like, uh, Pawpaw's hard liquor. It grew on everyone I know who was in proximity to multiple spins, reducing several of them to murmuring choruses from hits like the opener ""(I Hope U) Don't Survive,"" the retro shoutalong ""The Old You,"" the no-wave ""The Brain,"" the pollution-happy hoedown ""Dirty Air,"" and the clunkily-titled but killer ""A Cockfight of Feelings,"" a mud-puddle reminder that the verse-chorus-verse formula can be a lil' abstruse. Even the subdued, repetitive ""Moving,"" which is about moving in the unmetaphorical way that the Go-Gos' ""Vacation"" was about vacations, colonizes your tune-lobe. If only radio switched to an all-scab format, Silkworm's lurch-and-bounce could be credited for embracing the obvious throb of concise garage-prog-- a style you could call, to quote one of this album's few bombs, ""world-proof.""","Tour the Art Institute on Silkworm's Chicago turf and use reverse chronology as the organizing principal of your walkthrough ...

Something Wicked This Way Comes,The Herbaliser,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0ba5e6ef959693235cd/1:1/w_160/c7b39c2a.jpg,2002-06-13 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3831-something-wicked-this-way-comes/,Ninja Tune,"Jazz music has been called the only art form to originate entirely within the United States. Coincidentally, it's also the only art form to have died entirely within the United States. Following the birth of jazz in the early part of the 20th century, the genre hit its stride during the 40s, 50s and 60s. Although traditional jazz had faded by the 70s, it still had Herbie, Miles and others innovating and developing fusion and funk. But by the 80s, funk was all-licked out, and jazz appeared to be on life support. Zorn and his cohorts managed to draw new life and new sounds from the genre in the NYC underground of the 1980s, but smooth jazz pulled the plug clean out as far as the mainstream world was concerned. Led by Dave Koz, Kenny G, Spyro Gyra, David Sanborn, and other assorted white people, its soothing, inoffensive approach made for a peaceful, if undignified death for jazz music's public acceptance. Workaday music unenthusiasts were so entranced that they failed to even notice its passing. But one look at DownBeat, or one glance at the jazz section in your local Tower, and you knew-- jazz as we once knew it was through. Finished. What defined the new crap was also the clever adjective that described it: smooth. In order to reach the desired level of smoothness, each artist aimed for perfect equilibrium. Every musical element lent to a delicate balance, and the idea of extending oneself from that balance was strictly verboten. Each instrument was always to be locked-in, locked-down, and airtight. The ideal result was flawlessness in execution. The nasty side effect was remarkable inanity. Hip-hop producers The Herbaliser's newest release, Something Wicked This Way Comes, doesn't nearly approach the sins of smooth jazz, but their shortcomings are similar. The Herbaliser, like smooth jazz, is clearly in the game to pump out product of the baby's-butt variety. They feature a polished, precise production approach that delivers exactly what it promises-- near flawlessness. Unfortunately, organizing pieces into common and predictable templates, and utilizing familiar, hackneyed hooks and grooves is more often than not a pretty boring idea. Loose, buttery R&B; basslines drive this disc, with simple breakbeats and a cast of blaxploitation- and disco-era accoutrements (including string/horn sections, harpsichords, vibraphones, mellotron, and that old standby, scratched upon porno percussion) tossed in to add some 'flavor.' The grooves are solid enough, and occasionally pretty fierce-- ""The Turnaround"" borders on New Orleans funk, and yep, it's awfully tight. And on a few tracks, MCs show up to rhyme, ranging in success from the hot (""Time 2 Build"" [feat. Blade] and ""It Ain't Nuttin'"" [feat. MF Doom]), to the merely passable (""Verbal Anime"" [feat. Iriscience of Dilated Peoples, as well as an illogical chorus]), right down to pure gag-me putrous (""Good Girl Gone Bad""). But at the end of the day, Something This Way Comes fails to distinguish itself. The beats are just fine, but they lack the risk or innovation that could potentially make them truly engaging. Moreover, it's old music; every beat on here is something you've heard before, be it in a bad 70s flick, a New Orleans jazz club, or your own hip-hop collection. In fact, there's little on the disc that can't be supplanted with a spicier funk or jazz collection. No, those records might not boast today's hottest and hippest underground MCs, but they aren't bogged down with wack 1997isms, either. I'm just sayin'.","Jazz music has been called the only art form to originate entirely within the United States. Coincidentally, it's also ...

The Curse of...,Selby Tigers,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a39d9d034d5c69bf2e7e/1:1/w_160/136573c6.jpg,2002-06-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7064-the-curse-of/,Hopeless,"Poor St. Paul, Minnesota. Perennially overshadowed by its big brother Minneapolis in the Twin Cities tag-team, St. Paul is the jelly to Minneapolis' peanut butter, having to constantly remind tourists and map makers that it hasn't been swallowed up by its neighbor to the west. Sure, all the nice people I know from Minnesota insist that St. Paul is where the real action is, but I'm not convinced that all the little St. Paulians don't harbor a serious inferiority complex against their conjoined sibling. Perhaps it's that very psychological scar that has St. Paul's The Selby Tigers so darn hoppin' angry. After all, at one point on this record, singer/guitarist Nathan Grumdahl simultaneously boasts and pleads that ""this is an underground town, underground and secret at best!"" Of course, since the Tigers don't hail from the nouveau garage rock capitals of Detroit, NYC, or, uh, Sweden, it's understandable that they might be a bit defensive about the humble Midwestern setting for their own carport jams (even going so far as to namedrop St. Paul's illustrious Selby Avenue in their bandname). To compensate for this geographic handicap, the band's gotta strum them guitars just a little bit harder, kick up the drumbeat just a little bit faster, and make their album sound just a little more raggedy. Which is pretty much what the Selby Tigers do on their second album, The Curse of the Selby Tigers. And I dare say they throw down the rawk pretty well. Like most bands of the gee-rage scene (by my Warhol watch, now on it's 11th minute), the Tigers owe a lot more to late-70s punk than to the Count Five and ""Mony Mony,"" and with their male/female vocal dynamic, one often expects them to start chanting ""Johnny hit and run Pauline"" at any moment. Hey, these kids are even married, and the marital vibe gives them a torn-jeans leg up on their peers, with Grumdahl's snotty punk vox clashing lovingly against spouse Arzu Gokcen's gallant attempts to critically injure her vocal cords. Such beautiful punk-rock chemistry is absolutely necessary to deliver a song like ""Punch Me in the Face (With Your Lips)"" with the proper amount of gutter romance (does St. Paul have gutters?). Grumdahl and Gokcen have obviously perfected the ancient art of Fleetwood Mac-itude, giving each of their songs that ""are they singing about each other?"" edge that makes for delightfully uncomfortable listening. Not that their songs are all valentine hearts and candy boxes; a wide variety of topics are covered lyrically. ""Cheerleading Is a Big Business,"" for instance, features the telling line, ""All the jocks WOAH kitzo kitzo!"" or... something. Okay, so the lyrics are kind of hard to discern, but you don't exactly look for Dylan in a group like this. Generally, the Selby Tigers' one-take-and-print-it, rumble-bass, surfy-drums, spit-on-the-microphone, dive bar soundtracks are above average (say, 70th percentile). The band even genuinely hits the jackpot once with ""Down in Uppertown"" and its ominous ""roll with me tonight"" pre-chorus bridge. Conversely, they also hit the crap-pot twice with the cutesy irony-overkill of ""The Prom I Never Had"" and a failed attempt at scariness on ""Neighbor with a Defect."" Everything else is unsurprising but agreeable jump-up-and-down music, great for working those quads and bothering the financial consultants downstairs. If they complain, just tell 'em you're helping some St. Paulians wrestle with their subconscious feelings of neglect and inadequacy. They'll understand.","Poor St. Paul, Minnesota.

Free All Angels,Ash,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a117ea9e61561daa46fa/1:1/w_160/9d0b9610.jpg,2002-06-12 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/309-free-all-angels/,Kinetic,"I remember when summers actually meant something. It was time off from school and homework and structure, time to get all dirty and pretend you were something you weren't-- like a pirate or an astronaut or Optimus Prime or something. Those really were the days, I guess. These days, it's summer and I have to go spend eight hours of my day in a climate-controlled building, staring at a computer and making copies. Ah, but such is life. You need shelter overhead, after all. It's a fair bet to say that Ash probably have all the shelter they need by now-- they've been massively popular in the UK ever since they first rocketed out of Northern Ireland with Trailer, back before they were even out of high school. Maybe it's just the fact that they achieved fame so early in life, but Ash seem now like a band caught between youth and adulthood. They're full of introspection and nostalgia lately, but the impetuousness that made their early records so enjoyable still burbles to the top on a pretty regular basis. It's a dichotomy of ideals that makes their latest full-length-- their second as a quartet and fourth overall-- a compelling listen, if a seemingly contradictory one at times. Ash finally seem to have gotten around to growing up some, but the maturity of a song like ""Walking Barefoot"" actually suits them well, especially when it's countered with some solid looks over the shoulder at a time when the 'punk' was the louder half of the band's punk-pop equation. And frequently, the newfound polish that coats the record is actually advantageous-- for example, ""Candy"" is a stately tribute to a lover, riding on clouds of swirling strings sampled from the Walker Brothers' ""Make It Easy on Yourself."" The medium tempos of ""Shining Light"" and ""There's a Star"" would have seemed like big shoes for this band to fill just a few years ago, but now they fit perfectly-- the band's evolution seems entirely natural. ""Someday, we'll leave this town/ It wears us down/ We'll leave somehow/ All its harm and all its charm/ Someday,"" Tim Wheeler sings on ""Someday."" I remember thinking this, too, when I was younger. Man, I couldn't wait to leave my hometown and experience something that I pretty much only knew as 'more.' Nowadays, I'm still eager to test out the possibilities of the world and see new places, but when I think of my hometown, I seem to place a lot more emphasis on the charm than the harm. I go back there now and see all the new developments that used to be farms and forests and it makes me pretty sick to see how the place where I grew up is being raped of its rural atmosphere. Wheeler seems to be caught in this same place on Free All Angels-- he wants to get out and see the world, but he also seems to understand that what he's leaving is a lot less complicated than what he's gravitating towards. On ""Sometimes,"" he's pining for a lost love, but he's also resigned to the fact that most things aren't meant to last. One of the things that's so surprising about Free All Angels is that the good-natured rocker ""World Domination,"" a song with all the brash bravado and tongue-in-cheek humor of their earliest material, isn't the only one like it. ""Shark"" is a slamming pile-up of riffs from Wheeler and second guitarist Charlotte Hatherley, while ""Pacific Palisades"" is basically Jan & Dean on a lot of ephedrine, replete with Beach Boys-esque name checks. And then there's the classic pop of ""Cherry Bomb,"" a sweet little slice of Jello cut from the same wobbly mold as such classic Ash songs as ""Girl from Mars."" It's followed by what's perhaps the most curious song on the album, the hard-grooving, lascivious ""Submission,"" which offers a bit more of the rock star posing that ""World Domination"" so enthusiastically spews. Wah pedals and-- I shit you not-- orchestral hits spice up an already hot rhythmic stew stirred up by drummer Rick McMurray and bassist Mark Hamilton. ""Wait for the summer/ It'll come 'round again,"" Wheeler sings on ""Pacific Palisades."" Well that's hopeful, now, isn't it? And that's kind of what I get out of this album. Even though we may not be as free to take off and explore possibilities and our imaginations as we were when we were all younger, it doesn't mean that imagination is gone or those possibilities are faded-- we just need to find new ways to take advantage of them. Hell, I know that's not what Ash are really getting at conceptually, but it makes a lot of sense, and I think that on Free All Angels they've expressed it. Regardless of its conceptual significance, though, Free All Angels certainly works on another level. It's a damn good pop album, with a little muscle behind its melodies to boot. And no matter where you stand on the childhood-to-adulthood spectrum, that's something just about everybody can use now and then.","I remember when summers actually meant something.

God's first two plagues were creative masterpieces: first you had the Rivers of Blood, which were supremely gross. Then, avoiding a sophomore slump, God brought massive pain with the second and ickiest of the plagues, the Swarm of Frogs. Fear the Swarm of Frogs! God quickly discovered that frogs, although annoying, were not quite annoying enough to break the will of the hard-hearted Pharaoh. So that's when he pulled out the motherfucking gnats. Yeah, gnats. The gnats managed to make both man and beast itch, including Pharaoh, who was duly annoyed. But again, not annoyed enough. Slowly, God turned gnats into boils (side note: I would have given in at boils), boils into locusts, locusts into darkness, and finally, darkness into the King of All Plagues-- that weird wind thing that swept through Egypt, killing all first-born children. Now we're talkin' plagues! Although not documented in animated movies or religious text, God stuck with the last plague as the plague of choice for future generations. The most famous of those plagues, of course, was the aptly titled Bubonic Plague, aptly titled because 'bubonic' should be a synonym for 'awesome.' The Bubonic Plague was a very dangerous disease that spread rapidly and caused many deaths at a number of points in history. The first records of the plague document the disease as wiping out Athens in 430 B.C., then later slaying 5000 a day in Rome in 262 A.D. But the plague never gained its full nasty stature and nasty nickname, The Black Death, until it crushed Europe in the 1300s, killing a full quarter of the population. So much for the Swarm of Frogs. Although modern agriculture has minimized the threat of Swarms of Frogs, and modern medicine the threat of most rapidly communicable fatal diseases, it remains that we, the music fans of the 21st century, have a plague of our own. Our plague-- like the historical plagues of yore-- torment, vex, annoy and trouble. Our plague is uniform and predictable, attacking with the same methodic formula, overburdening us with sonic monotony, and annoying us with puerile lyricism under the guise of deeply affected emotion. Our plague attacks with a cunning ruse, purporting to offer a more profound aesthetic than radio rap-rock. But be ye not fooled! Fact is, this stuff is simply Bizarro world rap-rock. It's just as thin, just as commercially driven, and just as boring. Moreover, it has spread quickly, and Liars Academy is proof. If you like The Promise Ring and The Get Up Kids, you'll appreciate knowing that Liars Academy does, too. From start to finish, No News Is Good News unwittingly plays up the stereotype of pestilence; formulaic, overdriven guitars, punkish rhythms, and candy-sweet proto-melodies, driving home typically emotive lyrics. They execute their boredom well, playing as tight as you would expect for pop music's unpopular alter ego. But alas, the bottom line is this: it blows, and blows badly. Buy it and you will seal your own fate, ordaining yourself an emo connoisseur as you dig deep into the bins of filth. You may not die, but you may wish you had when you see what it does to your wardrobe.","God, the world's first and greatest purveyor of plagues, chose a number of creative ills with which to humble ...

The Action Packed Mentallist Brings You the Fucking Jams,Kid606,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb84abf31b7dc7155aea/1:1/w_160/e5947714.gif,2002-06-12 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4409-the-action-packed-mentallist-brings-you-the-fucking-jams/,Violent Turd,"Somewhere, Kid606 is laughing. Because right now, at this very moment, some young hipster type is lounging around his parent's basement, draped in a smoking jacket, drinking his Pale Ales, stroking his soul patch, awash in the glow of some thrift-store blacklight, and not only listening to Kylie Minogue, but enjoying it. And chances are (depending on just how hip our hypothetical neo-beatnik may or may not be), he doesn't even realize it. Meanwhile, the Kid can't stop chuckling. The West Coast's foremost electronic trickster's latest effort abandons the schizophrenic rhythms of Down with the Scene and the ramshackle noize of Don't Sweat the Technics in favor of hardcore, straight-up, knock-'em-down gabber beats, twisted jungle, and rapid-fire drum-n-bass. But no one will pay attention to any of these stylistic differences, for The Action Packed Mentallist Brings You the Fucking Jams offers a gimmick that just can't be beat. See, in this fast-paced, ever-changing world, it turns out that imitation is no longer the sincerest form of flattery. These days, it's theft. Ever on top of the latest trends, Kid606's latest, the second release from the copyright infringing Violent Turd imprint, is comprised mostly of other people's songs. New wave classics and contemporary pop radio standbys all get tossed in the blender for this outing, meaning Eminem trainwrecks into the Buggles, the Bangles walk like an Egyptian alongside A-Ha, Missy gets her freak on with Jay-Z... and it goes on like this! The idea's a good one, even if it isn't his. While everyone was busy arguing over how file-trading would(n't) affect record sales, the easy access it provided to both copywritten music and to easy-to-use, free-to-download software has inadvertently been forging a whole new style of computer music. Garnering the attention of big-time pundits like Spin and the Post, this online 'bootleg' revolution sees software savants mixing two disparate, copywritten pop songs into one new seething mutation. If you haven't heard Conway's ""Smells Like Missy Elliot"" or The Freelance Hellraiser's ""Just Can't Get Enough Pills,"" then put this review on hold and hop right over to http://boomselection.n3.net right this minute, skippy. This stuff's brilliant, albeit in the trashiest, most lo-fi way imaginable. But never one to be left out in the cold, Kid606 set his sights on ripping off the rip-off artists. Earlier this year, he slapped together his own take on the phenomenon, a compilation of tweaked Missy Elliott tracks titled FreakBitchLickFly. It marked the first release from Violent Turd, a label whose operation he swears he has nothing to do with. But The Action Packed Mentallist takes things a step further-- embracing hardcore, jungle and gabber techniques, and applying them to a wider array of source material than last time around. ""MP3 Killed the Radio Star"" applies a booty-bulging four-to-the-floor aesthetic and some bluesy harmonica to a sped-up acapella from D12's ""Purple Pills"" before ramming head-on into a jungle-infused version of the Buggles track its title parodies. ""Never Underestimate the Value of a Holler (Vipee-pee mix)"", serves both as the obligatory take on ""Get Ur Freak On,"" and the album's centerpiece. It starts with a glitchified Missy/Timbaland skewering set to a pulsing jungle rhythm, slows down for an expanded instrumental section, then sidetracks while the Kid fixates on the phrase, ""Copywritten, so don't copy me."" For a minute or so, he manipulates this phrase, finally making a beat out of the phrase ""copy me"" before driving into an abyss of sheer digital noise. He never quite resurfaces. Instead, he takes the next ten minutes to slice and dice the noise with bits of Eminem, Jay Z's ""Big Pimpin',"" A-Ha's ""Take on Me"" and a few other sources too ubiquitous to mention. The results are one of the strongest arguments for the strengthening of fair use laws I've ever heard-- not to mention hilarious, irritating, unsettling, and yes, pretty damned brilliant. The rest of the album is somewhat less inspired. ""Kiddy Needs a New Pair of Laptops"" barely touches any of its source material. The female R&B; melodies that open the track seem almost totally unaltered, aside from some weird beats and tones thrown on top. The track ends with a take of the Bangles' ""Walk Like an Egyptian"" with some bulging bass and looped drums thrown in, with the whole mess run through some DSP filters. I suppose it's entertaining, but I doubt it took more than a few hours to throw together. ""This Is Not My Statement"" is a barbershop-quartet rendition of Radiohead's ""Creep,"" with a whole bunch of stuttering hard drive sounds on top. Not only do the two never match, they never seem to interact, and the piece as a whole fails to reach whatever destination it had in mind. ""Smack My Glitch Up"" barely manipulates Kylie Minogue-- after a minute or so of DSP-garbled synthlines, there's little more than a few extra beats to distinguish it from straight-up Kylie. It sounds more like one of those no-name remixes that always pollute those $5 maxi-CD singles than it does California's patron saint of violent glitchery. So is The Action Packed Mentalist a great conceptual 'fuck you' to the musical elitists of the world? Or is it little more than the hyperpaced, yet mostly lazy masturbation of a secret pop addict? Probably a little of each. What's brilliant is that Kid606 is far too smart to let on, even if he does offer some clues. The disc is bookended with a few minutes of minimal digital static, quiet crackles and tiny little pops on either side. Maybe it's there just to fuck with those listeners who come in expecting a jukebox-smashing rollercoaster of a ride from start to finish. But I suspect that there may be more to it than that. These chunks of noise sound, to me, like a subtle homage to the electroacoustic composers-- folks like John Oswald, Bob Ostertag and Marc Tremblay-- who were stealing from others and recontextualizing their music (also without permission) decades before anyone had ever heard the words Internet, Tigerbeat or Glitch. Or maybe this, too, is part of the joke. Maybe Kid606 is sitting at home smirking at the idea that anyone would use words like 'conceptual' to describe this record. After all, the guy is a notorious prank-artist, and this all does seem like one big prank. While I'm eager to call him lazy for his minimal reworking of most of these songs, I can't help but wonder if this is the very punchline. Despite tossing around names like Throbbing Gristle, Steve Reich and Coil in interviews and press releases, something tells me he wouldn't make an album like this if part of him wasn't a closeted pop fanatic. Every time I get to the most mainstream, un-fucked-with parts of The Action Packed Mentallist, I can't help but think of the Kid, his face red, tears running down his cheeks, gasping for air, laughing harder now than ever.","Somewhere, Kid606 is laughing.

What Passed Between Us,Tami Hart,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0665e6ef9596932354a/1:1/w_160/6b717e1f.gif,2002-06-12 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3750-what-passed-between-us/,Mr. Lady,"Having spent much of my life in a small southern town, I'm well versed in the logistics of beating the odds. Every shitty open mic nite singer/songwriter, every floundering teenage garage band, every greasy-locked techie with an expensive computer and a synthesizer, and every 17-year-old streetcorner rapper is (unless blindly idealistic or the child of a record tycoon) familiar with the obstacles lying between the practice space in their parent's basement and a reasonable facsimile of a musical career-- much less a cover shot on a glossy magazine, a slot on MTV's Cribs, or a Pitchfork rating of 7 or higher. Suffice it to say that merely putting out an album on a recognized label, if you're a 19-year-old, rock-inclined female from South Carolina, indicates some pretty serious odds-beating. For Tami Hart, however, the accomplishment of her excellent, eclectic 2000 debut, No Light in August, was very near improbable. She offered an idiosyncratic interpretation of Northwest-inspired rock with a kind of skill and emotional maturity exceptionally rare for a songwriter still in her teens. The album earned her considerable critical accolades, a handful of recognized musicians to play cameo roles on her future releases, and great expectations for her next release. What's impressive about What Passed Between Us is that, in the two years following No Light in August, Hart's craft has progressed to a level that disallows the few flaws of her original output. She still mines the same Nirvana-meets-Team Dresch aesthetic for her uptempo rock numbers. But with a supporting cast featuring The Gossip's Beth Ditto and labelmate Sarah Dougher, Tami Hart has expanded her repertoire to include note-perfect fractured guitar pop, acoustic ballads, eerie C&W-tinged; tunes, and messy rock and roll. The driving guitars of opener ""Complication"" are reminiscent of No Light in August's furor, with a more complicated rhythmic sensibility. Hart's vocals take on a different tone with the changing character of the songs. She restrains that throaty yowl for the Go-Gos-inspired ""To the Editor""-- almost a dance song, complete with pop harmonies in the chorus. These dynamic changes in style, met with considerable ability by Hart, indicate an impressive degree of proficiency in her craft. The hard-edged ""On Your Houses"" pushes through distorted staccato choruses and resolves into softness as Hart sings, ""Look at you, where are your friends now?"" before she returns it to its original form. There's something to be said for an artist who can deliver such a seamless, shameless homage to her influences. The raucous ""Trapped in Your Blood"" is one of the more pitch-perfect Dirty-era Sonic Youth ripoffs I've heard-- she even goes so far as to emulate Kim Gordon's vocal style. The album's best moment, however, is the haunting guitar pop of ""From Chapel Hill."" Showing shades of Sleater-Kinney, it's a subtle piece about unrequited love, undercut by discordant harmonies and a super-tight drumline. This style of music comes so naturally to Hart, she makes it sound unique without the nearly eclipsing presence of her influence. That being said, there are problems here. Hart's eclectic sensibility is unquestionably an asset, but the dramatic shifts from song to song are a little uncomfortable at times. Like many young musicians, Hart seems remarkably energetic and prolific. Trying on a lot of musical hats is normal, and naturally, some aren't going to fit. The airy ""Head in the Clouds"" is boring and typical, likewise ""If You Were a Judge."" Both are well-executed, but drag after the more crystalline moments on the album. I'm inclined to be forgiving, though-- I mean, 21 years old? It would be an extraordinary accomplishment for someone 31 or 41 years old. The audacity and energy afforded Hart by her age keeps things from getting too dry, and broadly hints at what I can only suspect are greater things to come.","Having spent much of my life in a small southern town, I'm well versed in the logistics of beating ...

Latitude,Central Falls,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a56dc0084474cd0c0700/1:1/w_160/9a2ef621.jpg,2002-06-11 05:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1376-latitude/,Truckstop,"On their debut album, Central Falls sounds like another mellow alt-country band that couldn't rock a cradle. And it's frustrating, because Latitude shows potential, not least because of the resumes of the frontmen: Adam Vida plays drums for aggressive art-noise band US Maple, and his brother Ben co-founded post-rock ensemble Town & Country. It's to their credit that they're attempting to expand their horizons with this straight-ahead project, but you'd expect more dynamics and better arrangements. Latitude's consistent, snoozy sound dampens some fine writing, covering up the differences between the songs instead of pushing their strengths. The record lilts like it's going out of style. On ""Zip Codes""-- for just one example-- the gentle cadence of the waltz time guides the quiet, pillow-like guitars and the excessive swell of the pedal steel. Jason Adasiewicz' drums only occasionally knock the songs to life, roughening the sound with the steady thud that opens ""Leave Into"" or the lumbering beat behind ""So Lovely, So Lovely."" At other times, the band goes out of their way to keep the momentum in check. On both ""Travel"" and ""Leave Into,"" they separate a big chorus from a stumbling guitar solo with a space of extreme quiet to make sure they don't build on each other. Was there a baby sleeping nearby? Adam Vida makes an uncomfortable frontman. Though soft and melodic, his vocals aren't expressive: there's an ache in the lyrics that rarely comes out in his voice. He muffles the interpretations, and it wasn't until I looked at the liner notes that I appreciated the bitterness in, say, ""Travel,"" or the themes of distance and the sad, simple images that populate these songs. It's telling that the best cut, ""So Lovely, So Lovely,"" works by using the fatigue in Vida's voice as he switches from a drag-ass frustration with his life (""God damn, it's such a bore"") to the one line of hope (""But so lovely, so lovely are you""). When he hits this chorus-- as with the simple phrase ""between love leaving and seeking"" that sums up ""Travel""-- the song finally gets the punch it deserves. Latitude needs more of that sort of impact. On the album closer, ""Another Perfect Plan,"" Vida never brings out the potential in lines like, ""It's a lie when I deny the lovers on the side/ I never heard about the cancer."" The send-off, ""I should stay out of town and out of touch,"" could be miserable if it didn't disappear into an instrumental section that just sounds like padding; the lead guitar turns to knotty lines behind that final verse, but your ear is no longer looking for it. And ballads like ""Parallel"" and ""Famous Harbor"" are like sinking into the best bed you've ever slept all day in. It's a soothing listen, but I recommend not listening to this while driving or operating heavy machinery.","On their debut album, Central Falls sounds like another mellow alt-country band that couldn't rock a cradle.

Make The Cowboy Robots Cry EP,Beachwood Sparks,by: Will Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a23b5e6ef95969320385/1:1/w_160/443ee0b0.jpg,2002-06-11 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/599-make-the-cowboy-robots-cry-ep/,Sub Pop,"Pull your chairs on up to the campfire for a sec, I'm gonna tell y'all a little story about Beachwood Sparks. Nice fellers, the Sparks... and every last one of 'em thin as a rail. Every time I see a 32-length, 28-waist pair of cordoroy pants at a thrift store, I think about having the staff set 'em aside for the Sparks' Chris Gunst. Anyway, my story dates back to the first time I saw the Sparks, and that was opening up for Lou Barlow back in 1997. Only, see, there were six of 'em back then-- guitarist/vocalist Gunst, bassist Brent Rademaker, keyboardist/lap steel virtuoso ""Farmer Dave"" Scher, drummer Tom Sanford, a guy who didn't do much that we called ""the tambourine guy,"" and a fella by the name of Josh Schwartz. Schwartz, also razor-thin with a shaggy mane of fair hair, traded guitar and vocal duties with Gunst and wrote many of their best songs. Hell, before the Los Angeles New Times profiled the band, I used to think they were twins. And they were outstanding, like the missing link between Sonic Youth and Teenage Fanclub, with a chaser of Buffalo Springfield and your friend buying a bottle of Big Star to boot. The Beachwoods' brand of country-fried space rock had a rare immediacy that commanded attention-- no one seemed to speak at their gigs, even when 'songs' became ten-minute sideways jams and bled into one another, setlists becoming insane, dazed-and-confused medleys of the best songs you'd never heard. I roped a couple of friends into catching their next gig, a free show at Spaceland, and they were so enthralled we caught them every Monday for a month straight while the Sparks honed their chops in a brief residence there. It was at these shows that we began to recognize individual songs in the band's oeuvre-- Gunst's majestic anthem ""Desert Skies,"" and Schwartz's tripped-out ""Make It Together"" and British Invasion-flavored ""Midsummer Daydream."" It wasn't for many months that we were even able to hear the recorded versions of these songs, on Bomp! Records' ""Desert Skies"" seven-inch-- and the results were a little disappointing. The bombastic riff of ""Desert Skies"" and herky-jerky stomps of ""Make It Together"" were reasonably well-documented, but the vinyl was poorly pressed and the vocals-- Gunst's in particular-- sounded annoyingly twee compared to the echo-drenched Thurston-isms of the Beachwoods' live gigs. So you can imagine our shock when, after many months without a Beachwoods fix, we caught the Sparks opening for the Lilys at the Whisky A Go-Go and, uh-oh-- they emerged wearing matching white outfits and cowboy hats, sans-Schwartz and with various Lilys sitting in for Pete Kinne and Tom Sanford. The fringe-happy five-piece raced through a frantic, countrified version of ""Desert Skies"" and the rest of what would become 2000's debut album, Beachwood Sparks. I was willing to cut the guys a little slack, Flying Burrito Brothers outfits and all, but I've gotta admit the shine was taken off once the debut was released and I'd seen a few more of the foursome's lackluster shows. Beachwood Sparks were now the Chris Gunst show, and while the band still had many great things going for it-- strong songwriting, able musicianship, and a fond affinity for Gram Parsons-- the Sparks lacked the presence and energy they'd enjoyed with Schwartz, the very qualities that had generated all the hype in the first place. So, after last year's well-recorded but ultimately chilly Once We Were Trees (a project which finally paired the shameless Dinosaur Jr. worshippers of Further with their hero, J Mascis), Beachwood Sparks have returned with a six-cut EP featuring yet another change in personnel. Former Strictly Ballroom compadres Jimmy Hey and Jimmy Tamborello join the fray (as new drummer and guest collaborator, respectively), but for the most part, Make the Cowboy Robots Cry treads the same sleepy-lazy formula that made both of the Beachwoods' full-lengths such disappointments. Gunst's thin, wavery vocals barely cut through the treble-drenched swamp of harmonica and carnival-ride organ on seven-minute opener ""Drinkswater."" The equally poky ""Ponce de Leon Blues"" ambles along on a ghost of a riff, propped up by thick vocal harmonies and little else before collapsing into a barely-there deconstruction of the melody with acoustic guitar and bass and Gunst's soulless vocals. The Sparks also use the old 'between albums EP' cliche to indulge in a little experimentation at their fans' expense, with little to show for the effort. ""Hibernation"" conjures a spooky vibe, with its samples of dusty vinyl and distant thunderstorms courtesy of Dntel's Tamborello, before devolving into a chorus of, ""Will I see you again? Good, good friend,"" so impossibly high-pitched it could only have been recorded above a natural helium deposit. ""Sing Your Thoughts"" employs a suitably intricate bass part to move Gunst's trite musical meanderings along (""Do you hear the sound of my sadness?""), but is ultimately lost in a soup of stuttery syntho strings and an elusive melody. ""Galapagos"" suffers from a similar fate, with a rubbery bass and siren-like synth cutting abrasively through an otherwise pleasant texture of banjo and guitar. The only redeeming quality of this record is its good intentions, and with results like this, even those are questionable. At least Beachwood Sparks and Once We Were Trees had the fortune of massing more than a dozen songs on each release, spacing gems like ""You Take the Gold"" out with incidental noodling and mindless pop songs. If anything, Beachwood Sparks' albums are like listening to a hit-and-miss radio station-- if you don't like the song that's playing now, at least you might like the next. Make the Cowboy Robots Cry exaggerates the band's weaknesses by extending their most tepid work to date into mini-jams, accenting the 60s space-rock vibe with the worst of 90s pretensia, and continuing to pass off vocals so slight they wouldn't pass muster with Kindercore. Beachwood Sparks' best days are certainly behind them, but it's disappointing so see the band stray so far in the wrong direction with each subsequent release.","Pull your chairs on up to the campfire for a sec, I'm gonna tell y'all a little story ...

Splay,Jim Black,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2fbc0084474cd0c0189/1:1/w_160/51015b6a.jpg,2002-06-11 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/786-splay/,Winter & Winter,"The guitars are so calm, and the watery sound effects beneath the surface, you might think this was a new age record for the first few seconds. And in some ways, you might be right. Whatever raging, insistent inspiration Jim Black carries with him while playing for other people seems to have been merely a color effect for his owr music. It's just not fair to pigeonhole Black as always being full of rage: his light-handed, detail-oriented playing and ability to make just about any kind of music interesting is one of his major talents. In fact, the dense calm at the heart of his compositions seems to indicate that resolution, not rage, is his ultimate goal. So, I think an introduction is in order: meet Jim Black, drummer and composer. Black was born in 1967 in Seattle. He'd grown up playing rock and jazz, and eventually attended the esteemed Berklee College of Music in Boston. Soon, he moved to New York City, and fell in with the budding downtown avant-garde jazz scene. His first claim to fame was playing in Tim Berne's legendary Bloodcount unit, where he was at least partially responsible for the band's rather intimidating aggression. Black also made the rounds with Dave Douglas, Ellery Eskelin, Satoko Fujii and Chris Speed. Jim Black plays like there has never been a concept of tomorrow: like an ultra-precise, junk-cymbal and Aphex-beat loving hurricane. I read an interview ir an old drummer magazine once where Black was giving props to Stewart Copeland and John Bonham, and I guess those are good starters, but they don't really account for the whole lightspeed chaotic behind-the-beat-even-though-he's-really-right-on-it thing he does. Furthermore, Copeland and Bonham weren't jazz drummers. To my ears, he's near the lineage of Tony Williams-- aggressive and idiosyncratic, but so nimble that you never get the feeling he's pushing too much. Splay is Black's second solo release, after last year's Alasnoaxis, with his band of the same name. The band ir question (Chris Speed on clarinet and tenor sax, Hilmar Jensson or guitar and Skuli Sverrisson on bass) is made of players very much ir Black's demographic. These are relatively young artists who are knee-deep in the highbrow pit of new jazz-- yet unlike John Zorn, don't have to play modern rock as a genre exercise. I'd say the music on this record has as much relevance in an indie discography (particularly one that features instrumental acts such as Tortoise, Chicago Underground Duo/Trio and Rovo) as it does a jazz one, at least on the surface. Tunes like ""Aloe Evra"" and ""Cheepa vs. Cheep"" could probably pass for a jazzy brand of Chicago post-rock. The former begins lightly, with a backdrop of wet ambience and modest guitar figure-- until the drums crash in, at which point it becomes an odd combination of MBV distortion, but with relentlessly crashing cymbals and up-tempo rock beat, and eerily contemplative chamber jazz. Speed's clarinet takes the melody, and his understated tone just barely manages to keep aloft amongst the guitars and cymbals. Despite the intensity (and density), the overarching mood is still of calm. ""Cheepa vs. Cheep"" starts with Jensson's heavily distorted guitar and kinetic polyrhythms from Black, while Speed's clarinet makes modest melodic statements. In the mid-section breakdown the band first disintegrates into boisterous free-form cutups, only to completely disappear into a drone of pulsating acoustic guitar and pillowy synth. Sometimes the sound can get a bit too calm, especially during the ballads. ""iCratic,"" with Speed's straight-tone melody and Jensson's Frisell-esque watercolor comping, borders on the stationary despite Black's restless drumming. The tune doesn't really start to gain any momentum until about two minutes in, when it coincidentally ceases being a ballad and turns into brooding avant-rock. Black tests listener patience with the epic ""Blissed (Selfchatter Mix)"" which, at twelve minutes, will undoubtedly filter out all the strict jazzbos ir the audience. It's basically a straight indie instrumental, for whatever that's worth, along the lines of very recent Fugazi or Sonic Youth-- reveling in those low-register guitar chords and Black's everyman rock beat. If you havex92t had the pleasure of hearing Black play, I'd recommend starting with some of his records as a sideman (particularly with Ellery Eskelin or Tim Berne) before hitting Splay. It's not that this side of his music isn't just as compelling, but those performances were some of the best of the 90s, whereas his solo work is strangely attractive, but arguably not as inventive, or immediate for that matter. Nevertheless, a solid effort from one of the most interesting artists in contemporary jazz.","The guitars are so calm, and the watery sound effects beneath the\r\n\ surface, you might think this was ...

Full Collapse,Thursday,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7aa9d034d5c69bf385d/1:1/w_160/a902b9ec.jpg,2002-06-10 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8054-full-collapse/,Victory,"As faithful students of the music media, it's fairly common knowledge that if a band/album can't be pigeonholed into some ridiculously named sub-genre, then it ceases to exist. Naturally, when I saw that tens, nay, dozens of individuals were having trouble categorizing Thursday's debut CD, Full Collapse, I panicked. Is it hardcore? No, Snapcase would come and destroy anyone who seriously attempted to claim that. Is it emo? No, instead of pointless whining, Full Collapse is full of pointless screaming. How about 'screamo'? Hmm. It does sounds like emo with the angst on overdrive, but the name 'screamo' is so fuckin' ridiculous, it's ridonkulous. Not wanting to see Thursday fall to the wayside for lack of a classification, I consulted my good friend, Mr. Robert Stack, with the latest mystery I needed him to unsolve for me. Uncharacteristically, he provided an answer to my question immediately and suggested that Thursday be classified as simply 'shit.' And after spending some quality time with Full Collapse, I have to agree with Mr. Stack. Thursday does a few things right, but all in all, this could have been a much better album. These guys bring 'taking themselves too seriously' to a level few bands have ever even considered. I'm all for the serious approach to music, but enough is enough. When Geoff Rickly sings, ""Discard this message/ Throw this bottle back into the ocean/ Rip this page from the history books/ Smash all the street signs/ Erase all the maps/ Forget my name, forget my face/ Because it's gonna rain, it's gonna rain/ And it never ends,"" on ""Paris in Flames,"" I had to stifle laughter. He's got a good sense of melody, and he's trying his damnedest to sell this, but a little angst goes a long way-- in this case, out of the ballpark, over the parking lot, and into the strip mall with that skeezy porno store next to the donut shop. Maybe I'm just not fourteen enough to enjoy this stuff anymore, but after having twelve tracks worth of tastelessly over-the-top melodrama hammered into my forebrain, I was ready to call it quits. Even though the lyrics sound more like self-serving wankery than actual sincerity, Thursday's sound is a little tighter. They tend to sound like At the Drive-In, but without the afros; that is, cleaner. For the most part, this works against the record slightly because the smoothness of the instrumentation and the vocals really undermines the intensity of the subject matter. I'm not necessarily saying that the lyrics would fly if the music was a little harsher, but it couldn't hurt. The energetic guitar tug-of-war between Steve Pedulla and Tom Keeley is sharp enough to break the skin, but it needs a rustier edge, a threat of tetanus. Tucker Rule's drumming gets things from zero to sixty, but lacks the kidney-squeezing intensity from which Thursday could really benefit. Part of the problem is that when the music does start to pick up, the bass and drums really get lost in the mix, so it's hard to tell. The only remarkable thing about this album is the screaming. Full Collapse has a whole lot of screaming. Sometimes it's fun, like on ""Concealer"" or ""Understanding in a Car Crash,"" where it's mostly complementary to the vocals and doesn't end up overshadowing the music too much. Most of the time, though, the music can barely support the intensity of Rickly's vocals, and then the screamings kick in and completely drown it out. Then there are those mercifully rare moments (the ends of ""Hole In the World"" and ""Cross Out the Eyes"") where the screaming is so out of place I actually feel embarrassed for them, and I'm not just saying that. Full Collapse is scream-tastic, but that's about it-- it doesn't even stand out in its own miniscule sub-sub-genre. There's better 'screamo' out there. Check out Relationship of Command. And if you've already done that and decided that some more teen angst is what your world needs now, then go to it-- another sale might be just the thing to get Thursday to lighten up a little.","As faithful students of the music media, it's fairly common knowledge that if a band/album can't be ...

On a Wire,The Get Up Kids,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf11abf31b7dc7156250/1:1/w_160/cf11f3fe.jpg,2002-06-10 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3432-on-a-wire/,Vagrant,"Is it just me, or were The Get Up Kids a whole lot less obnoxious back before they were trying so hard? Sure, they were annoying little brats back in the early lo-fi days, too. But I assure you, they were but a mere shadow of their current selves, irritant-wise. Usually, change is a positive thing for a young band, but with On a Wire, change just means putting the keyboard higher in the mix and shifting the schmaltz into overdrive. Yessir, that's our Get Up Kids! Back with twelve more cringe-inducing nasally passages that'll have you kicking your dog and praying for redemption. True to form, this one's got a bunch of lyrics for kids who've never known real tragedy to cry to (""Don't have bruises I can show/ Scars from abuse without a blow""), and songs named after places and girls (I foresee increased sales amongst people named Hannah in Kansas), but this album is most distinct in that, like the Promise Ring's leaden Wood/Water, it marks the completion of the Missouri quintet's transition out of emo and into plain ol' generic pop. Of course, this kind of metamorphosis doesn't happen overnight. Ever since their first LP found them an audience, the Kids have been moving farther away from the abrasive sloppiness of their early efforts (it's hard to believe that their debut was produced by Shellac's Bob Weston), slowly transforming into something a bit more user-friendly. Painful hollering grew into hollers of pain, because hey, that sensitive schtick really gets the chicks! The Red Letter Day EP showed off a bigger recording budget and a softer, gentler batch of songs. And then, despite promising continued 'development' with their subsequent move to the Vagrant label, Something to Write Home About reeked with uncertainty. Some of the kids, it seemed, weren't quite ready for the big time-- and it came across in the songs, which teetered somewhere between the Kids' early underground screeching and the new, 'accessible' sound that by then seemed inevitable. Well, a few screaming stadiums full of horny underaged Weezer fans later and the transformation is complete: On a Wire has that glossy veneer that only happens with the help of a good decisive manager, a fast-talking label guy with All The Answers, and that bloodthirsty, all-encompassing desire for yet another Big Tour. And it'll probably work: the Kids are undoubtedly packing their bags as we speak to go peddle this inferior product. Will they succeed in tricking the teeming masses of sweaty teenage flesh into believing that the occasional appearance of an acoustic guitar means maturation? Only those who've been ruthlessly brainwashed and tortured by the vacuous hype machine will care to find out! But if I'm to continue to hold the least of faith in humanity, then I must suspect that lines like, ""Say the words so slow/ Say it without fear/ You won't turn to go/ You won't leave me here,"" just might be a bit too much to stomach-- even for Get Up Kids fans. Now, naturally, you don't need me to tell you all this. Chances are you already fall into one of two categories: people who already own this album, or people who know better. Either way, you've already made your decision. Which leaves me, the critic, feeling useless, rejected, depressed. Hey, wait a minute. Rejected? Depressed? Those are the kinds of things sensitive guys feel, right? And I have a guitar right over there. And I don't know how to sing. Hot damn! Maybe I can make a hit record, go on tour and have sex with underaged girls a whole lot, too! Yippee! I mean, sob.","Is it just me, or were The Get Up Kids a whole lot less obnoxious back before they were trying ...

System 2,Microwaves,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c46313d197565213bf45/1:1/w_160/d1489b9e.gif,2002-06-10 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5274-system-2/,Cenotaph,"Post-punk doesn't come much more jittery and tense than this. In fact, at times, Microwaves sound like a good old-fashioned American hardcore band, but they have far too 'arty' leanings for that classification. To the standard guitar/bass/drums format they add a fair amount of samples and other sonic wackery. The guitar is brittle and trebly, the bass sounds like some kid making fart noises on his arm (a good thing in this instance, I assure you), and the drums are all hi-hat and cymbal. Like their close kin in dark disco-punk bands like the Rapture, the Microwaves have obviously digested the Factory Records catalog, but they've also spent some quality time with Devo, Beefheart, Zappa, and most noticeably, MX-80 Sound, meaning they've picked up a sense of humor somewhere along the line. System 2 begins with what sounds like a squealing, tape-eating Tascam battling a dusty record in-groove, panning back and forth between channels before the angular post-punk chaos ensues. The vocals alternate between the above mentioned screamo and a deadpan plainspeak. The first thing you hear is, ""Every time I take a picture something truly horrible happens... people are dead, bloody and mangled,"" and later, we get some unclear, presumably nasty happenings ""in the back of a McDonalds."" Most of the time, though, Microwaves purposefully steer clear of direct narrative, preferring to proffer absurdities. And this is where the humor shines through-- if they played it straight and just related some tales of blood and gore along with frantic paced music, it would get tiring pretty quick. (Insane Clown Posse, anyone?) But little spoken-word interjections like ""What were you thinking?"" and ""How ya doing?"" are a clue that these boys are feeling the irony. Do they know what kind of lunatics they sound like? Is it just a big put-on? It's hard to tell, and that, ultimately, is what makes System 2 so interesting. Microwaves' defining moment on System 2 comes with the maddening final track, ""1983."" It opens with a hyper-repetitive solo drum pattern that sounds like something from a Faust album, and then, just when you think it will never end, they pile on layer upon layer of maniacal laughter (the kind you might hear from a cartoon villain) and some kid repeating, ""I took a picture of blood,"" and squealing with delight. The first time I listened to this I found it brutally irritating, but on subsequent listens found it both hilarious yet quite disturbing. I've listened to System 2 more than a dozen times and I can't believe I haven't had some sort of aneurysm yet. I'm fairly certain I've now listened to it more than anyone else in the world, at least more than anyone not somehow associated with the band. It isn't something I'd recommend doing unless you have some sadistic desire to inflict damage upon your nervous system, or if you're just really jaded. There are albums that produce more tension and anxiety than this one, but not many. I advise that you not listen to this as often as you visit Pitchfork (wait, maybe you're really filled with all kinds of sadistic desires!), but that instead, you just bust it out when you're on drugs. No, scratch that. Save the money you usually spend on meth and buy this album instead.

This Is a Hospital,The Ghost,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf1c5e6ef95969323365/1:1/w_160/94fa8f73.gif,2002-06-10 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3442-this-is-a-hospital/,Some,"Just in time for Scooby Doo we have The Ghost, a high-energy indie quartet hailing from Berkeley, California. And like every phantom wannabe rooted out by those meddling kids, there's a man behind this mask: superproducer Steve Albini. The debut LP from The Ghost, This Is a Hospital, proves a point about Albini, and it's not the point you think I'm going to make. For all you know, Albini is a total hack. He may as well be Al Bundy. The reason? Albini works exclusively with brilliance. (Well, except Bush. But that was for the cash.) Albini may be the greatest thing since sliced bread, but when you're already working with sliced bread-- well, you get my point. The Ghost may not be ""brilliance"" per se, but the seeds are certainly there. The quartet has been an official 'band' for just over a year (they played their first show in April of 2001), and they're already producing material twice the quality of some of their peers. The key lies in their formula, which, while familiar and easy on the ears, is awfully difficult to pin down. Musically, it's clear that the Ghost worships at the altar of The Rock, and I'm not talking about The Scorpion King (though it would be brilliant if they prayed to that guy). The majority of This Is a Hospital blends straightforward indie rock with some jagged post-punk hues for a rhythmic, powerful, incisive guitar-and-bass attack. The vocals, however, are the hallmark of The Ghost: probably a quarter of the time, lead vocalist Brian Moss just flat-out screams. And I don't mean that calculated, affected caterwaul his punky brethren swear by; I'm talking raw, shredded throat gore with damn-near judicial conviction. The Ghost also distinguish themselves with some impressive songwriting. There are a number of mix-tape gems on This Is a Hospital, and two of them open the album: the minor key, post-punkish ""Death by the Bay"" and the similarly unsettled ""On and On,"" which opens with jagged guitars and poignant lyricism (""I fell in love every night/ How could I not?/ Somebody kiss me and prove me wrong""), but resolves its tension in the potent, poppy, chant-along chorus, ""So it goes, we've clipped our own wings/ My arms have become roots."" That's horror shit, dude! Closer ""Red Slippers Red Wheels"" begins with a bright, midtempo pop rhythm, cutting back to just bass and drums for the verse. Something about the mood seems to promise an anthem, and as the song reaches its peak, The Ghost delivers on that promise, first halting the track altogether, then bringing back the opening chords for a rousing, top-of-their lungs chorus: ""In this empty room/ I will live with my mistakes/ Hold this straw until it's gold/ It will, or I will, break."" I don't want to oversell, though, so I'll come clean and admit that the middle of this disc is a bit flat. However! The bookends more than make up for any perceived deficiencies. Besides, it's sort of an Oreo thing. I don't go for the chalky, jizzy center, preferring the crunchy chocolate punch of the surrounding cookie crisp. You might love jizz, I don't know. But I do know this, and look at me when I say it to you: baby, it's your money. You can put it down on a half-ton of horseshit (check eBay) or you can give it up for The Ghost.

Felt Cover,Charles Atlas,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a58a5e6ef95969320b15/1:1/w_160/c473e773.gif,2002-06-09 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1405-felt-cover/,Static Caravan,"Charles Atlas is two gentlemen from San Francisco making calm, quiet ambient post-rock. Guitars, vintage keyboards, ghostly voices and the occasional cello are all found on Felt Cover, but not all at once. This album is not minimal in the traditional melodic or rhythmic sense of the word; it's that the amount of stuff that happens in any one track is kept at a minimum. This is the kind of album where a plucked guitar note is allowed to ring unaccompanied until it decays completely, and two chords are more than enough. ""The Light They Intend for You"" is a perfect example of this sonic reduction, as two guitar chords, misty wet with rain, are slowly plucked as some dialogue (oddly, an excerpt from the Jerry Stahl book Permanent Midnight) is whispered beneath the sound. There are a couple chord changes and a bit of organ accent, but that's about it for this short piece. It's more than a little Labradford-esque, but at pop-song length, and without the tension that Labradford bring to the table. ""Hinged and Still"" has more teeth, as the guitar this time duals with a woozy, cascading synthesizer pattern that lends a sense of uncertainty. Charles Atlas stake out jazzier territory with ""Valdiviam"" where trumpet, brushed drums and a Fender Rhodes give the feel of an impressionistic early-70s Chick Corea piece, while the scraping, discordant guitar and unsettling drones of ""Minor White"" flirt with ugliness. ""Five Teeth and Crawling"" makes nice with a noirish sweep of strings that seems to fall behind the slowly strummed bass and guitar chords, the perfect soundtrack to a silent student film shot on an empty beach. A few tracks sound decent enough but lack musical substance. ""Que Biblia"" is a barely-there piece for solo electric piano that, while pretty, seems more like a throwaway film cue than an actual composition. But the damning problem with Felt Cover is not that any one track is particularly terrible, it's that the record as whole just seems, well, bland. Even after a half-dozen listens, I can't play a single track back in my head once the record is over. The best ambient music leaves some kind of aural after-image, flickering bits of texture and mood. Felt Cover, while not at all offensive, simply vanishes.","Charles Atlas is two gentlemen from San Francisco making calm, quiet ambient post-rock.

High Society,Enon,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc91abf31b7dc7155d55/1:1/w_160/a3b78324.jpg,2002-06-09 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2815-high-society/,Touch and Go,"A rare occurrence in the cutthroat world of the Rock and Roll is something I'll call the Sideman Bar Mitzvah: a secondary player in a once-popular band that goes on to success with his own project (after death, or breakup, or incarceration) which stops the initial cash cow from lactating. The SBM happens occurs about as often as a triple play-- for every Wilco and New Order, there's like 98 Scottie Pippen bands like Preston School of Industry or The Kelley Deal 6000. Yeah, my profession is largely to blame for this phenomenon, as we're always ready to pounce on an artist's former affiliations. But a lot of the time, these bands' records are Exhibit A as to just why Mr. or Ms. Sideperson wasn't the go-to guy/gal back in the good old days. Hey, what a coincidence! Here we have Enon, the band of guitarist/vocalist/keyboardist John Schmersal, former second banana in a little outfit called Brainiac. If you consult your handy portable hipster encyclopedia, you'll find Brainiac alongside Joy Division and the Minutemen under the heading of 'taken too soon'-- groups whose career trajectories were cut abruptly short by that sickle-wielding bastard Death. When Timmy Taylor became an automobile accident casualty statistic (flying is safer, kids!), Brainiac, sadly, flatlined along with him, inspiring years of reverent webboard discussion over what might have been. Unfortunately, the cultish buzz around Brainiac's short career has also virtually ensured that any future Schmersal project would have to operate under the long shadow of his old Dayton purple-hair spaz-synth-rock days. With preconceptions placing him far behind the starting line, it would take a pretty good album to force us writers to delete our pre-Enon Schmersal biographies and stop using lame 'rising like a phoenix from the ashes of Brainiac' intros. Luckily, High Society is just such an album, perhaps more varied and consistent than anything the defunct Daytonites ever released. Of course, I'm not going to swear off references to the B-word yet, in part because Enon still sound a hell of a lot like Schmersal's previous employer. Given that Schmersal's epileptic seizure guitar work was such a huge part of Brainiac's herky-jerky sound, this is no big surprise, but Enon's also borrowed a great deal of Taylor's vocal tics and mini-Moog diddles on their work to date. Believo! took this to an almost uncomfortably eerie level, with Schmersal appropriating all of Taylor's cast of vocal characters-- castrati jazz singer, seductive cyborg-Jagger, Prozac-industrial screamer-- for his own performances. Mired in the same gloom-and-doom electronics of Brainiac's later work and sorely lacking Taylor's considerable charisma, Believo! only took off when Schmersal tapped into his own literal and figurative voice on ""Conjugate the Verbs"" and ""For the Sum of It."" High Society still has the occasional throwback tune, like the manic hip-swing of ""Pleasure and Privilege"" and the ominous march against soda pop ""Carbonation,"" but it largely exhibits Schmersal taking his first firm steps towards building an independent identity. The opening double shot makes this abundantly clear, with the hard-rock crunch of ""Old Dominion"" sliding his falsetto into an ominous coda and ""Count Sheep"" broadcasting his surprisingly delicate croon. The album represents a musical shift toward electronic-tinged rock rather than Believo!'s rock-tinged electronic, but Schmersal throws himself with equal aplomb into the loungy strings and Pink Floyd sax solo of the title track and the almost-""Jessie's Girl"" radio rock of ""Sold!"" While Schmersal is coming out like that creepy Levi's bellybutton commercial, the real clincher of High Society is Enon's newest member, Toko Yasuda, formerly one-half of The Lapse. Providing the same knockout injection of S-E-X-X that Taylor lent Brainiac, Yasuda is a Barbie girl in a Macintosh world, warning her robotic paramour on ""Disposable Parts"" that she'll ""throw you away when the flavor goes out."" Contracting out microphone duties allows Schmersal more time to rock the vintage keys on ""Shoulder"" and ""In This City,"" creating prime cuts of what the latest memos have told me I should label 'electroclash.' If all the genre-name bocce ball leads you to believe that High Society has got more personalities than Sybil, you'd be right. But the entire affair is kept cohesive by (cheesy as it sounds) a rather upbeat mood-- a dance record for the hooded sweatshirt crowd. It's the kind of meet-you-halfway hipster party record the Dismemberment Plan has decided they don't want to make anymore. Rather than lamenting what could've been with Brainiac, High Society says it's time to throw out that memorial black armband and Timmy Taylor R.I.P. commemorative plate, 'cause maybe they were just the warmup act for Enon all along.","A rare occurrence in the cutthroat world of the Rock and Roll is something I'll call the Sideman Bar ...

L'eclat du Ciel √âtait Insoutenable,Hrsta,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c132ea9e61561daa7d48/1:1/w_160/8765f22d.gif,2002-06-09 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3944-leclat-du-ciel-etait-insoutenable/,Fancy,"Insomnia is a harsh mistress. It inevitably sides with your more impulsive self, leaving logic at the door. Anyone who's ever gone or a four-night study bender will understand. Something as perverse as lining every inch of your room with mirrors may seem logical at the time but, as the cast of the film Alive discovered, the rationale can't always be justified in the face of social scrutiny. However, after finding myself driving about Austin's seediest neighborhoods at 4:00 a.m. blasting Snow's ""Informer"" at an ungodly volume, even I had to admit that I had a problem. Having been seduced by many of the myriad New Age philosophies blurring the lines between genuine medical practice and transcendentalist scam artistry, I made the decision to take leave of long-time friend and personal physician Dr. Schreiber and seek the clinical opinion of 'Hopie,' an authentic feng-shui master who happened to dabble in alternative remedies. After listening intently to the horrors of my descent into madness, he flipped through his record collection. The artists I could discern from my wicker topple-bowl across the foyer were completely alien to me. Nowhere ir my travails had I encountered musicians with such exotic names as Tanakh, Keiji Haino, or Tomas Jirku. Needless to say, names of such foreign cadence were quite impressive while under the influence of Hopie's slightly inebriating incense. When he finally prescribed a two-week tenure with Hrsta's L'eclat du Ciel √âtait Insoutenable, I felt the rare but refreshing surge of snobbery familiar only to the musical 'elite.' What ensued was much less exhilarating: my research on Hrsta revealed that the project was merely a vehicle for Mike Moya, co-founder of such post-rock luminaries as Godspeed You Black Emperor and another personal addiction, Set Fire to Flames. I soon discovered, however, that cred alone isn't enough to sustain a poorly conceived exploratior of dissonance. Although my insomnia was gone, it wasn't because Moya had painted a gorgeous and inviting sonic tapestry capable of tempting my defiant psyche into slumber. Nor were there any insurmountable walls of terror with which to frighten myself into a state of coma. Rather, I was subjected to distant orchestral 'scores' consisting largely of single, undulating notes occasionally interrupted by sparse attempts at cabaret numbers. Never mind that the more traditional songs to be found throughout the album all boasted the same tempo, Moya's raspy Jonathan Donahue-cum-Kim Gordon vocals, and lyrics that sounded as if they were borne of some ill-fated collaboration between Rage Against the Machine and Tristan Tzara. One can only stand the refrain, ""The bricks start to fall/ Like so many teeth,"" so many times before it begins to lose its poetic pretense. It's to Moya's credit that L'eclat du Ciel √âtait Insoutenable is consistent in its cinematic creepiness despite its overbearing length. Songs such as ""Lime Kiln"" break from the record's formulaic instrumentation by incorporating such exotic sounds as a theremin (a hallmark of any campy 50s sci-fi/nuclear fallout melodrama) succeed in offering a unique take on Hrsta's post-apocalyptic lyrical obsessions. But, in maintaining the ethereal and haunting mood of the record, Moya often falls back on the same aural tricks, the most notable being the liberally administered reverb which coats the entire damn album, drowning out whatever subtle intricacies were to be found in the songwriting. With my insomnia all but vanished I have more time to deal with my newly established disillusionment. As added insurance, I cut Hopie loose and have returned to legally sponsored medical aid (all the while praying that my insolence won't be rewarded with a painfully unnecessary prostate exam). Though still a very disappointing release, I've come to think of Hrsta as an anomaly: Moya exercising his ability as a songwriter while hamfistedly tending to his established 'sound.' Though I'd never refer to any aspect of Moya's music as 'irreverent,' the man has never taken himself less seriously then he does here.","Insomnia is a harsh mistress.

The Willies,Bill Frisell,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be35eb335119a49ed01e/1:1/w_160/56213603.jpg,2002-06-09 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3208-the-willies/,Nonesuch,"And it's back to the metaphorical boondocks for Bill Frisell, where, with a glass of lemonade (or Hooch) in one hand and a guitar in the other, he kicks back on the porch with his pals and records another album of jazz-informed folk and country. This is something he's explored for the past few years, ever since his 1997 album Nashville (recorded with session players like Jerry Douglas, Viktor Krauss, and members of Alison Krauss' Union Station) deservedly won 'album of the year' from Downbeat. He proved how well his own style-- the slight twang in his sustained electric tones, and the echoes of steel pedal guitar-- could work with this kind of music. Frisell put together a touring band called The Willies, featuring maniac avant-fiddler Eyvind Kang, banjo fiend Danny Barnes of progressive bluegrass band Bad Livers, and bassist Keith Lowe. This 'new bluegrass' (xFC-grass?) project toured America and Europe playing a set of new Frisell tunes and classics like ""Cluck Old Hen"" and ""Sugar Baby."" His new record documents the band, but it comes up short: Kang mysteriously wasn't included, leaving the other three Willies to pick and haw through an album that's faithful and accurate, yet not that adventurous. In spite of Nashville's success, Frisell's Americana phase has received mixed reactions: at its best it's finger-pickin' good, with Frisell setting up great jam sessions with top country and bluegrass musicians. At its worst, Frisell plays picturesque music that's thick with nostalgia, an ongoing homage to ""Home On the Range"" that masks the edgier facets of his playing. Some fans have complained that Frisell won't turn up the volume and return to his Noisy Bill period of the late eighties, when he was shredding across New York City. But there's absolutely nothing wrong with Quiet Bill, whose gorgeous tone and impeccable sense of collaboration make him the foremost balladeers of today's jazz axemen. His collaboration on Ror Miles' Heaven, a duet album released last month, is utterly beautiful: without hyperbole I can say that if my last moments or earth are like the music on that record, I'll know I did something right. The problem here is with Cautious Bill, who spends hours in the studio recording and overdubbing his tracks. The Ron Miles album, and albums like Nashville (supervised by hard-nosed producer Wayne Horvitz), capture performances live in the studio with minimal editing and overdubbing: they have the improvised feel of a conversation, the sense that someone caught a moment that we're lucky to have. Under Lee Townsend, who produced The Willies and most of Frisell's other recent albums, the pieces sound overplanned. Frisell treats the pieces carefully and often reverently, forgetting to let them breathe. The overdubs add color to the album (for example, Danny Barnes' addition of pump organ to several tracks), but the spontaneity is lost. With the bluegrass standards that make up half of this album, the successes make the merely competent songs sound even worse. For every hot track like ""Cluck Old Hen,"" with Barnes' manic runs and Frisell's gritty solo, there's a cover like ""Blackberry Blossom"" that's merely pretty (the extra loops from Frisell's delay pedal are colorful but unnecessary). ""Goodnight, Irene"" begins with a delicate improvised section but settles into a plucky but conservative reading. The slowed-down performance of ""John Hardy"" is a highlight; it explores a melody that modern players speed to a blur, and Barnes' extremely delicate solo is like drops of rain at an autumn funeral. But Frisell plays Hank Williams' ""Cold, Cold Heart"" with the eager faithfulness of a grade schooler reciting ""Casey at the Bat."" Frisell introduces some good originals-- particularly ""Everybody Loves Everybody"" and ""If I Could I Surely Would""-- but even here, the methodical studio versions are outshone by live recordings that have surfaced from some of the Willies performances. Their concert ir early 2000 at the Barbican in London has it all over this album: the BBC captured Eyvind Kang playing with the band, and his solo on ""My Buffalo Girl"" (from Good Man, Happy Dog) leaps out of the song, buys everyone dinner, has a few beers and gets laid before slinking back to restate the melody. And when Ghost Town's ""Big Bob"" segues into ""If I Could I Surely Would,"" the latter tune (buoyed by noisy flourishes and a breezy pace) sounds much more like it's riding into the sunset than the immaculately constructed studio version. Nonesuch takes a coffeetable-book approach to their releases, favoring immaculately produced studio products: they may never release the Barbican show, or any other live recording from Frisell. In its absence, The Willies is servicable, but it isn't the shit-kicking great time that it should be. It makes Frisell seem like the guy at the party who's scared to get drunk and break the host's furniture; and we know he has more bluegrass in him thar that.","And it's back to the metaphorical boondocks for Bill Frisell, where,\r\n\ with a glass of lemonade (or ...

1986-1992,Ruins,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2d2ea9e61561daa4b35/1:1/w_160/2ba87e72.jpg,2002-06-06 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6871-1986-1992/,Skin Graft,"There's something to be said about consistency. There's also something to be said about jackhammer migraines. With Ruins, one is the cause and the other a potential effect for many listeners. Pitchfork has featured a couple of other Ruins CDs by this point, so I probably don't need to tell you much about their sound. What I will say is that, since their inception in 1985, they've set industry standards for integrity of vision, and a lot of the credit can be given to drummer/leader Tatsuya Yoshida's decision to create a new band for every new idea or variation he has. Ruins was his proggy noisecore project, and though detractors may argue that so are the rest of his bands (including Koenji-Hyakkei and Akaten), it is the most purely so. Because of this, anyone who isn't totally down with the original concept is in for rough times with Ruins' discography. Aside from the one-off Symphonica, all Ruins records are bass-and-drums affairs, with manic yodel-screeching for vocals and the kind of needle-in-the-red instrumental acrobatics that give a shitload of indie cred to prog, while at the same time turning off most actual prog old-schoolers. I can't begin to imagine what sort of torture it would be to sit through something like Stonehenge if I wasn't completely on board with this band. That's where the jackhammer migraines come in, because if smooth sailing is your thing, steer clear. For fans, a release like 1986-1992 is fine indeed. Skin Graft's compilation packages ridiculously rare early stuff like the original 1986 seven-inch of the band's first four-track recordings, their 1987 twelve-inch album, and selected tracks from their third record. Incidentally, all of these releases were simply entitled Ruins, so thank Skin Graft for clearing up a potential Google mess. Also included are tracks from two easier to find LP's, 1990's Stonehenge and 1992's Burning Stone. Yoshida remixed all the tracks last year, and I can tell you that, being familiar with the original albums, I was pretty shocked by the remixes. Very noisy! Mark Richard-San remarked in his review of Burning Stone that it was the 'slick' Ruins album. Not here, as its tracks seem to have been given that extra ear-bleeding treatment. Give Yoshida credit for creating the impression that all of this stuff was recorded at the same time in the same studio, with the same production. The opener wastes no time in burning down all bridges to sanity: ""Outburn"" is at once the greatest-ever hardcore punk song not to protest anything or even feature real words in the lyrics, and a public service announcement for ADD awareness. The main riff is as stubbornly assured as anything Bad Brains put to wax, and the lest you get bored during its eight seconds, another wild-ass riff is there to take its place, and again and again. It seems like this kind of thing should have made the whole math-rock thing obsolete before it ever happened, but whatever. ""Epigonen"" is slower, but just as pummeling. The riffs don't fly by this time, and the mid-section is almost like a stoned mosh. Ruins first bassist Kawamoto Hideki even takes the distortion off for a few seconds, only to nail it back to your forehead again at the end of the tune. ""Body & Soul"" is still more slow-death, featuring a recognizably metallic head, like something you'd hear from a particularly badly recorded Sabbath boot. Perhaps the most interesting track for diehard fans will be ""Cambodia,"" previously only available on a compilation called NG II. If not for all the distortion, this could pass for straight-ahead King Crimson-esque prog (especially the anthemic B-section), and the opening riff is pure cock-rock edge. ""Hallelujah,"" from Ruins' 1988 LP, is also quite proggy compared to the rest of this stuff, especially as Yoshida makes the extra effort to sing in recognizable tones, and with recognizable harmonies. They turned the distortion off, and there's even a violin in there. Whoa... Kansas? Not quite. Tunes like ""Infect"" (possibly the most menacing thing they ever recorded) and ""B.U.G."" reinforce the notion that sheer force and oppressive repetition can do considerable damage. Quaint old bands like Magma used to work in similar realms, but Ruins just pounce all over any legacy those bands might have had. They're just that devastating. The Burning Stone tracks are more complex, as Ruins has seemingly gotten further and further away from tried-and-true musical vices like simple jackhammer migraine riffs, but the tunes don't fail to lurch and destroy. ""Zasca Coska,"" filled with echo vocals and riffs so unplayable that it just isn't that funny, even manages to fill a few life-sucking minutes of the song with free improv. I think I need to turn this down for second. Despite the ear-abuse, my only real caveat with the album is that fans will probably already own about half of it. Of course, the really early material makes it worthwhile for people like me. For newcomers, I'd suggest hunting down Burning Stone or Stonehenge for early Ruins, and work from there. Yoshida doesn't look like he's ever going to stop, so you have plenty of time to work your way through to this comp.","There's something to be said about consistency.

Unlike your Tortoises and your Uis and your Mice Parades, the word 'smooth' could never be used to describe what Fly Pan Am does. Their music is loud, messy and chaotic, and they come a lot closer to 80s no-wave than they do to jazz fusion. The musicians may or may not be improvising, but if they are, it's not out of any respect for a tradition; it's because the songs sound a little crazier and more fucked up that way. Ceux Qui Inventent N'ont Jamais Vecu (?) (loosely translated: ""those who invent have never lived"") finds the band turning up the funk and tuning in to the cosmic vibration of Can's Tago Mago. There's no doubt about it, bassist Jean-S√©bastian Truchy worships at the alter of Holger Czukay, and almost every track here is anchored by a percussive bassline that hits like a leather boot to the solar plexus. Moving through and around the groove is a whole mess of shaggy, atonal guitar that could come from a U.S. Maple record, all of it stitched together with Fly Pan Am's ever-present tape splicing. At a few points on the record, the track cuts off completely, only to emerge a split-second later a few beats off. Smooth, this ain't. The rhythmic punch is something to behold throughout the album, but once you get used to that, things get a bit iffy. Too many tracks seem like little more than an excuse for the bassist and drummer to lock into a love embrace, with no accompanying thematic or melodic development. It would be nice to see more tracks like ""Univoque/Equiovoque,"" which has a customarily funky beat but adds ar interesting music-box instrumental contrast and ringing guitars that border on the beautiful. By contrast, cuts like the slapbass workout ""Rompre L'Indifference de L'Inexitable Avant Que L'on vienne Rompre Le Sommeil de 'Inanimie'"" just kind of hang there. In between these poles are ""Sound Support Surface Noises Reaching Out to You,"" which combines nervous, jittery funk with Oval-style digital post-production, and ""Erreur; Errance; Interdits de Par Leurs Novelles Possibilites,"" a richly textured sound collage with an assortment of odd organic noises. Ceux Qui Inventent N'ont Jamais Vecu (?) has an attractive air of unpredictability: it seems as though each track could go just about anywhere at any given moment. A track called ""Partially Sabotaged Distraction"" consistently crashes my computer whenever it comes on, and I can't help but wonder if the effect is intentional. But for all the loose experimentation afoot, this is an easy album to ignore.

The Last Broadcast,Doves,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba025e6ef95969322acd/1:1/w_160/e9c293e5.jpg,2002-06-06 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2430-the-last-broadcast/,Capitol,"So I'm playing with my new office chair right now. The floor of my apartment is wood-finished and extremely warped, so there are all kinds of little bumps and valleys to roll over. Combine that with the fact that all the ball bearings and wheels are brand new and heavily viscous and I could amuse myself doing this for quite a while. I guess it's the simple things that give you pleasure after a long day at work, juggling projects and trying to get out of there at five. My job is pretty hectic and I usually come home all wound up, so it's good to have these little diversions to help myself. Tonight the stress has me feeling particularly goofy. Normally I wouldn't think of Manchester's Doves as an appropriate soundtrack for this kind of mood, but that's largely because until very recently I was only familiar with their first album, 2000's dark, murky Lost Souls. On that record, the band showed their facility with dark, claustrophobic textures and muted melodic statements, only occasionally indulging their impressive pop sense. And while their latest offering, The Last Broadcast, could hardly be called a wholesale revamping of their sound, it concentrates mostly on elements that the trio kept very subdued on their debut. For one thing, while Lost Souls was certainly nothing to sniff at, the band sounds infinitely more comfortable and confident here, placing more faith in their writing and relying less on production to put forth their ideas. The record still abounds with thoughtful audio details, mind you-- but here they're almost always employed in the service of melody. Even the exceptions to that rule-- the short instrumental tracks like ""Intro"" and ""Where We're Calling From""-- build tension while moving toward the catharsis of the next fully-fleshed song. ""Where We're Calling From"" is a dense wall of swirling guitars and keyboards, growing ever thicker until finally evaporating, leaving the initial strums of ""N.Y."" in its place. ""N.Y."" is exultant in its first verse, all crashing guitars and soaring vocals. The instrumental midsection is one the band's finest moments, cut through with an unobtrusive string section and some surprisingly dynamic interplay. ""Let's go while we can/ Put your finger on the map/ Who cares where it lands,"" sings Jez Williams as the song gathers steam behind him. It's one of several tracks that makes The Last Broadcast a brighter, and in some ways more accessible, album than its predecessor. Elsewhere, the band lay down a ream of excellent songs beginning with ""Words,"" a steadily chugging confection of astral guitar, vocal harmonies and glockenspiel that does a remarkable job of boring a limited melody straight into your memory. It's followed by the loping, seven-minute ""There Goes the Fear,"" which is a strong candidate for one of the band's best songs yet, its bounce befitting the subdued melody and diving, almost country-ish slide guitar that swoops in the background. Doves have always been a band who could come out swinging with a powerful pop song when they wanted to, and this just proves that they should do it more often. A few songs naturally point back to the band's original direction, such as the haunting, noir ""Friday's Dust,"" with its crystalline strings (arranged by Sean O'Hagan and Marcus Holdaway) and strange production. Devoid of percussion, the song floats along almost like something Talk Talk might have produced in their later years, replete with ghostly clarinets and odd smatterings of brass. Of course, ""Pounding"" bounces right back with a... well, pounding rhythm and a sterling melody, as well as some spirited rhythm guitar. The boys get downright proggy on the intro to ""The Sulphur Man,"" with sweeping strings deceptively setting the stage for what turns out to be a relatively modest song, albeit one cut through with all sorts of inventive little flourishes, like the strings that rise in the verses, threatening to overtake the vocals before abruptly backing down and retreating to the background, only to attempt another coup a few seconds later. It's those details that make a good song great, and that's what makes The Last Broadcast an easy record to come back to-- chances are you missed an awful lot the first few times you listened. ""Caught by the River"" closes things on a high note, riding out on a sturdy acoustic guitar frame adorned by the band's usual sonic fireworks and pushed forward by some very economical drumming. To the listener's benefit, the electric guitar parts aren't so economical, and the band masterfully layers soaring leads, ultimately ending on a glowing bed of reverb and clean guitar. It's a fittingly dramatic end to an album that's full of drama, without the tiresome excess-- a healthy balance if you ask me. Watch your toes while I chair-speed back to the stereo to give it another spin.","So I'm playing with my new office chair right now. The floor of my apartment is wood-finished and extremely ...

Viewfinder,Pullman,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a150ea9e61561daa4785/1:1/w_160/3a685474.jpg,2002-06-06 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6505-viewfinder/,Thrill Jockey,"As punishment for turning in reviews late twice in a row, Ryan Pitchfork sent me to the subterranean archives of Pitchfork Towers to clean out some of the rubbish down there. Clearly he was angered by my negligence, so I refrained from asking him if he wouldn't mind if I kept any stuff I found interesting as I waded through years of accumulated and now dusty junk. Amidst the self-released CD-Rs by wastrel emo acts and dog-eared, gushing press-releases about IDM boffins, I found a first pressing of the self-titled album by United States of America, an autographed glossy photo of 12 Rods, and a curious parchment document. The writing on the document is in brown, inked calligraphy and the bottom right-hand corner bears a drawn approximation of a wax royal seal. The script, though error-free, shows manifest signs of instability (herky-jerky loops on descenders, unnaturally exact straight lines on ascenders, for example). Before even reading the words on the parchment, it was difficult not to hypothesize that whoever wrote this document is a borderline sociopath. Once you've read the words, which appear to mimic a proclamation, it's clear that the writer has an unchecked (and unmedicated) Napoleon complex. Here follows the text of the parchment.

Co-Balt,Brute,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3c7c0084474cd0c033e/1:1/w_160/bb751603.jpg,2002-06-05 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/981-co-balt/,WidespreadSupercat,"In case you don't know who Brute is: hang on to your indie cred, activate your patchouli filters, and then answer me this: why does Vic Chesnutt (who is so irrevocably cool) make records with Widespread Panic (who are so irrevocably not)? I don't mean to over-refer to the car accident that handicapped Chesnutt, but he is a jalopist: his music peaks when it's wreckage-esque, arranged in a dangerous and fragile fashion that fits the stark goulash of his boondoggler-philosopher persona. And here he is in Brute with the airtight Widespread Panic, who check every valve like purgatorial Pep Boys. I wonder if Birkenstocks outnumber Campers at their live shows. For chrissakes, Vic Chesnutt was in Sling Blade! Remember when drizznunk, moodswinging Dwight Yoakam slams Chesnutt's wheelchair into the door, almost capsizing him? Sling Blade told it like it is-- showcasing power lines and potholes and crutches and fast food and armpit moisture, not Jennifer Love Hewitt in spaghetti straps bending over every six minutes. Like Fargo or Lone Star, it presented a region as its frumpy self, and dadgummit, that's how I like my alt-country/avant-roots/No Depression/cowpunk/ya'llternative/thunderplink/asscord/shitporch. But on Cobalt, Panic fails to meet Chesnutt's dark vision even halfway. When the first song kicks in, you'll think you accidentally switched on an adult-contemporary station broadcasting a John Hiatt/Bonnie Raitt duet. The band's playing is clean, but straight-up soulless. What is it that their fans can't get enough of? ""Man, bro, hey, bro, shazam, these jokers are technically proficient!"" The showtune plod of ""You're With Me Now"" would bring the house down at your older stepbrother's sparsely attended second wedding, the band keeping it real like the Carnival Cruise poolside karaokist. ""Adirondacks"" starts with some Bob Seger electric piano before busting into a patented Counting Crows midtempo anthem; ""Scholarship"" offers guitar tones I haven't heard since Britny Fox broke up. This music is tame, tame Southern Rock, like the honeysuckle bloat of late Drivin' n' Cryin'. Cobalt triumphs only on ""Puppy Sleeps,"" a riff-anchored track with just enough ingratiating hangnail cracker-funk to transcend the Disney-does-Skynryd of its peers. My molten downstairs neighbor knocked on my door, incense wafting from her absorbent pajamas-- I'm thinking she'd finally come to borrow a cup of love, but nope: ""What the hell are you playing that has that repetitive bassline?"" I pretended to be an exchange student house-sitting for someone much cooler. Yet, Chesnutt fans might wanna shell out their germy tender for Cobalt anyway, because Vic more than holds up his end of the bargain. His befitting themes of figurative paralysis, inertia, and atrophy all get thorough re-examinations. The drearier songs offer no escape; they're full of armory machinists, carpet plants and flour mills, and they recommend bridges from which ""suicide is a cinch."" The maudlin harmonica of ""Expiration Day"" is dead-on: Vic namechecks W.H. Auden and weird Southern county names, and his plangorous voice is as ripe as ever, despite what the twinklestains on Amazon.com say in their customer reviews about how the vox ""leave alot to be desired"" and aren't ""Widespread quality."" Vic loves him some Latinate diction, and he enunciates it so much better than the thesaurus-boys in Bad Religion and Lullaby for the Working Class, exaggerating the mouthfuls like a phonetic alchemist. When he sings ""stupid preoccupations,"" he sings ""a-steyoo-peyid eh-paree-awk-cue-payaysheyuns."" He continues to view the world as an equation (a habit he's had since the songs on his 1988 debut Little), condemning drug-culture friendships with the line, ""All we have in common are psychoactive compounds,"" on ""All Kinds,"" a classic peep at the problem of evil that harps on kiddie porn and ""stale mounds of semen."" But the overwhelming keeper is his new arrangement of old song ""Cutty Sark."" Panic performs a warm and subdued Lambchop impression, and the lyrics are a gold amalgam of Chesnutt's tendency to throw images together and see what happens-- a style that too often results in songscapes rather than songs, soundscapes that are often barren despite their crowdedness. If this record had a dozen more like ""Cutty Sark,"" I'd be lobbying for a 9+ rating and its subsequent canonization, hippie caravan and all. Hell, you can tell just by the pictures that stubbly, pensive Vic is the tormented bomb while Widespread are bootleg, all smiling with their flowing manes, ballcaps, and Reeboks. If you want an endearing jalopy, get the Ugly Casanova CD. If you're a die-hard Vic-ophile, get this anyway and make your own faux-folk cover art. Otherwise you'll be as embarrassed of Panic's presence as you are of that girl you made out with because she looked like Jeff Tweedy.","In case you don't know who Brute is: hang on to your indie cred, activate your patchouli filters, and ...

Remix,Le Tigre,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcb6ea9e61561daa7534/1:1/w_160/d358a902.jpg,2002-06-05 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4702-remix/,Mr. Lady,"As the astute reader has already determined, Le Tigre's latest is, in fact, a remix album. Honestly, does anyone really look forward to these things? Ten bucks to hear some of Band X's hit singles given a rhythm transfusion and made twice as long? Sign me up! For years, the phrase 'remix album' has been only slightly less off-putting than 'tribute album,' though at least there are people like Herbert (not Paula Abdul) who occasionally nail the concept of a remix well enough to obscure its fundamental pointlessness. Of course, for every one person like Matt Herbert, there are a dozen others whose wanky retreads do nothing more than inflict economic damage on unwitting consumers. What's that, Mr. Lady? Le Tigre's Remix isn't designed to simply steal money from all of their loyal fans, but rather as a ""vision for a hardcore dance genre infused with radical politics""? I beg to differ! Come on, Remix is just about as standard as remix albums can get-- four songs from Feminist Sweepstakes, one off the From the Desk of Mr. Lady EP, one from the self-titled debut, and all (with one exception) are clearly worse than the originals. That's not too surprising, see, but unlike most bands to fall prey to the remix syndrome, Le Tigre has a lot more to lose-- namely, the message. Anyone with even a passing familiarity with Le Tigre, Bikini Kill, or her solo outing as Julie Ruin can't miss the fact that Kathleen Hanna has always used her music as medium to broadcast her and her bandmates' neo-feminist viewpoints. Sure, she's traded the aggressive, slash-and-burn mentality of Bikini Kill for the fuzzy drones and lounge-y beats of The Tiger, but her message has always come through loud and clear. The aim of Le Tigre is not to get people dancing to the soothing tones of feminist rhetoric, it's to intellectually challenge people while they're busy getting their groove on. So, if anything, the biggest failure of this record is that, for the most part, it puts the disco before the discussion. Of course, being a remix record and all, that seems to be the aim here-- even though the original songs are some of the most direct tunes in Le Tigre's catalog. Across the board, the mixes manage to obfuscate the content by either sampling to the point of irrelevance, cutting lyrics, or just submerging them deep within the mix. It's rare for a band to be able to tackle such a wide array of issues with intellect as well as a smirking sense of humor, but the DJs at work here ditch all that. This can potentially be overlooked (especially if the mixes work), but with three wimmin as overtly political as Hanna, Johanna Fateman, and JD Samson, it doesn't seem fair to evaluate the music separately from the politics. Maybe that what's you're looking for, though. Maybe you want some of that patented, infectious Le Tigre dancecore without all the messy talk about issues. Well, don't hold your breath, because this thing isn't winning any awards on that front, either. Most of the cuts follow the standard remix procedure of just messing with the rhythm track and sampling the original without too much thought to the final product. ""Tres Bien (The Nouveau Disco Mix)"" from Analog Tara gives its source a decent trance-inspired makeover; Reid Speed's ""Aphro-Dykey Mix"" of ""Dyke March 2001"" doesn't change much more than the name of the track. And it actually hurts me on a personal level to think about the DFA's remix of ""Deceptacon,"" which sucks out all of the original's Joy Division-ish bassy goodness in favor of a simplistic funk pattern looped ad nauseam. The saving grace of this album is Lauren Flax's Flaxdatass mix of ""Much Finer""-- it's the only cut that somehow manages to walk the fine line between preserving the feel of the original, and genuinely adding something worthwhile to it. The track is subtly restructured with a more complex underlying rhythm and a keyboard riff that sounds vaguely lifted from ""Blue Moon,"" and frankly, it sounds fantastic. If there were a couple more like this one, Le Tigre's Remix might be rubbing elbows with those few other elite remixes that don't suck. As it stands, its membership card to that club got lost in the mail, along with any point to most of the mixes, and a good reason for even releasing this record. Hopefully the DJs will be able to make more use of it than the average listener.","As the astute reader has already determined, Le Tigre's latest is, in fact, a remix album. Honestly, does anyone ...

Some Things Plural,The Roots of Orchis,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2ac5e6ef95969320482/1:1/w_160/7c3e0f4e.jpg,2002-06-05 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6836-some-things-plural/,Slowdance,"To paraphrase an insight from Spin a few years ago (before they were sucking the band off), Incubus were notable if only because they'd managed to make the turntables just another bland member amongst the traditional rock-and-roll trio of bass, guitar and drums. Deracinated, the needle became simply a tool for decoration. Considering the title of the first track, ""Roll the Dice Man, Baby Needs a New Ellipsis,"" I was a little wary of the dull scratching that begins the new album from The Roots of Orchis. Thankfully, the piece develops into a smooth post-rocking instrumental with a dusty groove that never imagines itself any more pimped out than it is. Other instruments humbly rise: a supple bassline to add some swing, synthesizers to make it all swirl, and the scratching's never too pervasive. Of course, they could have called themselves The Roots of Tortoise. Not to overuse the Chicago scenesters as post-rock's only touch-point, but Some Things Plural specifically brings to mind Tortoise's self-titled debut on Thrill Jockey. By contrast, this is the Roots' third album, and they've updated their organic, jazzy-soft sound with a lot of feedback drones, layered keyboards, and other electronic processing. The aforementioned song actually reminds me more of the swerving rhythms on Scott Herren's Savath + Savalas project. But the way that the bass guitar always prods insistently forward (yet remains the backbone of these forty-five minutes) recalls Dave Pajo's short time with the Tortoiseheads. The Roots of Orchis have grown to the point where they're very careful about songwriting. There are few central melodies per se-- more a selection of motifs that they create through changes in rhythm. Each song clearly began as a jam, but the final versions are all trimmed for eloquence: no filler. A subtle whiff of cymbals and synth begins ""39 Years, 4 Months Ago Today,"" and the guitar emits a barely-audible scrim of sound in the background, like a hi-fi version of Cul de Sac's noodling. The Roots play with much more restraint than those post-surfers, though: soon the elements lock together and the pace steadily increases then calms down again, where other literalists would have launched the expected rawk-out. Most of the time the emphasis is on chilldom, as with ""Halfway to a Handshake,"" which could serve as the soundtrack to any number of dingy lounge nights. There's really not much to distinguish these guys from their brethren, though. By the time ""Log Jammin"" rolls by, you're waiting for a bit more than rapid-fire hi-hats from a drum machine to stir the mix. The later tracks all start to sound the same. If the band really wants to stand out, they need to write more songs like ""The Calm Within the Storm,"" where the gentle ring of a xylophone belies the tension whipped up later by guest Josh Quan's bass clarinet. Yet even this track barely reaches a roil. Still, The Roots of Orchis have been getting a good amount of airtime on college radio, and there's no doubt Some Things Plural would be great accompaniment for a late-night session around the bong.","To paraphrase an insight from Spin a few years ago (before they were sucking the band off), Incubus were notable ...

The Private Press,DJ Shadow,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9c69d034d5c69bf52d6/1:1/w_160/1e5c0add.jpg,2002-06-05 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2373-the-private-press/,MCA,"Chances are, the first time you heard DJ Shadow's Endtroducing, it sounded damned unique. No, the fat beats and the goofy samples and the wickedy-wicky weren't anything new, even back in those halcyon days of '96, but the idea of fat beats and goofy samples and wickedy-wicky on an album bereft of some sucka MC's verbal gymnastics-- that, friends, was gold. Instrumental hip-hop, of course, was no more radical an idea back then than it is now; but for many of us young wannabes and poseurs, Endtroducing was the first time we'd ever heard anything quite like it. And even if the concept wasn't just out of the box, the freaky melange of John Carpenter soundtracks and visceral, pounding punk beats in a hip-hop environment most certainly was. So, DJ Shadow may not have invented instrumental hip-hop, but he did sound a revolution with it. And now, six years, two mix records with Cut Chemist and a handful of UNKLE remixes later, here we all sit at our little terminals wondering if Mr. Josh Davis is capable of doing it all over again. But The Private Press is being dropped into a market vastly different than the one that gave birth to its predecessor. Ninja Tune, Mo'Wax and other like-minded labels have spent the last half-decade slowly and laboriously digging a grave in which to bury the beats-and-samples formula. Which might explain why-- despite its fair share of fat beats, goofy samples and wickedy-wicky-- The Private Press will not go down in history as the record that brought electronic music out of its state of imminent peril. After an irritating introductory segment in which some woman who's probably dead now recites a written letter to a friend (the record is littered with these skit-like clips, and though some are mildly entertaining, they tend to detract from the real deal), the album opens up for real with ""Fixed Income,"" a fine-enough instrumental hip-hop retread that leaves little impression after it's clicked over to ""Walkie Talkie,"" where things lighten up a bit. Built from a harsh drumbeat and a few alternating samples-- a man bellowing ""I'm a bad muthafuckin' DJ,"" a woman proclaiming, ""This is why I walk and talk this way,"" and the now-ubiquitous cry of ""SUCKA!""-- the groove on ""Walkie Talkie"" is seriously tight (even 'dope,' if you so dare), despite its too-quirky, scratched-upon boasting. Up until now, The Private Press has resided in the comfortable niche chiseled out by Endtroducing, albeit with a less darkly atmospheric bent. But the record's also got its fair share of tracks that sound nothing like Shadow's previous endeavors; alongside the familiar sounding cuts, new directions abound: on ""Six Days,"" a soulful R&B; crooner tears off close to a week's worth of page-a-days, lamenting with each that, ""Tommorow never comes until it's too late."" This 007-esque sentiment is set to hand drums and organ washes that wouldn't sound out of place on a pitched-down Can record. ""Right Thing/GDMFSOB"" infuses the standard Shadow routine with a hint of electro, replacing some of the trademark live-sounding drumming with cheesy machines, and looping a nicely staggered vocal to fit the beat. ""Monosylabik"" heads a bit further down this path, matching a vocal sample and drenched-in-delay drums with buzzing synths and bumping bass. ""Mashin' on the Motorway"" is a short but sweet tip of the hat to road rage, ""Grand Theft Auto III,"" and those reckless driving songs rebelliously churned out in the 1950s. Angry drivers serenade Lateef the Truth Speaker (of the Quannum Projects duo Latyrx) with horn honks and swears as he ponders the slow-moving fiends surrounding him (""I tell 'em move over/ This road ain't big enough for ya/ I'm flying like Knight Rider/ They tryin' to keep up with they Grandma beside em'/ 'Sides, maybe his steel-belted radials are expired/ Maybe they tired/ Maybe their odometer needs to be rewired""), the whole thing escalating until it crashes and detonates like a hundred-car pile-up. Next up is ""Blood on the Motorway,"" a comparatively slow, meditative reaction. Spoken word ruminations about death fall over simple piano chords, chimes and bad 80s synths, the relative corniness of which I could tolerate were it not for the hair-metal balladeering that comes with it. At one point, the vocalist repeats the phrase ""let the laughter..."" three times before he manages to get to what he wants us to allow the laughter to do. Personally, the melodramatic delivery of such underwhelming lines as, ""Your eyes will not close/ Your tongue barely speaks/ But I can still feel you,"" over an electro-synth arpeggio isn't exactly my cup of tea. Still, I appreciate Shadow's attempt to take a different approach, even if I don't care for the execution. Besides, the song does eventually resolve itself with a hot instrumental charge headed by a tight-as-can-be breakbeat, so I suppose nothing's lost... er, except any unhealthily harbored expectations of perfection. Shadow closes the album with a song called ""You Can't Go Home Again."" The title fits: though he makes a point of referencing styles and techniques from his breakthrough debut, he's clearly most interested in forward-thinking sounds. Like watching live improvisation, the results aren't always perfect, but you feel part of the process; the relative success of the whole takes a back seat to the art of trying. It's better this way, anyhow. It would, after all, be a sad thing if Shadow took a sad shot at Xeroxing his debut. But what would be sadder is if people dismissed this album just because it doesn't live up to the strength of its groundshattering predecessor. The Private Press is more solid an album than anyone dared expect from an older, wiser DJ Shadow, and though it won't be televising another revolution, I'd be lying if I said its celebratory pleasure centers didn't communicate directly with my own.","Chances are, the first time you heard DJ Shadow's Endtroducing, it sounded damned unique.

Interiors,Ativin,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a09db1335d7bf169806b/1:1/w_160/a9d408ea.jpeg,2002-06-04 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/335-interiors/,Secretly Canadian,"Ativin, welcome back. Four years ago, when you bid us adieu, perhaps not too many people noticed or cared-- but those of us who did shook our heads and heaved a heavy, regretful sigh. We knew your time had come; it was obvious. Math-rock was on the inevitable slide, especially heavy instrumental math-rock like yours. Too few ideas, too many bands, drawing upon too few sources. So you got out while the getting was good, after releasing just one full-length, a couple EPs, and a single. Brief, direct, lean, to the point-- just like the band itself. A minimal but pummeling drummer and two guitarists. Bassist? Who needs a bassist? The gypsies had no homes and you had no bassist. It all made sense, and after a tour in support of your lone proper album, you called it quits, and that too made sense. But now you're back with a new record, Interiors, but why? I can see how the threads from the earlier stuff flow through onto this one, but on the whole this seems like the work of a completely different band, and, well, you are largely a completely different band, so why not just come out and say so? It's not like ELO touring without Jeff Lynne or anything. Guitarists Dan Burton and Chris Carothers are on board, but gone is drummer Rory Leitch, and while replacement Kevin Duneman is adequate, frankly, he lacks the punch and quick snap of Leitch, whose drumming went a long way toward creating your distinctive sound amidst the faceless hordes of mathy noodlers. But on top this personnel shift, the string section from Burton's Early Day Miners (the band he formed soon after Ativin disbanded) is all over this record. So, based on the line-up alone, this could almost be called a Early Day Miners release. But based on the music, too, Interiors is closer to Early Day Miners than your old self. Sure, this album has got those repetitive, interlocking guitar patterns we came to love, but they're less disorienting now and more atmospheric-- like Early Day Miners. Hell, it's even got vocals on a couple songs-- and bass, and baritone guitar, and electronics, and strings, and on and on. It's like a freaking orchestra! Don't get me wrong, this is a nice little record you've made here; it just seems conflicted. I dunno, I like things to make sense, and what made Ativin Ativin, in my mind, was the leanness and power. No offense, but you were like a well-bred horse, even when you got a little trippy and sprawling on that last posthumous EP of yours-- it was still simple and undeniably listenable. Now you're just all over the place. There are some heavy, ass-kicking segments here, like the tailsection of ""End of Tape"" or pretty much the entirety of ""Scissors"" and ""Two Knives as Crutches,"" but what to do with the dubbed-out ""When the Sky Turns Clear,"" or the going nowhere-ness of ""Underwater,"" or the stuttering mumble of ""A Single Crease""? It would be different if these curveballs were aimed at something, but somehow they just seem like exercises in recording technique. I know Burton runs his own studio now, but c'mon, there's no reason for about half of these songs. Ativin, you've traded in your economy for the sprawl of Early Day Miners, without securing much of their luminous grandeur in the bargain. At any rate, welcome back. Here's your lukewarm review.","Ativin, welcome back. Four years ago, when you bid us adieu, perhaps not too many people noticed or cared-- but ...

Knife Play,Xiu Xiu,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aaca13d1975652139ace/1:1/w_160/482d761a.gif,2002-06-04 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8821-knife-play/,Kill Rock Stars5RC,"Critics sometimes share a form of bloodlust. They relish tossing off stock terms like 'sophomoric' or 'infantile'-- they're after the amateur for whom all output is 'art,' little more than a child proud of its own shit. If that's the case, then Xiu Xiu have produced one of the most inviting piles of it I've ever heard-- a profusion of all things twisted, wrecked, corrupt and sour and terrified. All I want to do is dive in and roll around in its richness. Each track or Knife Play is like a rock song captured in a photo negative, with all the hidden details brought frighteningly to the fore. It's a debut clearly in the debt of post-punk, one that has cut up and contorted itself to fit into the few cracks that albums in the past haven't reached. All this may be guessed from the infamous cover sticker, which reads: ""When my mom died I listened to Henry Cowell, Joy Division, Detroit techno, the Smiths, Takemitsu, Sabbath, Gamelan, 'Black Angels' and Cecil Taylor."" The quote comes from the group's enfant terrible, Jamie Stewart, and many who've bought the album for its influences aren't prepared for his tantrums. Though he cools down to a whisper later on, the first few songs shift without warning into strained cries, yelps and howls. I'll make my warning very clear: there will be hordes of people who will absolutely hate this album. They'll diss it for being too histrionic and pretentious, and maybe they'll even be right. Stewart wants to shock you, of course. His vocals stage guerilla skirmishes, cowering back in thickets of sound before pelting out a wild yell. Admittedly, at times he reaches a level of unintentional self-parody. ""Hives Hives"" opens with an awesome squall of feedback, but soon the tense, rumbling drum crashes peak with Stewart pining, ""A-I-D-S/ H-I-V/ I cannot wait to die, can't you tell, can't you tell, can't you tell?"" It's pathetic to the point of banality, the height of clich√©d angst. Hope comes only in sonic bombast-- one of the most gloriously nihilistic guitar solos I've heard in a while, a solid screed of stupid feedback firing measure after measure into nothingness. Stewart is more than just a Reznorian miserabilist, though. In taking Xiu Xiu absolutely literally, people will miss their sense of humor. The drum machine on ""I Broke Up (SJ)"" patters manically forward until the rhythm splits in a hopeful burst: the keyboards swell like a Peter Gabriel ballad, then just as soon wilt and reveal some psychotic twin. Then the sudden scream: ""THIS IS THE WORST VACATION EVER-- I'M GOING TO CUT OPEN YOUR FOREHEAD WITH A ROOFING SHINGLE!"" ""Anne Dong\xEE"" proceeds with more subtlety: solemn, almost religious bells and other clanging sounds set the rhythm amid the soft drone of a saxophone. This long, slow dirge is capped off nonchalantly with a deadpan impression of a young Jarvis Cocker: ""You're not coming to my birthday. Ohh, I know."" Despite these moments, Knife Play is deadly serious, an album for the mad and the ill, the suicidal and those near death. As such, with Xiu Xiu form fits function-- the songs warp aurally to match the anguish in the lyrics, drudge on in approximation of the doldrums, or just fizzle out in aborted contempt. ""Don Diasco"" opens with ar ornate gong pattern, signaling the band's classical ambitions. New Order synth-pads thump for a second and then cease, and Stewart's passionate breathiness reminds a little of Talk Talk's Mark Hollis. The brass figures at the beginning of ""Luber"" seem to have drifted away from Bj√∂rk's ""Aeroplane,"" but then the trumpet bleeds into aquatic synthesizers, leaving an aching feeling instead of the former's contentment. I'm tempted to favor the strangest turns, as on the Thighpaulsandra-esque ""Homonculus,"" where dissonant piano figures are obliterated by crunchy bass bombs. But the piece that seems to resonate with everyone the most is ""Suha,"" a relatively straightforward ballad about a mother who is going to hang herself; it's stark enough to make you start eyeing your own wrists. The band admits that most of their material is directly autobiographical, and a dark, voyeuristic pleasure enters play when you realize that Stewart's addressing other band members in a few of the songs. That ability to marry oblique sounds and a sense of mystery to a sentimental, personal narrative makes these patchwork vignettes incredibly affecting, and it's no wonder that the disc scans as a bizarre love child of synth-pop, no wave and goth. So fuck your 'art damage' and your 'pathetic self-pity.' Intensity this overwhelming makes you reevaluate your opinion on what emotions music has the right to explore. Knife Play may have its weaknesses, but it's oddly cathartic to immerse yourself in, peeling back layer after layer.","Critics sometimes share a form of bloodlust.

Music for Courage & Confidence,Mark Eitzel,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc16abf31b7dc7155c35/1:1/w_160/e2b82d73.jpg,2002-06-04 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2702-music-for-courage-confidence/,New West,"So picture this: you're a renowned and accomplished songwriter. Somehow, over the years, commercial success has eluded you, but critical acclaim certainly hasn't-- every publication from Magnet to NME has taken time out of their day to tell people you're great at what you do. After seven fine albums with your band American Music Club (and five great solo records), you're getting ready to cut your next album. And you record ten songs written by other people. Why? Who knows-- maybe you just need a break from your own material and your own life for a while. Or you want to pay tribute to some people who inspired you over the years. Whatever the reason, abandoning your main strength when you go in to record is a pretty risky proposition. Mark Eitzel is well known for his deeply personal songwriting, and with good reason. He's a master of drawing out his own anguish and suffering and putting it in terms you can relate to as a listener, and he's always managed to find the right musical backdrop for his confessionals, whether working with American Music Club or on his own. But on this record, you get to hear him tackling Culture Club, Curtis Mayfield, Phil Ochs, Bill Withers and others, with varying degrees of success. Is that a smile I see in the photo on the back of the booklet? What's going on here? Well, listening to it, one of the first things that's apparent is that Eitzel isn't willing to alter his approach to accommodate his subject matter-- whether he's taking on an old John Hartford chestnut or a demanding melody like Curtis Mayfield's ""Move on Up,"" he keeps things firmly within his range. Of course, there's a reason Eitzel is usually noted for his songwriting and not his singing-- his deep, breathy baritone is a limited instrument, but he manages to get a lot of mileage out of it, and Music for Courage & Confidence is no exception. The album sees Eitzel backed by a conspicuously high-calibre cadre of backing musicians, from Ryan Adams producer Ethan Johns to bigshot drummers Joey Waronker and Larry Mullins, though nicely, they all manage to stay out of the spotlight, allowing Eitzel to remain the center of attention. On Eitzel's last outing, 2001's outstanding The Invisible Man, he experimented with more electronic textures and indulged the part of him that liked to listen to Kraftwerk when he was younger, in the process creating what may be his best solo outing yet. There are hints of that direction on this album as well, as Eitzel and producers Brian Paulson and Johan Kugelberg brought in Napoleon Hill to craft backgrounds for three tracks here. The result is an icy take on Culture Club's ""Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?"" that reveals a dark undercurrent you might have missed in the original, as well as interesting versions of the Flamingoes' ""I Only Have Eyes for You,"" and strangely, Andrea True's 1976 disco smash ""More, More, More."" ""I Only Have Eyes for You"" is surprisingly well-served by the wobbly soundscape and rough acoustic guitar treatment it's given here. ""More, More, More"" chugs and burbles, overflowing with programmed hi-hat and sampled guitar noise, cut through with brief, rhythmless ambient interjections-- a far cry from the original. Elsewhere, it sounds like Eitzel and his crew had some genuine fun making this record, as evidenced by the amusing, almost Zappa-esque monologue he uses to cap off Kris Kristofferson's ""Help Me Make It Through the Night."" Bill Withers' ""Ain't No Sunshine"" seems an especially apropos selection for the perennially gloomy Eitzel, and he handles it beautifully, making it one of the most faithful covers on the album. Marc Capelle's funky Wurlitzer fills the room with smoke while Mullins' tight drumming keeps the tension high during the song's quieter moments. Perhaps the album's finest track is also its most upbeat-- an effervescent, spirited take on John Hartford's ""Gentle on My Mind"" (some of you might be familiar with Glen Campbell's version). A Latin feel, oddball keyboards and Justin Meldal-Johnson's melodic bass transport you briefly to some quasi-Lynchian lounge. Almost as good is the quick-paced and surprisingly faithful version of Mayfield's ""Move on Up,"" which finds Eitzel singing parts he never seemed capable of before, bringing the whole affair down about two octaves. It's hardly better than the incredible original, but it's certainly a worthy tribute if there ever was one. The album closes with a weird, whispery cover of the Fain/Kahal classic ""I'll Be Seeing You."" Eitzel's baritone scrapes at the bottom of its range, reduced to an odd whisper as he sings the lines ""I'll be seeing you/ In all the old familiar places."" It's actually quite compelling-- kind of like parting with a close friend and just hoping you'll see them again soon. And of course, I do hope to be seeing Eitzel again soon, though next time it'd be nice if he'd bring some of his own songs to the table. For now, this covers record is a charming enough document that fans will almost certainly find worthwhile.","So picture this: you're a renowned and accomplished songwriter.

Pixeltan EP,Pixeltan,by: Michael Bernstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0865e6ef9596931ff86/1:1/w_160/728044b4.gif,2002-06-04 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6312-pixeltan-ep/,Troubleman Unlimited,"The only accurate way to depict what is commonly perceived as the 'New York sound' on record would be to do shit like field-record our jail cells, scrape chins, and do a lot of screaming. Amplified screaming. Affected screaming. And while Pixeltan don't quite go that far, they definitely have the screaming part down, and with plenty of grunts and moans to boot. While remaining minimal enough to stay cool, Pixeltan manages to ride perverted human drum-machine beats just on the edge of exploding. The crackly, fucked-up guitar (it's a synth! No, wait, it's a bass!) is consistently surprising in its range of sounds. This four-song EP clocks in at just under twelve minutes, another nod to its style-- as if to say, ""We could hang out here a while longer, but this scene is beat,"" or, ""There is most definitely a better place to be right now than in this fucking recording studio."" Several aspects of the music itself favor this short length, including the inhumane beats pounded out by Hisham (Black Dice's drummer, who has since left Pixeltan to do the Black Dice gig full time) and the Yoko Ono-on-crack stylings of Mika's vocals. Really, this EP couldn't go on for that much longer without completely detonating, erasing itself, and leaving no trace of its origins. All four songs stay enough within the boundaries of dance music: hit it and quit it. Pixeltan definitely hits it, with sneered breathy vocals: ""It's gonna get you... It's gonna get you... It's gonna get you... It's gonna get you... It's gonna get you... It's gonna get you... GONNA GET YOU... GONNA GET YOU... GONNA GET YOU..."" After listening to this EP over and over again, real paranoia begins to set in. This is the New York of Now. Comparisons can clearly be drawn to the obvious: Liquid Liquid, Public Image Ltd., etc. Troubleman's website says Pixeltan draw from these sources, ""but with a harder, more electronic edge."" I'm not sure if that's 100% accurate, but it's pretty damn close. To me it sounds like those bands, but with a more modern feel and an overdriven, erratic, second-half-of-""Sister Ray"" vibe: totally sloshed and yelling from the back of the bar. What Pixeltan lacks in length, they make up for with actual power and movement, which tons of these bullshit New York bands clearly lack. What they have in power, they may lack in diversity-- which is a difficult thing to judge over the course of twelve minutes, no matter how many times you listen to it. Still, the power level stays at ten, and if you crank it and leave it there, the twelve minutes seem to last a lot longer.","The only accurate way to depict what is commonly perceived as the 'New York sound' on record would be to ...

Blobscape,Geoff Farina,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd53c0084474cd0c2c90/1:1/w_160/41491227.jpg,2002-06-03 05:00:03,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2996-blobscape/,Kimchee,"There are many peripheral reasons one might be compelled to buy music, besides the obvious liking something you hear and checking it out. For example, suppose your brother is in a band-- you'll probably want to buy his album, even if your brother is deaf, or his name is John Stamos. Or you might be one of those 'completists,' the fanatics who will not rest until they own every b-side, guest appearance, and bootleg by their favorite artist. If so, then reviews probably don't affect your purchasing habits. However, the central reason most everyone else in the world buys music is neither familial relationships or fanaticism. Nope. It's this: they want to listen to it. If this reflects your experience, then pay close attention: do not buy this album. Blobscape is the third solo recording from Karate and Secret Stars principal Geoff Farina. Farina plays guitar-- and in late 2001, he recorded over 100 instrumental improvisations, 16 of which he released to CD. Restated colloquially, for emphasis: Blobscape is a recording of improvisational guitar noodling. Sixteen tracks' worth! Unleashing solo guitar recordings on the public puts Farina in a class with such Guitar World regulars as Michael Hedges, Tim Reynolds and Eric Johnson. All accomplished technically, no doubt, but have you ever felt compelled to buy their albums? Probably not. After all, most of the time, contemporary solo guitar lacks for nearly every desirable musical quality: melody, rhythm, interesting dynamics-- pretty much what your average music enthusiast is looking for, save virtuoso ability. And Farina can't even boast this. Sure, he's pretty good, but it's not like he deserves his own signature Ibanez, let alone one with seven-strings, a vine fretboard inlay and cutaway carrying handle. To use the vernacular, Blobscape features very few killer chops, blazing riffs or hot licks (especially the licks). Let's see if we can cut Farina and his lickless noodling some slack. Perhaps creativity is his game: if it were, you'd expect the tracks to feature conceptual diversity, sonic uniqueness, and variety in playing style. Alas, they don't. As it happens, each of the sixteen cuts on Blobscape sound pedestrian and very similar. On each, you hear Farina spewing rapidly fingered arpeggios, almost-bluesy hammer-ons, and a bunch of abstract modal shit (my catch-all term for the stuff that sucked), without keeping a beat and without shifting guitar tone or tempo. Furthermore, and not surprisingly, there is almost nothing structured to grab a hold of; rarely does Farina add anything approaching a melody or a groove. Much of it sounds like warmup exercises, and the rest sounds like half-dissonant, improvised abstraction. If Farina's ideas are so brilliant, why not write them down and then work on improving them? Just an idea. This review could have consisted of three words: ""solo improvisational guitar,"" with perhaps the addition of the prefix ""bad."" The concept speaks for itself, albeit unpersuasively. Is Geoff Farina your brother? Do you work at Kim's Music and Video, where I plan to take a trip tomorrow? If not, then I repeat, for the benefit of your pocketbook: do not buy this album.","There are many peripheral reasons one might be compelled to buy music, besides the obvious liking something you hear and ...

I,Buffalo Daughter,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3e4c0084474cd0c038b/1:1/w_160/66083631.jpg,2002-06-03 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1007-i/,Emperor Norton,"In the past, Buffalo Daughter have often found themselves in the unfortunate position of being ""one of the other Japanese bands."" Though they share a sound with some of the other Japanese artists to penetrate the U.S. indie rock scene, they lacked Cornelius' vision, never came close to the touch and refinement of Takako Minekawa, and as for Shonen Knife, well... okay, they do just about everything better than Shonen Knife. But still, though they've consistently come up with a great track or two per release, Buffalo Daughter has never distinguished themselves in any way. They're as eclectic as their peers, but something has been missing on previous releases for Grand Royal. After hearing this, their first record for Emperor Norton, I've finally figured out what it is: the songs. Buffalo Daughter produce exceptional-sounding tracks that cover a wide spectrum of genres, texture and mood; they perform well on a variety of instruments, and their voices blend nicely most of the time. But they don't write great songs-- too often, they don't even write good ones. Though they're genre-hopping like mad, and making all the sounds pretty, if you have people singing and you're adhering to pop structure, you best be writing some songs. So as usual, I has few standouts. The first of these is the fantastically catchy riff-rocker ""28 Nuts."" After an extended intro that sounds like the band tuning up in front of an orchestra, the crunch takes over, and Buffalo Daughter sound like the Primitives with the vocals pitched down an octave. Forget that the crude two-chord riff is the mirror image of the hook that drove ""Great Five Lakes""-- this is still a great track. Also fine is the title track, which does away with the electricity and opts for dreamy Brazilian pop, complete with some heartwarming flute. A half-notch below these is the midtempo, harmony-laden ""Mirror Ball,"" which has the prettiest melody on the album but eventually wears out its welcome as it passes the seven-minute mark. ""Discotheque du Paradis"" is an engaging slice of roller-rink pop with an unexpected Kraftwerk sample. The rest of I displays admirable diversity, but no great songs. The lumbering ""Earth Punk Rockers"" has a proggy cast to it and wants to sound like the Flaming Lips' ""The Gash,"" but ultimately the poor singing and non-existent melody sink it. ""Robot Sings (As If He Were Frank Sinatra with a Half-Boiled Egg and the Salt Shaker on a Breakfast Table)"" has a nice-enough title and, yes, vocodered vocals, but the limp structure just kind of lays there. All told, I is far from a terrible record, but Buffalo Daughter only skim the surface of greatness, flirting with a myriad of styles without ever perfecting any of them.","In the past, Buffalo Daughter have often found themselves in the unfortunate position of being ""one of the other Japanese ...

Low Kick and Hard Bop,Solex,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4a9c0084474cd0c053a/1:1/w_160/d0794f33.jpg,2002-06-03 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7324-low-kick-and-hard-bop/,Matador,"The Pitchfork precogs reached consensus. There wasn't even an inking of a minority report on Low Kick and Hard Bop. All three mutant visionaries reported that only Elisabeth Esselink (operational guise: Solex) could have created the splendidly chaotic beat-a-rama. But I consulted the Pitchfork precogs only out of curiosity. From the opening moments of the title track through to the closer, ""Look-- No Fingerprints!"" I couldn't mistake any of this album for someone else's work. The debut Solex album, Solex vs. the Hitmeister, sampled unwanted record store vinyl, telling personal tales of ripped stockings and Solex's Rolex. Solex album number two, Pick Up, sampled live performances and roughened up the gentler edges of the debut, but retained the minuscule vignettes of trivial activity. ""Oh Blimey"" tells of a woman pulling ""bits and bobs"" out of her pocket with all the glee of Bj√∂rk, but none of the pixie princess' staged naivet√©. Despite the commonplaceness of her lyrics, Esselink made sure that the musical accompaniment was far harsher thar before. Perhaps someone had offloaded a bunch of soundboard tapes by Minor Threat's Dutch equivalents. Though Low Kick and Hard Bop doesn't retreat from Pick Up's abrasiveness, it does draw its samples from a wider array of sources, with Esselink making far savvier choices of skitter-funk drum breaks to loop. Thus, Low Kick and Hard Bop takes far fewer listens to capture the listener. This third time around has given Esselink the opportunity to show off her near-perfect ability to mimic Fall song titles. ""Mere Imposters,"" ""Ease Up You Fundamentalists,"" and ""Look-- No Fingerprints!"" are just three examples of Esselink's appropriatior of Mark E. Smith's askance appellation engine. ""Mere Imposters"" deals with a formal apple-bobbing competition at a dinner party supervised by the waitstaff; ""Have You No Shame, Girl?"" depicts a catfight between dancing girls. I'm at a loss to figure out what ""Not a Hoot!"" is about, even though I find it ar irresistible bayou-bounce complete with gris-gris guitars and menacing backbeats. But what I find so engrossing about Low Kick and Hard Bop isn't the samples, it's how Esselink combines them and submits them to her idiosyncratic style. It's quite a feat to take quirky elements from so many diverse sources and make them coherent, to the extent that I don't even register that they're samples. They become part of the Solex entity. Even Esselink's vocal mannerism wavers, but remains unmistakably Solex. From swamp-thing growl to Tanya Donelly-does-a-Kathleen-Hanna-Valley-Girl-rant, Esselink stamps these styles with the Solex identity. Her ability to integrate discordant and heterogeneous elements leads me to believe that if Esselink was a shift manager at Subway, rather than a record shop owner, she'd as effortlessly construct something unique from three-day-old veggies and moldy bologna. Yet the consistency of Solex material is potentially the agent of its own downfall. Play Solex vs. the Hitmeister after Low Kick and Hard Bop and you might think that they were recorded at the same time, rather than four years apart. Low Kick Hard Bop offers nothing essentially different than past Solex releases. While I'm not asking for a duet with Peaches or a remix by the Streets, I would appreciate a new facet to the customary lo-fi diamond boogaloo. I quizzed the Pitchfork precogs with a 'wither Solex?' question. While two out of three precogs foresaw a sequin-and-Appletini future for Esselink in Vegas, I prefer the less radical modification to Solex as described in the dissenting report. Time will tell if the minority precog and I will be thoroughly satisfied.","The Pitchfork precogs reached consensus. There wasn't even an inking\r\n\ of a minority report on Low Kick ...

Chelsea Walls,Jeff Tweedy,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a83ab1335d7bf169922b/1:1/w_160/b3ad7251.jpg,2002-06-02 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8198-chelsea-walls/,Ryko,"These certainly are strange times for Jeff Tweedy. Assuming you're literate and that you live somewhere other than an ammunition-fortified Al-Qaeda tunnel, you don't need to hear that old Yankee Hotel Foxtrot sob story again. So let's just say this: Tweedy is at the height of his success while making the most challenging music of his career-- not an easy feat by any measure. And now, in conjunction with Wilco's latest opus, Tweedy has released his first recording under his own name, the soundtrack to Ethan Hawke's directorial debut Chelsea Walls. Now, frankly, this isn't the kind of thing that's going to solidify his stardom. For starters, there are only five 'real' songs, as we'll call them for convenience, and only two of them even feature him. The record's other seven tracks comprise his score for the film, and though each is effective in its proper capacity as soundtrack music, most of it isn't the sort of stuff you're going to feel compelled to listen to time and again. Consider the seven-minute opening titles, for example. Tweedy layers swelling feedback and ambling guitar parts over Wilco drummer Glenn Kotche's sporadic percussion, but the loosely defined theme he plays isn't very commanding, and the sputtering vibes in the background don't help it congeal. In short, it does what an effective soundtrack should do-- establish a mood or feeling without distracting you from what's going on. The problem is that it doesn't make for very engaging listening outside of the context of the film. It gets more interesting toward the end, as Kotche's percussion rises in intensity and Tweedy's wall of sound grows thicker, but as a stand-alone piece, it never really arrives. Part of the problem lies in the fact that each score track can be easily represented by a brief description of what happens in it. For instance, ""Hello, Are You There?"" is ""the short one with the repetitive acoustic guitar and all the floaty keyboards on top,"" while ""Finale"" is ""the overlong one with the repetitive acoustic guitar and all the floaty keyboards on top."" ""The Wallman"" builds a lovely texture with vibes and what sounds like a harmonium, but only gestures at building a piece of music with that texture. Makes for wonderful sonic wallpaper, but that's about all I can say for it. The remaining pieces each manage to hold their own on some level without visual accompaniment, with the sparse piano and cymbals of ""Frank's Dream"" sounding like the not-too-distant cousin of something Michael Krassner's Boxhead Ensemble might have dreamed up-- appropriate, as Tweedy appeared on that collective's last album. In fact, most of the score pieces on this album reflect Tweedy's recent involvement with Chicago's improvisation-oriented underground musical exchange-- Kotche himself has been a mainstay on that same scene for years now. The two most aggressive-- and memorable-- score pieces come at opposite ends of the disc. ""Red Elevator"" follows the opening titles by swinging the vibe 180 degrees. Kotche lays down a heavy backbeat, over which Tweedy tosses off distorted riffs and some interesting manipulated feedback. There's a primal drive to it that contrasts well with the rest of the music here, and it's likely to catch your attention mostly for that reason. Better still is the music composed for the closing credits, wherein Tweedy weaves a gorgeous tapestry of themes and counterthemes on acoustic guitars over Kotche's subdued but steady drumming. While the score pieces may not all be memorable, they at least have a consistent and seemingly coherent color and mood. That flow is broken, however, by the five other songs tossed like so many cucumber slices into the salad of the tracklist. You won't mind when it's Wilco interrupting the flow, as their two contributions are easily the highlights of the album. ""Promising"" is vintage acoustic Wilco, and would have fit beautifully on Being There's second disc. Tweedy spins an arresting ballad, bathed in dobro and fingerpicked guitars. Even better is ""When the Roses Bloom Again,"" another leftover kicking around from the band's Mermaid Avenue sessions with Billy Bragg. It was booted from the first album when they discovered the lyrics weren't actually Guthrie originals-- he had adapted a standard-- but it's easily the equal of any of the best material on either of them (Mermaid Avenue, Vol. 2 even cribbed the melody for ""Blood of the Lamb""). Whoever wrote the lyrics, the humid swaths of slide guitar and organ bring the words to life in a way I'm sure would have impressed Guthrie himself. That leaves three other songs, however, which are less essential diversions, and in the case of jazz man Jimmy Scott's contribution, considerably less pleasant. Scott's version of John Lennon's ""Jealous Guy"" is the only honest-to-god bad thing on Chelsea Walls, and the less said about his piercing, androgynous caterwauling and listless, loungy arrangement the better. The final two tracks seem to be simply sound clips from the film, of actor Robert Sean Leonard, who plays a songwriter running through some material, one of which happens to be Wilco's ""The Lonely 1."" Though hardly bad, they're also unnecessary and come across more as curiosities than fully developed, listenable songs. So when the laser slides back across its little track and the disc stops spinning, what is there to say about Chelsea Walls? Not much, I'm afraid. Aside from a few mildly diverting pieces from Tweedy and Kotche and two excellent (and unfortunately, rare) songs, it has little to offer as an album divorced from the images that inspired it. I suppose Wilco completists will want it for those two extra songs, but only you know whether you're that devoted.","These certainly are strange times for Jeff Tweedy.

Invention,Daedelus,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a875ea9e61561daa5812/1:1/w_160/0a76611d.jpg,2002-06-02 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2129-invention/,Plug Research,"Daedalus, the most famous inventor in ancient Greece, is probably best known for fathering a dipshit. Daedalus' son Icarus reckoned himself such a player when he decided that flying higher than anywhere else on flimsy wings held together with wax (the Scotch tape of ancient Greece) was a good thing. Icarus was killed when he plummeted into the sea after the heat of the Aegean sun melted away the wax on his wings. It wasn't for another two thousand years or so that Leonardo Da Vinci thought about winged flight-- Icarus' stupidity put everyone but the Renaissance genius off the idea of becoming birdy. Daedalus, though, was a shrewd man. He constructed one or two questionable things, and chief amongst them was a cow. Yes, Daedalus fulfilled a request from King Minos' wife Pasiphae to make her a cow costume so that she could fuck a bull that the sea god Poseidon had sent for Minos to sacrifice in order to confirm his right to rule over Crete. I suppose he looked at the project as more of an engineering challenge than as some kinky request from a sovereign's wife who could have him decapitated if he didn't comply. Despite his successful completion of the task and Pasiphae's successful impregnation by Poseidon's bull, Daedalus still ended up in the chokey. I guess Minos wasn't too pleased when his wife gave birth to the half-human, half-bull chimera, the Minotaur. But before throwing him in the clink, Minos did order Daedalus to construct the labyrinth in which Minos imprisoned the Minotaur. All in all, a pretty remarkable figure, this Daedalus bloke. As you'd expect, anyone adopting Daedalus' name (albeit with a tiny alteration in spelling) takes on a slew of pre-conceived notions. Fortunately, the gorgeous and nigh-on-unique Invention is more than worthy of assuming the name of its ancient Greek forbearer. Daedelus takes downtempo IDM and adds the naivety of childhood and the poignancy of Tin Pan Alley ballad arrangements. Just as Dntel's Life Is Full of Possibilities charmed me out of my IDM ennui last year, so too has Invention. Daedelus' combination of Mush-style beats with the dew-eyed nostalgia of 1940s and 1950s string arrangements may seem awkward on paper, but nowhere does the combination of avant electronics and strings jar or sound forced. Daedelus has realized what the downtempo elite Broadway Project and Bonobo have known for a while now: contrast need not disturb. Throughout Invention, I'm amazed at how complementary the opposites sound. During ""Playing Parties,"" a low frequency sawtooth sound emerges from the skirts of a stately, stomping concert grand piano into a glitched-up clockwork world of nursery toys. Daedelus presents a sound picture of gentle chimes and bells and whirs, then ushers in the star attraction-- a synthetic melody line every bit as romantic as the one Jega used on his stand-out ""Geometry."" The opening string ensemble sample that begins ""Pursed Lips Reply"" recalls the wistful poignancy of the Hollywood String Quartet's accompaniment to Frank Sinatra's 1957 album Close to You, a sentiment builds throughout the track. Daedelus recasts that 50s nostalgia with ""Astroboy,"" a complexly arranged tune with segmented spoken word narration. It's like Brian Aldiss' short story ""Super-Toys Last All Summer Long"" (the foundation for Kubrick/Spielberg's A.I.) retold for first-graders. Remarkably, the chopped story of a robot wondering about its identity is never cloying or even, in fact, resolved. For ""Adventress,"" Daedelus pulls a woodwind ensemble out of retirement and gives them wistful melodies of their forgotten youth to dwell upon. ""Quiet Now"" is as close to conventional downtempo as Invention gets. Over a lolloping EQ'd rhythm track a processed guitar works counter-rhythms. By contrast, ""Perchance a Bit"" is John Surman's bass clarinet soundclashing with Jega's electronics. ""Soulful of Child"" recalls some of Squarepusher's least spastic jazz-n-bass, a style that Daedelus taps more frenetically for ""Thus the Whirligig."" Two bonus cuts chart Invention's progression from childhood naivety to savvy maturity. Daedelus invites guest MCs Busdriver and Sach to rhyme over ""Quiet Now"" and ""Pursed Lips Reply."" Busdriver's and Sach's stagy delivery and avant-poetry message locate them squarely in Mush/cLOUDDED territory. However, while I appreciate these rhymes on their own, they do squelch the overall mood of the record in this context. Still, Daedelus' debut album manages to find common ground between 21st century electronics and the string arrangements of yesteryear. He never obscures one with the other, nor allows one to shine through at the other's expense. The disparate elements are in harmony and at the command of Daedelus' personality. It could have gone so horribly wrong. Daedelus could have ventured too far into the mawkish, or equally astray in search of David Lynchian oddity. Invention has very few peers, in my opinion. Though Schlammpeitzinger's Collected Simple Songs of My Temporary Past and Andrew Coleman's Everything Was Beautiful and Nothing Hurt come close, I'm firmly resigned that I'll not hear a more effortlessly charming album this year.","Daedalus, the most famous inventor in ancient Greece, is probably best known for fathering a dipshit.

Out of the Fierce Parade,The Velvet Teen,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a935c0084474cd0c0fc1/1:1/w_160/5a4e39a3.jpg,2002-06-02 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8433-out-of-the-fierce-parade/,Slowdance,"Boy, is The Velvet Teen a crappy superhero. A geeky 16-year-old caught in an explosion at Fabrictron's experimental Nuclear Textile Factory, Jimmy Krauser not only miraculously survived-- but also developed the unique power to transform his skin into a velvet-like substance at will. Forgetting the 'great power' part of the 'with great power comes great responsibility' adage, Jimmy set about fighting the rather pedestrian criminals of his quiet suburban Houston neighborhood, subduing shoplifters and underage drinkers by rubbing the soft, tiny hairs of his velvety forearm against their face. Yet, save the occasional battle with arch-enemy Dr. Velour (same explosion, similar powers, evil, etc.), The Velvet Teen is an unremarkable superhero at best. The mediocrity of Jimmy and his tactile battle against small-time wrongdoing is reflected in his soundtrack, Out of the Fierce Parade. While Spider-Man gets to swing around buildings to facial-hair rock from members of Nickelback and Alice in Chains, the Velvet Teen's music is of the introspective Northwest indie-rock scene: music for rainy-day snuggling-- not rainy-night, upside-down, slobbery Kirsten Dunst kisses. It's an appropriate matchup, though, as The Velvet Teen the costumed crusader and The Velvet Teen the musical trio both have the same general vibe: well intentioned, but not too original, and not very well executed. The Velvet Teen are a trio from Cotati, California with a debut album produced by Death Cab for Cutie's Chris Walla. Building most songs around singer/guitarist/key-tickler Judah Nagler's grand piano, the band favors long, slow-burning arrangements blanketed in Walla's usual fetish for the reverb knob. Self-consciously soaring above it all is Nagler's falsetto-more-often-than-not voice, one that is more than a little reminiscent of a certain lazy-eyed Brit whose name rhymes with Yom Thorke. But like the other 873 would-be Thommys straining their vocal cords these days, Nagler's lack of subtlety and restraint is a quick reminder of the original's considerable emoting skills. Rarely deviating from the upper registers, Nagler's vox fail to underscore the tragi-slacker lyrics, blurring any and all sentiments into an incessant whine. The music, meanwhile, belies a similarly obvious Radiohead lean, albeit one that sets too high a bar for the band-- imagine the fresh-faced and heavy-handed Pablo Honey-era grungers taking on the sleep-deprived paranoia of OK Computer. This approach leaves Out of the Fierce Parade with a lot of interesting, if familiar, minor-key ideas lost amidst unwieldy five, six, and seven-minute-long navel-gazing arrangements. ""A Special Gift for You"" and ""Into the Open"" manage to develop fairly effective dreamy environments, but would still benefit from a few days on the musical Atkins Diet. The obesity of ""Red, Like Roses"" and ""Death,"" however, goes right down to their genetics-- epics that take two or three minutes to charge up, while never paying any dividends once they finally get rolling. When things are kept lean, short, and given a bit of a backbone transplant (""Radiapathy,"" or the synthy C.S. Lewis nod ""Caspian Can Wait""), The Velvet Teen sound much more alive, though still stuck in the shadow of their Anglophilia. Sorely in need of an editor, and without a direction or sound to call their own, the band never even comes close to the oddball density of the Henry Miller excerpt they provide in the CD inset (remind me to check Tropic of Cancer out from the library). It ain't crime-fighting music-- hell, it ain't even crime-fighting video game music-- but this is one pathetic superhero that shouldn't be encouraged.","Boy, is The Velvet Teen a crappy superhero.

Here Be Monsters,Ed Harcourt,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c05aabf31b7dc715644e/1:1/w_160/d182522d.jpg,2002-05-30 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3739-here-be-monsters/,Capitol,"To all those searching for their next fix of minimal, watered-down singer/songwriter sensitivity, look no further. Ed Harcourt has arrived, and he's got exactly what you need. A recent expulsion from Headmaster DiCrescenzo's School for Emotionally Fragile Male Singer/Songwriters, Ed was retained by the program long enough to learn some by-the-book songwriting techniques, but his insistence on sweeping orchestration led to dismissal before he could complete the most important portions of the curriculum. What Harcourt failed to learn while enrolled was that his brand of orchestral folk-pop needs substance (or a healthy sense of humor) to survive. Now some of you might be wondering how Ed can be accused of being a hack when brain-dead pop outfits, like, say, Phantom Planet get the go-ahead to dumb down the nation's youth? Well, it all comes down to craftsmanship. Great pop songwriters like Elvis Costello or a young Bowie could have written classic songs about the phone book; they approached their material with a true sense of invention and the desire to craft songs that would not only appeal to the masses, but be creative and infectious enough to smooth-talk their way into the deepest recesses of the public consciousness. Middle-of-the-road acts (Sarah Shannon, Weezer, etc) make up for what they lack in creativity or brains with energy and interesting spins on old genres, and are at least able to wring out songs nuanced enough to warrant a few subsequent listens. If the best of the best write pop for the ages, and the runners-up write pop for today, then Ed excels at single-listen music. Once you've sampled his array of string swells, backing horns, and amateur piano the first time through, you realize that the depths of these songs could be plumbed with a toothpick. Harcourt writes like a supermodel: pretty but shallow. Not only in the sense of intellectual content (though that's in short supply here), but simply in the fact that Here Be Monsters doesn't have a payoff. Once you strip the polished veneer from the songs with the initial listen, further attempts leave nothing for subsequent discovery. Other bands might get away with this on intensity alone, but Harcourt's straightforward, predictable manner leaves his wan material desperately lacking. Considering the minimal tone of most of these tracks, Harcourt's vocal is miserably distant and unimpassioned-- he might as well be mumbling in his sleep. He rarely provides the intimacy necessary to sell what he's singing, destroying the most vital aspect of his work. Given the uniform rhythm of almost the entire album and the aimless, meandering sort of chamber-pop background to these tracks, it all comes off as half-hearted. Now, there's nothing wrong with sleepytime music, but only if it has the requisite sense of closeness to the work, which Ed ain't got. There's no one aspect of Here Be Monsters that's faulty in and of itself-- the sparse instrumentation, plodding rhythms, and arms-length vocals combine almost equally to sabotage this solo flight. For most of its 51 minutes, Here Be Monsters lumbers along at the same mind-numbing pace, and Harcourt is content to offer up the same basic formula again and again. There are slight variations in his staccato piano, or where (but not how) the strings come in, leading to a few first-among-equals tracks as ""Like Only Lovers Can"" and ""Hanging with the Wrong Crowd."" There's also a lone standout, for what it's worth-- on ""Shanghai,"" Ed conjures up enough energy to finally let 'er rip on the vocals, and the melody is actually up-tempo. It's the closest this record comes to anything even remotely approximating rock. It's by no means a masterpiece, but in light of the other tracks, it differentiates itself by simply, mercifully, breaking the pace and actually being enjoyable. If only there were a few more like it, or more beneath the surface. Folk-pop a la Ed Harcourt doesn't necessarily need to be intelligent, or very complicated. Pop legends like the Beach Boys and singer/songwriter greats like Elliott Smith probably won't be the focus of a Psych term paper anytime soon, but they've written songs of enduring value-- the fourth-year curriculum Ed never received. On Here Be Monsters, Harcourt masks the underlying transience of his work with hollow instrumentation, but it's hard to miss that there's nothing at the root.","To all those searching for their next fix of minimal, watered-down singer/songwriter sensitivity, look no further.

Reagent Specs,Ink,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b96a5e6ef95969322963/1:1/w_160/96985c4d.jpg,2002-05-30 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4099-reagent-specs/,Monitor,"Baltimore can drive men to extremes. I'm not just talking to your run-of-the-mill 'brink,' either. The Charm City is retarded in so many powerful ways that it pushes men towards the bizarre and inconceivable. Take my beloved brother, Dr. Steve Haywood, for example. Prior to moving to Baltimore, he was devoted to three average, respectable pursuits: jogging, auto restoration and dentistry. Then came his Baltimorphosis: upon moving to the city, Dr. Steve immediately felt compelled to drop all else in an effort to master swing dancing, shaming my dear parents, and leading us all to ask what went wrong. Don't blame yourself, Mom; it was just Baltimore. One glance at Ink's sophomore LP, Reagent Specs, suggests that they, too, have been afflicted by Baltimore's insidious 'charm.' The liner notes proudly attest that Reagent Specs was ""written and recorded simultaneously at ACR, Baltimore, MD."" In other words, they just booked ACR and waited for something cool to happen. Sounds crazy, eh? Like something you'd like advance warning about just so you could avoid it? Right, well, maybe it sounds that way on paper, but the results are fantastic. Whatever the point of the disclaimer, it's rather striking because, fact is, the album sounds calculated, like something that comes with its own theory. Instead of reflecting a 'found sound' aesthetic, Reagent Specs sounds practiced, polished and richly creative. The restrained post-rock of Slint is an instant and undeniable reference point, as Ink similarly brood on shady bass and drum rhythms. Guitarist Craig Bowen (ex-Science Kit) works his hardest to draw new and interesting noises from his axe, including harmonics, feedback, and string-scratches. The guitar work, combined with some unique percussion (congas, junkyard implements), adds a jittery unease that prevails throughout the disc. Then there's the dispassionate delivery of vocalist Peter Quinn (formerly of the Baltimore-based hardcore band Candy Machine), which carves out meditative, quasi-melodic lines that, united with his mantra-esque lyrics, add a final measure of abstraction to the mix. The ensemble achieves its best results on two early tracks: ""Stereo Eyes"" captures the spirit of anxiety with a steady, funkless monotone bassline undergirding random guitar embellishments and lyrics about lucid dreaming. ""Industrial Schemes"" follows a different tack, dominated by the rhythmic elements: a restful, placid bass groove and a lazy, pulsing drumbeat which Quinn punctuates with rhythmic, stream-of-consciousness vocals. For an album recorded under the oddest of conditions in one of the bleakest, least attractive cities in North America (and the former murder capitol of the world), Reagent Specs certainly is a fortuitous result, surprisingly palatable and accessible. And unlike its place of production, it doesn't grind or annoy, let alone stink, rot or die.","Baltimore can drive men to extremes. I'm not just talking to your run-of-the-mill 'brink,' either.

Title TK,The Breeders,by: Will Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a38cb1335d7bf169875e/1:1/w_160/dccac85a.jpg,2002-05-30 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/923-title-tk/,4ADElektra,"Excuses, excuses. Kim Deal's got a million of 'em. How else could she manage to put off releasing her first original music in six years, not to mention following up on Last Splash, the radio and retail-friendly juggernaut from nine years ago? ""I haven't found the right drum sound,"" she'd say to engineer after engineer. ""I'm going to take some time off and learn how to play the drums myself"" (she's been working that one since 1995, when Tammy and the Amps-- Deal's basement solo project-- eventually became The Amps, with ex-Breeders drummer Jim Macpherson). ""I can't do this without Kelley,"" she'd tell interviewers, despite having toured as the Breeders in 1997 with a Kelley-less lineup that included Macpherson, the Amps' Nate Farley, and violinist/vocalist Carrie Bradley. As engineers, studios and musicians were discarded as casually as cigarettes, and potential release dates came and went, the vultures-- and VH-1's Behind the Music-- started circling. Legend even has it that Kim Deal, having spent the Breeders' royalties and advance money long ago, has been living on fees generated by the Prodigy's ""Firestarter,"" a song that, fortunately for Deal, sampled Last Splash's ""S.O.S."" After years of being just around the corner like that Hopi Indian freak in Mulholland Drive, at last Title TK is upon us. And it's not bad. Far from being the chilly product of Deal's reputed perfectionism and production overkill, Title TK is a loose, spontaneous, even messy affair, and a blast to listen to once Deal's pop curiousities begin to take shape in the listener's imagination. Steve Albini should get a stipend from Nike for finally corralling Deal in his Chicago studio, convincing her to can the excuses and just do it. ""Round up, holler girl,"" are the first words from Kim Deal's mouth in six years, on opener ""Little Fury,"" a rough-edged call-and-response with divebombing guitars, driving bass, and sister Kelley's dissonant harmonies. ""Hold what you've got,"" Deal rasps on the chorus as hired guns Richard Presley and Mondo Lopez (of Los Angeles punk band Fear) and drummer Jose Medeles pound out a labored groove. Forget Last Splash and The Amps-- Title TK picks up where Pod left off in 1989, with a jagged sound nowhere near as tight as the Pixies' but a heartfelt enthusiasm for creating music. ""Yeah, I'm leaking pure white noise,"" Deal sings on ""London Song."" It's not the most accurate statement, as this ain't exactly Merzbow, but it's an accurate reflection of what the Breeders are shooting for with Title TK: something uncomplicated, as pure and unaffected as static. While the Thom Yorke school of songwriters, bored with conventional pop structures, slice their music apart and reconstruct it digitally like a Burroughs novel, Deal's latest compositions are disjointed by design-- trying on and chucking lyrical ideas and musical motifs with abandon, almost elevating ADD to a kind of art form. ""Dumb as a fuckin'... and missing from the party,"" Deal sings in ""Little Fury."" Dumb as a fuckin' what? Attempting to decode Title TK's musical Mad Libs can be maddening-- it's easier to let Deal slur her words and catch the occasional fragments of brilliance that only weed-fueled midnight recording sessions and happy accidents can produce. Title TK also finds Deal dabbling with new sounds, with hit-and-miss results. ""The She"" is built around a Stereolab-ish keyboard vamp, and while you shouldn't expect grooves as tight as Le Tigre's, the Breeders' rough-and-tumble brand of funk is convincingly nasty. But the silly slap-back percussion of ""Sinister Foxx"" and Record Engineering 101 channel-swapping guitars on ""Huffer"" aren't exactly cutting edge. Still, when the Breeders set out to rock-- and the chugging guitars and stomping drums of standout ""Son of Three"" will bring a knowing smile to Pixies afficianados-- they get the job done. Title TK also contains two unexpectedly beautiful songs-- the disarmingly spare ""Off You,"" with its lonesome guitar and gorgeous bass solo, is some of the creepiest headphone listening since The Wall. ""I've never seen a starlet, or a riot, or the violence of you,"" Deal sings in a weary, muted voice. ""I am the autumn in the scarlet, I am the makeup on your eyes."" ""Forced to Drive,"" a woozy travelogue bouyed by shimmering arpeggios and effects-pedal-to-the-metal choruses, merges Last Splash's summery hangover with the Velvets' ""Ride into the Sun."" ""Title TK"" is journalistic shorthand for ""title to come,"" and Title TK does feel incomplete in many ways-- from the hand-scribbled song titles on the back sleeve to the sometimes tuneless (and always somewhat haphazard) delivery of the vocals. Keyboards buzz from out of nowhere, guitars hit bum notes intentionally, basslines amble up and down the scale, sometimes two at a time. When Title TK loses people-- and I suspect it'll lose many-- it'll be with the langorous, abstract half-songs like ""Put on a Side"" (a listless anti-song built around a fretless bass groove, spare guitar and a single piano note) or ""Sinister Foxx"" (largely a meditation on the repeated phrase ""Has anyone seen the iguana?""). And for an album so highly anticipated for so long, Title TK feels awfully skimpy, at just over 38 minutes, and pretty shamelessly padded. Did we really need the two false endings and an extended jam that stretches ""London"" past the three-minute mark? Or the rockabilly remake of The Amps' ""Full on Idle,"" which barely deviates from the original? Isn't the two-minute ""T and T"" essentially just an extended instrumental intro to the short, sharp ""Huffer""? Deal has been flogging many of these songs since that 1997 Breeders outing, including ""Forced to Drive"" (released on a fanclub single way back when), ""Too Alive,"" and ""Huffer."" And what about Kelley's ""Fire the Maid,"" a live favorite discarded from Title TK at the eleventh hour? Still, it's a hell of a lot of fun to hear these fortysomething twins still singing about whippets and the quality of Jersey weed, and when the Breeders are on, they're still on. Just don't come to Title TK expecting the note-perfect pop confections of ""Cannonball"" or ""Divine Hammer,"" because it's not that kind of record. And let's hope nobody samples Title TK on their big hit single, or it might be another ten years before the next one.","Excuses, excuses. Kim Deal's got a million of 'em.

Uninvisible,"Medeski, Martin and Wood",by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c413ea9e61561daa8080/1:1/w_160/450cb443.jpg,2002-05-30 05:00:01,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5201-uninvisible/,Blue Note,"As cliched and erroneous and controversy-mongering as it may be, I'm just gonna come right out and say it: jazz is dead. That sound you hear is a thousand jazz afficiados snorting in disgust as they roll their eyes and take another puff on their morning cigar-- but their opinion is biased and irrelevant anyway. To the rest of the world in the 21st century, jazz exists only as deluxe-packaged re-re-re-reissues, PBS documentaries, and hip-hop sample material. Sure, its influence has sunk into the genetic material of everyone from Tortoise to Tribe, but pure, un-hyphenated Jazz has grown into nothing more than a stagnant pond surrounded by a scene that makes indie rock look downright populist. Yet there's still a few post-mortem muscle spasms running through the old corpse, most notably the Brooklyn keyboard/bass/drum trio Medeski, Martin, and Wood. Chastised by the jazz community for associating with those godawful hippie jam bands (a genre most jazzbos hold about one notch above Manheim Steamroller and Zamfir), MMW have nonetheless done more than just about any other act in recent years to continue pushing the genre into new fields. Taking the relaxed-rules approach to improvisation practiced by the better of the jammy folk, and adding a healthy, non-patronizing dollop of hip-hop to their Tipitina's funk, they've expanded jazz's vocabulary while still appealing to a crowd beyond subscribers to The Wire and regulars down by the Electric Factory. While MMW albums have the tendency to function merely as sketchpads for future embellishment on the concert stage, recent collaborations with producer/engineer Scotty Hard have proved remarkably successful as bona fide Albums. Hard, who's worked with the likes of Wu-Tang Clan and Kool Keith, lent the Caucasian trio enough street cred confidence to experiment with DJs and a raunchy collection of keys on the creepy Combustication, and to teeter on the brink of the noise-o-sphere on The Dropper. Violating traditional jazz recording laws, MMW used overdubbing (gasp!) and post-production editing (well I never!) to make an increasingly spacey roar that rarely came unglued from their characteristically tight, deep groove. Sadly, Uninvisible, the third time around the block with Hard, ain't quite got the charm. Not that it's a bad album, or a step back for the band-- if anything, it's a step sideways, as much of the territory explored sounds like doubling back rather than journeying onwards. ""Your Name Is Snake Anthony,"" with jam band patriarch Col. Bruce Hampton doing the spoken-word thing over the band's abstract wallpaper, is Combustication's ""Whatever Happened to Gus"" with lamer poetry. ""Pappy Check"" and ""The Edge of Night,"" both turntable jams with DJ Olive, recall better work with DJ Logic who more easily found the rare chinks in MMW's sound that call for vinyl theatrics. Medeski, meanwhile, seems to have finally run out of keyboards to pound on, having added mellotron, toy piano, and the ever-popular ""sequential circuits."" The large stable of special guests brought into liven things up also succumb to a bit of a stylistic rut-- even when the tactic occasionally works, it's merely functional. A full horn section appears with the band for the first time since their more traditional jazz-funk days, but the brass on the title track and ""Nocturnal Transmissions"" is so filtered, faded, and generally fucked about that it resembles the astro-Mingus of Radiohead's ""The National Anthem."" Eddie Bobe utilizes a veritable arsenal of percussive oddities against Medeski's mini-Moog squiggling on ""Retirement Song,"" a song that tense and itchy as an allergy attack. Nonetheless, many tracks come off as retreads or ideas freeze-dried for consumption at the trio's famous exhaustingly intense live shows. I can just imagine the chicken-shack organ throwdown ""Smoke""-- a lean 2:48 on record-- being stretched out to the length of a sitcom while smelly kids in the latest hempwear draw curly, imaginary amoebas in the air with splayed fingers. (God, I miss my innocent jam band days.) So while Uninvisible doesn't succeed as a compelling prize copy of the Medeski, Martin and Wood home game, it's still an interesting listen that proves their relevancy in the Real World, rather than the Jazz World. Do you think any other new jazz releases this year will coincidentally use the same ping-pong ball sampling effect as the new Anti-Pop Consortium? Fat chance, Wynton.","As cliched and erroneous and controversy-mongering as it may be, I'm just gonna come right out and say it ...

You Think You Really Know Me,Gary Wilson,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa4313d19756521399e6/1:1/w_160/6609ebae.jpg,2002-05-30 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8694-you-think-you-really-know-me/,self-releasedself-released,"Gary Wilson was born in October 1953, in southern New York state. He was something of a musical child prodigy, having learned to play bass, guitar, piano, cello and drums by the time he entered grade school. Early on, he exhibited a desire to perform (inspired by his heroes Dion and the Belmonts, and having seen the Beatles perform at Shea Stadium), and at 12 years old was playing keyboards in a local garage band. The band actually cut a single when Gary was in the eighth grade, and was successful enough to open for the bubblegum act 1910 Fruitgum Company. After the band's vocalist left, Wilson took over, composing original material and leading the band through various formations over several years. However, Wilson quickly proved to be a bit eccentric for the band, and his music was becoming increasingly experimental. At 16, he picked up on the music of John Cage, and went so far as to send Cage manuscripts of his music. To Wilson's surprise, Cage actually invited him to his home where they would discuss and critique the music for a couple of days. Perhaps as a result, Wilson's band ventured into even stranger realms, and their gigs began to consist of three or four songs, followed by fights between band members and audience, who were throwing anything within reach at the stage. Wilson graduated from high school in 1970, and moved to New York City with his friend Vince Rossi (who plays trombone on one song on this record). New York proved to be a tad rough for the boys, who were back in their hometown within weeks, living with their parents again. Wilson set up a studio in his parents' basement, spending countless nights working with magnetic recording tape and making the music that would become his only album. This album, You Think You Really Know Me, was completed in 1977, and is a testament to Wilson's virtual one-man dogged determination and talent. He pressed the record with his own money, and promoted it by mailing it to radio stations and music writers throughout the U.S. He sent along self-made press packages, including some pretty fucked-up photos (the one with Wilson covered in tape, staring at the camera in his underwear stands out). He even got some radio play, and in 1978 moved to California in hopes of landing a record deal. Of course, he never found one, though he did make a last-ditch tour cross-country, ending in 1981 with a gig at CBGB's, and some very rare seven-inch EPs. Since then, he's settled in California and retired from music. One of his friends sent this album to Motel Records, and this reissue is the result. So, now you know the story; be prepared for the unique cocktail-angst stylings that are Wilson's tunes. The thing is, the music-- largely an odd combination of late 70s soft rock, proto-synth pop and experimental tape effects-- wouldn't seem half as strange if not for Wilson's raw, thoroughly unpolished vocals. Most of the time, he's out of tune, otherwise his voice is cracking, struggling to contain his enthusiasm when he blurts out stuff like, ""Oh, Jesus, she's so real!"" or emitting one of his trademark (well, copied from James Brown) ""hey's"" or ""hoo's"". Wilson, to his credit, is a great keyboardist and bassist, and pairs himself with an equally great drummer (Gary Iacovelli). Furthermore, his production is clear and dynamic, suggesting that if he hadn't retired, he probably could have made a very fine producer or engineer. Nevertheless, most people are going to focus on his voice, which is nothing if not unique. The opener, ""Another Time I Could Have Loved You,"" gets things started on a very tense note, as Wilson's searing guitar mangles whatever shimmering backdrop his Fender Rhodes provides. It lasts for just over a minute, and immediately leads into the very peppy ""You Keep On Looking."" This tune is at once totally legitimate synth-pop, like a larval Erasure, and completely ridiculous. Wilson's aggressive vocals spit out declarations of loneliness (""Hey! Foolish hearts, you're keeping me away, hey!""), sympathy (""I don't care that they call you a whore, it don't matter! Hey!"") to mistrust (""Your mind is full of imbalanced things, hey!""). He often goes into rap-speak instead of carrying a tune. Luckily, his Kraftwerk-meets-Mr. Rogers keyboard arrangements keep the edge off. ""6.4 = Make Out"" sees Wilson getting his groove on, Barry White style. If Barry White was a creepy pervert, that is, or a horny teenager. The low-down porno soundtrack groove perfectly frames Wilson's straight-faced horn-dog prose (""How old you say you were?"" -- ""Sixteen!"") and obsessive pining (""She's a real, she's a real groovy girl, and she's got red lips. Can't you hear me god? She's a real groovy girl, and she's got red lips! Man, she's so real! She's so real!!""). At one point, one of his recurring obsessions comes to the fore, when he admits to his current object of desire that his 'real crush' is on ""Karen."" Karen pops up a couple of times on the record, as do Cathy and Cindy. Going to the dance on Friday night is a common topic, as is avoiding a ""sick trip."" It's pretty intense. One of the truly creepy moments on the record comes with ""Loneliness,"" featuring Wilson's languished whisper (""Sometimes... I wish... I were... dead"") over what sounds like a cow getting slaughtered and dissonant keyboard clusters. At the end, someone starts pouring out a bucket of water, and abusing a keyboard while a radio plays in the background. Was I meant to hear this? All is made well with ""Cindy,"" because apparently, she's the kind of girl who will let you walk her home ""late at night, about 12."" She'll say, ""It's a real cool scene,"" and best of all, she'll tell you, ""It will be real cool with her,"" if you want to kiss her lips. She'll even let you take her out as long as you pick her up ""by 9:20."" Cindy also gets the porno soundtrack treatment. You know, I've listened to my share of Brian Wilson bootlegs where he's singing about teaching little girls to put on makeup, but this is just weird. ""You Were Too Good to Be True"" is a fast and funky instrumental that would sound at home on ""The Price is Right"" when they're bringing out new prizes to bid on. ""Groovy Girls Make Love at the Beach"" moves along at a nice pace, like a cross between lounge acts playing Bee Gees in Las Vegas and more ""Price is Right"" grooviness. But then, Wilson decides to let the dwarves have some by injecting some helium-like vocals into the bridge. ""She's out of reach, every single Friday night-- I'm not kidding now!"" Righteous. Perhaps the most poignant music on the record happens during ""Chromium Bitch."" Sure, Wilson is about twenty years too early to turn fantasy-misogyny into a pop song (""I want to make you my Chromium Bitch. My bitch, hey!""), but this kind of unadulterated teen bravado is You Think You Really Know Me's calling card. That Wilson was in his twenties when he made this record shouldn't sway your judgment too much. There have been a few hipsters to latch onto this record (most notably, Beck, who name checks him in ""Where It's At""), though I wonder how many are taking it as a joke. It seems to me Wilson was dead serious with this stuff, and though that results in some pretty awkward moments, you could hardly call it a joke. Of course, I laughed a few times when I first heard this, but the lasting effect is actually fairly dark. If you can stand some indulgence on Wilson's part, and are willing to part with your irony filter for about an hour, you might be surprised at how this affects you. Or you could put it on to freak with your roommate. It's all good.","Gary Wilson was born in October 1953, in southern New York state. He was something of a musical child prodigy ...

Blazing Arrow,Blackalicious,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2fcea9e61561daa4b9a/1:1/w_160/4b5dd641.jpg,2002-05-29 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/787-blazing-arrow/,MCA,"This is one of those classic summer albums that crams in so much sound and so much life that listening to it is like going to a block party, all-day concert and a family reunion all at the same time. Blazing Arrow is the major-label debut of underground hip-hop act Blackalicious, and if it sounds like they had more money to work with than ever before, at least they spent it well. The layered production, the mess of styles, and the three-ring circus of guest stars turn this into a breakthrough record. But what makes it a masterpiece is that Gift of Gab and Chief Xcel can hold it together with the directness of their vision of strength and hope: this is unstoppably joyous, a complicated album that feels as natural as sunshine on your forehead. Like their full-length debut, Nia, Blackalicious use the full 74 minutes of the compact disc, and every minute has something good. But this album is also a massive advance on the last one, pushing the limber rhymes and tight beats with more musical innovation. Start with the short funk intro ""Bow and Arrow,"" which segues into ""Blazing Arrow,"" featuring a bouncing bassline knocking into a horn section and a hazy, dreamy Harry Nilsson sample on the chorus. Xcel and Gab canvas thirty years of funk, soul, hip-hop and modern R&B;, skipping from one to the other every song. There are the nostalgic lyrics and smooth sound on ""Make You Feel That Way,"" with its haunting trumpet line; but a couple tracks away is ""Chemical Calisthenics,"" a breakneck lyrical workout for Gab backed by scattershot beats from Cut Chemist. Blazing Arrow gets better with every listen as you dig into the different styles and rhythms-- from the slow glide of ""Brain Washers"" to the strong beats on ""4000 Miles"" and ""Paragraph President""-- not to mention the details, like Gab punching in that ""Fade away!"" on the title track, or the breaking beaker on ""Chemical Calisthenics."" As for the guestlist: it's impressive, not just because of the big names that lent a hand, and not just because they sound good, but because some of them have never sounded better. There are plenty of guest rappers-- Lateef the Truth Speaker, Chali 2NA, and Lyrics Born, to name a few-- but the other vocalists are surprising. Will Rage Against the Machine's Zack de la Rocha ever have another chance to shout on a record this mature? And Gil Scott-Heron's basso profundo firms up ""First in Flight""-- he didn't even sound that good back when he sounded that good. Fellow SoleSides alumnus DJ Shadow slips in a between-tracks interlude, and Saul Williams gets a showcase for his gnarled, elaborate verses in ""Release."" And ?uestlove of the Roots co-wrote and plays drums on one of the album's standouts, the missed-opportunities rumination of ""Nowhere Fast."" Blazing Arrow has moments of slick R&B;, not least because of the MCA-roster female vocalists who help slow things down: Jaguar Wright's randy, sassy guest spot on ""Aural Pleasure,"" Keke Wyatt on ""It's Going Down,"" or Tracey Moore's smooth-as-silk chorus on ""Nowhere Fast."" Xcel fills out the sound with live instruments, including horns on several songs. Dig the funky keyboards and cello low in the mix on ""Nowhere Fast"" as Gab runs through a list of what he'll accomplish ""tomorrow,"" while the music sends him drifting away. Gab has plenty of fast rhymes, but is more impressive for the clarity of his message. There's a humility to his frontman stance that makes this album about everything but himself. He and Xcel have the stage, and all they want to do is share it. It's as if the scope of this album-- the stylistic diversity, the guest artists, the sincere, ecstatic rhymes-- doesn't come from ambition or creativity for its own sake, but out of a need to include everyone they know and everything they see around them. Not since Car Wash has there been such a celebration of diversity and hot fun in the summertime. And unlike that otherwise classic film, Blazing Arrow doesn't have the Pointer Sisters to drag it down.","This is one of those classic summer albums that crams in so much sound and so much life that listening ...

Infinite Love Songs,Maximilian Hecker,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c09613d197565213ba7a/1:1/w_160/81738090.jpg,2002-05-29 05:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3795-infinite-love-songs/,Kitty-Yo,"Maximilian Hecker is an underachiever cloaked as an overachiever. The career of this 23-year-old Berliner started by standing in the dim corners of some of his hometown's most scenster-y clubs. From those corners, he moved on to the stage to perform Oasis covers. Apparently, people found this endearing and, as well as finding time to insert some original material in amongst the covers, he became a male model. To the Viva modeling agency, Hecker is the very essence of the 'poor sweet shy-boy thing,' and it's evident in his music. Infinite Love Songs, his debut album, is crammed to the gills with songs that Hecker would love to die to. This is Hecker's expressed intention: to create songs of such beauty that the listener will be vaporized into non-existence. Perhaps it says something about my tenacity rather than the relative strength of Hecker's skills, but I'm still alive and shuffling after many listens to his record. My survival is not entirely indicative of Hecker's failure to promote self-extinction in me. In fact, opener ""Polyester"" did make me consider throwing myself in front of an oncoming Good Humor van. The only reason I haven't topped myself is because I can't think of a graceful enough way to send myself off into oblivion having absorbed the extreme swooping beauty of ""Polyester"" for one last time. As Hecker recorded Infinite Love Songs at home, it's not surprising that his performances are intimate and comfortable. His acoustic guitar lines have become as familiar to me as the pattern of my bedroom wallpaper, and the way his falsetto reaches for sublimity as comfortable as my duvet. The Beatles-derived piano ballad ""The Days Are Long and Filled with Pain"" sends me to my teenage years, wrestling with inner conflicts and acne. Yet the winsomely crooned ""Green Night"" falters because Hecker borrowed EMF's drum machine. The resulting rhythm is as predictable as a stopped clock, and forces the listener to consider all the more deeply the banal ache of his lyrics. ""Polyester,"" by contrast, redeems itself when Hecker repeatedly mumbles in malevolence, ""I'm using gloves."" But that slightly imaginative sophistication falls apart during the boiled-until-flavorless ""Today,"" a sappy plea for maternal love on the day that Hecker plans to kill himself. ""Cold Wind Blowing"" is a return to innocence-- gently plucked guitar chords form a soft bed for Hecker to sing about his mental state in meteorological metaphors and observes that ""there's no place to hide."" The title track is a feistier affair (and Hecker's most pronounced incorporation of the electronic sounds for which the Kitty-Yo label is best known). Even so, Hecker never reaches the eerie amalgam of classic pop and synthesized sound that James Combs did on Please Come Down. Combs' album takes pop hooks and falsetto ache to a new imaginative level, whereas Hecker isn't willing to commit to more than commonplace longing. What I find frustrating about Infinite Love Songs is that I see great potential here-- Hecker has the chops to challenge his older, less foppish rivals-- but only after he's progressed beyond narcissistic tenth-grade poetry. To achieve that, he's got to experience more and renounce being a model agency's dreamy lost boy, self-consciously conspicuous in his corner, practicing his Gallagher moves. And my remaining alive after spinning this album so many times should give Hecker every reason not to fail me next time.","Maximilian Hecker is an underachiever cloaked as an overachiever.

It Isn't The Fall EP,Lesser Birds of Paradise,by: David M.

As I write this, porches in my neighborhood are enjoying maximum occupancy as folks sip tea, guzzle beer, stare into space, smoke cigarettes, smoke joints, sing softly to themselves, wave to strangers on the street-- you know, that usual peaceful springtime stuff. But even though all seems calm and relaxed, there's a sense of discomfort lurking just beneath the idyllic veneer, as every Chicagoan knows that they might wake up tomorrow to rainstorms and frigid wind. This ability at masking uneasiness with a stoic, well-practiced relaxed calm comes through on It Isn't the Fall, the second release by the Chicago-based Lesser Birds of Paradise. The Lesser Birds are yet another band cranking out alt-country flavored Indie Brand pop music. Like so many other bands like them, I can't bring myself to hate the Lesser Birds; after all, they deliver their clever-enough vocals with a likable, gentle voice that's accompanied by pretty-enough backing oohs and ahhs and clean instrumentation. Still, despite the addition of theremins, saws, keyboards, vibes and upright bass (the last two provided by former Coctails Mark Greenberg and Barry Phipps, respectively), the Lesser Birds don't exactly stand out. There's no denying that they sound, well... nice. But that's precisely the problem. There's no uncertainty or worry in the music to match that in the lyrics. ""She's Got a Set of Wings,"" for example, really wants to be a sad song about an indecisive girl-- the kind that inevitably conjures up a mental image of some unfortunate girl you know yourself. Mark Janka sings lines like, ""She used to know the names of all the pigeons in Times Square/ Now she's got her own wings/ But they don't take her anywhere,"" with a standard sensitive-musician-guy voice and there's lots of pretend mellotron to make it sound real moody and stuff. But Janka and his bandmates lack the conviction necessary to pull it off, and Phipps' engineering, while competent, lacks the subtlety it takes to make such sentiments resonate. This music sounds too practiced to be sincere, and often, Janka's Kindercore-by-way-of-Tweedy vocals sound too walked-through to really matter. ""Into Pieces"" may be the most indecisive song here-- but the confusion's got nothing to do with unrequited love, a lost hometown or a lack of whatever. Rather, Janka seems uncertain if he's trying to be creepy (""If I could cut you into pieces,"" starts one verse; ""If I could stir the blood in your veins,"" starts the next), goofy (""And we'd make love like all the R&B; singers do/ And we would do it just like R&B; singers do""), or wistfully Wilco-esque (""A telescope is my only hope of getting closer to you""). It seems likely the band could pull off any of the above with reasonable competency, but instead the three get confused and the song wanders without much direction. Were It Isn't the Fall much longer, I might've succeeded in mustering up the bile and anger that are necessary ingredients for the Trademark Pitchfork Diss. But at twenty-some minutes, the Lesser Birds of Paradise fail to grate any more than they inspire. They don't really strike me as bad or untalented-- they just don't strike me at all. It Isn't the Fall is the sort of thing that comes and goes every day without getting paid much attention. It might even be likeable, given a temperate day and a benevolent temperament. But much like a sunny day in the middle of a frigid Chicago May, I know that any such enjoyment will be fleeting. The Lesser Birds may be a quick hint of warmth, but they're hardly the full-on blazing summer I'm anxiously awaiting.","The weather in Chicago is notoriously erratic this time of year.

Secondhand Sounds,Matthew Herbert,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0bb5e6ef959693235cf/1:1/w_160/87884861.jpg,2002-05-29 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3832-secondhand-sounds/,Peacefrog,"How great is it to get into an artist at the exact moment when he's at the top of his game? Mathew Herbert is pretty much unstoppable right now, a one-man juggernaut assaulting the world of electronic music on several fronts: high-profile experimental pop under his own name, underground releases as Doctor Rockit, Radioboy and Wishmountin (some of which are available free) and collaborations too numerous to mention-- all packaged with biting anti-globalism dogma which you can pay attention to or ignore without affecting your appreciation of the music in the slightest. His beat programming is always on time, he's writing vocal melodies to rival prime Stereolab, and he's a sampling theorist on par with Matmos or DJ Shadow. This guy is firing on all cylinders. As one would expect of a busybody electronic producer such as Herbert, he does a lot of remixing, and the two-disc Secondhand Sounds collects 21 of his post-production tweaks created over the past six years. It's definitely one of the best remix albums ever, but given how many shitty ones are clogging the used bins, that statement doesn't tell you much about the record's quality. What I like so much about Secondhand Sounds is Herbert's imperialistic way with the source material. As he makes clear in his manifesto, only sounds from the original work are included, but he completely twists them to his own ends, giving his remixes the most distinctive sonic signature this side of Markus Popp. The result is a collection that feels cohesive and works as an album. The source material may not be his, but the thing is pure Herbert from the first vocal sample forward. Part of what makes Herbert's production so distinctive is his quirky sense of rhythm. House beats are his stock in trade, but each track is given a slight variation of Herbert's trademark shuffle, where ever-so-slightly awkward accents are placed around the standard bass drum/high-hat pattern. It helps, too, that he's such a firm believer in sound transformation; the familiar cymbal hisses have a timbre that's just a bit off, and the drumbeats have a glitchy twist that always sounds fresh. The structure of the song can remain intact, or not, depending on the effect that Herbert is going for. But there's no doubt when listening to each track that it's the product of meticulous design. Many of the original tracks are obscure, at least to me, but with the presence of Herbert always foregrounded, that's neither here nor there. Nils Peter Moivaer's ""Merciful"" is a feast of melancholia; the opening chords and vocals are at first pinched, as if sourced from an old 78, and then piano chords and a spare beat leave plenty of room for the chanteuse-style lead to blossom. The ethereal Two Banks of Four track ""Street Lullaby"" is another piano ballad, livened up with blocky percussion and underpinnings of distortion. Terra Deva's ""Fresh Start"" takes longer to develop, with lonely organ and vocals dominating the first minute and half, until a bubbly bassline and jerky beats bring it to life. Herbert's funky and propulsive remix of Serge Gainsbourg's ""Bonnie and Clyde"" shows how brilliantly he makes good source material seem even cooler, transforming others' work merely by accent into brand new songs. Six of the tracks are remixes of Herbert's own material, including the Bodily Functions tracks ""Suddenly,"" which is given an aggressively rhythmic slice-and-dice dub treatment, and ""The Last Beat,"" which removes most of the vocals and inserts sharp percussion figures. It's a testament to Herbert's approach that these two sound like they could be original tracks in their own right. And that's pretty much the story all down the line. Take a guy with serious skill who actually gives a shit about remixing and you get Secondhand Sounds, one of the finest records of its kind.","How great is it to get into an artist at the exact moment when he's at the top of ...

All Tomorrow's Parties v2.0,Various Artists,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a75dea9e61561daa557c/1:1/w_160/0ae13d42.gif,2002-05-28 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1842-all-tomorrows-parties-v20/,ATP,"The dominatrix on the southwest side of town was already getting kind of haggard, but now she's made matters worse by turning Presbyterian. The only reason I still go see her is to try to purge my lingering shame over needing to buy every compilation with more than thirty seconds of Will Oldham on it. So, hooray, now I've got something called All Tomorrow's Parties 2.0 to put beside the Dutch Harbor soundtrack, the Quelque Chose D'Organique soundtrack, that Tweaker thing, that last All Tomorrow's Parties (or which Oldham helped Papa M cover Cat Stevens), that Briana Corrigan thing, Louisville Sonic Imprint Volume 1, Boxhead Ensemble's The Last Place to Go, that John Denver tribute, the Johnny Cash duet, the Anomoanon duets, Hey Drag City, The Drag City Hour, At Home with the Groovebox, Succour, Sounds of the Geographically Challenged, Sourmash, Macro Dub Infection Volume 2, Love Is My Only Crime, Louisville Sluggers Vol. 3, and that nervous circle-jerk with Appendix Out and Songs: Ohia on the My Morning Jacket split! Please, born-again Mistress Filthcobra, stand on the backs of my knees, spit on me and call me your diapersnake, ther please carve the word 'pathetic' into the meat of my lower back. This indie rock completist thing requires too much legwork. I may as well be buying lottery tickets. If you checked your hair in the mirror five times today, then you probably already know what All Tomorrow's Parties is: it's the series of well-intentioned live music marathons devised by fey-wafers Belle and Sebastian to circumvent the sponsor-pimping horrors and generally stank vibes of their predecessors. ATP is what the rich kids were planning for on that listserv you haunt. Poor people can, however, save up and purchase this accompanying CD. Unfortunately, wher you press play, your speakers won't emit communal principles, so you'll have to settle for toe-tapping rarities by key participants. This disc is from the third festival, called v2.0 and set in the UK, which is not a big deal like the U.S. edition (that's ATP 1.1 for those keeping putt-putt scorecards) since the UK has awesome concerts all the time (sniff, pout). The UK, see, is a magical place where Thom Yorke sells you your morning paper, where pedestrians are equidistant like the cover of Abbey Road, and the streets are paved with PJ Harvey's discarded lingerie. The ATP discs have been packaged all sleek and antiseptic, like software, and each has had a curator from indie rock's more pretentious upper-tier (the first two were curated by Tortoise and Sonic Youth, this one's by Shellac). Lordy, if the punks are curating, then a human-beatbox fugue can't be far behind. Okay, so the Will Oldham song is a great one that reteams him with a couple Anomoanon guys to pull off a giddy pirate-jig cover of one of the Kate Wolf tunes he did on his faultline-coast tour with those eco-strummers in Rainywood. When not dreamily mid-ooohh, he sounds like the bridge troll in rehab, trying to explain the appeal of the gruff goats. If Oldham's song is the jauntiest, then Nina Nastasia's is the most conventional. But that doesn't mean it's not plenty pretty, blending elements of the best dark-folk chanteuses past, present, and probably future. The Fall's ""Two Librans"" is a standout, as they continue to sound like the Richard Pryor-designed computer from Superman III is forcing them to compose mutated dance-rock against their will. Some Chicago sugardaddy had better break ground on an Indie Hall of Fame, and quick, before these guys become Tolstoys that everybody namedrops but nobody experiences. Shellac's ""Watch Song"" is a slab of explosive-drum, post-human, death-wiener blues, but it gets upstaged by a mighty, mighty 8\xBD minute offering from Shipping News that's more confident and epic than their recent records. That Arcwelder's ""Do Something Right"" sounds quaint and retro is testament to this comp's fundamental progressiveness. The imposing hit from High Dependency Unit and a bouncy ""Trem Two"" from Mission of Burma will have to share the Daytime Emmy for Best Effects Pedals-- in fact, the drums, chanting, and bassline laid down by them Missionaries will take you back to when it all got called 'college rock.' Had something to do with wanting to go to college, I reckon. What showcase of contemporary hip sounds would be complete without some of those amazing, but bloated, hard-to-describe instrumental bands? The strings of Threnody Ensemble's seven-minute ""Groups"" are seductive, lilting along chipperly only to get tense and foreboding on a dime. The Godspeeders in Do Make Say Think live up to their sound, if not to all those idealist present-tense verbs. Though it's not without its gorgeousness, even the non-rare album track ""Classic Noodlanding"" seems to be admitting that it's par. The band should move forward or team up with one of those old-school rap groups like EPMD, who were proud to promise from album to album that ain't a damn thing changed. Rachel's contributior has a title so amateur-poetic I won't type it, but the song is an affecting piano-and-drum-driven buildup from 1998. Nobody here tosses off a dried turd-- much of this disc is as beautiful or as beautifully ugly as the current scene gets, although one occasionally feels a chill from spending so much time in Krautrock's long apoplectic shadow. The power-pomp of ATP v2.0 is worth the investment, even if you just use it to soundtrack a cigarette-and-antiperspirant run. Besides, you have a free spot on your Various Artists shelf beside Colonel Jeffrey Pumperknickel since you sold back Schoolhouse Rocks.","The dominatrix on the southwest side of town was already getting kind of haggard,\r\n\ but now she's ...

Burn and Shiver,Azure Ray,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a16c9d034d5c69bf2965/1:1/w_160/f7c5f938.jpg,2002-05-28 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/399-burn-and-shiver/,Warm,"As a critic, I place about as much faith in the 'rating scale as an institution' as I do in the fidelity of my overseas liaison, Papillon Soo Soo. That's not to say that Pitchfork's mandatory inclusion of a numerical rating with its reviews isn't justifiable. One glance at the site's readership will reveal that all advertisements and promotional gimmicks for which our existence is a vehicle are geared towards your prototypical inner-city collegiate male-- children of the instant-gratification generation who want as little as possible to do with the kind of painfully long literary passages they encounter on a daily basis. For those with an aversion to the lengthy texts and editorial fodder which act as a smokescreen for our more corporate endeavors, we provide a randomly selected numerical approximation of an album's greatness by which your preconceptions of music are to be realigned accordingly. The preceding example of depurated cynicism has more purpose than simply illustrating the effects of insomnia on your humble narrator's keyboarding. In reviewing Azure Ray's latest collection of unexcitable meditations on lost love, Burn and Shiver, my chosen rating of 6.8 will signify to many that there has been a drop in quality since group's 2001 eponymous debut for Warm Records, an album which Pitchfork deemed a 7.0. But nothing could be further from the truth, as Burn and Shiver finds Bright Eyes/Japancakes/Moby collaborators Orenda Fink and Maria Taylor improving upon nearly every aspect of their essential formula. While Azure Ray's debut boasted one or two truly moving songs-- most notably, the pensive ballad ""Displaced""-- it suffered from a horrible case of homogeny, as many tracks seemed mere variations on the group's favored structural idiom: the mid-tempo acoustic waltz. The overbearing sense of sameness to be found throughout didn't lend the disc to repeated, discriminating listens. Burn and Shiver remedies many of the group's past transgressions, as our favorite Eric Bachmann understudies have recently discovered the joy of incorporating percussive elements and-- in the instance of the excellent ""New Year""-- small flirtations with IDM into their sonic spectrum. No, the girls still haven't allowed Songs from a Room to leave their turntable, but on tracks such as ""How You Remember"" and the stellar ""Raining in Athens,"" they come closer than ever to wielding an emotional potency like master Cohen's. Yet, in spite of the progress to be found on Burn and Shiver, the album brims with brilliance unrealized, as many songs still refuse to fulfill the moments they seem fully capable of. This could be attributed to the fact that the girls have yet to author a lyrical passage worthy of their absolutely gorgeous vocals, often devolving into forcefully evocative lines that wax nostalgic of adolescent summers long past, et al. Were the arrangements more dynamic, such criticisms would be forgiveable, but Fink and Taylor's compositions often disengage the listener after a few minutes, generally resulting in unintentional drones. It's refreshing to hear two clearly talented artists beginning to inch out of the shadow of their influences, however long it may be. Though I'm not expecting their magnum opus any time soon, a few more albums of similar consistency will yield enough individual moments to comprise a satisfying body of work. Maybe by that time, Azure Ray will have come into their own.","As a critic, I place about as much faith in the 'rating scale as an institution' as I do in ...

One More in the Cabin,Jim and Jennie and the Pinetops,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9f9ea9e61561daa7100/1:1/w_160/3dce78c1.jpg,2002-05-28 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4254-one-more-in-the-cabin/,Overcoat,"Bill Monroe killed bluegrass. Most people would have you believe that he's the genre's undisputed pater familias and there would be no such thing as bluegrass without him. Well, that's true too, but he's also responsible for its lack of vitality as an art form, its stagnation, and its relegation to the museum to gather dust. He did this by defining it too specifically, by stating (both verbally and implicitly through the wild success of his music) exactly what bluegrass is. As a result, he hermetically sealed it, and cut it off from the influence of other kinds of music, which is what keeps a musical style alive and vibrant. It's ironic, considering the alchemy Monroe dabbled in to create bluegrass in the first place-- mixing together hillbilly, old-time string band music, western swing, classic folk balladry, jazz, etc. Nevertheless, it's ultimately his fault that there hasn't been much significant development in bluegrass since he cut his classic sides with Columbia in the mid-to-late 40s with the Bluegrass Boys. No musical genre is more haunted by its past than bluegrass-- not even reggae. Monroe's specter looms so heavily over the practitioners that most seem unwilling-- or more likely unable-- to push the form forward. The critic Harold Bloom called it the anxiety of influence, and in the case of bluegrass it's stultifying. Sure, there are stylistic shadings and sub-genre stratification if you really get into it, but basically it all comes down to Monroe. He embodies the form. It's similar to Andre Breton and his tyrannical control over the Surrealists (i.e., defining the terms, determining who was a surrealist and who wasn't), only in the case of bluegrass, Monroe's right to final say was accepted without much fuss. I've been to my share of bluegrass festivals, and while I appreciate the tradition and the musicianship bluegrass musicians almost invariably possess, it's hard not to feel like you're at a funeral when you're at these things, and not just because many of the pickers and fans are septuagenarians. You almost wish someone would do something tacky and desperate, like pull out a drum machine or plug in a theremin just to stir things up. Jim and Jennie and the Pinetops are raging against the dying of the light while at the same time dragging the carcass around with them. And I'm not sure how worthwhile the whole exercise is. The Philadelphian neo-bluegrass outfit, probably best known to indie rock fans for appearing on Songs: Ohia's Didn't It Rain, have a good outing on their new record One More in the Cabin. Yet, while pleasant enough, it surely isn't anything that's going to give bluegrass that long-overdue kick in the pants. But maybe these days that's all you can rightly ask of a bluegrass album-- that it be enjoyable, a good collection of songs to listen to on Sunday morning. One More in the Cabin sticks to the tried-and-true components of canonical, classically defined bluegrass: the high lonesome sound, the close harmonies (a nice touch given the male and female vocalists here), the standard five-piece guitar/bass/banjo/mandolin/fiddle instrumentation, the frenetic breakdowns followed by the rollicking ballad, and, for the most part, the lyrical subject matter (i.e., death, the weather, apple trees, etc.). In fact, this last item might reveal the most outstanding thing about the Pinetops: listening to the album before reading the liner notes, I was sure I'd heard some of these songs before. But they're all originals. One song in particular, ""Mourning Dove,"" had me convinced the liner notes must be wrong-- I was certain it was an old timey standard. But, no. It's just a good solid song, that, by all rights should be a standard someday. Isn't it a little sad, though, when the measure of success within a style of music isn't originality but how close the music comes to the accepted standard? Of course, the demographic who made the soundtrack to the movie O Brother, Where Art Thou? a fluke hit-- the NPR/Borders crowd-- will eat this up. That's not a putdown exactly, it's just a marketing tip. And there sure as hell are worse things they could be sippin' lattes to (Sting). But ultimately, One More in the Cabin is yet another tombstone-- a well-crafted one, yes, but a signal of doom all the same, an indicator of the sad, ironic fate of the music whose founder was so damn good his hegemony became oppressive.","Bill Monroe killed bluegrass.

The Illusion of Safety,Thrice,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a796ea9e61561daa5606/1:1/w_160/37d3503c.jpg,2002-05-28 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8036-the-illusion-of-safety/,Sub City,"What do Boy George, Ziggy Stardust and RuPaul have in common with Limp Bizkit and Two Live Jews? Nothing, actually, but if you moved a few consonants around, the former, a group of gender benders, would be identical with the latter, a group of genre blenders. Gender benders and genre blenders-- each so enigmatic, each so alluring. Or depending on the execution, instantly familiar and utterly repulsive. Clearly, this business of combining in one package that which has formerly remained distinct is awfully tricky. So tricky that the hardcore/pop-punk quartet Thrice has yet to figure it out. Have you ever looked at RuPaul and thought, ""What the fuck?"" Some things just aren't meant to be-- six-foot-seven-inch men and high heels, for example. Listen to the opening track of The Illusion of Safety, ""Kill Me Quickly,"" and you'll feel the same. It begins powerfully, with a burst of thick, crunchy metal chords and singer Dustin Kensrue's authentic hardcore growl. Then, with little more than 30 seconds invested, you get hardcore turned on its skull, in the form of hackneyed emo-verse. Weird, sure, but it gets weirder: the song then transitions back into its metal vibe, except with lyrical emo entrails: ""Let's fall asleep together/ Hold me darling 'cause I'm scared/ And I can't do this alone."" Huh? After the opener, Thrice retreats from the utterly sugary to the moderately sweet, blending metal with run-of-the-mill pop/punk. Imagine Blink-182 backed by the Fucking Champs, and you're approaching the mind warp Thrice hurls upon you. It's not seamless by a long shot-- the elements here are plainly distinct and separable, and unfortunately for the band, a little too hard to reconcile with one another. Like ""In Years to Come,"" which opens with an admittedly badass speed-metal riff. I ask you this: how can that ever-- and I mean in any conceivable world-- work in concert with lyrics like, ""It's a different kind of love?"" Call me traditional, but I'm just not feeling it. Despite their stylistic gumbo (and maybe you're picking up on this), Thrice deserves some props. In terms of their hardcore/metal riffing capabilities, Thrice has the skills to get the job done. The guitar overload on ""In Years to Come,"" for example, is grade-A stuff, as is just about all of ""To Awake and Avenge the Dead."" This, however, is like saying Wes Borland is a great guitarist; no matter how much you try to fiddle with your stereo EQ, you're always going to have to deal with Durst. In this case, Thrice's Durst is its incongruous lyrical and melodic direction. As proof, here's another good one, from ""Deadbolt"": ""And you, my true love... You call from the hilltop, you call through the streets."" Despite all of the vitriolic criticism contained herein, if you think you can ignore the singer, you might want to buy this album anyway. The band adds a conspicuous pledge to devote a portion of its proceeds to charity, a worthy organization in South Central Los Angeles called ""A Place Called Home"" (benefiting at-risk youth). Then again, it might be more economical to simply skip the album purchase and give straight to the charity. If you write them, tell them, ""I don't know why I'm here/ Guess I'm afraid to be alone"" (from ""See You in the Shallows""). Or don't, and make the wise metal-move of keeping your pansy-ass emotions to yourself. So there you have Thrice, heavy on instrumental ability, heavy on philanthropy, but featherweights in the songwriting department. Unique? I'll give them that, but so were Two Live Jews. And as with orthodox rabbis and hip-hop, this blend needs some work.","What do Boy George, Ziggy Stardust and RuPaul have in common with Limp Bizkit and Two Live Jews? Nothing, actually ...

Maladroit,Weezer,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9f113d197565213994c/1:1/w_160/b6c1a274.jpg,2002-05-27 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8613-maladroit/,Interscope,"Allow me to start by making a rather dorky connect-the-dots between two landmark cultural institutions of our key demographic: Weezer and Star Wars. Check it out: Weezer's self-titled return from hibernation (colloquially known as The Green Album) was The Phantom Menace of indie rock. Both sci-fi epic and alt-rock record were long-awaited events that had even the most jaded hipster hopping around like a small child with a full bladder. However, reactions to Star Wars: Episode One and Weezer: Episode Three were predominantly (and in some cases, absurdly) negative, despite small pockets of supporters slinging the old ""just turn your brain off and have fun"" argument. To be fair, the analogy isn't completely fail-safe. After all, The Phantom Menace didn't break the Star Wars hiatus with a skimpy 28 minutes of new material, and The Green Album didn't have some of the worst acting-- human or computerized-- in the history of film. Furthermore, by my standards, Weezer's second eponymous release was nowhere near the memory-raping experience Episode I entailed, nor was it as terrible as judged by this site and elsewhere. Freed from the skyscraper-high expectations surrounding its release, The Green Album on return visits has shown to carry a fair amount of damn fine singalong tunes, while rewatching The Phantom Menace induces more wincing than a Jackie Chan blooper reel. Now, convenient for my journalistic maneuvering, both franchises have produced their next efforts to get in your wallet-- Attack of the Clones and Maladroit. Regardless of what you might have thought about The Phantom Menace or The Green Album, it's undeniable that the rollouts of their respective followups are not garnering the same kind of delirious Second Coming-level hype. Not surprisingly, the response to Attack of the Clones has fallen along more traditional critics-vs.-the-public lines, with film writers generally turning up their nose at the flick's wooden dialog while normal people celebrate the picture as quality escapism. Maladroit, by continuing in the vein of The Green Album, promises a similar division of opinion, meaning a responsible critic (like myself) should probably submit it to the Mindless Fun Litmus Test. The MFLT is appropriate because, yeah, Maladroit is definitely not a return to the sound of the band's mid-90s artistic peak. But to give them the benefit of the doubt, it's pretty apparent what the Weez are shooting for with the new record-- a further distillation of their power-pop specialties into short, catchy, big-riff-centered nuggets. Many writers will probably try to lump this incarnation of the band in with Andrew W.K. and the White Stripes for a 'Return of the Rawk!' style feature, but what's truly apparent is Weezer's now-complete focus upon the concert experience rather than studio twiddling. The flying-V guitars and large light-up =W= of their stage act no longer carry the wink that they used to, and these songs are tailored specifically to provoke mosh pits and elicit rampant flashing of devil-horns. With Maladroit, Weezer has finally given the full punt to the nerd-rock label they sorta invented and always shunned, settling instead for being our generation's version of Cheap Trick. Rockford, Illinois' finest is just one of the classic guitar-worship pop bands invoked by the majority of the songs here, many of which seem like slight musical and thematic variations upon ""I Want You to Want Me,"" and all of which make room for a fingers-flying solo. Things are harder-edged musically than the sunny Green Album tunes, with guitarists Rivers Cuomo and Brian Bell laying on as much distortion as possible over the crunchy riffs that hold up ""American Gigolo"" and ""Take Control"" and, well, pretty much the entire affair. But lyrically, things are still anchored in your usual white-man pleading-voice girl courtship, as song titles like ""Love Explosion,"" ""Possibilities,"" and ""Slave"" clearly indicate. When this full-bodied attitude accompanies typically gooey Cuomo melodies, it makes for a handful of some of the best in-car rockout material of recent years. ""Keep Fishin'"" has boisterous call-and-response vocals and at least three different sections catchy enough to serve as choruses, while ""Fall Together"" is grunge-pop worthy of the late St. Kurt himself. Many songs on Maladroit come off as near-cover version love letters to Cuomo's rock heroes, most noticeably when ""December"" grafts a replica of the Who's ""Love Reign O'er Me"" to a souped-up 50s prom theme arrangement. On the other hand, the Kiss emulation and guitar-god posturing is a pretty thin disguise for a band that's pretty obviously a mere shadow of its former self. Weezer's first two albums were almost unanimously loved, hyper-influential, near-masterpiece collections of quirky, personal, addictive power-pop. Stripping down to the basics is one thing, but removing almost every element and characteristic that separated the band from the other million quartets-with-guitars is a sad, sad sight to see. There's a thin line between homage and unoriginality, and it's hard not to notice that, in their effort to emulate their guitar-rock heroes, Weezer has to some extent become a fairly straightforward, above-average bar band. Don't come looking for any of the eccentric flourishes of ""Undone"" or ""El Scorcho,"" as Maladroit is predominantly a one-note, homogenous affair. Deviations from the hard-rock mean are whiffs: ""Death and Destruction"" slows things down for some nazel-gaving, but can't come close to the emotional weight of a ""Say It Ain't So,"" for example. ""Burndt Jamb"" revisits the tropical flair of ""Island in the Sun""-- and is only a keyboard and a Laetitia away from being Stereolab-- but can't resist falling back on steel-toed overdrive theatrics in the middle. Meanwhile, Cuomo continues to move away from the intensely specific lyrical content of earlier work (I've always wondered if that half-Japanese cellist got a cut of Pinkerton's profits), preferring instead to drop angstful Everyman phrases like, ""Get yourself a wife/ Get yourself a job/ You're living a dream/ Don't you be a slob."" Right, so now's the part where I'm accused of underestimating Maladroit's youthful relevancy, missing the possibility that this album might mean as much to today's disenfranchised high school crowd as The Blue Album or Pinkerton meant to me in more innocent times. Maybe so, but it should be noted that I was a late-blooming Weezer fan, having written them off back in their first heyday and only cultivating a true appreciation for them over the last couple years. Given that fact, I have no qualms about taking a stand and pegging Maladroit as the slightest effort yet from the Weez, marking a continuation of their distressing downward trajectory and a perpetuation of their post-comeback complacence. It may have a handful of premium-grade headbangers, but in the mindless fun department, it sure ain't Yoda battling Christopher Lee.","Allow me to start by making a rather dorky connect-the-dots between two landmark cultural institutions of our key demographic: Weezer ...

Para Toda Vida,The New Amsterdams,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3d9c0084474cd0c3575/1:1/w_160/b886f457.gif,2002-05-27 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5761-para-toda-vida/,Vagrant,"In order to cleanse my mind and engage the New Amsterdams' Para Toda Vida without the usual vitriolic Pitchfork anti-Vagrant spiel, I underwent a vigorous regimen of holistic treatments. Employing acupuncture, aromatherapy, yoga, and reiki sessions, I attuned my brain to its optimal meditative state. Most importantly, I received twice-daily 'full body massages' from Maryann's Rub-N-Tug on 14th street, via the considerable expertise of the highly talented 'Vanessa' (tell 'em Rob sent you!). This meticulous and tax-deductible procedure was necessary preparation for tackling Para Toda Vida, in order to organize every last ounce of journalistic integrity to make a fair assessment of the album's quality. For you see, the New Amsterdams is the solo acoustic project of one Matthew Pryor, singer/guitarist for buzz-bin pop/punk cutie pies the Get Up Kids. And while the Kids have a Pitchfork credibility rating somewhere between Bobby McFerrin and Pablo Cruise, their albums (and spinoffs like this one) are consistent high-charters with the underclassmen crowd. So, as a service to our younger readers, it is my mission to judge the album without bias and on its own terms as Pryor's expedition into singer/songwriterly territory. Unfortunately, on that scale, Para Toda Vida still isn't-- how you say? Ah, yes-- good. Sure, the brief proceedings succeed at achieving a certain level of low-key intimacy, like a peek inside Pryor's bedroom while he holds a personal strumming session (not like that, perv). But while the concept strives to be third-wave emo's answer to Springsteen's Nebraska or Neil Young's Harvest, Pryor copies the methods while missing the point of the folkie approach, expecting poignancy and emotional depth to spontaneously result from stripped-down instrumentation. The very structure of the songs themselves exhibit this mistaken attitude, often coming off as typical Get Up Kids fare played during a power outage, rather than compositions written with acoustic instrumentation in mind. Pryor's day job leaves him with little more than two strumming patterns in his arsenal-- the fast strumming and slow finger-picked riffs of an intermediate-level guitar student. Also unmodified is Pryor's standard-issue throaty/nasal pop/punk voice, the uniform peppiness of which instantly strips away any variation in mood or emotional tone. Nor do Pryor's lyrics survive the extra scrutiny a solo setting casts upon them: while the words manage to avoid the broken-hearted weblog suffering of colleagues Dashboard Confessional, neither do they say, well, much of anything at all. Struggling to paint stirring word images of life's little complexites, songs end up instead with paper-thin morals (""Escape is the only way out"") and the kind of condescending lonely-waitress empathy MOR staples Train specialize in. It's telling that the most compelling lyric of the entire album-- ""It's possible the piano may be drinking/ But it's not me""-- is an uncredited swipe from an artist Pryor can be reasonably sure his base audience has never heard, Tom Waits. It may sound like I haven't succeeded in washing my ears of the fact that Para Toda Vida was made, in reality, by a Get Up Kid, but even in a blind taste test it'd be pretty obvious that it's the half-baked meanderings of a pop-punkster minus the drummer and Marshall stack. To tell the truth, appraising the record with Vagrant prejudice intact allows me to make the biggest compliment possible-- that the album isn't any worse than I expected it to be. But whether my chosen lens is objective, subjective, or just flat out pissy, there's no getting around the fact that Para Toda Vida is still ten songs destined for incidental music on the WB's primetime lineup.","In order to cleanse my mind and engage the New Amsterdams' Para Toda Vida without the usual vitriolic Pitchfork anti-Vagrant ...

Super/System,El Guapo,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc1dc0084474cd0c29fd/1:1/w_160/1d3cfa36.gif,2002-05-27 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11728-supersystem/,Dischord,"In America, we tend to equate quantity with greatness-- the bigger the product or the more of it, the better. For example, something about the idea of a 100-plex is interesting both on the structural tip and logistically. If they're playing 100 movies (realistically 50-- at least ten theaters would have to be reserved for Star Wars, et. al.), there might be one or two that don't feature helicopters, corsets, or a soundtrack by Blink-182. That's the double-edged sword of quantity thinking: with so much selection, we expect to find a gem hidden in all the mass. Conversely, we've gotten so used to having so much space that people seem incapable of turning out the good stuff without a whole helluva lot of clutter. Super/System, the third album (and first for Dischord) from D.C. trio El Guapo, contains-- count 'em-- eighteen tracks in 42 minutes. This is ar impressive feat for an avant-garde band whose appetite for sonic weirdness, jazz fusion, and various and sundry electronic bells and whistles might have you anticipating an extended horn jam session, ambient noise, and general rhythmic fucking around. And you wouldn't be wrong. There's some of all of that: the six-minute ""Being Boulevard"" includes all of the above, plus some appropriately Mark E. Smith-influenced yelling about fast lanes and bite-size snacks. There's something sort of appealing about this mix, though the ambient drone that makes up the latter half of the song is about 3\xBD minutes too long, and I'm curious to see how exactly they would pull this off live. But ""Being Boulevard"" is just the tip of the iceberg. Super/System contains so many sounds, and so many styles of music (sometimes within the same song, or in the same bar of the same song) that you might suffer under the temporary delusion that you're not listening to a cohesive album at all, but a quirky sound effects CD. There's just so much here-- it's the Old Country Buffet approach to songwriting. As previously noted, this approach guarantees them some moments of pure greatness; the problem is that they're not necessarily in any individual song. So here, I'll give you a short list of the most solid assets El Guapo has going for them: the droning harmonies over the driving, near-military drums on ""My Bird Sings,"" the icy, clever TNT-era Tortoise rhythms or ""Disappointment Spelled With A V.,"" and even the flurry of free-jazz horns that pop up sporadically are great the first or second time around. Signing to Dischord is kind of a big step for El Guapo; it may earn them a whole new variety of fans. In that light, Super/System may be seen as sort of a crossover album. There are moments here that are accessible-- ""Buildables"" is pretty catchy and easygoing, even though it does sound sort of like simplified Autechre with vocals. But El Guapo doesn't let you get too comfortable with any one genre or style. Things change so rapidly (and songs end so quickly) that Super/System may actually be less accessible than their previous work. When you start to incorporate experimental techniques into your music, a kind of underlying master plan is not a bad idea. Like, your audience, ideally, shouldn't get the impression that you threw that arrhythmic cacophonous mix of beeps and buzzes and bleats called ""Faith Based Music"" onto the album after an offhand in-studio conversation beginning with the lines, ""Hey guys, you know what would be really cool...?"" It's tedious. Super/System sounds like the best Christmas present ever for a burgeoning DJ. It's all there-- the sudden bursts of vocals, of melody, of interesting beats, of fun instrumental blips-- a seemingly inexhaustible resource! Turning 100 varieties of racket out on one 42 minute CD may earn accolades in some circles. As for me, I'm too overwhelmed to wade through all the clamor looking for the moments of genius.","In America, we tend to equate quantity with greatness-- the bigger the product\r\n\ or the more of it ...

Kind of uninspired. Supernatural hooks from beyond the grave. All sorts of descriptors spring to mind when I think about Phantom Planet's second album, The Guest. But honestly, how many of you actually care what this record sounds like? Let's just lay all our cards on the table. With a quick show of hands, who among you is only interested in Phantom Planet because that kid from Rushmore is the drummer? Come on, 'fess up. There was a time when I, too, couldn't have cared less about them if I wasn't such a fan of Wes Anderson's films. At first glance, Phantom Planet seemingly has 'gimmick' built into its DNA-- see, frontman Alex Greenwald's also got an acting career. And just look at them! The last time I saw five guys doing so much self-conscious posing was in Zoolander. Plus, they've got three guitars. Now that's anarchy! But the thing is, somewhere between all the vamping and forced attempts at being hip and irreverent, they found the time to write and record a fine record. The Guest is practically the definition of pop-- there's enough bubblegum and sticky-sweet lyrics in these twelve tracks to finance a Hubba Bubba comeback. Some of the songwriting here is unbelievably catchy, and bordering on brilliantly so. Sure, it ain't too complicated, but this sort of music rarely is (it's not like these guys are Mathletes or anything). And the unstoppable production duo Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake work wonders for the album, too, keeping the sounds crystal clear and light as a feather. Unlike most bands that claim their music is reminiscent of 60s pop, Phantom Planet actually make good on their promise, while also capably wrapping the sound around a variety of obvious influences from Radiohead (""Turn Smile Shift Repeat"") to Elvis Costello (""Nobody's Fault"" and ""One Ray of Sunlight""). Of course, the same retro charm that effortlessly carries the more upbeat numbers fails to translate as well to the more subdued cuts, and while the vocals are almost uniformly enjoyable, hearing Greenwald strain his pipes on a couple of these tunes gets a little tiresome. Still, The Guest is well executed and enjoyable, and fares much better than a lot of by-the-numbers pop/rock. It might be a little empty-headed for some people's tastes, but hey, not mine. All they need to do now is get Dogstar to open their tour. Then for the encore, Jason Schwartzman and Keanu Reeves could come out and sing some sort of duet-- like a Wyld Stallyns medley! Now that I'd pay good money to see.","Slick. Kind of uninspired. Supernatural hooks from beyond the grave. All sorts of descriptors spring to mind when I think ...

Above the Volcano of Flowers,The Fire Show,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd9eeb335119a49ecef2/1:1/w_160/02ba30f5.gif,2002-05-23 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3062-above-the-volcano-of-flowers/,Perishable,"There are certain bands that just seem destined to do great things. Whether it's a band with a sound all their own, or just a boatload of ambition, you can sense it in the air as their music travels through it. The Fire Show's eponymous first album revealed them as a band full of ideas, and the necessary swagger to carry them through to interesting ends. Released a year later, the mini-album Above the Volcano of Flowers continues that forward-thinking evolution. The Fire Show's sound is built on a basic enough template of craftily penned post-punk anthems, but they're not afraid to deviate from that formula by, say, running their own material through a meat grinder of samplers and refashioning it as a close cousin of Warp-style IDM. It's hard to know what to expect from the band when you first get your hands on this record-- it's packaged in a very plain cardboard slipcase with no information beyond the title, the label, and the band's website, where artwork and four extra MP3s can be downloaded. You can't even find the song titles on the website-- they're all read on track eight by a voice that seems to be having some major problems keeping itself aligned with the space/time continuum, constantly slowing and speeding up, sometimes to the point of being unintelligible. But as annoying as the liner notes are, the music manages to speak for itself quite nicely. The band's pairing with producer Brian Deck, well-known for his junkyard-bound kitchen sink production techniques, could hardly be more appropriate. The disc opens as the Fire Show quietly approach you with some swelling, ambient guitar and quietly mixed keyboard ostinatos, then a synth and cornet hook are sunk deep into your eardrums. Elastic bass throbs and pulsates as vocalist M. Resplendent intones, ""My mind makes debts that my body can't repay/ My heart keeps beating its head against the walls of this cage."" Tense strings creep along in the undertow as Olias Nil's guitar tears apart the song's wordless second verse. Nil's guitar is just a quick punch in the head, though, and the band then proceeds to rip through with the snorting, crunching middle eight. ""Designing a Steeper Cliff"" is followed by the propulsive ""Heart Muscle Mass,"" with a bass and drum groove worthy of any of the band's obvious forefathers like Gang of Four or The Fall. Unfortunately, Resplendent's vocal limits also come sharply into focus on this song, which finds him wailing like a deranged Muppet on the song's refrain: ""Our insurrection sprang from summer's call to arms/ To arms!/ Heart muscle mass/ Continues to grow."" Thankfully, this is really the only place where he falters, mostly sticking to a scattershot, declamatory delivery that befits his range quite well. While processing and electronic flourishes have always been present in the Fire Show's sound, the band has never taken it as far as they do on ""Black & White Trees Line the Paths of Sleep,"" an electronic reconstitution of other music from the band's catalog, all of it rendered unrecognizable by processing and sampling. Stuttering beats and vintage synths eye each other warily as other sounds buzz in the background, slowly piling texture onto the beats. The band are really at their best when they stick to their brand of rhythmically charged, experimental post-punk, but this is an interesting development in their sound, and its more subtle implementation in the other songs reveals the true promise of that direction. The slow-motion post-punk of ""You the Ghost"" is awash in strategically placed drones and programming, creeping along like a less tortured Joy Division or Section 25. The acoustic guitar and cooing backup vocal that suddenly enter to close out the song are about the last thing you'd expect, but it sets up the piano intro of ""Sonny Listman, Dead Like Latin"" beautifully. That song then launches into more of the snaking post-punk that the band has basically perfected at this point, replete with violently mixed guitar interjections and stuck-keyed synths humming around the edges. As the droning conclusion of ""Sonny Listman"" consumes itself with rising guitar noise, ""Bed with Ambulance Police Light on Top"" rounds the set out with a barrage of glitchy percussion, distorted vocals and freakishly hollow-sounding bass that eventually lurch to a halt like broken machinery. It's a fitting end to an adventurous release for a band that was short-lived, but accomplished what they could when they could. It's the sound of a band exploring their capabilities and discovering that they don't have very many, and that's a great thing to hear.","There are certain bands that just seem destined to do great things.

Demure,Engine Down,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc7013d197565213b310/1:1/w_160/fd857da8.jpg,2002-05-23 05:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2788-demure/,Lovitt,"Religious people, especially Christians, used to be a gloomy bunch. Think about Jesus. Sure, he eventually triumphed over death, but the whole point of putting him on earth in the first place was to get him killed. Almost every one of his followers was martyred, and those following in their footsteps-- monks and priests-- would regularly pay rueful, onerous penance, and swear to never have sex in their lives. Someone sign me up! Recently, though, religion has taken a different tack. In a quest for fresh converts, Christians have spruced up their image, emphasizing the happy, fun times over the heritage of suffering, all in an effort to ""meet the young people where they're at."" Unfortunately for them, my guess is that secular youth aren't all smiling. No, the under-30 crowd seem to be a bit more confused, upset and cynical; in a word, angstful. Engine Down knows it because they are, too. On Demure, the band evidences a keen empathy towards where the frowning youngsters are at, and it meets them there. Singer Keeley Davis presides over Engine Down's congregation, chanting a brooding liturgy of angst. His solemnity is effective in one way-- Davis' voice may tend towards the Kermit side (throaty), but it is rich and expressive, convincingly communicating cynicism and sadness. Engine Down comes up a tad short on the songwriting end, though; if you've heard a chanted liturgy, you know this-- they may be hypnotic, but they certainly aren't melodic. In a similar way, Engine Down's vocals sound like moribund meditations. Besides being simple and slow to develop, the melodies are uniform: from song to song, Davis laments his subjects in more or less the same basic fashion, rarely departing more than one or two tones from where he started. Fortunately, this weakness isn't fatal, and it may well be calculated. For as sad as a man like Brian Wilson may have been, he rarely sounded it. There's wisdom in that there proverb: want to sound melancholy? Do not follow the bouncing ball. Leave the bouncy, chipper melodies for the bouncy, chipper people. However-- and this is a substantial however-- if you're going to make an album with melodic uniformity, you'd better work it out with the instrumentation. That shit needs to be dead-on. In this respect, Engine Down plays a strong hand. The instrumentation and orchestration on Demure are both equally impressive. Guitarist Jonathan Fuller and bassist Jason Andrew Wood play quite well together, especially when utilizing counterpoint, as on the title track, where Fuller fingers a rapid arpeggio while Wood walks out a minor-key pattern mimicking the drum rhythm. The drums, courtesy of a most unfortunately named white man, Cornbread Compton, are as dynamic as the melodies are stagnant. Opener ""Songbird,"" for example, is defined by the unsettling drum beat. The propulsive ""Taken In"" gains its momentum from Compton's rolling, full-bodied tom and bass rhythm. Moreover, the music fits the mood of the vocals perfectly. The coarse, minor key guitars communicate the same emotions as Davis' lyrics. Likewise, the song structures retain a consistent tension and anxiety from odd rhythms and time signatures. Demure is a consistent release, albeit a tad formulaic and lacking in overall dynamism. To fully meet the young people where they're at, the band would do well to play up their fondness for variety; shifting tempo, voracious intensity and building to crescendos all seem to be popular with the kids these days. True to its title, Demure lacks the confidence to tread all over the competition, but holds its own as a pretty nice effort.","Religious people, especially Christians, used to be a gloomy bunch.

In Our Gun,Gomez,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf65eb335119a49ed1ff/1:1/w_160/ad7dd294.jpg,2002-05-23 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3511-in-our-gun/,VirginHut,"For those of you that don't know, Gomez won the Mercury Music Prize way back in 1998 for their debut release, Bring It On, and they've been the darlings of the British hype machine ever since. Considering how well blues-inspired rock of the Gomez variety seems to fare overseas, that probably shouldn't be a surprise, either. Not that there's anything fundamentally wrong with blues-rock. Last I checked, the Rolling Stones are/were fairly well regarded, and I think a couple of people enjoy the White Stripes, among others. If only Gomez could pull it off, too. Problem is, Gomez is to the blues as Blink-182 is to punk. The work of these blokes from Southshore, England is sometimes said to be reminiscent of Mississippi delta blues, and every time I hear that my heart breaks for John Lee Hooker. In fact, did you know that B.B. King decided to sell his soul and shill for Burger King as a direct result of listening to Gomez' second album, Liquid Skin? It's true, and the crimes against music don't end there. Gomez has seen fit to unleash a third installment in their war against discerning audiophiles everywhere, and they call it In Our Gun. If anemic blues guitar riffs and half-assed attempts at white-boy soul were the only problems with In Our Gun, it might almost be passable. Instead, perhaps sensing their own shortcomings with the music's source material, Gomez searches far and wide for musical gimmicks to prop up their limp Britpop-meets-New Orleans aesthetic. What better way to bolster weak-kneed compositions than by making half-hearted stabs at a dozen other genres as well? Everything from jazz sax to watered-down electronica is crammed into thirteen tracks, and they feel even hollower for the addition of these excesses. The result is a Frankenstein's monster of an album-- overwrought and disjointed, executed with some technical precision, but completely devoid of any flow, feeling, or spontaneity. It certainly doesn't help that these tracks, marginal compositions to begin with, seem to have been completely defanged by glossy production techniques. This album is cleaner than Howard Hughes' bedroom, and the songs might have benefitted from some roughness around the edges. The lone exception to most of these criticisms is the title track, which actually succeeds a little despite the album's missteps. ""In Our Gun"" is somber and tense, with a surprisingly soulful chorus and, not coincidentally, it's also the most tastefully spare song present. According to guitarist Ian Ball, the song was inspired by the 2000 U.S. election fiasco, which is evident in such typically incisive lyrics as, ""It's been carefully planned by the ones you won't see/ Send out the monkeys, they come out of the bushes/ To piss in the punch and then smash up the decks."" Scary thing is, that's the best of the bunch. ""Shot Shot,"" ""Detroit Swing 66,"" and ""Ruff Stuff"" also seem to show promise, but fail to develop into anything worth listening to more than once. In Our Gun is at its best (and I use that word loosely) when it appears to actually construct something out of the formless soup of musical genres it flirts with. At its worst, it's the music playing nonstop in fraternity hell after all the noisy, drunken jocks have left the party to go screw passed-out cheerleaders and the only people left are the quiet, introspective drunken jocks-- move over, Dave Matthews! In the end, though, all this ranting's just one man's opinion. If the British music press is to be believed, then rest assured that every single loyal Englishman thinks Gomez is the cat's pajamas. In fact, if you listen closely, you might just be able to hear an islandful of people simultaneously proclaim me a 'stupid git.' Er, bring it on!","For those of you that don't know, Gomez won the Mercury Music Prize way back in 1998 for their ...

Stereo / Mono,Paul WesterbergGrandpaboy,by: Ryan Schreiber & Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa00b1335d7bf16995b8/1:1/w_160/c527eefd.jpg,2002-05-23 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11863-stereo-mono/,Vagrant,"Paul! Good god, man, it's been a while. Last I heard, you were wasting away in some piss-gutter on Minneapolis' north side, regaling the local liquor slobs with tales of 7th Street glory and Tommy Stinson's bitchin' hair parades. Hey, how about that solo career? Yeah, you blew it right from the start. Christ, dude, ""Silver Naked Ladies""? Suicaine Gratifaction?? What'd, you have an aneurysm? Ahh, no offense, pal. Heard your new records-- fuckin' shocker, man! Thought we'd heard the last of you after that career-ender back in '99. But that's all history now, buddy. Get up on that barstool and talk some noise about Pete Jesperson. You still owe me a rum-and-coke for ""World Class Fad"". Such is how a conversation between myself and olde Paul Westerberg might've gone had we hooked up for a drink at the Turf Club a couple of months ago for an interview I just dreamt up to make this transition smoother. Yeah, I could be like the rest of you cynical half-breeds and feign disinterest, write this weathered codger off and tell you to save yourself the worry and pick up a Sorry Ma reissue. After all, I've got the practice, having spent the last ten years bored to tears by Westerberg's post-Replacements solo schlock. 14 Songs and Eventually have long since left my memory banks, forgettable like the phrase ""adult contemporary singer/songwriter."" Yet, after getting the boot from two major labels in the past four years, Westy's back on the minor circuit with a sense of confidence so renewed it produced two full-length records. But what shocks even more than his sudden resurgence in popularity is the fact that these albums mark the first time since about 1987 that Westerberg's released anything worth more than a 5.0. And while I'm on a roll here, I'll go ahead and be controversial: Stereo and Mono are the best work Paul's done ir like fifteen years. And yeah, I'm just as surprised as the rest of you skeptics. Stereo's a collection of low-key, country-tinged acoustic ballads, sad love songs, and bluesy rock beaters that were reputedly self-recorded in the basement of Westerberg's house over the course of two years. The amateurish production announces its presence with abruptly ending songs and occasional, unintentional background racket. Westerberg plays all the instruments, occasionally flubs lyrics, and gets defensive in the liner notes: ""Unprofessional? Perhaps. Real? Unquestionably."" Cocky? Yep. But the man's got a right. This here's the inventor of cock, the guy who shared a town with the already well-established H√ºsker D√º and openly mocked them in a song on his band's debut album! That cockiness fights its way onto both Stereo and Mono, and solely on the basis of the man rediscovering his testicles, these records are worth a listen. But there's more: reverting to his trademark graveled vocals and veering off the path of predictability by dropping some genuinely loud material along the way, Westerberg's conviction is nearly as strong now as it was in his prime. And, spared the studio polish and complex arrangements of the rest of his solo catalog, these songs are simply solid-- proving that when he's inspired, he can still bring home the magic. Unquestionably. The disc opens with ""Baby Learns to Crawl,"" with its spacious guitar and muted accordion effects fading into ""Dirt to Mud,"" a plaintive, acoustic Dylan-esque paean to regret. The excellent, waltz-timed ""Got You Down"" even recalls the sparse intimacy of Nebraska-era Springsteen. For an album conceived and recorded with a modicum of slick production toys, it does a great job manipulating atmosphere from song to song. Take the downtempo blues-pop of ""No Place for You,"" which, for its spatial expanse, is remarkably intimate (likewise the lo-fi rock of ""Unlisted Track""). Makes one wonder about the acoustics of Westerberg's basement. Included with the original pressings of Stereo comes Mono (released under that cheeseball moniker Grandpaboy), and seen as a double album, Stereo/Mono is particularly effective. If the Paul Westerberg of Stereo is a seasoned musician putting his sorrows to music in the basement, Grandpaboy is his incorrigible alter-ego, playing spacious, low-fidelity Stones-stampin' rock 'n' rule that evokes his Replacements days without pandering to nostalgia. Westerberg's even joined by a tight backing band on Mono, and claims to have recorded the album in a state of hurried, sweaty-handed irrationality-- something some of you digital perfectionists out there might take a cue from. As on Stereo, Mono moves fairly seamlessly across genres without disrupting the essential tone of the album: the bar-brawling ""High Time"" kicks things off somewhere between rootsy Americana and power-pop; ""Let's Not Belong Together"" is a reverb-heavy, imperfect rockabilly number; ""Anything But That"" pits Jagger swagger against Westerberg's best 'Mats yowl. And of the two, Mono holds up as the stronger album throughout. But only by a hair. Both of these records are considerable accomplishments, considering that the last time we heard from this guy it was on the cut-out bin damnation of Suicaine's abysmal ""Bookmark."" Westerberg's influence was planted ir this fertile indie rock soil back in 1982, and whether it's been bastardized through the generations or not, you can still hear echoes of his rasped tone deep in the mixes of today's greatest counter-cultural masterpieces. Mono and Stereo would be fine records from any musician-- that Westerberg himself is the source makes it all the sweeter. These albums, if nothing else, serve as a reminder of all he's done, and all he's yet to do. Congrats, Paul. Didn't think you had it in you.",,7.7,
Animal Magic,Bonobo,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3405e6ef959693205e3/1:1/w_160/9d021c20.jpg,2002-05-22 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/853-animal-magic/,Ninja Tune,"For those of you who skipped out of zoology classes to get baked behind the bike sheds, bonobos are a species of chimpanzee. Whereas your regular chimp is a vicious, antagonistic bag of misogynistic rage, the bonobo is a peaceable, female-respecting soul who loves to have sex just for the fun of it. Bonobos are Pitchfork's kind of primate. So when we received Animal Magic, the debut album by downtempo Brit Simon Green, the 'Fork knew that the collection was bound to get us all super-relaxed and ready for some smooth, sweet loving. So with a several tubs of fresh whipped cream, a punnet of strawberries and a French tickler or two, I set about scoring some love action while assessing Animal Magic. In keeping with his chosen alias, Green never screams, throws tantrums, or is stupid enough to allow primatologists to force him to learn a simple noun-predicate dialect. Green's language is already highly developed-- though he borrows slightly from previous Ninja Tune releases, he's more in sync with Memphis Industries' Blue States or Broadway Project, and as wryly humorous as Fort Lauderdale. Animal Magic stumbles initially: Green's gaffe is to include one of those hokey master-of-ceremonies intros in which some suited-and-booted jerk-off intones for the enjoyment of ladies and gentlemen. That schtick got mildewy yonks ago and for perpetuating such a clich√©, Green needs to be roundly rebuked. Once the intro is over, none of Animal Magic is impeachable. Though Green sifts through the same thrift-store record bins as Bent, he manages to combine his samples so as to produce tracks that transcend their constituents. In other words, Bonobo avoids the wretched hamfistedness of Lemon Jelly. The bewitching vocal sample that anchors ""Sleepy Seven"" reminds me of Blue States' ""Your Girl."" Green doesn't make extensive use of the sample, instead dropping it in to subtly spice up his languid groove and melodica lines. ""Dinosaurs"" is appropriately more muscular: Greer selects beats that are less geared to bob heads as to snap necks. But to counter the violence, Green arranges somnolent trombone and sax snippets. The acoustic guitar appeggios and swooshing sounds that begin ""Kota"" remind me of the intricate yet sleepy vibes of my favorite Swiss downtempo-er, Seelenluft. During ""Terrapin,"" sitars and subdued strings weave the wordless story of Shiva's horizontal journey to the center of his pleasure zone. ""The Plug"" tells the tale of how Shiva, upon reaching the center of his pleasure zone, begged never to return to the realm of strife and woe, and how he pleaded to remain surrounded by the sounds of gentle cymbal strokes, maracas, strings, and a melody played on an oboe-ish instrument of ineffable serenity. Though Animal Magic breaks no new ground for chill-out, I'm overjoyed that after its initial slip into clich√©, Green makes his debut album much greater than the sum of its parts. Green has a real flair for dynamics which, in chill, is a remarkable achievement. Animal Magic is clearly the creation of a musician rather thar that of a zany bricoleur who has absorbed too many broadcasts of ""The Goons."" With his debut securely a success, it'd be nice to see Greer follow the path of J. Swinscoe's Cinematic Orchestra and apply his composer's abilities to human musicians rather than an array of sound files. Now. May I tempt you with a cream-dipped strawberry, sweet thing?","For those of you who skipped out of zoology classes to get baked\r\n\ behind the bike sheds, bonobos ...

Live at the Holiday Sin,Ill Ease,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c1b613d197565213bc48/1:1/w_160/fc4c90e9.gif,2002-05-22 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4073-live-at-the-holiday-sin/,Smilex,"So Elizabeth Sharp, of the one-woman band Ill Ease, recorded this album by herself in Room 124 of the ""Holiday Sin"" outside Altantic City-- that benighted second-tier den of evil, with its casinos, partial-nudity strip clubs and grotesquely venal boardwalk attractions. And this is a vulgar little record, part loopy and part seedy. In fact, is that motel even a real place? Or is this a Holiday Sin... of the soul? Sharp, former member of New Radiant Storm King and Skinner Pilot, tries to create a twisted vibe, but the record works best when it's good clean rock 'n' roll. The first three songs are terrific: she kicks off ""Dear Krazy"" with a grungy rhythm guitar and nice, driving brushwork-- she's a great drummer, and she reportedly records every track by starting with the drums. Guest guitarist Caleb Seavey takes a solo that's halfway searing. ""Whatever Turns U On"" speeds over a coarse guitar riff and nicely placed keyboard fills, before Sharp settles down into ""The Static's Beat"" and its broad melody and catchy chorus. And the last track, ""Miami Hurricanes,"" is too long, but it has a Sunday-on-the-boardwalk feel and an acoustic guitar part that's like a warm drizzle. But outside of those tracks, Sharp runs out of ideas. Most of the songs are repetitive-- maybe starting with the drum parts wasn't such a good idea-- and while a couple of tracks are raucous or hypnotic, the sound can become claustrophobic, as on the head-beatingly singsong ""Ruler of the Ho-dom."" And where's the evil? Sharp tries to sound loony, singing just above a murmur, but the lyrics sound like they come from Liz Phair's ruder younger sister. They swing from the hilariously blunt ""Me & My Babysitter"" (""Let's play babysitter/ Let me sit on your face"") to the silly, indie-as-a-heart-attack ""Yr. Corporate Sponsor"" (""Yr corporate sponsor sucks dick/ Gives good head""). The recording sounds lo-fi and rough, like the worn-out motels in Sharp's cover photos. But the arrangements are impeccable: every use of a keyboard or toy xylophone falls right in place, the guitars are flawless, and aside from the frantic turn in ""Jack & Ginger,"" the pace is machine-like. In fact, everything's perfect, but without enough passable songwriting or raw lunacy to carry it: it's nasty, yeah, but not as nasty as promised.","So Elizabeth Sharp, of the one-woman band Ill Ease, recorded this album by herself in Room 124 of the ""Holiday ...

Reservoir Songs EP,Crooked Fingers,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a6a6b1335d7bf1698e9b/1:1/w_160/4c055c05.jpg,2002-05-22 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1669-reservoir-songs-ep/,Merge,"These are drinking songs, so: Beer One: When I get together with people who were my friends between Bushes in the petty-angst cyber-nineties, we inevitably end up covered in doughnut glaze and gin under a pinball machine, crying about how we miss the Archers of Loaf. ""That angular, angular thunder!"" one of us moans. ""It was porcupine rock, man, porcupine rock,"" another slurs. In just two years, though, tallest Archer Eric Bachmann has mutated from a staccato-barking, dissonant chord-ninja into a twangy, pulsing, guttural Neil-trouba-Diamond-dour. His latest outfit, Crooked Fingers, has gone from being considered Bachmann's 'post-Loaf project' to releasing material singularly captivating enough to suggest that he won't always be fending off requests for ""Harnessed In Slums"" by declaring to the crowd, as he did at a recent show, ""Uh, that was a different band."" Beer Two: Some months back, I had an itch to burn some of that sexy fossil fuel that makes the world go 'round, so I gathered up a posse to follow Crooked Fingers for a few days. The first show we beheld had a strange vibe: the kids all had that cultivated bedhead, and the scene was inbred; you could tell that everyone had seen at least five people in their periphery naked, so they were all nerves, calculating complications in their one clean sub-ironic slogan t-shirt (""Try New Coke,"" ""Thank You, Come Again""). Crooked Fingers set up on stage and then told the horn-rimmed soundman that they were going to play in the middle of the venue without any PA. The unplugged songs (some of which are included on this EP) rang supreme, but there was initially something stagey about this offstage business, forcing the crowd to encircle them as the needy girls wet-mouthed the lyrics and stared do-me-ly at Bachmann, hoping for a validating glance back. This floor-level banjo jam seemed to be saying: O Brother, Here Pimps Us. Beer Three: By the fourth show, hoss, we was sold. The original venue was inexplicably closed, so the Fingers resourcefully set up at a bar down the street, but see, that bar didn't have a PA that could handle the band's electric segment, and the 'stage' was outside, and it was nipple-scab cold. You know what's next: they took it inside, to the crowded bar-bar, and did a 'quiet' show like no other. The band was so adept, and Bachmann was so affable, that the crowd became downright protective of Crooked Fingers, moving tables, getting them drinks, verbally assaulting anyone not paying attention, and yanking the video games' cords out of the sockets. By this point, my comrades and I realized that this down-in-the-crowd angle was a populist masterstroke, a way to supercede the absurdity of the pedestal-stage. The band made their way around the room, and eventually ended up on top of the thin bar counter. I'm not one who thinks that 'acoustic' equals 'deep' (one the lamest things I've seen was a drummerless version of Bachmann's Merge-mate Neutral Milk Hotel)-- but damn. The cello got caught in the ceiling fan. Eric was a towering post-folk Charon, scrunching his mouth and twitching like a cartoon wino. People were buying beer between their legs. Ooh, heaven was a place on Earth. Beer Four: Ayyyyy! Now entering Buzz City, baby, and my teeth can't feel each other. What I've been trying, but failing to say is, I first heard these songs live, and they were triumphant-- so much so that this EP has a hard time holding up, like how Polaroids from fifth-grade Bible Camp don't convey how much ass the counselor-versus-ambassador tug-of-war kicked. Despite this, and despite the fact that the band's live cover of ""Long Black Veil"" is sorely missing, this EP is hella fulla gold. The same blippity keyboard-aquarium flatmosphere as the Fingers' other releases provides a foundation for three songs here. The first of them, Kris Kristofferson's ""Sunday Morning Coming Down,"" isn't sublime until its chorus, during which the string instruments transcend the singer/songwriter swelter of the verse lyrics. The story of Springsteen's ""The River"" is told portentously, with a righteous drum-punch. Bowie/Queen's ""Under Pressure"" should satisfy anyone who's ever gotten sloshed and pogoed on their own glasses at an Old Wave/80s night: the band scraps the riff that connotes Vanilla (stop, collaborate and listen), and showcases a Bachmann falsetto that rivals Lambchop's Kurt Wagner. The bone-marrow bombs, however, are the sparse rebaptisms of Neil Diamond's ""Solitary Man"" and Prince's ""When U Were Mine."" These songs and their authors are oft-covered, but that don't spook our boys. Diamond's ode to stubborn bachelorhood is given an oompah treatment, complete with elderly-sounding ""hurmmmm's,"" while Prince's tune is awarded a past so rich that you'll regret everything you ever gave away (including the Ewok sticker book) as the banjo and cello build to pregnant pauses so's you can gasp. Beer Five, I Think: You go, Merge, landing Crooked Fingers, and my other favorite band, Destroyer! The Fing' is so authentic. Man, Bachmann's tall. I wonder what that's like, being all tall and all. My eyelids are, like, on fire. This EP is the work of true disciples. Who could win in a fight between Bachmann and Malkmus? Who could win in a fight between nuns and sluts? Why are bands who used to be distorted returning to their pop/Appalachian roots? My grandpa doesn't remember my grandma. Let's play football with this rocking chair, and then squat under a bug zapper with these crossbows.","These are drinking songs, so:

There Is No Beginning to the Story EP,Bright Eyes,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3995e6ef959693206a7/1:1/w_160/f1241da1.jpg,2002-05-22 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/936-there-is-no-beginning-to-the-story-ep/,Saddle Creek,"How old is Conor Oberst now? Twenty-one, maybe twenty-two, right? It seems like just yesterday he was only the tender age of fourteen, hammering away on his old acoustic, blessed with enough angst and resentment to make most teenagers envious. But kids grow up so fast nowadays, don't they? I mean here it is, eight years later, he's just released There Is No Beginning to the Story, and there's barely a hint of the tantrum-infused songwriting he's been prone to on any of his countless other releases. Maybe he's shocked his critics by maturing while they weren't looking; maybe he's just screaming less. Whatever the case, the latest Bright Eyes EP hints at the promise of better things to come. Some of you are no doubt familiar with the standard Bright Eyes ouevre. For the duration of his young career, Oberst has stuck to jangly, repetitive acoustic guitar work and oh-so-tortured vocals like a religion. To a large extent, his caterwauling delivery and pent-up aggression have been the basis of his major criticisms and, I'll wager, the basis for some of his fanbase, too. Yet, with There Is No Beginning to the Story, Oberst manages a nice balance between his more intense older material and a newer, calmer sound that won't alienate his fanbase, and just might even stifle some of his detractors. It's still Bright Eyes, certainly, but a little less jangly and a little less whiny (most of the time). These improvements aren't across the board, though, and there are some problematic moments. ""From a Balance Beam"" is stale-- yet never offensively so-- and ""Messenger Bird's Song,"" the one fatal misstep of this EP, is particularly poor: featuring Oberst at his most embarassingly emotive and little else, he cracks and quavers through a thin acoustic ballad so predictable it wears out its welcome with the first 'heartfelt' faltering of his voice. Fortunately, There Is No Beginning's faults are more than compensated for by the two remaining cuts on the disc. ""Loose Leaves"" is, hands down, the most uncharacteristically unique tune Bright Eyes has produced. It's bouncy, electric, and-- dare I say-- almost cheery. The jaunty, Irish-folk inspired riff at its foundation, the horns, and the singsong feel combine to produce a tune so unabashedly catchy it's tough to believe Oberst wrote it. Hell, it's just nice to get something you can sing along to, even if you aren't planning on hanging yourself tomorrow. And, for a real change of pace, Oberst nearly drops the semi-precious waver altogether and actually sings on ""We Are Free Men."" I've got a higher tolerance for Oberst's trademark nasal whine than most, but his decision to tackle this one in a lower register improves it 100%. Additionally, vinyl addicts are treated to two fine bonus tracks: ""Amy in the White Coat"" and a cover of Neil Young's ""Out on the Weekend."" The eerie backing vocals on ""Amy"" are really one of the highlights of the EP. This is what ""Messenger Bird's Song"" wanted to be before it was handicapped by over-the-top vocals-- but Oberst doesn't make that mistake twice. As for the cover of Neil Young, I don't have the room to discuss all the possible implications; you either love him or hate him, but it's a solid cover, regardless. The biggest surprise of all, though, is the lyrical quality this time out. Sporting fewer trite poeticisms, the content of these songs comes across as less self-indulgently brooding-- even occasionally bordering on optimistic. To find four (or six) more diverse Bright Eyes selections than those on There Is No Beginning to the Story would be difficult, if not impossible. Here, Oberst's songwriting seems newly inventive, and the musicianship is tight all-around going into Bright Eyes' upcoming album. For almost twenty minutes, he shows signs of finally growing up. If he can keep it up for another fifty or so, he might be on to something.","How old is Conor Oberst now? Twenty-one, maybe twenty-two, right? It seems like just yesterday he was only the tender ...

Here's why: you're not French. Perhaps it's not the only reason, but no matter how scrawny, ugly or foul-smelling you are, if your lips manage to pronounce those delicate, lilting tones of the language of love, it is on. Promise. Some of my best friends are French-- they have, like, ten dates a night, usually three or four at a time. Unfortunately for TTC, though, hip-hop isn't about romance. Unlike making love, French language skills tend to be a liability in the world of beats and rhymes. You know what I mean; just imagine a French accent on badasses like Rakim or Jay-Z: ""how you say-- errr-- Beeg Peemping?"" Not quite. Despite the disability, hip-hop has followed in the footsteps of another traditionally African-American art form-- jazz-- in gaining a substantial following with the Gauls. But probably owing to the reasons noted above, American audiences have yet to pay a return favor to French acts, notwithstanding the critical acclaim showered on torch-bearers like MC Solaar. TTC hopes to put an end to the trend with their first-rate sophomore effort, Ceci N'est Pas un Disque. Chances are, if you're considering a TTC purchase, you won't be making it for the lyrics. In light of that, allow me to brief you for a moment on the beats. They're a superb and diverse bunch, evidencing influence of American old-school and underground hip-hop alike. From the playfulness of the opener, ""Nonscience,"" to the spooky sci-fi of the El-P inflected ""Subway,"" it's all inventive and surprisingly well-produced. The DJ Vadim-helmed ""De Pauvres Riches"" utilizes a sparse, quirky beat built on a curious bass clarinet melody and accompanied by almost comically intermittent orchestral embellishments. The unique ""Pollutions"" opens with four measures of a bass-lipped human beatbox, which is joined by an organ melody that is almost the exact replica of the background music from Abba's ""Dancing Queen,"" as well as the crackles and pops of vintage vinyl. The odd blend of two worlds (disco and hip-hop) delightfully provokes concurrent nostalgia and head-nodding. The album's finest beat appears on ""Ensoulevant le Couvercle,"" knee-deep in thick production. The dark, ominous beat rests on a foundation of simple, downtempo drums, with synth horns and organ insinuating a chilling background ""melody,"" if you can call it that (it sounds more like an echo). The song plods along, a more pervasive pipe organ gurgling intermittently along with the rhythmic ambience of creaky floorboards. It's better described by the emotions evoked: doom, confusion, and funk. In terms of lyrics, it's anyone's guess. I can tell you this: one of the MC's, who I dubbed ""Ad-Rocque"", struck me as rather annoying. He sounds like your run-of-the-mill white-boy MC who tries to affect a voice he doesn't have. As for the others, I have no problems with them, even though I don't understand a damn word. Which brings us back to the opening point; except for two English cameos (Dose One on ""Pas D'Armure"" and Yara Bravo on ""Ensoulevant Le Couvercle"") the album is entirely in French, so don't expect the kids in Bushwick and Bed-Stuy to be stocking up on copies of TTC. But should you? Think of it this way: TTC scores an 8.0 on beats alone. Hand the mic to Del, and we're probably staring at a 9.5. Hand it to Gwen Stefani, and we're back down to 7.0. Either way, you get the point-- you like beats, you buy this album. End of story.","Still looking for romance? Here's why: you're not French. Perhaps it's not the only reason, but no ...

Souljacker,Eels,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc0713d197565213b20f/1:1/w_160/3756e2c4.jpg,2002-05-21 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2686-souljacker/,Dreamworks,"Beyond the melodies that don't stick in my head and the beats that don't make me want to dance, the only real problem with Souljacker, Eels' fourth album, is that it just seems like an underachievement. I've never been a big fan of artists who play it cool on record: that is, appear to toss off musical ideas when their fans, their press releases and even signs hidden in their own music suggest they should be doing a lot more. Take someone like Prince: a guy with talent to burn, and without the pressure of having to establish himself or compromise his art to appease a greedy record label-- so why am I lucky to get even two decent jams per album from him since about 1987? Similarly, artists like Eels, led by frontman E (Mark Oliver Everett) seem like they have a wealth of raw material to work with, yet are often content to settle for middle-of-the-road filler-pop. If Neutral Milk Hotel suddenly got a million bucks to record at the best studio in L.A., with access to hundreds of studio musicians and music-biz insiders, I'm not sure it would make the music any better. Mangum takes odds-and-ends and a four-track and makes incredible music anyway. I think the key is that he started with good songs and expanded from there, whereas bands like Eels just seem to be dumbing down every aspect of their stuff for who knows what purpose. I hope it's not to get radio play, because if so, it isn't working. I haven't heard much Eels on my FM dial since their modest 1996 hit ""Novocaine for the Soul."" Opener ""Dog Faced Boy"" starts innocently enough, with a faux lo-fi glam guitar hook and primal drumming. E's raspy vocals still sound a bit thin to my ears, which doesn't help when delivering ominous lines like, ""Ma won't shave me/ Jesus won't save me, Dog Faced Boy."" Wher the shakers come in, I wonder whether this was supposed to be single material-- something that might appeal to those ornery Gen-X rascals. ""That's Not Really Funny"" picks things up with its good-natured carnival-band hook, and more faux lo-fi guitar. (If you're wondering, I keep making the 'faux' distinction because it's hard to imagine any album funded by Spielberg and company being forced to use bad amps or equipment.) It could be a good effect-- just ask Beck-- but again, the tune and the wacky atmosphere just aren't interesting enough or their own to give Eels the benefit of the doubt. And, when they're dropping lines like, ""You say a lot of funny things, my little bunny,"" just to get a rhyme for the chorus, things take a turn from the underachieving to the just-plain-sad. I don't want to dwell on the negative (even though the VH1-approved 'sophistication' of ""Woman Driving, Man Sleeping,"" and the fake punk of ""What Is This Note"" do their best to force me to). Eels car occasionally turn out a nice tune-- exhibit A is the squeaky clear ""Fresh Feeling,"" with its tasteful orchestration and (this is important) strong melody. It probably won't win them any indie points, as it's closer to an Alanis-style ballad-with-a-beat than to NMH, but it might conceivably have a life beyond this record via adult-contemporary radio. Exhibit B is the surprisingly potent one-two punch of ""World of Shit"" and ""Souljacker, Part II."" The former takes some melodramatic piano lines, subtle productions tricks like bells playing backwards and nice string lines, and manages to overcome some seriously unfortunate lyrical choices (""Let's get married, and make some people""). This leads into the latter track, a short, dreamy tune featuring mellotron and actual lo-fi ambience! Well, I suppose that could have been injected in there to appeal to the, you know, underachieving indie crowd or something, but it sounds okay. The point is, even when the results are middling, at least Eels never sink into lame radio-rock clich√©s. Ultimately, though, I'm left with the feeling that a band that displays a fine grasp of orchestral pop and baroque studio flourishes on some tracks should be delivering something better than Souljacker. It could be that since most of the songs don't have great melodies (and supplant them with odd, fluffy lyrics), any attempt to juice them up with lightly eclectic production was doomed from the start. Then again, if you're going to show everyone your cards and demonstrate that you can come up with good melodies and neat production, it seems a waste not to capitalize on it for the whole ride. As it stands, Eels are still in the middle of the pack for underachievers-- I'll take Prince's last album over this one.","Beyond the melodies that don't stick in my head and the beats that\r\n\ don't make me ...

Creatures,Elf Power,by: David M.

Dismissed 'em as second-generation Georgia retro-pop-- well-executed but by-the-numbers 70s psych-rock with a bunch of chord changes snatched outta Lou Reed's ass pocket. But one day, I came around to these small-town, tousle-headed geeks. Seemed the closer I listened, the more I became aware of the subtle differences that came with the hints of Middle Eastern melody, the quick bits of slide guitar, the occasional accordian or flute or organ, and the sporadic bursts of feedback scattered sparsely through albums like The Winter Is Coming and A Dream in Sound. Sure, the songs were simple and even a bit derivative, but there was enough unique flavor to each one to keep things interesting, while still definable within the vague boundaries of rock music. They were no longer just normal pop songs-- they were dark pop songs, cold pop songs, desolate pop songs. The moods matched the subtle changes in timbre which were both unexpected and stunning. But now these Elf Power kids got a new album, and though I hate to say it, I might as well be frank: it sorta sucks. Yeah, it's still got those fuzzy and jangly guitars. And yeah, there's still gentle vocals about goofy shit-- monsters and creatures and all that, but there's nothing that actually steps forward or makes an attempt to stick out. Tracks like ""Let the Serpent Sleep"" are built around strikingly familiar melodies (in the case of the title cut, one of their own); ""Visions of the Sea"" sounds like a sped-up version of R.E.M.'s ""Sweetness Follows."" ""Everlasting Scream"" is distorted twee-vocals over Ramones-inspired (though to say ""inspired"" might be stretching it) three-chord rock. There are a ton of acoustic guitar-based tracks that drift right on by-- like they aren't even there!-- despite the attempts by a cello on ""The Modern Mind,"" a twangy steel-pedal guitar on ""The Creature,"" and violin practically everywhere else. Problem is, where Elf Power previously made every extra instrument sound like an essential part of their songs, here, these things just sound like last-minute additions aimed at making one song sound remotely different from the next. Maybe I shouldn't be so tough on the guys. After all, I know what rejection feels like, and Elf Power's been through a few tough breaks of their own lately-- what with bigshot producer Dave Fridmann moving on to greener pastures with Mogwai and former member Bryan Poole leaving the band to rock out with the drummer of Jucifer. Maybe that's why the new album sounds so faint and distant, and why this new Elf Power seems only a shadow of their former selves. But sympathy or no, these guys just aren't nailing it on Creatures. Elf Power always stood out as one of the few Elephant 6 bands capable of pulling off the Phil Spector-on-a-budget thing. And they didn't even have to make it their trademark! Instead, they'd employ the technique sparingly, and even manage it with subtlety and respect for the song's basic structure. These days, they don't even try, whether that's from some misguided stab at so-called maturity, or just overconfidence in their formula. Creatures sees a band trying desperately to hang on to a sound that's clearly gone-- kidding themselves into thinking the same old routines will still work, sans Bryan. It's a sham, miserable and obvious. The group's remaining members need to wake up, to reevaluate, to cease living in the past, to change, to adapt, to allow themselves to become something different. Otherwise, they're just another little indie band in a sea of little indie bands, and though that might sound cute on paper, it's not.","Was a time I didn't think much of Elf Power.

Finally We Are No One,M√∫m,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c40feb335119a49ed86c/1:1/w_160/d75f0475.gif,2002-05-20 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5505-finally-we-are-no-one/,Fat Cat,"The buzz around M√∫m began early in 2001, and the word on the street was that another Icelandic band was making music as pretty and epic as Sigur R√≥s. Those tuning into the hype were surprised when they finally heard Yesterday Was Dramatic, Today Is Okay. On their debut album, M√∫m sounded like a melodic laptop outfit with a curiosity about acoustic instruments. Nothing about the record suggested the word ""band."" Sure, there were some ""la-la"" vocals here and there, a good amount of accordion and the occasional guitar, but Bogdar Raczynski's last record had all those qualities in equal measure and he never lost his IDM identity. However M√∫m were presented, there was no mistaking the quality of the music. With their second full-length album Finally We Are No One, M√∫m definitely sounds like a 'band', in the traditional sense of the word. Almost half the tracks feature proper vocals singing songs; the horns, strings and accordion are even more evident; and the modular synthesizer patches have been relegated to the background. The band continues to build its rhythmic foundation around glitch-inspired beats, but the sound surrounding the clicks and pops is more conventionally musical. How you feel about this new development will depend on which path you hoped M√∫m would follow. If the marching voices that emerged at the tail end of ""There Is a Small Number of Things"" were what moved you, then you'll find Finally We Are No One very much to your liking. If, on the other hand, you found the sprightly beat programming and warm synth chords of ""I'm 9 Today"" and ""Awake on a Train"" to be the foundation of what made Yesterday Was Dramatic so great, you'll find yourself enjoying this one a little less. To my ears, the closer M√∫m gets to conventional song structures, the less appealing the band is. At its heart, M√∫m is not bestowed with the gift of melody, and too many of the tunes here come across as simplistic and trite. ""We Have a Map of the Piano"" has the same lead line as the familiar keyboard exercise ""Heart and Soul"" (I'm not suggesting they stole the melody-- I doubt the band has even heard it-- but I can't think of anything else when I listen to this track). While it adds to the innocent cast of the tune, it does little to encourage repeat plays. ""Don't Be Afraid, You Have Just Got Your Eyes Closed"" and the first half of ""K/Half Noise"" are similarly powered by the kind of inane four-note melody a toddler might dream up. With all that out of the way, the fact remains that this is still a good album, if not a great one. Despite containing a few tunes that grate with their simple-minded sweetness, a handful of others are excellent. Released earlier as a single, ""Green Grass of Tunnel"" is far and away their best stab at conventional songwriting, with a whimsical melody appropriate to the music-box backing and a nice mix of organ, accordions, and strings. The title track, an instrumental, also displays a sense of balance, as it moves from dark, crunching sounds in its first third to a nice melody doubled on violin and trumpet, before returning to its murky resting place amid gurgles of distortion at the end. The lengthy closer ""The Land Between Solar Systems"" is pretty great, building from near silence to a low-grade fever pitch, unfolding like an epic Quickspace tune in extreme slow motion. I understand that the child's-view angle is a large part of M√∫m's appeal, and I don't mean to discount this approach to music-- as a devoted fan of Nobukazu Takemura, I'd be a hypocrite to argue against it. But something's missing from M√∫m's relentless pursuit of beauty and innocence: a sense of struggle. They're almost too good at making simple, pretty music at this point, and the tracks content to pursue these qualities alone come across as fluffy. With the digital aspect of the sound played down in favor of uncomplicated acoustic melodies, M√∫m seems just a bit less substantial.","The buzz around M\xFAm began early in 2001, and the word on the street\r\n\ was that another ...

In The Afternoon,L'Altra,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc82abf31b7dc7155d2e/1:1/w_160/af5159dd.jpg,2002-05-20 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4651-in-the-afternoon/,Aesthetics,"It seems like the Chicago scene's reach gets bigger every time I turn around. Since the early 90s, when bands like Shrimp Boat and the Coctails began to make their marks, the Chicago underground has grown by leaps and bounds to become one of the largest, most prolific and inbred indie scenes in the world. It's even begun to absorb bands and personnel from other Midwestern metropolises like Louisville and St. Louis, extending absorptive psuedopods outward like some giant metropolitan amoeba. And, of course, when these guys aren't recording or touring with their own bands, they're playing on their friends' albums left and right, leaving a string of credits a mile long behind each of the scene's main constituents. Suffice to say that Six Degrees of Fred Lonberg-Holm isn't a very hard game. Hell, he's even on this L'altra disc that I'm writing about right now, along with a few other Chicago scenesters you might recognize, like Charles Kim and Robert Cruz. And then there's the fact that L'altra shares member Eben English with fellow Chicagoans Del Rey. Naturally, the real reason guys like Longberg-Holm get called to play on so many albums is simply that they're amazing musicians, and selfless ones at that. On the occasions that you can hear his familiar cello on In the Afternoon, he plays flawlessly, never making for the spotlight and stepping aside for the quartet's full-time members. The only problem with this is that the band doesn't seem especially comfortable there, and as a result the album is a bit lacking in conviction. Though L'altra's penchant for musical understatement is quite appealing, the humility of the vocals doesn't serve them as well. The male/female interplay of Joe Costa and Lindsay Anderson is effective to a point, but they're good enough singers that they could easily make each song more memorable by merely projecting more and attacking the already good melodies with more vigor and enthusiasm. I won't dwell on this too much, as it's likely a concern that many listeners won't have, but for me, it's the biggest reason L'altra's third album doesn't stick especially well. That said, the band do manage to conjure an alluring atmosphere for most of In the Afternoon, creating a series of rich musical tapestries to back their lazily delivered vocal musings. ""Traffic"" opens with a wash of aquatic keyboards and finishes wrapped in a veil of swelling guitars. Those guitars stick around for ""Ways Out,"" coloring in the song's dark corners until being overtaken by vibes and violin halfway through. It's the subtle touches like that that really make In the Afternoon worth listening to. Otherwise, the album is basically just a pleasant, atmospheric diversion. The band nudges the tempo forward a bit on ""Black Arrow"" and ""Broken Mouths,"" which features a striking, classically bound piano part that manages to dominate everything but the drums. In fact, drummer Ken Dyber (also the owner of Aesthetics Records) is frequently the element that keeps everything interesting, lending steady momentum to even the most ambling moments. The album ends with ""Goodbye Music,"" a stirring instrumental lullaby that closes the proceedings on a high note. Lonberg-Holm's cello rides low beneath Anderson's piano, framed by washes of mallet-struck cymbals and violin counterpoint. If the production were more prominent on more of the band's songs, they could have something really fantastic on their hands. As it is, L'altra is a band with obvious strengths and talent that ought to be more confident in displaying them.","It seems like the Chicago scene's reach gets bigger every time I turn around.

Placement Issues,Sybarite,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a618b1335d7bf1698d55/1:1/w_160/a9d72044.gif,2002-05-20 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7677-placement-issues/,Temporary Residence,"Xian Hawkins (aka Sybarite), formerly of the Silver Apples, makes music that works well in the background. He takes electronic production techniques (a loop here, a glitch there), splices in a healthy mix of acoustic instrumentation (guitar, piano, some light strings), and takes most of the edge off in the mix. That Hawkins plays it cool isn't a criticism, though. In fact, if you go by the praise of recent releases by Boards of Canada or Fennesz, it might very well be a recommendation. If only Placement Issues were as consistently interesting as the music of those artists, I could extend that praise to Sybarite. Placement Issues is actually a collection of all of Sybarite's singles to this point, taken from various EPs (1999's Meusic and 2000's Otonomy) and seven-inch releases. Conventional logic says that singles collections don't hold up as albums in the same way as proper LPs, but Sybarite shoots down this wisdom with his consistency in production and the fact that many of his tunes share similar moods. It's not that all of his music sounds the same, though you'd be forgiven for not picking up on the fact not all of the tunes were recorded at the same time, for the same project. Many of these tracks would fit perfectly into a film: ""Second Cities,"" with that patented Boards of Canada smooth groove and light acoustic guitar, might figure prominently into a pensive midnight driving scene around downtown Los Angeles. ""Otonomy"" retains the pensive mood and guitar, but subdues the atmosphere for a misty nostalgia. Sybarite's apparent fondness for consonance and rounded edges may put off those looking for something more tart, though his knack for melody and efficient arrangements is impressive enough that, at its best, this music works well beyond any cinematic backdrop. ""Square One"" is a particularly engaging example of how relatively traditional sound design and minimal harmonic coloring can be used to great effect. The high-pitched, stuttering rhythm (something like a stopwatch accompanied by a triangle) underscores a repetitive, mournful guitar figure, while various subtle glitches work their way in and out of the mix. As good soundtrack music doesn't distract from the images onscreen, it's not hard to picture this bit of finery supporting a vigorous session of daydreaming. Not everything works as well in a supportive function: ""Unforced Force of the Truth"" features an up-tempo, shuffling beat, distorted just enough to stand out on an album full of airtight programming. The slightly angular guitar line (which wouldn't sound out of place on a Tortoise record) is joined by moderately searing synth and a discordant whistling chord floating over the electronic ensemble. ""The Sweep"" is smooth enough, except for the omnipresent, static-y effect that fills in every empty space in the tune. The analog drum machine pulse reminds me of early Mouse on Mars, though the noise quotient is more along the lines of Fennesz. And if the looped guitars that open ""Without Engagement"" sound a little too similar to those that open ""Engaged,"" well, they should-- they're the same guitars. The pitfall in records like Placement Issues is not in the individual moments, but rather in the difficulty of keeping the moments distinct as you listen to the entire record. After an hour or so of atmospheric synthesizers and smooth beats, my ears start to wilt a bit, though I'm sure any one of these tunes could hit the spot under the right circumstances. Sybarite's got a knack for nailing the moment, and if you don't mind the fact many of the moments share moods, Placement Issues works.","Xian Hawkins (aka Sybarite), formerly of the Silver Apples, makes music that works well in the background.

18,Moby,by: David M.

Back in the mid-90s, when it seemed safe to assume he was about as popular as he was likely to get, Richard Melville Hall followed up his mostly Eurodance-inspired Everything Is Wrong with a grunge record, then followed that with a disc of film scores and a full-on ambient record under the bastard alias Voodoo Child. So when Play dropped back in '99, the oddly infectious mix of scratchy old blues recordings, MIDI keyboards and programmed drums seemed like an intriguing development in Moby's sound-- but no one dared assume it would become his sound. Anyone living within ten miles of a TV or radio pretty much knows the story from here. Idealistic hipster trades actual idealism for the 2-D MTV version that-- it turns out-- pays a helluva lot better, inadvertently scores two-thirds of commercials produced in the following three years, and oh yeah, there's that whole international superstar thing. If the threat of never achieving massive superstardom never frightened Moby into fitting his music into a mold, then the actual attainment of superstar status has. As a follow-up, 18 plays it safer than a quadruple-condomed fundamentalist Christian at an abstinence rally. So, yes, in case you were wondering, 18 does sound a lot like Play-- almost song-for-song, in fact. But any manager can tell you that the best way to achieve commercial success is to Stick With What Works. Here, Moby shows us why he's a star and not a starmaker-- by actually sampling from the same sources! Couldn't get enough of that chanteuse shrouded in tape hiss who sings, ""Ooh Lordy, troubles so hard,"" on that Pentium III commercial? Well, here's another one just like her, singing, ""Lordy, don't leave me all by myself."" See? Different. For ""In My Heart,"" Moby sets a crackly old gospel singer against piano lines that way too closely recall the ones on ""God Moving Over the Face of the Waters"" (which, by the way, was already a mere variation on a Philip Glass piece). There's plenty more to dislike about 18, like the monotonous thumps of already-dated drum machines, the painfully repetitive nature of so many of these sounds, or the simplistic keyboard noodling in the background of half these songs. Or inconsequential lyrics like those in the opening track (""People may come together/ And people may fall apart/ No one can stop us now/ 'Cause we are all made of stars""), or those that serve as the refrain to ""Extreme Ways"" (""Oh baby, oh baby, then it fell apart, it fell apart""). But we're veering dangerously close into the realm of personal taste, and I see no reason to reduce my argument to aesthetics, when I know that tons of people get off on this kind of cheese. But there's plenty of stuff wrong with 18 that's much harder to debate-- stuff that has nothing whatsoever to do with my personal likes and dislikes. For one, 18 is such a blatantly commercial affair I can't help but feel pandered to. Any pretext of cohesiveness is crushed under the heel of A&R;'s blatant attempts to sell this album to as many demographics as humanly possible. There's an indie rock song (""Great Escape,"" featuring would-be scenesters Azure Ray doing their best Mimi-from-Low impression), a hip-hop song (""Jam for the Ladies,"" featuring Angie Stone and MC Lyte), and, worst of all, a weepy adult contemporary-friendly slow jam featuring none other than Sinead O'Connor (actual so-sappy-I-fell-off-my-chair-and-broke-my-tailbone-laughing lyric: ""The sadness flows like water and washes down the heartache""). Those songs that aren't graced by guest appearances all sound crafted from the same mold-- Play-style sampled blues and gospel set to the same sort of cornily uplifting ambient soundscapes and basic keyboard noodlery Moby's been mucking around with for years-- though it sounds less inspired now than ever. For an album three years in the making, 18 sure does sound like it was tossed together at the last minute. It would seem Moby's artistic growth has been stunted by his suddenly packed social schedule. One gets the feeling from the songs on 18 that Moby's more interested in introducing music videos and being unfunny with Winona Ryder on Saturday Night Live than he is in making music. The only thing that differs from Moby's former work here are the liner notes. Before Play, Moby had earned a reputation for the well-crafted, often persuasive essays he included with each album. He damned cultural conservatism, cigarettes, celebrity and fundamentalism, while promoting an agenda of conservation, vegetarianism, and animal and prisoner rights. 18 has merely two essays: one about the difficulty of writing essays and the process of creating the album at hand, the other politely suggesting that everybody be nice to each other. Can someone please explain to me why, in a time when Moby's voice is louder than ever, and when cultural conservatism and fundamentalist dogma aims to destroy what few freedoms we as a nation have left, Moby would choose to back down? Maybe MTV built an android Moby with the remarkable ability to look cute in Pumas and to pilfer through the real Moby's back catalog and rearrange samples. It seems farfetched, but I'd rather suspend some disbelief than deal with the knowledge than such an idealistic guy could be so easily corrupted by the system he once seemed to fight against. Everything is wrong, indeed.","Say what you will about Moby, but the guy's always been good for throwing his audience a left-handed curveball ...

Moon Money Moon EP,Retsin,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a264ea9e61561daa4a2a/1:1/w_160/097c4b70.gif,2002-05-19 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6768-moon-money-moon-ep/,Acuarela,"Have the Indigo Girls broken up yet? I have a feeling they have, but I have to admit I haven't been following the trials and tribulations of Decatur, Georgia's finest girly-folk duo too closely. Either way, Tara Jane O'Neil and Cynthia Nelson-- better known as Retsin-- seem intent on taking over where Swamp Ophelia left off. With this five-song EP, the duo smooth out the experimental eccentricities that characterized their privious work, and offer up a surprisingly bland dose of Lilith fare. The sonic depth of O'Neil's work with Rodan and the Sonora Pine-- which always seemed to spice up Retsin's lo-fi confessional singer-songwriter style-- is likewise nowhere to be found here. Even the lyrical conundrums, which at the very least kept things somewhat interesting, are traded for forgettable faux-witticisms delivered in a smarmy, sing-songy manner that would befit a Lisa Loeb album. ""Pauline and Susie"" is the clear standout on this modest little collection. Presumably a tale of escaping to some relative's house during a breakdown, the song's repetitive riff comes off a little too cutesy, especially accompanying lines like, ""This time I said yes to sedation, oh yes,"" but at least it's memorable. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the rest of the songs here. They seem feeble, meandering, and unfocused by comparison. Opener ""Duck Out,"" even with clunky and embarrassing lines like, ""Duck out to where we're from...there's no sex in my face,"" wouldn't be half bad if there was some kind of interesting musical accompaniment. Then there's the completely dispassionate and forgettable instrumental ""The Moon Fickle,"" which suffers a similar handicap. ""Money Song,"" a quite banjo and acoustic guitar rambler, presumably about the tedium of work, while not bad or annoying, has little to distinguish it either lyrically or musically. Okay, okay, so this is just a between-albums effort, and maybe not indicative of the duo's future direction. Maybe I'm being a little harsh, but hey-- you've got to address this kind of shit before it gets out of hand. Sometimes, an EP like this can provide a representative introduction to a band or artist, but if you're looking for a good cheap place to start with Retsin, Moon Money Moon is definitely not it.","Have the Indigo Girls broken up yet?

Sarah Shannon,Sarah Shannon,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3bd5e6ef959693206eb/1:1/w_160/bd16f400.jpg,2002-05-19 05:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7097-sarah-shannon/,Casa,"I'd like to ask for a temporary reprieve from orchestral pop. The jazzy vocals, smooth horn arrangements, and bursts of cheery strings were a welcome respite from crunchy guitar, back when the downtown hipsters developed ironic attachments to Burt Bacharach and learned to mix martinis. The lounge craze of the mid-90s was all about kitsch and secondhand space-age dinnerware. Maybe you liked the music, maybe you actually owned a CD, but the only place you ever listened to it was while vintage shopping or appropriating the mannerisms of middle-aged swingers circa 1965 at your lowbrow cocktail hour. Orchestral pop was resuscitated right about the time Burt Bacharach records were rescued from thrift-store record rack graves and their creator lauded as a genius and inspiration to people who, two years before, would have scoffed at the mention of his name. Jazzed-up orchestral pop became the form of choice for one-time rock-and-rollers, save for the ever-popular acoustic, confessional folk. Which brings us to Sarah Shannon. Her old band, Velocity Girl, once post-grunge Sub Pop's biggest seller, got a considerable amount of attention in the early/mid-90s before breaking up and disappearing from the radar entirely sometime in 1996. Being the only girl in an otherwise male band is never easy. Some regarded the Shannon as little more than a pretty face, a charismatic frontwoman to deck the cover of Alternative Press and represent the ideal woman for smitten indie-rock boys. By 1997, when Velocity Girl's once ubiquitous Simpatico! had become $1.99 bin fodder, Sarah Shannon found a terrific opportunity to reinvent herself, first through the short-lived Starry Eyes, and then as a solo artist, releasing one EP on her own Marzipan Records. Shannon's self-titled release is produced and co-written by Blake Wescott of Pedro the Lion, but don't let that fool you-- there's little evidence of mopey folk or Christian theology on this album. There are, however, a lot of horns and tons of backing vocals. This is not a casual nod toward Bacharach, but a full-on embrace. And I guess there's nothing wrong with that. But the lush arrangements, coupled with Shannon's pretty, pitch-perfect vocals and polite lyrics are a little too well-behaved for my taste. The balmy ""I'll Run Away,"" is true easy listening, without moments of sonic deconstruction or ironic distance. Sure, the piano is lovely, and the flugelhorn solos will certainly evoke the pastel-tinted, bubble machine theatrics of all your favorite soft-rock radio acts, but folks, last time I heard sounds this smooth I was on hold. The bluesy ""That's Mine"" grants the listener a temporary reprieve, as one of the only songs on the album with at least a tenuous relationship to rock n' roll. It gives Shannon a chance to cut loose, ditch her Starlite Lounge persona and summon a bit of emotion. Sadly, she still falls short, but at least it's a good effort. The album's true high point comes with ""Live Life Alone,"" which sounds like a little-known Gershwin standard. It's a beautiful song, and the arrangement is so dead-on I was temporarily lulled into a kind of romantic trance. Shannon's vocals actually recall Ella Fitzgerald. She hits the high notes like a champ, and I'm inclined to advise her to find a great jazz band, or take up musical theater (she has that kind of voice). Which creates a problem-- ""Live Life Alone"" could ground a whole album of similarly toned material, or even standards. There's nothing wrong with being eclectic, but Shannon quickly pulls the listener out of the reverie and into a couple more prototypical chamber-pop songs. The jangly ""Are You Far Enough"" could be a Velocity Girl song (though with less punch); the early 70s swing of ""Can't You See"" (the album's final track) is tepid, at best. So here's the risk. You release an album with one really outstanding song, ideally suited to your talents as a vocalist. Your audience may be so blown away by your performance of that one track that they revise their prior opinions of your artistic strengths. You have a diva moment. It's cool, but the rest of your material sounds like you phoned in your vocals, schlepped out some lyrics, and hoped the liberal use of flugelhorn would conceal your ambivalence to the rest of the material. I feel sorta bad for Sarah Shannon. On this album, she reveals what she should have been doing all along. And it's not this earnest Debby Boone shit-- I'm thinking Shannon could do a mean take on the Cole Porter songbook. Until then, I'll wait patiently for the Bacharach regurgitations to end.","I'd like to ask for a temporary reprieve from orchestral pop. The jazzy vocals, smooth horn arrangements, and bursts ...

The Oak in the Ashes,Amps for Christ,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a08c9d034d5c69bf2749/1:1/w_160/aa4eac30.gif,2002-05-19 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/173-the-oak-in-the-ashes/,Shrimper,"This, my friends, is what DIY recording is all about. Amps for Christ mainman Henry Barnes makes music too out of step, too varied and too fucked up for anyone to front him the money for serious studio time. It's never going to happen. But instead of becoming bitter and frustrated, he records his music carefully and cheaply and releases it on labels like Shrimper-- imprints unconcerned with image, fashion or sales. This process gives him the opportunity to realize his wide-ranging vision of machine-damaged folk music. The Oak in the Ashes feels like a yellowed artifact from a parallel world, one where Celtic drones, beat poetry, African percussion, Persian ballads, classic-rock guitar solos, power tools and free jazz all find equal footing. I like this place. The 23 tracks on The Oak in the Ashes are carefully selected and sequenced so that no single style of music ever becomes too prevalent, and listener fatigue never sets in. ""She's With Me"" and ""Give/Leave"" are both lovely folk songs in the British style, combining plucked acoustic guitar, fiddle and spare use of feedback, the latter even adding just a bit of Lynyrd Skynyrd to the mix. The anthemic guitar instrumental ""Scotland the Brave/Ditches"" has Barnes tuning his Les Paul like a bagpipe and running it through the distortion pedal. ""Nese 1"" and ""Nese 2"" are both Middle Eastern folk songs, with Tara Tikki Tavi offering vocals in (I believe) Persian, accompanied by Barnes' acoustic guitars and assorted percussion. The iffy tracks on The Oak in the Ashes are confined to the spoken word pieces, most of which find Barnes reciting Ginsberg-inspired poetry about the environment over a drumbeat. The words aren't particularly embarrassing, they just add little to the overall thrust of the album. Fortunately, these pieces are short interludes of a minute or less, so their presence is never terribly distracting. And it's well worth sitting through these to hear the unusual textures Barnes wrings out of his various homemade instruments on ""She Saw"" and ""Scotland the Brave/Cheeks"" (a reprise of the drone melody of ""Scotland the Brave/Ditches"" translated to some wheezing keyboard instrument). The live and crudely recorded ""Mission Accomplished"" begins with somebody tuning up a power drill and then the machine competes in a furious duet with a Coltrane-inspired sax on a tune that would fit right in on Crescent. The screams from the players as the track fades out attests to their enthusiasm. The eight-minute ""Prepared Hammond for 5 Hands"" closes the album with a blast of the kind of noisy ""power electronics"" Barnes contributes to Eric Wood's Bastard Noise project, a dense amalgamation of machine skree and analog electronics that manages to remain just this side of annoying. It's a fitting end to this document of one man's inspiring vision. Most everyone will love and hate at least one track here, but I'm glad to know that we're living in an age when a record this weird and all over the place is only a click or two away.","This, my friends, is what DIY recording is all about.

10 Seconds,Jel,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9e25e6ef95969322a87/1:1/w_160/b33505ca.jpg,2002-05-16 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4232-10-seconds/,Mush,"Underground producer Jel's instrumental hip-hop opus 10 Seconds is the underground analogue to a producer's album a la N.E.R.D. except with fewer vocals, and far less studio polish. Like the Neptunes, Jel is a high-demand fellow, a bedrock for that shapeless mass of Anticon MCs. With this album, though, Jel bucks innovation and gives a hefty, rustic shout-out to producers of yore. And what easier way to pay one's respects than to use their equipment? The concept on 10 Seconds revolves around a sampler: the classic E-Mu Systems SP-1200. The title refers to the limited sampling time of the SP-1200 (every cut had to be 10 seconds or less-- usually less), precluding most P. Diddy-style ""whole song"" ripoffs. Limited sampling time was one feature that lent to the SP's distinctive sound. The other was the SP-1200's low-tech construction: limited by 12-bits of sampling power, SP beats were uniformly dank, dirty and rough-hewn-- a grittiness that appealed to producers looking for a little more snarl in their funk. The cast of SP disciples who fell in love with the machine is illustrious: Mantronix, Marley Marl, Large Professor, Ced Gee, the Bomb Squad and the Beastie Boys, just to name a few. Given the aforementioned lineup of hip-hop all-stars, making an album in tribute to their equipment could be disastrous. At its worst, it would approximate handing B.B. King's ""Lucille"" to Extreme's Nuno Bettencourt. Or giving Van Halen's mic to Extreme's Gary Cherone. Or really, just about anything involving decent music exchanged with elements of the instrument-endorsing blowhards responsible for ""More Than Words."" Luckily, Jel manages to avoid such ignominy. Rather, he does a nice job, tweaking some authentic growl out of the SP, and adding some flavor of his own. Jel never departs from funky beats-- no matter what the sample or mood, the beat remains, and it's usually fairly straightforward, using standard funk basslines and hyper-syncopated drumbeats. On the other hand, they can also be quite stagnant-- rarely do you hear many rhythm changes or interludes. Instead, most of the flavor comes from authentic samples, scratches, and drums. As a result, the consistent patterns can wear a little thin. A good example is ""Channel Assign,"" which vamps on a reverbed two-chord organ riff while a nice, hollow-sounding drum beat pumps underneath. The beat is fresh, but the track clocks in at about four minutes, with little other than the organ riff dropping in and out to keep it interesting. ""Special,"" on the other hand, is the record's highlight. It includes Jel's finest sample work, grounding the beat in a Bob Marley groove, while adding some ambient crowd noise, what sounds like an electric oboe, and the requisite scratched-up old-skool MC verse. Although 10 Seconds doesn't break much new ground, it is a good disc, true to Jel's concept and very listenable. Like most of the SP's work-product, 10 Seconds sounds like old, undiscovered vinyl-- with plenty of funk, crackle, and pop.","Underground producer Jel's instrumental hip-hop opus 10 Seconds is the underground analogue to a producer's album a la ...

Or You Could Just Go Through Your Whole Life and Be Happy Anyway,Various Artists,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fe113d197565213824c/1:1/w_160/9e424659.jpg,2002-05-16 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7-or-you-could-just-go-through-your-whole-life-and-be-happy-anyway/,Darla,"Funny what gets tagged for popular comebacks these days-- post-punk and electro are the two flavors experiencing the strongest resurgence right now. Shoegazers have been pining for a new My Bloody Valentine album for the last ten years, even though the sound has never really gone away. Post-punk and electro come from roughly the same late-70s to early-80s time frame, so maybe shoegazer needs the crit-mandated two-decade span to rally behind a Loveless for the next generation. In the meantime, labels like Clairecords and Darla have been releasing a steady stream of paeans to pop noise. Darla's Bliss Out series, in particular, has been a vehicle for some high-quality excursions in fuzzy ambience. ...Or You Could Just Go Through Your Whole Life and Be Happy Anyway, the eighteenth volume of Bliss Out, is an essential release in the series, and it conjures all the appropriate environments: a wintry atmosphere, snow softly falling, the scene mirrored in the water as you watch from the lakeside hearth of your home. As Aarktica, Jon De Rosa programs melancholy dream-pop infused with layers of strings and shifting electronic beats. He's studied composition at NYU with Kenneth Valitsky, a former student of Stockhausen, and now does graduate work in the psychology of music. De Rosa's structural skills are reflected in these seven tracks, which play out with orchestral swells and symphonic attention to tone, but never come across as ornate or stuffy. The production blurs the elements together, touching on the dullness of the hibernal season, instead of just the glitter of the holidays. ""Aura Lee"" builds from thrummed guitars and the pristine whish of a drum machine's hi-hat into one constant, rolling crescendo of timpani rumbling and backing vocals from Mahogany's Lorraine Lelis. De Rosa's got the voice you'd expect, soft and breathy-- somewhere between a sigh and a moan. His lyrics invite intimacy: ""In winter time, to keep us warm/ I'll show you how the snow can harbor us from harm/ Trust will grow in blinding cold/ Double footsteps line the path toward growing old."" The chorus, ""sing to me, Aura Lee,"" would turn the title into a pun if the song wasn't so transcendent-- the ethereal romanticism is like an alternate-universe twist on ""Manic Depression,"" in which the artist can finally caress and kiss the music. These surreal moments of aural contact occur throughout: ""You're Landlocked, My Love"" traps you in a field of constantly shifting beats flickering violently between stereo channels. De Rosa's pulled an impressive trick here, placing what is essentially a folk ballad down amongst the electric mayhem. At the end even his own slow tone poem gets caught in the whirling textures, fading into a foghorn's groan, then cut up and pasted in abrupt, jarring passages. On the other bank, ""Happy Again"" finds you laid back against the shore and lazily tossing stones into a glassy pond. Each sublime guitar peal ripples outwards, echoing until time lapses, while the ebbing feedback drones on. After the ambient stretches, De Rosa caps off the record in a more pop direction. ""Nostalgia = Distortion"" sets up a downtempo groove as De Rosa sings, ""I can watch you for hours fishing your skull."" You barely notice the transition to its companion piece, ""The Hook, the Reel, and the Pull,"" four minutes of Cure'd reverb. The handclaps and the bell tolling on ""Song for a Free Williamsburg"" seem absurd at first, but the dance vibe moves even further towards delicious darkwave. De Rosa's vocals melt into different shades as the beats multiply. The progressions in these forty-one minutes remind me of the Flying Saucer Attack songs that Matt Elliott worked on, as well as Amp's organic textures. The consistency of the music here creates a world unto its own. It'll churn in any season, like a snow globe.","Funny what gets tagged for popular comebacks these days-- post-punk and electro are the two flavors experiencing the strongest resurgence ...

Protest a Dark Anniversary,Masters of the Hemisphere,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3d05e6ef959693238f9/1:1/w_160/bc2164f1.jpg,2002-05-16 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5138-protest-a-dark-anniversary/,Kindercore,"I should start by apologizing to Masters of the Hemisphere, as they hit the top of my review pile about a year too late. There was a time when I was crazy in the coconut for the kind of sky-blue sundress pop the band peddles, scooping up anything with the serpentine Elephant 6 logo or by a band whose name could have been lifted from the lyrics to ""Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite."" At their best, these acts seemed to tap into the unrealized potential of late 60s sing-along psychedelia, and the possibilities seemed endless. Well, endless ain't what it used to be, and unless I'm just getting cynical (a reasonable possibility) anything the Beach Boys and Beatles didn't get a chance to say may now have been officially said. Elephant 6 is in shambles: Olivia Tremor Control has split into two inferior entities; Apples in Stereo has attained their lifelong goal of becoming cartoons; Jeff Mangum is a drug casualty with follow-up fear. But that doesn't matter to labels like Kindercore who continue pumping out competent but unexceptional collections of catchy, sunny tunes. Take Protest a Dark Anniversary, for example, an album that's far from terrible, even fairly enjoyable at times, but an album with absolutely nothing to separate it from the rest of the worker ants in the pop music colony. This appraisal is supported by the number of ""element x sounds like band y"" statements I can construct from the eleven songs within, in time-honored lazy critic fashion. For example, singer Sean Rawls sounds a heckuva lot like Matthew Sweet with a weaker high range, while other singer Brendan Mead could be Kevin Barnes on a low-sugar diet. The flute solo of ""Anything, Anything"" is reminiscent of the Essex Green, and the brass section of ""Take Time"" harvests the same thin, reedy sound of Elf Power hornwork. And so on. If you're keeping score at home, you'll notice that all the above influences are themselves artists proudly sporting late 60s sensibilities, suggesting (correctly) that Masters of the Hemisphere are a further dilution of the original inspirations. Despite the cocky name and intriguingly mysterious album title, the quartet's mood rarely varies from starry-eyed romanticism-- to paraphrase Phillip Seymour Hoffman impersonating Lester Bangs, there's absolutely nothing controversial about them. We're talking irritatingly gauzy songs about girls named Diane and Jenny, a song in waltz time about waltzing (""Sailboat Kite""), and positive-thinking slogans like ""Everybody's writing songs/ In hopes that you might sing along."" But I'll reiterate that MOTH (cool acronym, at least) have a knack for melody, even if the songs stick about as well as secondhand scotch tape. In the battle of the two frontmen, Mead's songs tend to stand out, if only because he's not afraid to use a couple minor chords on ""Rules of Life"" and ""Local Government."" ""In the Morning"" lingers amongst the short-term memory centers a little longer, thanks to a jumpy bass line that almost-- almost-- gives the band a little backbone to work with. These occasional ventures into above-average range make me feel a little guilty about using their album as a platform for my State of the Pop World Address, but the fat part of the bell curve majority of Protest a Dark Anniversary models the flaws of the genre all too well. Overly familiar and comfortable staying along the beaten path, it's the kind of record that serves primarily as a comparison point by which truly great, boundary-expanding pop works are judged. Consider it a teaching tool for those looking to start the next tambourines-and-Rickenbacker band: find a fresh and unique element to add to the mix, or face the collective shrug of pedantic hipsters like myself.","I should start by apologizing to Masters of the Hemisphere, as they hit the top of my review pile about ...

Storytelling,Belle and Sebastian,by: Will Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a259b1335d7bf169849a/1:1/w_160/6d1534af.jpg,2002-05-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/629-storytelling/,MatadorJeepster,"Todd Solondz' Storytelling was, by most standards, a disappointing exercise in borderline-intellectual unpleasantry and pretentious indie-filmmaker posturing. Conceived as a three-part anthology centering on the themes of ""Fiction,"" ""Non-Fiction,"" and ""Autobiography,"" the film was stripped of its lengthy third sequence when, depending on who you believe, the segment was determined to be redundant and inferior-- or, excised at the studio's request when they discovered, to their horror, Dawson Creek star James Van Der Beek on the receiving end of simulated anal sex. The completed Storytelling was released earlier this year with an anemic 87-minute running time and a ludicrously censored interracial sex scene (which placed an enormous crimson rectangle not just over the offending areas of adjacent black and white skin, but completely obscuring the actors). Two artists were commissioned by Solondz to score the remaining sections of Storytelling-- Shudder to Think's Nathan Larson and the Cardigans' Nina Persson the ""Fiction"" segment, which concerns a white community-college student's fascination with her black writing-class professor, and Belle & Sebastian the ""Non-Fiction"" segment, about a second-rate filmmaker's attempts to document the life of a completely aimless high school student. The choice of Belle & Sebastian to score a film seemed a coup for Solondz, a tactic which backfired when it was widely reported that most of Belle & Sebastian's score and several original songs written for the movie simply wouldn't be used. The move reportedly incensed both the band and the film's distributor, AOL Time Warner subsidiary New Line Cinema, who were counting on a killer soundtrack to help sell the film. Storytelling, predictably, was a critical and commercial flop, even among those who really wanted to like the film, with many viewing its brevity and heavily censored content as a sorry compromise. Belle & Sebastian's Storytelling is a compromise as well, as this schizoid album is clearly divided by what Belle & Sebastian consider a soundtrack (Breakfast at Tiffany's, The Graduate) and what New Line considers a soundtrack (Pulp Fiction, apparently). Coming in at a tidy 38 minutes, Storytelling is a disorienting hodgepodge of new songs and instrumental score padded with annoying segments of dialogue from the movie. Belle & Sebastian's instrumental score is mostly comprised of variations on a theme, in this case the ambling piano loops and soaring strings of ""Fiction."" It's a pleasant enough melody, revisited thrice on Storytelling: with variations in a minor key on ""Freak,"" with cavernous echo and vibes on ""Night Walk,"" and a more propulsive reading with percussion on ""Fiction (Reprise)."" Different instruments are used to convey particular themes or characters: a majestic horn and gentle undulations of harp mark ""Consuelo""; similar instrumentation explodes into Latin exotica on the Sergio Mendes-flavored ""Consuelo Leaving."" The lonesome, harmonica-driven ""Fuck This Shit"" floats along on a Mancini-inspired river of cheesy 60s strings, despite an unfortunate resemblance to the music in Del Taco's late-night commercials (for those of you in Western states and, for some reason, Maryland). The melody is resurrected on the jazzy ""Mandingo Cliche,"" which is unfortunately marred by dialogue from the film throughout. The six vocal cuts are a grab bag of songs only marginally relevant to the film-- ""Storytelling"" and ""Big John Shaft"" seemingly more about Hollywood and the process of moviemaking than concerning the Solondz film and its shallow conceits. The twee but extremely catchy title track continues in Fold Your Hands, Child's poppy vein with Schroeder-from-Peanuts piano, flute, and horns and Isobel Campbell trading vocals with Stevie Jackson. Slo-mo funk riffs and spacey vibes give ""Big John Shaft"" an infectious, cinematic drive as Stuart Murdoch laments a landscape of frustrated screenwriters and typecast actors: ""I won't play another heavyweight/ I won't play another Big John Shaft."" Jackson's excellent, Spanish-inflected ""Wandering Alone""-- a highlight of Belle & Sebastian's 2001 live shows-- is another standout here, though it seemingly has little connection with the film or the rest of the album. The other three vocal contributions are less successful, with Murdoch's almost a capella ""I Don't Want to Play Football"" barely registering at under 60 seconds. The similarly brief ""Scooby Driver,"" scarcely over a minute long, is much too boisterous and hyperactive for this otherwise low-key, mid-tempo collection. Jackson's fey ""Black and White Unite"" suffers from thin vocals, inexplicable references to hiking and cricket, and juvenile stream-of-consciousness drivel like, ""They're tearing up the street/ I'm half in love with every girl I meet/ The gas man loves the street/ He loves to drill, he loves to think about his girl."" So where to stand on a soundtrack that clearly rises above its source material, yet fails to gel as a cohesive record on its own merit? One wonders why Belle & Sebastian insist on an association with Storytelling at all, rather than parceling out their unused compositions to better films. Fans will still consider this album worth owning, if only for ""Wandering Alone"" and ""Big John Shaft,"" but the lackluster filler and pretty, but generally repetitive, instrumental work make Storytelling little more than a six-cut EP with a dozen bonus tracks. The record is barely longer than a sitcom without the between-tracks dialogue, which gets pretty tiresome after the first listen. However, I don't mind the inclusion of a cheeky dig at Solondz' artistic failure at the tail end of ""Fiction (Reprise)."" ""I'm so, so sorry,"" mutters the filmmaker played by Paul Giamatti to the stoner lampooned in his documentary. ""Don't be,"" comes the reply. ""Your movie's a hit.""","Todd Solondz' Storytelling was, by most standards, a disappointing exercise in borderline-intellectual unpleasantry and pretentious indie-filmmaker posturing.

You'd think that's a bit of a no-brainer for someone like me-- I've been writing music reviews for a year now, own thousands of albums and just completed four years at a music college. But when you're surrounded by something you love, it can be easy to forget just how important it is to you. Absence makes the heart grow fonder, as they say. This past week, I haven't had much of a chance to listen to music. Between finishing up classes, attending graduation, giving time to my visiting family and frantically searching with a friend for an apartment that didn't seem to be materializing, my stereo and I didn't get a whole lot of quality time together. Even now, my computer and stereo are sitting packed in boxes, in limbo at my parents' house, waiting to be moved again. Of course, now that the blur of airports, trains, mortarboards and landlords who never called us back that was this last week is finally over, I've got some time on my hands. So here I am at my parents' computer, finally getting a chance to spend a couple of hours with some new music. My deadline for Pitchfork notwithstanding, it's like Heaven-- and it reminds me of just why music is such a big part of my life. Maybe it's just a coincidence that the CD I'm reviewing now perfectly suits my mood. Slow, beautiful and contemplative, the debut from Charles Kim's Sinister Luck Ensemble couldn't be a more perfect soundtrack for my state of mind if it had been improvised to a video of my brainwaves. Some of you may be familiar with Kim's work with Pinetop Seven-- he was responsible for the instrumental interludes that dotted their albums and played foil to Darren Richard's narratives of warped Americana. Striking out on his own with some of the Midwest's finest players in tow, he makes it clear that his Pinetop Seven contributions were just a tiny glimpse at the landscape of sounds that exist in his head. Anniversary opens with the title track, a brief statement from Rob Mazurek's muted trumpet designed to prick up the goose bumps on your arms, no matter how warm it is. From there, Kim & Co. bring on the night like nobody's business, effortlessly sliding through almost an hour of arresting, nocturnal music. Kim's steel guitar soars over Robert Cruz's accordion and Glenn Kotche's restrained drumming on ""Deep Ellum,"" recalling Friends of Dean Martinez at their most majestic, while it mixes perfectly with Andrew Bird's violin on the effervescent, sepia-toned ""What Holds Them Above."" Kim turns to the melodica for the album's gorgeous closer, ""This Will All Be Yours,"" intertwining his playing with Diana Parmeter's softly moaning cello to great effect. Elsewhere, Ken Vandermark's clarinets battle Kim's reverb-soaked guitars for dominance on ""The Black Pool,"" easily the album's most sonically challenging track. Though much of the music here rests near the line between freedom and structure, this song is one of the few that actually crosses that line, with controlled waves of swelling noise. Possibly the album's finest song, though, is ""Spit in the Well,"" a stirring waltz featuring Andrew Bird's commanding violin and thoughtful counterpoint from Parmeter and double-bassist Kent Kessler. For those of you who're multimedia inclined, Anniversary contains a Quicktime movie for ""Cakewalk,"" prepared by Jeff Economy, whose films with Carolyn Faber provided the basis for half of Califone's Deceleration One. As Mazurek's trumpet blares in the foreground, you're treated to some grainy footage of snow-covered streets, a lighthouse in a storm and a man operating a cement mixer, all sped up in odd contrast with the music. It's hard to slap any kind of label on music like this. Calling it post-rockin'-folk-Americana or some other compound hyphenate could never really do it any type of justice, so let's just say that it's gorgeous, emotional instrumental music that's perfectly tailored for those times after the sunset when you need to bring your blood pressure down a few points. Rest assured, when I finally do get into that new apartment, this disc will be coloring a lot of my nights.","I love music.

Caller: I don't know what it means! Aren't you supposed to help me figure it out? Why the hell else do you exist? Operator 1: Sir, try to calm down. I can hear that you're frustrated. Caller: Of course I'm frustrated! Duh! You would be too! Operator 1: But sir, I didn't call the Crisis Hotline tonight. Let's not make this about me. [The caller's response here is unintelligible except for what sounds like the words ""shenanigan ass"" and ""Robyn Hitchcock.""] Operator 1: Breathe, sir. Try to breathe. How about I count and you inhale and exhale along with my counting? Caller: I don't think you're taking this threat seriously enough. Have you considered what would happen if this double CD were left in a time capsule, and the rest of the world was destroyed in a war over oil so people could drive to their tanning beds and botox injections, and this thing was all that was left of Bob Dylan's legacy after the destruction? [Operator 1 was silent here. She reported to her supervisor that she did not know what to say.] Caller: Hello, operator? Jesus! Think about it! Anyone who heard these sixteen covers and thought they had heard Dylan-- that would be like thinking you'd seen some painter's masterpiece because you saw a postcard of it! The crap-recorded acoustic guitar on the first disc must be being strummed by a mannequin! [At this point, Operator 1 believed that the Caller had begun talking to someone else in his proximity. On the tape, he evidently told someone to ""go away,"" because ""Daddy's putting up special shelves.""] Operator 1: Sir, are you still there? Caller: Yeah. Kids these days, huh? Operator 1: They're something. Caller: They really are. So, are you getting it yet? Operator 1: What I'm hearing is that you think someone's going to try to trap Bob Dylan in a capsule. Caller: That's not what I said at all. Do you even listen to Bob Dylan? Operator 1: No, sir. Caller: Who do you listen to? Operator 1: Country. Kenny Chesney, Alan Jackson... Caller: Hell, you wouldn't know country if it served you under a heat lamp in an All-U-Can-Eat buffet. Get me somebody else. I will burn this house down if you don't connect me with someone who knows who Bob Dylan and Robyn Hitchcock are! [Operator 1 patched the Caller through to Operator 2, who claimed familiarity with whatever the Caller was talking about. The tape didn't pick up until mid-conversation.] Operator 2: I thought the liner notes were only mildly self-indulgent and even kind of charming. Especially when Hitchcock compared Dylan to Monty Python's reluctant messiah Brian, and when he wrote about how, the first time he heard ""Desolation Row,"" he thought Dylan was saying ""Destination Roll."" Caller: Yeah, but the song-order listing on the first CD is screwed up! Just by the time ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue"" came on, I wanted the coffeehouse proprietor to interrupt and say for him to give someone else a chance at open mic night. Operator 2: Sir, Hitchcock doesn't purport to be trying to 'interpret' Dylan's songs. I think it was a very cool gesture, to a mentor. Hitchcock is saying 'thank you' to Dylan, in a way. Caller: I don't know, man. His restagings are as hackneyed as Gus Van Sant's Psycho! He totally botches ""4th Time Around""! I didn't pay for two damn blooper CDs! Operator 2: I find the full-band rendition of ""Visions of Johanna"" really powerful, the way they soft-produced it for that retro feel. And the acoustic versions of the two more recent Dylan songs, the nihilist ""Not Dark Yet"" and the humanist ""Dignity,"" hold up beside obvious jukebox fare like ""Tangled Up in Blue."" Caller: But that breathy vocal inflection for 'important' or 'intense' lines strikes me as so fake. He sounds like Willow marveling at Madmartigan! There's some murky quantity, some American idiom, missing. The same way Americans make goons of themselves doing Shakespeare, he makes a goon of himself doing Dylan. Hitchcock misses the spontaneity of Dylan's enunciation and forces a predictable pattern on the lyrical rhythm. His version of the whitey-blues swagger of ""Leopard-Skin Pillbox Hat"" is straight-up square! Operator 2: Sir, do you fancy yourself an amateur rock critic? Caller: What does that even mean? Is there any such a thing as a 'professional' rock critic, whom lawyers can summon to testify in cases? 'We need an official diagnosis of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, quick! Help, we don't know what to think about The Soft Bulletin!' Fuck! Operator 2: I was just saying that you might try listening to Hitchcock's earlier work solo, and his two bands. Caller: Yeah, there's good stuff, but he's second-tier next to Dylan, right? He's like Pepsi, or K-Mart. Operator 2: Try to focus on something positive, sir. Caller: Okay, okay. Disc two is pretty good, the one where he re-enacts the Royal Albert Hall/'Judas' concert. Some of that stuff's top-notch homage, actually. High energy. He cusses well on that raucous ""Ballad of a Thin Man."" The band rips up ""I Don't Believe You"" and ""Just Like Tom Thumb's Blues."" And Hitchcock works himself into an inspired, endearing, middle-age rage on disc two. I love some of it, I think. Operator 2: That CD came out a long time ago as a promo called Beautiful Queen. Caller: What a stupid thing to know. What I was saying was, the best stuff on these discs only increases the sting of the lame stuff. And what England-covers-America album do my kids have to look forward to in 2025, if there is a 2025? Liam Gallagher doing Beck? [Caller groans, bangs the phone against some surface, possibly a tile floor, says something unintelligible except for the words ""irony hostage,"" and then asks someone to ""go get Daddy's lucky pliers"" before disconnecting. No update is available at this time.]","**

Self-Titled Long-Playing Debut Album,+/-,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0b35e6ef9596931fff6/1:1/w_160/a18be39e.gif,2002-05-15 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6354-self-titled-long-playing-debut-album/,Teenbeat,"I swear, some days it's like I can't even mention the name James Baluyut without hearing something about Versus. But now, Baluyut's ready to shut everyone up in fine style and just maybe get you to stop reminiscing about his full-time band for five goddamn minutes. Now listen closely, 'cause I'm only gonna say this once: Baluyut sets out solo for this effort as +/-, and if you were expecting pop, you got it, but this ain't exactly your daddy's Secret Swingers. Instead, Baluyut marries deliciously hott digital manipulation and Mille Plateaux beats to the upbeat, joyous pop songwriting that made him such a staple of the 90s college-rock circuit. Baluyut's recipe here is straightforward enough: take simple acoustic pop sensibilities with warm electronic swells and undertones; add tight, complex percussion and distant vocal arrangements. But it's the small changes of focus between seemingly disparate elements that make Self-Titled Long-Playing Debut Album exceptionally varied. Each song is a subtle shift from the previous one as new elements continually rise to the fore and old ones are subdued or eliminated. And of course, it's all occasionally punctuated by startling bursts of white noise and alien effects. Yet despite its experimental nature, the pop song always remains the focus, drenched in perfect melody. Even at its most jarring (which, to be fair, isn't very), Debut Album has a nice underlying tranquility. Synth chords mimic strings and sweep in over the opener, ""All I Do,"" constantly building but never finally breaking, over Baluyut's lone, plaintive refrain. ""Manifest Destiny (In General)"" instantly distinguishes itself with a cascading, slightly dissonant piano melody and bouts of invading instrumentation before Baluyut is brought so close it feels as though he's singing from within the deepest recesses of your brain. In fact, it's at this moment that you realize Baluyut's vocals are Debut Album's single greatest asset. The thread that ties the record together, his lilting tenor is part lullaby, part lament, mournful and sleepy, conveying a genuine sense of conviction. This record fits nicely into the canon of so-called ""digipop,"" amongst releases like Notwist's Neon Golden and Hood's Cold House, but its artistic debts are owed to the Magnetic Fields' synth-crazy oeuvre. And while not perfect-- the vocal loop on ""Yo Yo Yo (Please Don't Fall in Love)"" is pretty upsetting-- its missteps are few and far between. The only real issue I take with Self-Titled Long-Playing Debut Album, is that it's a bit too removed at times. Some of these songs could benefit from a little intimacy, which is admittedly difficult to pull off in this kind of setting. But all told, this is an interesting direction for Baluyut that pays off more than it flounders. And with the advances recently made by digital editing software, his self-titled long-playing sophomore album stands to be just as rewarding.","I swear, some days it's like I can't even mention the name James Baluyut without hearing something about ...

Talkatif,Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0b413d1975652138455/1:1/w_160/29305ed3.gif,2002-05-15 05:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/212-talkatif/,Ninja Tune,"""They're ripping off Fela, man."" There is a law that says all reviews of Antibalas records must contain the above statement. And it's true-- this 16-piece Brooklyn collective owes a hell of a lot to the Nigerian bandleader and rabble-rouser, as they're the first to admit. They owe so much to his sound, in fact, that even people who bought the 2xCD Best of Fela Kuti at Starbucks two months ago are allowed to feel outrage at the level of mimicry on the band's second album, Talkatif. Even though these 16 musicians live and breathe Fela Kuti's music and have devoted their lives to spreading the joy that comes from sharply arranged and performed afrobeat, the punters will not stand for this wholesale appropriation of style. Down with Antibalas! Fela Forever! Did I just say ""punters""? Anyway, with that rant out of the way, let's say, just for argument's sake, that you're not really concerned with the integrity of the recorded legacy of Fela Kuti, and are instead curious about whether or not this here Talkatif album has some good music on it. I know, I know, you're actually seething over this aping of the Fela catalog, almost as bad as the number Bill Laswell pulled on Army Arrangement, but I'm going to answer this question anyway, just as a rhetorical exercise. It'll be fun. Setting aside all issues of originality, I am here to report that Talkatif is a good album, though not a great one. First the 'good' parts: the arrangements on these seven tracks are exceptional. This unwieldy mass of trumpets, saxophones, organs, guitars, bass and drums, drums, drums seriously chug along as a unified music machine, each part working together and yet remaining separate enough to be heard and appreciated on its own. With everything going on simultaneously-- and it's quite a lot-- the music never seems crowded or muddy. The compositions are also up to snuff. Each track is built from a bass and percussion vamp; riffs and rhythm are far more important than melody. On most tracks the beat is introduced, a few horns will solo on the theme, the organ might take over for a bit, next comes a percussion break, then a restatement and time to back out. A couple of numbers also engage in shouted call-and-response vocals, which lack urgency but somehow manage to work well as songs. Now on to the not-so-great: first, I have an image in my mind of Antibalas as an energetic live band, and much of Talkatif seems more restrained and polite than it probably ought to. While the tracks are marginally propulsive, there's a lack of fire to the music, like they were more concerned with sounding good than cutting loose. This has the odd side effect of helping Antibalas fit in at Ninja Tune, as this record seems made more for background music or head-nodding than for a real dance party. Along the same lines, the seven tracks here run just over 40 minutes, which seems a little short for the afrobeat form. With this music's semi-improvisatory nature and focus on the beat, long, drawn-out tunes that develop over time would be more appropriate. A ""Live at the Great American Music Hall"" follow-up could be just the thing to follow Talkatif. Still, for what it is, this isn't bad.

29092000,Filament,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd97abf31b7dc7155f9f/1:1/w_160/dfdb10c3.gif,2002-05-14 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3056-29092000/,Amoebic,"I was talking with a friend of mine today about the fear of completely new music. I made the not-terribly-deep insight that one of the reasons some people might not like a lot of the noisier experimental music was because it was intimidating. In reality, I was describing my own experiences regarding some of the music I now take for granted as standard 'noise.' I doubt that most people are scared of this stuff. ""They're afraid of our music"" is a standard cop-out for an artist to excuse the fact nobody is latching onto his or her sound, though just as often it's a matter of the music simply not appealing to listeners' tastes. Not that anyone cowers in a corner with a watchful eye on their stereo, but maybe there's sometimes an aspect of fear that goes along with music that doesn't immediately relate to something with which we're already familiar. The example I used in the conversation was when I heard the self-titled Clash album in high school. It was so aggressive, furious and assured. There was nowhere for me to breathe, and I had never heard anything that raged with the kind of brute force and focused sense of purpose that record seemed to possess. It wasn't until six months later, when I revisited the record, that I was able to listen without being put off by the sheer intensity of it. I could use the same scenario to describe my first encounters with Boredoms, John Zorn and the music on this CD. In each case, there was the initial shock and subtle intimidation, an extended separation, and then a return when my senses had almost caught up with the experience. Strange that fear would lead to discovery. Filament is an extreme project, and one that I'm not sure what to make of yet. Comprised of full-time experimentalists Otomo Yoshihide and Sachiko M., the duo makes minimalist noise via sampler, turntable and sine wave. Both of these musicians have been involved with boisterous 'Japanoise' (most notably with Ground Zero, and solo), and the usual fare of electronic mayhem and jazz-core extremities expected from experimentalists out of Tokyo in the last decade or so. What hasn't been expected is their gradual shift from destructive cacophony to lengthy, high-pitched sequences. They still go for your ears, but with a laser beam instead of a club. Otomo and Sachiko (who work in similar, if more percussive, realms with I.S.O.) describe Filament as a project wherein sound is a massive texture, which they knead together from the dough of their very minimal equipment. Okay, you want to know what it sounds like? Leave your computer on for about a week, until it starts humming from exhaustion, and then place a mic up to the hard drive. Turn your amp up to 10, and then subject yourself to the feedback and computer hum for about half an hour. Trust me, you won't have to strain to hear it. The devastating frequencies will more likely cause your dogs to go berserk, and yourself to either develop a terrible migraine, or kneel in submission. If you listen in a bit, there are variations at work. Otomo's sampler interrupts the pure resonance of the sine wave, ofter producing the effect of a very light generator hum, or even glitchy tick-beats-- just dox92t expect anything close to rhythm. Also, since 29092000 (Filament's third release) is a document of a concert hall performance, there is an omnipresent room ambience. This may not seem like much, but if live sine wave and sampler effects is the Spartan music of the future, then purely studio-based sine waves is the music of digital hell. And so, the question becomes: is this interesting new music, or a physically painful display of artists looking for the next plateau of extreme noise? The answer may very well reside in your threshold for pain-- not to mention your ideas about what actually constitutes music. Filament is but one of several current electronic outfits all over the world who are already very far away from both relatively experimental IDM and established, academic electro-acoustic music. They certainly aren't for anyone impatient or the slightest bit wary of experimental electronic music. If that doesn't scare you away, they could be onto something.","I was talking with a friend of mine today about the fear of\r\n\ completely new music. I made ...

Notes Left Out,Knotworking,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbe05e6ef95969322d05/1:1/w_160/4cfb0dad.gif,2002-05-14 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4499-notes-left-out/,One Mad Son,"Traditional Pitchfork jurisprudence dictates that, should an artist sound a great deal like his influences, his music will often stand or fall on the quality of those influences. If the influences are deemed credible and prudent, the music produced in the wake of them will stand, unless: 1) it is a cheap ripoff; 2) a commercialized update; 3) shitty. Examples of influences that generally enjoy deference include the Beatles, Can, and the Velvet Underground. Other influences, should they surface in a modern artist's music, must be subjected to more rigid scrutiny. These are artists whose aggregate work product amounts to two good songs on a box set, or one on a greatest hits compilation. These are the fads, six-hit wonders, and bygone anachronisms from the pop-rock of old. Most never recorded any decent music in the first place, and the very fact that an artist actually knows their full catalog nearly sounds the death knell by itself. Examples of influences subjected to strict scrutiny criticism include the Grateful Dead and Aerosmith. Instances in which evidence of these influences will stand are rare, but they do exist. For example, an apparent Duran Duran influence may survive a Pitchfork review if it is stunningly ironic. You can squint until your eyes are shut, but you just won't find the irony in Knotworking. Edward Gorch, lead singer and songwriter of the Albany, NY folk-pop outfit, has chosen for himself without a doubt one of the most irredeemable and least advisable influences in the history of rock and roll. For as popular as Cat Stevens was in his heyday, it seems that, in modern times, he's about as relevant as an abacus. His music, while a staple for weed-loving audiences in the 70's, has thus far managed to evade any influence on younger weed-loving generations. And Gorch has clearly listened to several albums by Allah's chosen pop icon. Unfortunately, his choice of influences also means that, as a matter of rote Pitchfork constitutionalism, he was doomed from the outset: the voice and lyrical melodrama are straight from the Cat himself. Moreover, since Gorch obviously doesn't have the same sort of production budget at his disposal, the orchestration and musicianship are relatively simple, leading not only to average music, but consistently average music. It's really a hard presumption for Gorch to overcome. He tries-- ""Imbecile Smile"" is solid proof that the man isn't without talent of his own. But even then, the power of the song is drawn solely from a crescendo of instrumental dissonance, not from the strength of the melody. ""Lawn Plastic Santa,"" on the other hand, has a decent guitar hook and vocal melody, but employs dreadful song structure, repeating the same verse-chorus-bridge pattern over and over a good five or six times. As for the aforementioned Stevens idolatry, the pinnacle comes on ""Manuel,"" where Gorch's voice fully morphs into Cat's trademark whinny. In the end, Gorch offers little to redeem his choice of influences. Yes, he puts his own folksy downtempo spin on things, but when you're dealing with shitty music, simply slowing it down isn't a huge improvement. Accordingly, this album must be found wanting. In the future, Gorch would do well to stock up on indie-approved influences like Nick Drake and Tom Waits, because the current formula is definitely ""knotworking.""","Traditional Pitchfork jurisprudence dictates that, should an artist sound a great deal like his influences, his music will often stand ...

Sugar,Aloha,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a05cc0084474cd0bfb5c/1:1/w_160/73ed1424.jpg,2002-05-14 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/128-sugar/,Polyvinyl,"Some college kid told Aloha that they were great to study to and it's been haunting them ever since. How could their whirlwind, vibraphone-driven post-rock get stuck in the background? Shouldn't it at least be distracting? As they finished their second full-length, Sugar, bassist Matthew Gengler wrote on their website: ""This year I'm pushing for more 'anthemic pelvic rockers' and fewer 'heartfelt ballads.'"" And sure enough, after an attention-getting percussion intro, Sugar leaps into a song that pins your ears back like an extreme rollercoaster. ""They See Rocks"" vaults through its chord changes on Gengler's moon-walking bass and the one-man massacre of Cale Parks on drums. It has the lurching, exhilarating feel of Aloha's first albums, but this time the arrangement is bigger: Eric Koltnow's signature vibraphone mixes with electric piano and distorted guitar into molten rock candy. It's their loudest album, but the band still sound like music geeks: they favor pulsing rhythms to rock beats, and ""It Won't Be Long"" even echoes Steve Reich. On other tunes, they finally sound as jazzy as they've always threatened to be-- specifically, they're reminiscent of 70s fusion, with its driving rhythms and vague sense of conservatory educations. You can picture the dusty vinyl in their collections by bands like Weather Report and Eberhard Weber's Colours. They're not the first post-rock band to be serious instrumentalists, but they keep their chops in line by focusing on the songwriting. The mini-epic ""Let Your Head Hang Low"" and the exotic segues of ""Thieves All Around Us"" both fit inside five minutes, and the disturbingly titled ""Balling Phase"" may be their most ecstatic anthem yet. Tony Cavallario is also gaining confidence as a singer: his vocals are clearer and louder in the mix, but he's still earnest and direct, making sure he earns every high note and big chorus. Where their earlier songs were sometimes fragmentary, the material on Sugar is better developed, as each composition hold its own under independent scrutiny. As before, Aloha edits the songs together into continuous blocks of music, to replicate their live shows. However, this aspect also makes Sugar less fun than their last album, That's Your Fire, where the fast and slow songs hurtled into each other and shorter pieces of tunes ran into sprawling textural epics. To some listeners it sounded cobbled together, but to others, That's Your Fire was one of the more inspired post-rock albums of the past few years. Sugar needs more of that variety. Aloha throws everything they have-- their biggest arrangements and most belted-out lyrics-- at almost every song on the album. Near the end, ""Dissolving"" and ""I Wish No Chains Upon You"" each sound like just more anthemic bricks in the wall: either the band or the listener feels a little tapped. And Sugar could use more of the slow, spare tunes that Aloha was known for: in fact, the one thing this album truly lacks is one of the trademark, vaguely sappy ballads that the band is obviously trying to avoid. They might have been worried about getting typecast, but earlier songs like ""Roanoke Born"" and ""Saint Lorraine"" were-- and there's nothing wrong with it-- really fucking pretty. One or two of these per album won't make anyone think they're soft. Besides, I can't study over all this racket!","Some college kid told Aloha that they were great to study to and it's been haunting them ever since ...

Acuarela Songs,Various Artists,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a75b13d19756521393c8/1:1/w_160/3d27cef1.jpg,2002-05-13 05:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1841-acuarela-songs/,Acuarela,"Everyone has the right to pat themselves on the back once in awhile, so I won't hold it against the Spanish label Acuarela for this somewhat vain collection of songs. ""Acuarela"" is Spanish for watercolor, and all the songs included on this two-disc contair the word ""somewhere in the title, the spirit or the lyrics,"" according to the liners. Simple enough, and most bands play along, though some are certainly a stretch. I'm not sure how Mojave 3's ode to Mark Kozelek, ""Krazy Koz,"" fits the criterion, but I won't hold these slips against them either because so many of the songs here-- almost all of them otherwise unreleased-- are so darn good. Most comps like this take a shotgun approach, scattering an assortment of songs in the listener's direction, and hoping something hits the mark. Acuarela Songs, on the other hand, has a fairly clear aesthetic goal in mind: to collect the best in American, Spanish, French, and Australian sad white bastard music. Mojave 3, the Court and Spark, the Clientele, Mark Eitzel, Giant Sand mainman Howe Gelb, perpetual Pedro the Lion opening act TW Walsh, the Mountain Goats, and the Willard Grant Conspiracy are some of the bigger names on this comp. And, as might be expected, many of the participating artists come off as if they just scoured their vaults when asked to contribute. The greatest offender ir this respect is Mark Eitzel, who sounds as if he didn't even have a complete song lying around, and instead of coming up with something new, just spliced together a few unfinished bits and called it a day. Likewise, Howe Gelb scraps up a 1\xBD-minute acoustic track that starts out promising then disintegrates, sounding like the tape just ran out on him. But I'm not going to waste too much time on the disappointing and mediocre (of which there is plenty). I'd rather focus on the surprising and satisfying (likewise, plenty). ""The Colour of Water"" from the Leeds-based Dakota Suite, is a super smooth cool-jazz instrumental with dual trumpet/guitar lead and amazing interplay from the rhythm section. Greg Weeks' ""The Waves"" is an ambitious psych-pop workout with a creepy vocal delivery, a heavy fuzz guitar riff, and a quiet organ-lead outro-- it's a full album wrapped up in 5\xBD minutes. I've been putting off buying his album for months, and I might just have to do it after this sample. ""Watercolor Rose,"" from Nashville singer/songwriter Doug Hoekstra, is a classic melancholy reminiscence. The closely miked vocals and achingly distant trumpet create a nice discrepancy that easily pulls you through the story-song about the natural selectivity of memory. Elsewhere, ""John King's Watercolor Bicycle"" by M. Ward is like Paul Westerburg via Red Krayola, while Tracker's ""Water Fills the Bedroom"" rides a rusty wheelbarrow atop Fahey-like fingerpicking. Highlights of disc two include Paloma's ""Watercolor..."", just a shade away from your standard folk fare-- banjo and acoustic guitar accompanying plaintive, slightly flat Damien Jurado-style vocals-- but what a difference that shade makes. Australia's Sodastream give their naturally skewed take on Oldham-esque weird-folk with ""Coloring Iris."" The abrasive lo-fi jangle of the Mountain Goats' ""Saigon Shrunken Panorama"" comes as a bit of a shock, but this is never a bad thing where John Darnielle is concerned, and the song, as should be expected by now, is exceptional. As you can see, most of the worthwhile moments on Acuarela Songs come courtesy of the lesser known acts, which I suppose should be expected-- you gotta swing for the fences when you get fewer at-bats. But despite the overall quality and the relative focus of the collection, with 32 tracks, it's all a bit overwhelming and difficult to trudge through all at once. A clear use for a collection like this is as random play fodder for your CD changer. But if you're like me, someone who detests random play, there are few uses for something like this: something to help get you across the notorious talk-and-country-radio-only zone of central Ohio maybe, or a means for discovering some new artists without much initial investment. Listening to this entire two-hour-plus collection straight through is something like tuning into a college radio station during the wee hours of a weeknight, some lonely first-semester sophomore behind the mic, just discovering his or her taste for mopey indie rock, seeking some kind of connection over the airwaves. In short: spotty.","Everyone has the right to pat themselves on the back once in awhile,\r\n\ so I won't hold ...

If only Tom Waits had been given a seat and a microphone beside all those painkiller-and-vitamin-goofy ex-jock anchors at the Super Bowl halftime show, Waits could have responded to McCartney's ""Wouldn't it be great if, in these patriotic times, the Patriots won?"" blather by howling-- as he does on one of his two new albums-- ""Who gives a good goddamn?!"" In fact, Waits' new platters offer three rejoinders to ""Freedom,"" McCartney's banal attempt at a post-millennial moment-defining anthem: ""Misery Is the River of the World,"" ""Everything Goes to Hell,"" and ""We're All Mad Here."" Tom Waits has been milking the concept of the ramshackle apocalyptic carnival for twenty years now, flaunting a keen otherworldly nostalgia and a preoccupation with freaks that transcends the hell out of Harmony Korine's. In the 80s-- when everything was measured in 'oodles' and forecasts didn't include a 30% chance of terrorism-- Waits rescued himself from his role as a clever lounge slouch by going real weird right about the time he hitched himself to Kathleen Brennan, whose influence has grown with each release (she co-wrote and co-produced both new albums). Back then, fans of the old Waits cried ""Yoko!"" but let's face it: that barroom-sage thing was getting pretty half-hearted. It's difficult not to hear the new song ""Coney Island Baby"" as an ode to Brennan, the psycho-circus muse: ""Every night she comes/ To take me out to Dreamland."" Both of Waits' new discs are their own concept albums, and both are collections of sick Germanic showtunes resulting from overseas theatrical collaborations with Robert Wilson (the man infamous for staging Philip Glass' Einstein on the Beach, and with whom Waits made The Black Rider). Both albums' subjects are headline-fodder: Alice deals with (ahem) (cough) intergenerational desire (reportedly based on Lewis Carroll and the famous little girl whose hand he would squeeze during their walks), while Blood Money (written to accompany the play Woycek) hazards the realm of psychopharmacology via its tale of old-world medical mind-tampering. Waits makes his woebegone statements about the muck of modern life artfully and metaphorically, avoiding the overt outrage that leisure-class sophistos would label tedious. These albums function in Waits' discography the way the film The Man Who Wasn't There fits into the Coen oeuvre: they are self-homages, full of superceding revisitations, that hone rather than advance. The exotica of Swordfishtrombones, the arch storytelling of Rain Dogs, and the better elements of the hit-and-miss Mule Variations are fully realized here, sustained for 91 cohesively transportative minutes of convoluted waltzes and marches. At one point, Waits even plinks the piano bit from ""Innocent When You Dream"" with a winking brio that whispers, ""Ain't I fun?"" Blood Money's clomp-and-stomp and Alice's musty ether represent the osteoporosis of Bone Machine and the senile dementia of The Black Rider, allowed to blossom into terminal malaise. Both albums are further testament that Waits' inner cryptkeeper is getting sharper, combining disparate instruments with calamitous precision and conjuring worlds in which celebrities are born without bodies and razors 'find' throats. The music is so expressive and confident in its spook-ass vibe that it's flat-out cinematic. The instrumentals serve as aural Rorsharchs (the gorgeous violin of ""Fawn"" made me see bugs mating-- now you try!) and Waits' voice is warmly recorded on each of the pump-organ-and-stand-up-bass dirges, some of which seem to channel the balcony-leaping spirit of a heroin-shriveled Chet Baker. The guitar of ""Starving in the Belly of a Whale"" sounds like an animatronic parasite prancing on your spine. ""Lost in the Harbour"" captures the creaky havoc of metal bending to the sea. ""Lullaby"" is a perfect nugget of twilight insecurity, and the nightmare cartoon of ""Kommienezuspadt"" begs for a club mix. Every syllable of ""God's Away on Business"" is a seizure, with the Ben-Hur slaveship-rowing coach pumping the tempo to ramming speed. Those of you who first heard Tom Waits, as I did-- that is, over lasagna at the house of a junior-high teacher with a skin disease who was trying to seduce you-- will relish the albums' creepy love songs. They shine a morbid light on how most love-pop reduces the world to a consuming need for one magical person, and how often it's a bum swap: the Alice of Alice brings its protagonist an ounce of redemption and a ton of ruin. Okay, so you might find the voices silly (there's Ancient-Mariner-on-a-bender, post-pubescent Grover, Golem-in-a-tux, and Gungan Boss Hogg). Okay, so this is the first group of Waits songs where the ingredients seem so familiar that listeners feel empowered enough to try to guess the recipe and write their very own Tom Waits Song (I'm talking to you, Joe Henry). Okay, so a moratorium should be imposed on the kiss/bliss rhyme. Okay, so some of the recombinatory stunts of The Man Who Wasn't There felt autopiloted and didn't satisfy as much as the first time you encountered them. Okay, so Anti's copy editor should have to rescue rabbits from cosmetics testing labs to atone for how badly they transcribed and jumbled the lyrics in the booklet. (What gives? I bet Epitaph has a brigade of undergrad interns that sort out each apostrophe in Bad Religion liner notes.) Still, you should be ashamed you bought that Cursive, or Pedro the Lion, or Ladytron CD, and get these. Synth-pooh and guitar-flarney doesn't have jack on calliopes, marimbas, chamberlains, cellos, and tubas, all of it in classily surreal packaging that screams ""Fuck the Grammys."" While the rest of pop culture infantilizes itself with cussing puppets and manufactured bands who willfully dangle like marionettes, Waits is serving up vintage brittle fusion and somehow breaking the law of diminishing returns. Something wicked this way hams, and it ain't afraid to be misanthropic and admit that humans are just monkeys trained to parallel park. Come on, you Disney puds, it's time to let Waits and David Lynch do Kafka's Metamorphosis as a musical.","The abundance of elder tunesmiths keeping it real is enough to make a youngster want to move to an assisted-living ...

Lend You a Hand,Tight Bro's from Way Back When,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7ad9d034d5c69bf3865/1:1/w_160/a270d212.jpg,2002-05-13 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8058-lend-you-a-hand/,Kill Rock Stars,"The first time I ever saw the Tight Bro's play, I was having one of the shittiest days of my adult life. I entered the club audibly groaning. But by the time super-speedy, explosive, cock-rock lunacy took the stage, I was actually smiling, for crying out loud, to say nothing of feeling the need to raise the red hand of rock and holler like a demolition obsessed, mullet-sportin' tweaker at a monster truck show. As one of the more unique names on the Kill Rock Stars roster, the Tight Bro's From Way Back When have, since 1997, become one of the preeminent Friday night party-rock bands for otherwise uptight indie kids looking to get plowed, go nuts, practice air guitar, and unleash their inner hesher without looking over their shoulder to see who's watching. Listening to the Tight Bro's is hardly an intellectual activity-- though, don't get me wrong, they know what they're doing. The Tight Bro's are vocalist/screamer Jared Warren (formerly of Karp), guitarists John ""Quitty"" Quittner and Dave Harvey (of Behead the Prophet), bassist Sean Kelly (of Gene Defcon), and a fairly impressive list of ex-drummers for a band that's only been around for five years. A quick gander at the Lend You a Hand cover art, featuring the smiling head of Charlemagne, some lightening bolts, and the multicolored faces of the band members would seem to verify that the Tight Bro's are not inclined to take themselves too seriously. Lend You a Hand, the band's sophomore full-length, is 37 minutes of tightly packed, over-the-top rock action that unabashedly channels AC/DC by way of the Stooges, without diluting the formula with masturbatory solos or pretentious harmonic noodling. Cartoon liner notes urge listeners to sing along-- ""If you're having a hard time figuring out which lyrics to sing along with, let the Tight Bro's lead the way... or make up your own, clap hands, etc."" If you're even remotely inclined toward guitar rock, it won't be hard to do as instructed-- especially when the opportunity presents itself in the first song to howl, ""You're vicious, you're nasty,"" along with Warren (don't try this at the office). The first track, ""Make It A Habit,"" builds out of a din of feedback and a baying coyote into a driving rhythm and the style of hyperkinetic guitar licks your fourteen-year-old cousin with the subscription to Guitar Player wishes he could play. It's hard to stay still while listening to this song. This is followed up by ""Bless Me,"" with its slightly raunchier, roadhouse feel-- truer, perhaps, to its AC/DC influence. Much of the album vacillates between roar and raunch, occasionally meshing them into the same song, one example being the metal swing of ""Gimme the Key."" There's little extra racket on this album. I could have probably done without the Blues Explosion/Black Sabbath hybrid ""My Bad Luck,"" which takes too long to hit its groove, but this is a minor complaint. The energy rarely flags on Lend You a Hand-- no small feat for an album that comes out of the gate at full-throttle roar. Even the covers-- Joe Tex's ""Show Me"" and the Animals' ""Inside Looking Out""-- come off seamlessly. The latter even reveals that Jared Warren has a better-than-average blues voice. The current rock revival has spawned a number of vault-mining bands with old-fashioned tastes. The Tight Bro's are not the first to resurrect this genre (nor, from the looks of things, will they be the last), but there's a nice immediacy to their stuff. It feels good to listen to this right now, and imagine hiring them to play your most debauched backyard barbeque, without having to worry about the real effects of incipient madness at the first song. Good stuff.","The first time I ever saw the Tight Bro's play, I was having one of the shittiest days of ...

Our Noise,Herrmann and Kleine,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0c2c0084474cd0c3230/1:1/w_160/9ed405bb.gif,2002-05-13 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3838-our-noise/,Morr,"Our Noise is the collaborative effort of Thaddeus Herrmann and Christian Kleine, on which they aim to find common ground between their very public adorations for 80s synth pop (Herrmann's passion) and instrumental hip-hop (Kleine's). The common ground they've found is early 90s UK indie-- apparently the point at which the Venn diagrams marked 'Visage-y synth-pop' and 'DJ Premier's dopest beatz' intersect is Slowdive's Souvlaki. My incredulity in no way impeaches Souvlaki-- it is, after all, the √ºber-shoegazer album. Rather, I'm perplexed that delicate and stylistically conservative shoegazing would be the arena where experimental IDM chaps like Herrmann and Kleine would find shared passions. So instead of, for instance, a renewed take on Suicide that would expose fey electroclashers for the posturing clotheshorses they truly are, Our Noise is a serene and utterly unchallenging collection. Opening with ""Drop,"" the duo set the parameters of the template they'll use extensively and predictably for the next 45 minutes. The track perfectly combines blunted beats with chiming ethereality, and does so in such a precise and calculated manner that the track that follows it, ""Her Tune,"" is almost indistinguishable. The mopey, angelic mood that characterized Chapterhouse's Whirlpool and Northern Picture Library's entire output prevails-- unmodified and unchecked. It's only when a fast-running marimba comes into the third track, ""Kissing You,"" at 120 BPM that I notice any difference at all. As if to pay even more blatant homage to the indie scene of a decade ago, Herrmann and Kleine cover a 'lost classic'-- Slab Happy's ""Blue Flower."" The fanboys amongst you will immediately point out that elegant maudlineers Pale Saints and Mazzy Star have already covered ""Blue Flower,"" which makes it kind of a shoe-y standard, I suppose. And within the Our Noise frame of reference, it's a perfectly fitting cover. Herrmann and Kleine's version is gorgeous, but evanescent: Ariane Hensel√≠s voice is well-suited to mimic Hope Sandoval's. But like every track here, it's just too damn insubstantial to make me do anything but pass onto the next song without pause or consideration. Furthering their wallpaper strategy on ""Wonder,"" Herrmann and Kleine give their no doubt accurate artistic impression of Slowdive's ""Catch The Breeze""-- as remixed by Plastikman, then chilled-out by the Grid. In the course of ""Wonder"" I can distinctly perceive each of the three evolutionary stages and am mildly amused, but ""Wonder"" is hardly a worthy object of excessive contemplation-- it's an uncomplicated and ultimately purposeless rendering. It's impossible not to assess Our Noise as anything but as boilerplate IDM-inflected shoegazing-- it's the work of talented musicians sculpting guileless sound in lieu of substance. I hope the next time they collaborate, Herrmann and Kleine investigate what separates them instead of what homogenizes them.","Our Noise is the collaborative effort of Thaddeus Herrmann and\r\n\ Christian Kleine, on which they aim to find ...

Sprain Your Tapedeck,Edan,by: Matt Kallman,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc0113d197565213b200/1:1/w_160/c2b8333e.gif,2002-05-13 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2681-sprain-your-tapedeck/,Lewis,"Steve Jobs has this rap game locked. Whether he knows it or not, Apple-Jack's G4 has become the premiere production device for any pseudo-boardsman, giving work to meatheads with even the narrowest of ProTools prowess. Most likely na√Øve to the clear, crisp faux-funk coming out of his product, I guess you could say the man's just making a living. Evolution does not imply progress, only change, so there's no problem with Boston's triple-threat Edan ignoring this modern technological path. Ditching the J-O-B, this rapper/DJ/producer instead bows down to the almighty Tadao Kikumoto, mastermind behind Roland. Edan has himself mastered the tricks of all Roland's various x0x rhythm machines, putting his talent to good use to create this harmlessly facile, yet just plain fun, six-song (four are new) follow-up EP to the excellent Primitive Plus. But by calling this release simple and amusing-- and going along with the Golden Age production techniques-- Sprain Your Tapedeck shouldn't be dismissed as mere 80s kitsch. If recent outside production credits to Count Bass D and Mr. Lif arex92t enough hip-hop cred, Edan makes it abundantly clear on his own records: he knows what he's doing. Combining the hilarity of his Biscuithead 12-inch debut (1999's ""Sing It, Shitface"") with the nostalgia of the recent Critical Beatdown-era tribute track ""Ultra 88"", this record is a retardedly good time. ""Let's B. Friends"", a priceless plea for a new buddy to cool out with, comes complete with a young LL Cool J whisper: ""Let's go over and play some video games/ At the arcade you know we'll just hang out/ Yeah, and we'll work on our rhymes/ My metaphors are okay, how are yours?"" Adorable! Production-wise, the track is surprisingly nuanced with 808 drum rolls, immersed in timely handclaps. While it's completely dull running down the technical on a song like this, it should be emphasized that Edan has honed in on his craft; this clever recreation of a sound long dead in hip-hop is shockingly well-executed. Actually, let's forget legitimizing-- ""Beautiful Food"" is the funniest shit I've heard in years. Edan just lists a bunch of food. That's it, that's the entire song. Over a poppy, Latin guitar, he reads: ""Falafels with tahini/ Eggs scrambled with Monterey Jack cheese/ Cream of broccoli soup/ Portobello mushrooms/ Pigs in a blanket/ Mueslix..."" and so forth. At the risk of being a cornball, if you aren't smiling during this song, check your pulse. Joke-songs aside, ""Clinical Rhymes"" (ft. Skillz Ferguson) evidences some convincing lyrical ability over a beat that runs the gamut of hip-hop references, flipping up eleven (!) times. The kickdrum-heavy, snot-nosed rhyming of ""Schoolly D Knew the Time"" pays homage to the Philadelphia emcee, further exposing the knack Edan has for a dirty, basement production style. Sure, this record is a laugh overall, but don't pass this guy off as some patsy Har Mar Superstar jerkoff. Edan is a one-man hip-hop army. Ice-grilling backpackers (yes, they're still around) take heed: his output is a welcome breath of dusty fresh air.","Steve Jobs has this rap game locked.

Adaptation and Survival: The Insect Project,Tribes of Neurot,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8085e6ef95969321101/1:1/w_160/686f449b.jpg,2002-05-12 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8151-adaptation-and-survival-the-insect-project/,Neurot,"The author is dead! Or so a sect of critic types will tell you, and they may very well be correct. For at some point in the last couple of generations, you-- the reader, and the listener, and the citizen-- became the focus of the critical experience. Interaction, cooperation, and an overwhelming desire to place the epicenter of control (or at least an illusion of control) within the mind of you, the reader, has become paramount. Think of all the reviews you've read about how the music affects a particular reviewer: ""I envision fields of amber, and a sudden calm overtakes me-- it reminds me of my kindergarten class photo, documentary yet ultimately sentimental."" And you have no idea what the music sounds like. But that's okay, at least you know that it had some kind of profound effect on the writer, and that's what good music is supposed to do, right? I mean, it's cool that someone can take a piece of music, and strip away all the packaging and context, and just let it transport (or transform) them. The experience is the key there. So, what if I told you the music described above was actually field recordings of insects, multiplied and manipulated to sound like a battlefield, or some kind of spaced-out fizz generator? Tribes of Neurot practically demand that you, the listener, make your own judgement, because Adaptation and Survival: The Insect Project was made with interaction and listener choice in mind. The Californian outfit encourages listeners to play both of the discs in this set simultaneously (Zaireeka-style) on different players for ""further depth into the sound of insects."" Neurot go so far as to give you a mission statement: ""The only limits are of your imagination and effort."" The author is dead! Long live the new authors-- that means you and me. For their part, Tribes of Neurot have invested a few years into their experimentation and general strangeness. The outfit is made up of most of the members of the avant death-metal band Neurosis (though, in keeping with the dead author motif, none are listed on the CD jacket). Neurosis specializes in extreme noise terror, by way of your workaday rock band instrumentation. Though Tribes tone down the violent outbursts, opting for dark ambience, they inhabit similarly doom-gloomy realms. The two camps continue to exist concurrently, and have even breached the multi-play strategy before with Neurosis' 1999 release Times of Grace meant to be played alongside Tribes of Neurot's Grace. It sounds very compelling-- there's something inherently exciting about never really knowing what the music will sound like each time you play it. At the same time, the concept may be self-defeating. In Tribes' case, their alien static symphony of bugs is probably going to sound close to a wall of noise for most folks no matter what combinations are playing-- though, all bets are off if you're high (seriously, it may take that for some people to get close to this stuff). Adaptation and Survival begs the question: what's better, a pristine recording of digitally enhanced bugs, or going outside in the summer and hearing real ones? At least Zaireeka had Wayne Coyne, who hasn't come anywhere near my backyard, as far as I know. So, it's a bit difficult to focus on these sounds. The first disc is comprised of mixes of a vinyl edition of this set, supposedly split into three separate records to mix and match as you will. ""High Mobility"" actually contains insect samples looped and processed to the point of making it seem like there is an actually tonality at work. A fuzzy drone colors the background of the track, and the buzzing of who knows what winged-bug pans across the speakers. ""Adaptability"" uses cricket sounds and some very creepy wing-flapping samples, supporting more processed insect noise that sounds like a murky synth line. In fact, I counted no less than four different sounds of flying insects in this track. If you don't like flying bugs, it's probably best to steer clear of this release. The epic ""Metamorphosis"" begins with a low hum of flying insects en masse. This is what I imagine a plague of locusts might actually sound like-- the samples are so densely multiplied, the overall effect is not dissimilar to hearing a jet engine. Things take a turn for the disgusting, when what sounds like ants feeding on a decaying carcass works its way through the mix. You can imagine what kind of dual-stereo nightmares Tribes of Neurot could cause you-- but remember, they only recorded the stuff and its up to you to completely gross yourself out! The second disc contains a mix of ""a single potential outcome"" of the various sounds from the original set. For sheer acidic haze, this is the disc to put on for company. The sounds, while still recognizable as insects, blend together to form a much more rootless horror. Suffice it to say that when locust plagues and frenzied ants are the closest points of reference (other than alien terror, that is), good times are not in order. Tribes of Neurot have produced an impressive document of studio wizardry and apparently a steadfast dedication to capturing the hidden sounds of bugs everywhere--it's up to you and me to make something of it. Adaptation and Survival kills authors dead.","The author is dead! Or so a sect of critic types will tell you, and they may very well be ...

I was on the beach this weekend on a sunny day, and the air was still freezing. The local clam shack and ice cream stand had opened but the people in line were wearing windbreakers; this year's scoop girls are only just starting to build the biceps that they'll take to school next fall. It doesn't get hot enough in Portland, Oregon for music like this, and maybe that's why Chad Crouch and Blanket Music recorded Move in the South Pacific, on balmy Island 734-001 of the Bikini Atoll. They're joined by the beautiful voices of Esperanza Spalding (of Noise for Pretend) and Corrina Repp, who sound as smooth as ice against a hot torso. ""Shut up and sway your hips,"" they implore, and the tropical songs and warm recording couldn't sound more like an afternoon at a bar by the beach. They even put a cocktail umbrella in the spine of the disc, to illustrate what you're missing. Crouch says this is party music, and it is, though it's also good hangover music: soothing and free of shrill noise. The hooks are so subtle and laid-back that it can take a few listens to appreciate Crouch's catchy songwriting-- most notably on ""K - A - R - A [breathless] O - K [keep it coming] EEEeeeeeeeee,"" where his droopy-dog vocals and clever lyrics dance over a catchy guitar riff. Greg Lind's drumming is limber but restrained, and even the drum machine that augments the music is nicely integrated-- as on the hot jazz-meets-IDM ""Itchy Popcorn,"" which builds to speaker-shaking bass. Crouch is a low-key frontman with a thin, melodic voice, perfect for the tone of this record, and he and Ross Seligman play killer staccato lines on guitar. I'd expect American bossa nova to be as bad as other Americanized ethnic creations, like American ska, or American chop suey. In addition to having a stand-up band, Crouch succeeds by not pretending to be anything he isn't-- instead of posing as a smooth island loverboy, he sticks to wry lyrics and mundane topics. He has three jobs: as a musician, as a designer, and as the head of this label; and he likes to talk about the need to slow down. Like the 'to do' list that's set to a beautiful tune on ""Walk the Dog,"" or his potshots at hip visual artists in ""Hot Designers."" He writes witty love songs about (though not necessarily to) his ""incredible"" girlfriend, who he describes so sweetly in the liner notes that I winced hoping they haven't broken up since this came out. For example, the cutesy interplay in ""Tap the Beat"" (He: ""And if I lost my legs..."" She: ""I would put you on my back/ And I would grab things off the shelf for you""). Hey, guys, get a room! On a song like ""Costa Del Sol"" there's genuine yearning in Crouch's voice, the note of sincerity that makes it compelling and not just exotic. What does he yearn for? Maybe his girlfriend, though she probably hangs around plenty; maybe something as global as world peace, as on ""Get Togetha."" But more than anything, it sounds like Crouch wanted to vacation in a warm place and to party. And on the defrosting boardwalks, in the last gusts of New England's waning chill, that's good enough for me.","Living on the New Hampshire seacoast, I can relate to the state of mind that might drive one to bossa ...

Sharpen Your Teeth,Ugly Casanova,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8ccc0084474cd0c0ef1/1:1/w_160/27c15984.jpg,2002-05-12 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8332-sharpen-your-teeth/,Sub Pop,"Isaac Brock is that rare character in an independent music world crowded with upper-class college boys and eccentric old men: a legitimate redneck. Hailing from a rural logging town thirty miles east of Seattle, Brock grew up in a rusty trailer, doomed to the blue-collar nightmare of foundry life or some other back-breaking eternity. Over the past ten years, he's seen the backwoods town's tall pines and muddy soil swallowed alive by the corporate monster and shit back out as duplexes and strip malls. What little nature remains there now is permeated with the death stench of ChemLawr yards and Wendy's drive-thrus. So, after the success of Modest Mouse's classic The Moon and Antarctica, Brock packed up and moved to Cottage Grove, Oregon, another even more remote logging town-- one whose chances of becoming a suburban hellhole are about as likely as his mother's of winning a Powerball jackpot. Brock is extremely candid in interviews about his love of drugs, particularly psychedelics and uppers. As everyone knows, there's not a lot to do out in nature but get high, and there's nothing like getting high in nature. It gets you thinking about the broader picture-- typical hippie shit like your place in the universe, and the usual depressive shit like your own mortality and irrelevance. This kind of environment can't be good for a guy who, beneath his surly exterior, is about as depressed as a motherfucker comes. But it helps him write, and when that's all you've got going for you, you go where it comes easiest. I have little doubt that Brock wrote a great deal of the lyrics for The Moon and Antarctica on psychedelics, as many of his insights were so disconnected and profound that they could only have come to him in a moment of altered consciousness. But recently, including during the recording of that album, he's spent a lot of time in stone-sober Chicago, where psychedelics are considered hideously lower-class and drink is the drug of choice. None of this affected his magnum opus-- presumably because he was still hanging mostly with his druggy bandmates-- but Brock's solo debut as Ugly Casanova reeks of mental clarity, sacrificing the great philosophical lyrics of records past for pleasantly poetic, but never revelatory, subject matter. Brock recorded Sharpen Your Teeth with Red Red Meat's Briar Deck, Califone's Tim Rutili, Pall Jenkins of Black Heart Procession, and a few random others at his Portland home studio, Glacial Pace, which he built using the advance Sub Pop offered him to record this very record. But let's consider his company here: Deck-- producer of the last Modest Mouse album and the first installment of Brock's Ugly Casanova side project-- for all his culvert reverb and glistening, interstellar software tricks, strikes me immediately as a man who has either never ingested a poisonous mushroom in his life or has long since outgrown such leanings. Rutili's work with Califone is marked by its junkyard percussion and Budweiser Americana. Jenkins sounds like he walks around in graveyards all day praying for inevitable death to just get it all over with. This is no company for abusing prescription tranquilizers. But maybe that's the purpose of this project, to step away from the pursuit of universal knowledge and convey a simpler desperation. Or maybe he just wanted a new cast of characters to collaborate with. And this is indeed a collaboration. Though the songwriting-- which all members had a hand in, right down to the lyrics-- sounds unmistakably like Modest Mouse, you can hear the distinct marks of all the other players. It's initially evident on ""Spilled Milk Factory,"" and later on ""Pacifico,"" both of which feature clanging percussion and sparse background peripherals echoing Califone's Roomsound. The collaborative nature of Sharpen Your Teeth, of course, yields a few missteps, the worst of which stumbles backwards and breaks it neck: ""Diamonds on the Face of Evil"" is an awkwardly loping experiment in which Brock recites a few lines of nonsense padded with the ceaselessly hollered refrain of ""shey shaw shey shaw!"" Likewise, ""Parasites"" comes on like some absurd postmortem parade, with blaring synth trumpets and Isaac morbidly insisting that ""the parasites are excited when you're dead/ Eyes bulging, entering your head/ And all your thoughts... THEY ROT!"" ""Ice on the Sheets"" is, at 6\xBD minutes, repetitive and overlong, and ""Bee Sting,"" though surely intended as a segue, hinders the flow of the album-- a tuneless interlude with Isaac offering some of the least thought-provoking lyrics of his career. There are some damn fine moments here, though. Brock seems to have been born with an innate talent to impart the sourest dejection. His approach is more akin to Arlo Guthrie than to the mop-headed, crybaby adolescentry that presently dominates our rock. If he stuffed his shit with 75-cent dictionary finds, it'd be one thing, but he uses plain English to communicate complex meditations, analyses that could as easily be grasped by drunken farmhands as by world-class poets. The finest of these crops up on ""Hotcha Girls,"" when Brock, at his most austere, sings, ""Don't you know that you'll rust, and not belong so much, and then get left alone.../ Don't you know that old folks' home smells so much like my own."" The opener, ""Barnacles,"" has Brock referencing classic Rolling Stones amidst antisocial daydreams: ""I don't need to see/ I don't see how you see/ Out of your window/ I don't need to see, I'll paint it black."" Then there's the killer two-song punch that ends the record: ""Things I Don't Remember"" recalls the very best upbeat and rhythm-oriented Mouse moments, with truly propulsive percussior hitting with ferocious thwacks, as if trying to better the Pixies' ""U-Mass."" When the song springs to life out of the pleasantly countrified ""Smoke Like Ribbons,"" it hits with such caffeinated urgency that its surrealist lyrics actually become incredibly fun where they might otherwise have been fatally clumsy. This guides us to the reflective closer, ""So Long to the Holidays,"" which evokes both wistful memories of past Christmases, and going off somewhere to die-- and with just two simple lyrics. Sharpen Your Teeth was undoubtedly a therapeutic outing for Isaac Brock, giving him some time to recuperate from his band's definitive statement and temporarily alleviating the pressure of making the next one. And lucky for us, the final product fares far better than these things generally do. Rutili is an able guitarist and lyricist, as is contributor John Orth (who got his start in the Florida-based band Holopaw), and Brian Deck's production, though sometimes excessively spacy, is always warm and nicely balanced. That said, I'm looking forward to Brock falling back in with his old crowd. The drugs might not be good for him, but the inspiratior is.","Isaac Brock is that rare character in an independent music world\r\n\ crowded with upper-class college boys and eccentric ...

Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0b9ea9e61561daa461c/1:1/w_160/ef89248a.gif,2002-05-12 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/215-we-aint-fessin-double-quotes-ep/,Anticon,"I may not be a card-carrying, backpack-lugging member of the hip-hop nation, but I know something amazing when I hear it, and I'm hearing it right now. Thirty years since hip-hop first snuck off the streets and into the collective American consciousness, a bunch of kids from seemingly unlikely places-- Maine, Minneapolis, Nova Scotia-- are reinventing the form yet again. Anticon does hip-hop the way Miles' second quintet did jazz: technically, everything's right where it belongs, it's just hard to tell because everything sounds so different. Sure, there are beats and scratching and verbal acrobatics, but not quite in the ways that we're accustomed to. This is hip-hop made by people who grew up with hip-hop, music created by a generation whose defining skill is their ability to absorb and interpret mass media. Where the originators of modern hip-hop were students of soul, funk, jazz and spoken word, Anticon's revisionists are students of pop culture as a whole. This is reflected in the records they make-- schizophrenic journeys through foreign soundscapes that change every minute, accompanied by abstract narratives that seem more introspective than the usual self-aggrandizing. The production itself is twisted, owing more to the fast-paced chop-suey of Negativland or Eugene Chadbourne than it does to the crisp beats of the Automator. The music changes just as often as the rappers' cadences. MCs criss and cross, enigmatic verses proudly bounding with slant rhyme (and, at times, pure gibberish) twist in and out of one another, simultaneous bursts of verbiage intertwining the same way Miles and Wayne Shorter's horns did-- in synch one second, bursting into polar opposite directions the next. Then, before you've even registered the change, they're back again. You can't make out all the words, but you also get the comforting impression that you're not really supposed to. So instead you cling on to whatever vocal snippets you can: bits about ""liquids descending, my certainty still mending"" and ""citizens tearing up the floorboard."" Deep Puddle Dynamics opens things with ""More from June""-- a menacing piece of music compiled by DJ Mayannaise and Grapedope, then whipped further into shape by guest producer John Herndon. Police sirens wail, just barely audible over alternating drones pierced sporadically by syncopated beats and free-floating minimal scratches as Anticon co-founder and Atmosphere member Slug intones. Suddenly, dubby machine-gun percussion breaks through, destroying the groove, as cLOUDDEAD's Dose One breaks in, spitting words too fast for human comprehension. The title track is a collective work, a reinterpretation of an earlier composition by the same name. It begins with a crackly old jazz sample set to a jungle beat. The crew informs us that, as the title promises, they ""ain't fessin'."" The music stops short. The MCs introduce themselves, but their words are eventually lost in a heavy gust of turntable static. Then a mantra, as bursts of ominous synths grow steadily in the background: ""The first lie/ Wasn't much like of lie/ Less like a lie/ More like a wish with a spine/ Doublecrossed by time."" This isn't easy stuff: there are uncomfortable pauses, unpredictable shifts in speed and rhythm. But it all pays off when an elusive female vocal is suspended in space, nefarious basslines echoing in a mutating murk of chopped-up garage sale vinyl and gurgling electronic noise. From a baseball stadium, to a political rally, to a game show, these eighteen minutes wander through more audio environments than most full-lengths. The EP closes with a production by Jel and Sixtoo called ""Pitty Party People"" which almost resembles a straightforward hip-hop track, built from melodic guitar loops, cheesy synthlines, a relatively straightforward beat, and more of the same stellar rhymes. By usual standards, it'd be a stunning example of hip-hop, mighty catchy and madly upbeat. But here it's got a tough act to follow. At a mere three tracks and 18 minutes, We Ain't Fessin' (Double Quotes) isn't a critical departure for those already familiar with the Anticon brand. But the quick approach may serve well when it comes to recruiting new listeners-- all rapid-fire changes and unapologetic weirdness, We Aint Fessin' (Double Quotes) makes for one king hell mindfuck of an introduction for the uninitiated.","I may not be a card-carrying, backpack-lugging member of the hip-hop nation, but I know something amazing when I hear ...

"Haunt Me, Haunt Me, Do It Again",Tim Hecker,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c09713d197565213ba7e/1:1/w_160/bd336922.jpg,2002-05-09 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3798-haunt-me-haunt-me-do-it-again/,Alien8Substractif,"Tim Hecker is the best-kept secret in the North American electronic underground. The Montreal native debuted last year as Jetone, releasing Ultramarin on the esteemed German imprint Force Inc. On that impressive record, Hecker put his unique stamp on minimal techno, creating nuanced tracks filled with depth and feeling in a genre that can seem clinical and emotionally remote. Ultramarin received a bit of notice, and then late last year, Hecker dropped the vastly different Haunt Me, Haunt Me, Do It Again under his own name on the Alien8 sub-label Substractif. Released almost six months ago at the time of this writing, Haunt Me made only the tiniest ripple in the electronic music press. A couple stingy hundred-word blurbs have been the extent of it. But Hecker's pint-sized level of notoriety just ain't right, because Haunt Me is a hugely great album. Jettisoning the beats and club references of his work as Jetone, Haunt Me is a journey into abstract drones and cinematic atmosphere. The sound fits squarely with what's happening in the laptop scene-- Fennesz, Janek Schafer and Microstoria are all valid reference points-- but once again, Hecker's approach is distinct. While these tracks never comment on traditional song forms in the manner of Fennesz' Endless Summer, they project a similar level of accessibility. The thick, meandering drones that permeate the record are shot through with seams of noise and static, but the dissonant elements are never off-putting. Haunt Me is alien, amorphous and occasionally noisy, but always welcoming. The photographs adorning the artwork of Haunt Me are of building roofs and telephone poles, but the pictures are framed in such a way that 95% of the image is sky. The sleeve design, oddly reminiscent of Modest Mouse's The Lonesome Crowded West (or, cover-wise, the Dismemberment Plan's Change), conveys an aspect of the music. Unlike the microscopic soundworld of someone like Jan Jelinek, Hecker's music seems designed for vast spaces, and the sound minutiae seems less important than the vibe of the whole. Keeping with the theme, Hecker's music, while celebrating open space, feels very isolated. Some tracks contain a melancholy edge that suggests loneliness; others hint at the healing power of solitary meditation. Either way, this is not an album for sharing-- you have to go it alone. Haunt Me is laid out beautifully. Nine individually titled pieces are spread across twenty CD tracks, and the whole thing flows together as a long piece. Befitting the music, this is a record for one sustained session. ""Music for Tundra"" takes up the first three tracks on the record, setting the mood with rumbling undercurrents of bass, a continual upper-register buzz, and unsteady synth chords that cut in unpredictably. As it flows into ""Arctic Lovers Rock,"" a highly-processed pop song is woven into the sheets of sound. Though the vocal treatment is more wistful than aggressive, the mood shifts drastically on ""The Work of Art in the Age of Cultural Overproduction."" This is where Hecker brings his harshest sounds, as deep bass throbs teeter on the edge of complete feedback and dense harmonics pack the high end. ""October"" provides welcome relief, a peaceful amalgamation of synth drones that would sound great on a Kompakt Pop Ambient collection. The tension begins to return on ""Ghost Writing,"" but this more reserved track, which combines gradually shifting sustained tones with the sounds of disembodied voices, could still work as background music. ""A City in Flames"" slowly builds in density, working with the same basic material, and the last several tracks wind down with spare, interweaving lines of drone that recall the first two albums by Stars of the Lid. Each listen is deeply satisfying. Haunt Me is not a shift in paradigm, but it does explore this particular sound with taste and invention, and I wouldn't hesitate to place it on the top tier of current abstract electronic music.","Tim Hecker is the best-kept secret in the North American electronic underground.

Oregon,Kaia,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb60ea9e61561daa720f/1:1/w_160/0ff27ca3.gif,2002-05-09 05:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4376-oregon/,Mr. Lady,"I never attended Lilith Fair-- it wasn't really my scene, or rather, it was a scene that reminded me of tenth grade field-hockey away games, when we'd traverse the state, listening to the Indigo Girls and XTC on the school van's stereo. This was 1991: we thought Indigo Girls' songs were about boys. We believed we were cool, sort of, ir the way only slightly off-kilter, na√Øve, uptight prep school girls might define as cool. We spent a lot of time waxing poetic about private Northeastern colleges and liberal politics and applying high school-level critical theory to R.E.M. and Cure lyrics. I don't look back at this part of my life with any great fond reminiscence or melodramatic despair. It was non-threatening, easy, heavily estrogenated, and dull. Six years later, when I was invited to attend Lilith Fair festivities ""as a guilty pleasure,"" the idea seemed about as appealing as retaking Algebra II. While I was singing along to Skylarking and speculating over how many of my field hockey teammates would be able to justify rhinoplasty after suffering game-time facial injury, Kaia Wilson was teaming up with Donna Dresch to form Team Dresch in Portland, Oregon. Their album, Personal Best, garnered critical acclaim and earned Team Dresch the designation as one of the most outspoken and recognizable queer-core outfits. Wilson left Team Dresch shortly after their second release and moved to Durham, North Carolina, where she co-founded Mr. Lady and split her time between recording with the Butchies and putting out solo material. Kaia's latest solo album, the largely acoustic, confessional Oregon, is an exemplary representation of the under-the-radar, user-friendly female folk-pop genre. I don't listen to a whole lot of this stuff, in part due to an irrational hatred of Ani Difranco (to whom Kaia bears some musical similarity) and all her friends, but this is a safe bet for anyone who's into that kind of thing. Oregon starts out with a sweet natured ode to-- I believe-- Amelia Earhart, called ""World's Greatest Haircut."" It's a fairly simple major-key acoustic number that builds gradually with broad harmonies and light piano. The predominating theme here, if there is one, is loss. ""Mira"" laments the early death of a friend with a country twang and the backing vocals of Indigo Girls' Amy Ray. In the same vein, ""Jasper"" features harmonica and lyrics like, ""When Jasper left, he left for good."" Oregon also features a significantly stripped down, acoustic Cure cover, ""Catch,"" and the jazzy ""Storm,"" which seems to be the most fully realized song on the album, both in structure and instrumentation. ""Make Me Please"" is a great one-minute pop song played with drum machine and steel drum keyboard setting. This sounds weird-- and it is-- but I would have preferred more songs in this vein. Kaia has a nice voice, an ear for integrating harmony, and a somewhat distinctive touch on the acoustic guitar. Lyrically, much of the album is somewhat self-absorbed and confessional, but that's the nature of the beast. Kaia doesn't take a lot of risks, save for ""Make Me Please"" and the goofy new-age keyboards on ""Air."" Oregon is the kind of music you expect to hear while browsing in your local gynocentric bookstore, or wafting from the dorm windows of peasant-bloused, mooneyed, Birkenstock-ed college girls with really good skin. It's nowhere near as distasteful as the vast majority of mainstream mopey girl music out there,but if you have to ask at this point if it rocks...well, no. Not to speak pejoratively of our fair readers, but I suspect there are more than a few of you who shudder when I invoke the name of Lilith Fair. Likewise, I suspect if a Y-chromosoned rocker had released a nicely produced, adult contemporary folk rock solo album, I wouldn't even be writing this review. Kaia's back catalog as a member of both the Butchies and Team Dresch shows punk rock tendencies that don't really have a whole hell of a lot to do with this album. On the other hand, Oregon is a solid, well-written, well-executed release that probably deserves the attention of the legions of fans currently shelling out substantive sums of cash to attend Ani Difranco shows. Well done, for what it is.","I never attended Lilith Fair-- it wasn't really my scene, or rather,\r\n\ it was a scene that ...

The Blackened Air,Nina Nastasia,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3a413d197565213bd96/1:1/w_160/eb17a797.jpg,2002-05-09 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5713-the-blackened-air/,Touch and Go,"You're in a canoe, floating down a stream in some backwoods part of the country, and these sounds come seemingly out of nowhere-- a woman's voice; a whispery, corporeal cello; a ghoulish eerie singing saw that strikes matches on your spine. Something twisted, born wrong, is making this music. And damned if it isn't gorgeous. Nina Nastasia lives in New York City, but she must keep an outhouse and a shotgun in her apartment to dream up such an effective Southern Gothic record. Every sound oozes atmosphere: creepy, bare, sometimes gloomy-- the title of one song, ""In the Graveyard,"" could describe half of them, and the lyrics are rich with references to falling leaves, ""little dead dogs,"" and a stranger that her father once chased from the house. Other songs, hewing closer to country music, feel like a cool breeze through your hair. Nastasia's arrangements use everything from guitar and drums to accordion, a few strings, and singing saw, and where other albums would treat these as embellishments, they're essential to the strength of The Blackened Air. It's not unlike the bleak first album by fellow New Yorkers Clem Snide-- if you swapped Eef Barzelay with a woman, and if the rest of the band had fathered one another. The instruments float in and out, right from the first track: Nastasia drifts in with her acoustic guitar, and then the full band swells through and vanishes. Vibrant strings drive ""This Is What It Is"" while the accordion flutters through; on ""So Little,"" a beautiful ambling waltz, instruments come and go like guests at a barbeque-- an aching electric guitar figure, a cello weaving around the last verse. The spare instrumentation suits the songs, half of which are under two minutes: ""The Very Next Day,"" four lines long, goes by so lightly that you don't notice when it leaves. Diverse but never merely eclectic, it comes together as a patchwork of beautiful fragments hanging in silence: How To Make An American Shroud. As for Nastasia's performance, her voice is not bad, and on some of the songs it fits perfectly-- she really puts her lungs into ""In the Graveyard,"" and on ""All For You"" her voice is plain and worn like a well loved, hand-me-down housedress. On other songs--""Ugly Face,"" for instance-- it's just plain. But this lets Nastasia slip into the picture instead of making it center around her: while this might have been a fine singer-songwriter album, Nastasia has turned it into something far more interesting. But the arrangement and delivery wouldn't be half as effective if The Blackened Air weren't recorded so beautifully, and for that we can thank Steve Albini. That's right, Albini has produced a folk album, and it's one of the most pristine yet organic records I've heard, where every sound is clear enough to touch your nerve endings one by one. Albini holds his own against such purveyors of silence as ECM Records, and this would be a great listen even if songs like ""So Little"" and ""This Is What It Is"" weren't excellent in their own right. For all the raucous, brutal records Albini has recorded, this one, in its own way, is scarier than any of them. I keep picturing the cellist as some lumbering figure with three fingers and one nostril. But man, can he play.","You're in a canoe, floating down a stream in some backwoods part of the country, and these sounds come ...

This Year's Model,Elvis Costello & The Attractions,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a66cc0084474cd0c096e/1:1/w_160/2864bac9.gif,2002-05-09 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1615-this-years-model/,ColumbiaColumbia,"Anyone can whine. But as a seemingly infinite stream of clich√©-obsessed singer/songwriters using misery as a thinly veiled ploy to get laid has proven, very few people can do it well. Drawing inspiration from banal personal miseries and girlfriend tragedies may indeed turn songwriting into some kind of a cleansing experience, but nobody wants to be sprayed in the face with someone else's emotional Lysol. And being preached to? That's nearly as bad. Screamy thugs recycling endless bullshit about the oppressive and destructive state of capitalism, and yet selling their records for profit-- where's the dignity in that? Elvis Costello, more so than any other musician before or since, has managed to integrate the insight of personal music and the conviction of political music, while avoiding the self-indulgent pitfalls of both. To put it another way, Elvis Costello could sing a song about the oppressive and destructive state of his girlfriend and pull it off with wit and talent to spare. With My Aim Is True, Costello immediately established himself as the world's foremost angry geek with something to prove. And while the songs on that album were absolutely stellar, Costello had yet to make his defining statement. Clover, who would later become the News and back up a lesser geek who never managed to prove much of anything, did a great job backing Costello's songs, but never really managed to sound like anything more than a backing band. This, Elvis Costello's second album, marked the beginning of a long and illustrious collaboration with the Attractions, not to mention one of those glorious moments in which a musician discovers a sound that is all his own. While My Aim Is True was largely a guitar-centered album, the sonic core of This Year's Model consists almost entirely of drums, bass, and keyboards. As a result, it's not only a more complex and dynamic album, but also one that steers well clear of the retro guitar twang that marred the less interesting bits of his debut. Indeed, songs like ""Pump It Up"" and ""This Year's Girl"" sound like they were essentially written from the rhythm section up. Pete Thomas' drumming is nothing short of perfect-- on these two songs in particular he keeps the beat deep and powerful, putting accents in all the right places without ever attempting to take the spotlight off the freak up front. With less rhythmically straightforward songs, such as the vaguely reggae-inflected ""(I Don't Want To Go To) Chelsea,"" Thomas shifts accents faster than Miss Cleo, and with far more skill. ""(I Don't Want To Go To) Chelsea"" is by far the most angular tune to be found on This Year's Model. But at the other end of the spectrum sits ""Little Triggers,"" a piano-driven pseudo-ballad that plays host to some of Costello's best wordplay. ""Thinking all about those censored sequences/ Worrying about the consequences/ Waiting until I come to my senses/ Better put it all in present tenses,"" is characteristic of Costello's finest lyrics-- eloquently constructed and uniquely insightful without ever being trite or obvious. A more controversial lyrical highlight comes with ""Night Rally,"" a song that was left off of the original U.S. release of This Year's Model. Costello never shied away from using offensive and thought-provoking imagery in his songs, most notably references to Nazi Germany. Sounding something like a new wave funeral march, ""Night Rally"" sees Costello making a reference to ""singing in the showers,"" a line that's both cleverly disturbing and vice versa. ""Night Rally"" was intended to be the last song on This Year's Model, but the folks at Rhino decided to stick the single ""Radio, Radio"" at the end of the album itself, as was done on the original U.S. release. Given the great care Rhino took with both the remastering and packaging of This Year's Model, it seems odd that they would go and do something that acts contrary to the original idea of the record. But one can hardly bitch about the inclusion of that track, easily one of the glowing highlights of the man's entire career. Rhino's expanded reissue also includes a second disc of bonus material, some of which is nearly as satisfying as the album itself. ""Big Tears"" is one of his finest unreleased tracks, and acoustic demos of ""Big Boys"" and ""Greenshirt,"" both of which later appeared on Armed Forces, provide an interesting insight into the way Costello turned simple guitar tunes into fully formed new wave masterpieces. These three songs, as well as many other tracks on the bonus CD, were all included as bonus tracks on the recent Rykodisc reissue of This Year's Model. On this reissue, though, Rhino has added a decent number of additional tracks, including alternate versions of ""You Belong to Me,"" ""Radio, Radio,"" ""This Year's Girl,"" and ""(I Don't Want To Go To) Chelsea."" None of these versions are nearly as good as those that appear on the original record, but every song on the bonus disc is cast in a sufficiently different light from its album counterpart to unquestionably warrant inclusion. Simply put, Rhino couldn't have done a much better job here. And it's a good thing, too, since this album deserves nothing less than a flawless package. Perfectly balancing the raw energy of My Aim Is True with the more elegant pop songwriting that would come to characterize much of his later work, This Year's Model is not only Costello's best work, but one of the most distinctively brilliant albums ever to be released. For fans of rock music bursting with wit and character, it really just doesn't get any better than this.",,10,
We Are The Boggs We Are,The Boggs,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a33b5e6ef959693205d4/1:1/w_160/efc0eab4.jpg,2002-05-09 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/847-we-are-the-boggs-we-are/,Arena Rock,"We're a third of the way through 2002, and we might already have a winner for the coveted Most Misleading Album Cover Of The Year award. Squint your eyes and take a look: a bunch of meticulously rumpled bedheaded ladies and gents lounging on a vintage couch, one of whom is even reading a magazine with the Strokes on the cover for chrissakes. What's more, The Boggs are on Arena Rock Recordings, based in the trendy, scene-making borough known as Brooklyn (invest in Queens, people). So they've gotta be one of them garage bands the kids are diggin' these days, like the Yeah Yeah Yeahs or the Mooney Suzuki, right? Ahhh, but my skin-deep deductive powers show their complete inadequacy approximately five seconds into the album, when opener ""Whiskey and Rye"" blasts off not with fuzzy power chords but with fierce mandolin strumming. It quickly becomes clear that the garage from which the Boggs' music emanates must be hay-strewn, with a lucky horseshoe tacked above the door-- if it's not a barn. More than any NME flavor-of-the-month band, The Boggs come off as kinfolk to The Pogues, with their reverence for traditional music and Jason Friedman's failed-Breathalyzer-test slur. Rather than the spooky melodies of the Green Isle, however, good ol' American bluegrass lies at the heart of The Boggs' music, no doubt sporting overalls and a straw hat to boot. The Boggs seem less concerned with grafting old-fashioned sensibilities to 21st century innovations than they are with creating the most authentic-sounding facsimile of pre-Nashville country music possible. While the concept of attractive New York thrift-shoppers playing Appalachian folk may have a certain white-rapper sheen of questionable credibility to it, The Boggs at least know how to record their hoedowns properly. The sound is kept raw as a carpet burn, with the studio tracks sounding like the players are all hunched around a single microphone, the music blurred into a mish-mash of fiddle, accordion, harmonica, and found-item percussion. ""On North Wood Ground"" and the male/female call-response tune ""Emily, O, Emily"" take it even further, with answering machine-level sound that aims to replicate the days when wax cylinders were the industry standard. Sadly, The Boggs frequently seem to forget the other aspect of high-quality bluegrass: keeping things lightning-fast and ADD-short. ""A Picnic Lunch Packed for Two"" and ""The Airborne Station"" both do a bang-up job of showing why punk is just a couple steps down the genre family tree from bluegrass. But on other tracks the simple, repetitious arrangements get a little tiresome. With little variation in song structure, and with Friedman not exactly a fountain of lyrical enunciation, there's not much to hold a listener's interest beyond the first couple times through the verse/chorus on ""Beside the Windowsill"" or ""How Long?"" Still, you have to credit The Boggs with having a different sound, one that allows me to use country-fried terms like 'barn-burning' and 'skeedaddle-rific' to describe above-average tracks like ""Over the Way"" and ""A Direction Taken."" It's amusing to imagine the Camper Van Beethoven-like outsider role they must play in the ultra-cool Brooklyn scene, performing in front of crowds too concerned with maintaining their studied ennui poses to give the music the elbows-splayed chicken dance it occasionally deserves. While We Are The Boggs We Are might only be a fair collection of old-timey music, at least it doesn't have the nasty Grammy aftertaste of the O Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack. Plus, they're a lot cuter than Ralph Stanley.","We're a third of the way through 2002, and we might already have a winner for the coveted Most ...

A Kind of Closure,Tram,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7f19d034d5c69bf3912/1:1/w_160/fe02bb90.jpg,2002-05-08 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8128-a-kind-of-closure/,Jetset,"Slow down, man. No, slower than that. A little slower. Okay, you're almost there, just a bit slower. Right, now you're moving at roughly the same speed as Tram, one of the least propulsive rock acts in Britain I can think of. Only once over the course of ten songs on their third album, A Kind of Closure, does the band even break 80 bpm, on the relatively galloping ""Only Then."" Of course, that's not necessarily a bad thing, though. Low move at a snail's pace through everything they do and everybody loves them, right? For their part, Tram take their slowcore approach very seriously, allowing the lush arrangements sitting on top of the barely-there drums and sparsely strummed guitars to draw you into their world. Once you're there, Paul Anderson lies in wait with a veritable arsenal of downtrodden lyrics to bring you down, or, depending on your mood, simply put you to sleep. Anderson's high, fragile voice manages to cut through even the densest music on the album, occasionally rising to a fey falsetto somewhat reminiscent of Geneva's Andrew Montgomery. Of course, in this context, the word fragile simply refers to his tone, and not to his ability-- too often ""fragile"" is simply a word used to nicely say ""barely in tune,"" but Anderson's vocals have a genuine, glass-like clarity and vulnerability to them, especially when he nails those high notes. Anderson and his partner, drummer Nick Avery, have managed to assemble a stronger batch of songs for A Kind of Closure than for either of their previous efforts, hitting their stride early with the trapped-in-ice loneliness of opener ""Three Years."" All eyes are cast down as Anderson delivers tidbits like, ""Detected a joy/ He knew was a flaw,"" in a piercing falsetto before a solid piano part pulls him from the iceflow and onto the dry ground of the chorus. That's followed by the more rhythmically inclined ""Forlorn Labour"" and the stark title track, which opens with the lines, ""There's a real lack of compassion in your voice/ As you tell me the news."" The song builds to a stunning conclusion as an orchestral freezer blast of strings and horns carries you to the album's country-tinged and decidedly warmer midsection. ""A Painful Education"" is laced with lazy fiddle and steel guitar, but it's one of the few songs that fails to really go anywhere, instead content to drag slowly along on an acoustic guitar base, without the benefit of Avery's percussion. ""Forgive Me Dear"" fares much better with its soft fingerpicking and understated drums, using the steel more texturally and coloring the vocal with some very subtle Leslie. As strong as most of the vocal tracks are, though, two of the album's standouts are actually instrumentals-- the brief, horn-drenched ""Theme"" and the comparetively uptempo waltz ""The Hope Has Been Taken Away."" The latter begins slowly, with just minimal guitar and muted trumpet, but the drums soon drag it lurching forward, strings swirling in the undertow. The horns enter with close, dissonant voicings, recalling a slightly tamer version of second-LP Tindersticks. The unfortunate thing for a band like Tram is that their appeal is likely to always be limited simply because of their chosen range of tempos. And there are always moments where it gets somewhat tiresome-- at their sparsest, Tram fail to give off much steam, but for the most part there's enough going on to keep you invested. Based on their three albums so far, Tram are on an upward quality curve, which leaves a lot of hope that they might yet make a whole album full of the tension and stately grace that mark the best moments here. For now, if you're looking for a quiet, slow album that's easy to spend a lot of time with, this one comes highly recommended.","Slow down, man. No, slower than that. A little slower.

CIA Headquarters
McLean, VA 22101 Dear Mr. Tenet, Thank you for your May 3 memo (your ref. ""Pitchfork! I want some answers!""). I can understand your concern in the matter of Luke Slater and his recent Alright on Top release. In this reply, I plan to outline for you my understanding of the situation, what led to its occurrence and what remedies I have already put in place to prevent it from happening again. Allow me to briefly outline Pitchfork's engagement with Slater. First and foremost, I would like to state categorically that Slater has been one of Pitchfork's most effective operatives, domestic or overseas. Since joining the covert program, Slater has, until now, never failed to follow through on the program's directive, namely to offset and countermand hostile musical activities. Ever since one of our field operatives discovered the fifteen-year-old Slater manipulating his Commodore 64's sound card, Pitchfork Covert Operations (PCO) has recognized Slater's value in the struggle against the menace of formulaic music. In 1987, PCO sent Slater three truckloads of equipment and the back catalogs of Pitchfork-funded Detroit techno labels Transmat and Planet E. With little instruction, Slater began to prove his worth. His first releases on the UK GPR label under his own name and as Morganistic more than met expectations. With the unveiling of his Planetary Assault Systems project in 1992, PCO decided to maintain only a weather eye on Slater's activities. No one at PCO saw reason to monitor him any more heavily. In fact, his multi-album deal with Mute's techno division, Novamute, confirmed that PCO could trust Slater to carry out his mission without constant supervision. I need not remind you that many Americans are alive and enjoying fine music today because of Slater's ambitious and innovative Freek Funk and Wireless albums. When PCO's UK field office reported that Slater had communicated that his next album would be a slight change of direction and that he was introducing vocals, we saw no need to inquire any further. At the time, you will recall that PCO's budget was cut and POTUS had instructed you to ensure that something musically substantial should come out of his home state. If I may remind you, this confluence of events severely compromised PCO activities. Not only was the operating budget slashed, but I had to divert 86% of what was left to guarantee the actualization of POTUS' executive order. Do you know how much leave I had to cancel, how much mandatory overtime I had to insist upon in order to transform four Austin, TX douchebags into the cream of the indie rock nation? Hookwinking hipsters with a 10.0 isn't like falling off a log, sir. In short, Source Tags and Codes about crippled PCO. Something like Alright on Top was bound to happen. At first glance, Alright on Top seems a viable proposition-- Slater's UK spin on Motor City techno with vocals from Ricky Barrow, formerly of UK social-consciousness techno act The Aloof. I think you'd agree that that the single and album opener, ""Nothing At All"" pair up perfectly. Barrow's mannered R&B; moan is rendered all the more forcefulby Slater's relentless stomping techno funk. But the subsequent tracks definitely warrant thorough investigation. For one, I want to know from where Slater acquired that blip kick drum, outlawed by UN treaty since the 1993 Culture Beat incident. Similar Euro pappy trance vibes occur throughout Alright on Top. Slater is content to make his songs as banal as possible, and Barrow is content to croon his moon-in-June type lyrics as if no one really cares. Occasionally Slater takes on vocal duties and employs a vocoder, the use of which goes against internal PCO policy after the Cher debacle. But Slater's use of the device in no way contravenes international treaties. Alright on Top closes with (and I think you'll not deny this, sir) the unequivocal return-to-form ""Doctor of Divinity,"" which at least gives me hope for the future of Slater's activities. I share your concern over symbolically disguised messages in the cover art. It doesn't take a Hoover or a McCarthy to recognize that the Trimphone prominently featured on the cover is nothing less that an invitation to wayward former Soviet Bloc nations to contact Slater about possible double-agent activities. Likewise, Slater's Rollerball costume proclaims his intent to go rogue. Remember Kim Philby? The British do have a track record of defecting and spilling the proverbial beans. To prevent such a disaster, I have taken steps to insure that Slater stays within the PCO program and furthers its crucial aims. Though I foresee no improvement in PCO's budgetary constraints, I will divert funds from other projects. Because the Trail of Dead project has successfully placed Texans at the top of the indie rock mountain (BTW, where was POTUS' acknowledgment or thank you card?) and PCO has contained the electroclash threat to just one section of Brooklyn, I have enough resources to guarantee the ongoing success of Slater and of the entire PCO. Substandard music will one day be eradicated from this world. My loyal and devoted team and I are proud to be part of this war on artistic terrorism. God bless America! Yours truly,

A Warm and Yeasty Corner EP,Appendix Out,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0d2c0084474cd0bfc72/1:1/w_160/76fb329f.gif,2002-05-08 05:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/244-a-warm-and-yeasty-corner-ep/,Shinglestreet,"Ali Roberts is the kind of guy you hope to have around if you ever find yourself stuck in a Scottish pub waiting for the rain to stop. Just put a guitar in his hands, keep the pints coming, and I imagine he could entertain you all night with songs and stories. Together with his band Appendix Out, Roberts has put out some of the best neo-folk in recent years, in the vein of Pentangle meets Palace, without sounding too ironic or revivalistic. But he does seem to have a vast supply of traditional songs and cover tunes haunting the recesses of his mind all the same. Last year, he released an album's worth of English and Scottish folk standards under his own name called The Crook of My Arm. This EP, A Warm and Yeasty Corner, gathers five covers under the full banner of Appendix Out. While cynics may say this is just a time-stall tactic in lieu of new original material from the band, when the results are this good, bring it on! The EP starts out with a song from Vashti Bunyan, a pastoral ballad called ""Window Over the Bay."" Roberts' voice creaks and moans as if he's just returned from a long fishing voyage, and, together with the slow, rollicking pace of the song, the images of rest and contentment become heartbreakingly remote: the longing is palpable. In Bunyan's original, the song conveys a feeling of hippie idealism. Here it's much more forlorn, almost bleak. By the way, if your unfamiliar with Vashti Bunyan, by all means, seek her music out if you're a fan of Nick Drake-- and these days, who isn't? ""Sally Free and Easy"" is next, a song written by English folky Cyril Tawny, who's best known for sea chanteys like this (and particularly for this very song). The version here is a fairly straight reading of the old tune featuring some lovely double bass and piano accompaniment. Ewan Macoll's ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" is mostly just piano and Roberts' voice. Within the world of British folk, covering Macoll is kinda like covering Dylan-- everyone does it. Hell, artists as diverse as the Pogues and Zamfir (master of the par flute!) have done it. With that kind of range, you know a songwriter is touching on some deep, universal issues. The spare ambience created by this reading reminds me more of Bonnie Prince Billy's ""I See a Darkness"" each time I hear it. Next is kind of the oddball of the bunch: The Magnetic Fields' ""Josephine."" By this point, it's high time for some sort of shift ir tone in the EP, and this song's postmodern wordings and distant orgar drone do the job. But it's quickly back to 60s British folkies, with probably the most recognizable track rounding things out. The Incredible String Band's ""A Very Cellular Song"" (which has nothing to do with cell phones, unless those kids were far more visionary then I give them credit for) is a singalong number, with but with one verse and lasting 4\xBD minutes (though the original is something like twelve). It provides the perfect coda for this small, heartfelt collection, as Roberts and the full cast sing, ""The pure light within you guide your way on."" A Warm and Yeasty Corner might not get you through the dark night of the soul, but it's enough to point you in the right direction. And at the very least, it's a fine way to kill some time as you wait for the storm to pass.","Ali Roberts is the kind of guy you hope to have around if you ever\r\n\ find yourself stuck ...

The Evil One (Plus One),Roky Erickson & The Aliens,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc9ec0084474cd0c2b1d/1:1/w_160/226062d3.jpg,2002-05-08 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2827-the-evil-one-plus-one/,Sympathy for the Record Industry,"I hate to reduce the suffering of the mentally ill to spectacle, but damn they're entertaining! Every place I've lived in the lumpy American South has sustained a disproportionate number of tenured schizophrenics. Where I live now, on any given day-- in fact, every day-- one may spot some poor souls under compulsion to conduct counterintuitive acts in the streets, as if hexed into being involuntary performance artists. One fellow 'sieg-heils' at intersections. Another puts his head inside the Free Real Estate Guide dispenser and bellows, ""Bushels of wheat everywhere!"" One covers the city in magic marker formulas such as ""CBS minus HMO equals TAMPA."" A man resembling Christopher Lloyd wraps his right arm in electrical tape and calls everyone ""Honeypardner."" Asymmetrical women engage in heated arguments with themselves on every other public bench. Yesterday, a man grabbed my hand and tried in a series of abrupt tugs to drag me down the street with him, asking, ""I know you know me! Where my trees at? You going to get me some more trees, dawg?"" And just this morning, returning a book to the downtown library, I witnessed a screaming man trying to shake something only he could see out of a huge tree, like a live-action Bosch variation on the remote-island strandees of comics and cartoons. To be a jerk and evaluate their suffering aesthetically, though, I find it odd that much of the personal mythologies of the schizophrenics I've met are really unoriginal. Often, the sufferers just inflict upon themselves some conspiracy involving proper nouns from the three most obvious powers-at-hand: the government, the Bible, and-- strangest of all, I think-- pop culture. I know a schizophrenic who posits that we all live in the Starship Enterprise, and another who believes that the world is controlled by the original MTV VJs. Advocate for the mentally ill Ken Steele admits in his posthumous memoir The Day the Voices Stopped that TV and the radio tortured him the most, as demon voices would join in commercials, or the chorus of ""na-na-na-na, hey-hey-hey, goodbye."" Even pop genius Daniel Johnston's lore is populated by copywritten entities like Casper the Friendly Ghost and Captain America. And who runs former Thirteenth Floor Elevator Roky Erickson's shadow government? Silly B-movie monsters. Roky isn't bothered by the fact that old movie monsters were bipedal failures of the imagination (ever consider what a true abomination of nature would look like?) with tacked-on social messages (venereal disease, puberty, nukes are bad). Sympathy for the Record Industry is putting that White Stripes money to good use and re-releasing Roky's best post-breakdown album, offered in many forms and under many names since it was produced by Creedence bassist Stu Cook in 1980. You heard it here first: after Ron Howard's impish brother gets Jack Black to play Roky in the film An Unbeautiful Mind, this album will be huge, and showcased in a mega-display right beside White Blood Cells at your local Best Buy. Accompanied by wailing, plasticky guitars and tight, propulsive drumming, a meth-sparked Roky warns his listeners of the monsters' power in a passionate, authoritative Texan drawl. Inarguably strong hooks abound, whether Roky is running from the gut-throwing ""Creature with the Atom Brain"" or demanding that you ""Stand for the Fire Demon."" The atmospheric slo-momentum of ""Night of the Vampire"" even gives CCR's ""Bad Moon Rising"" a run for its blood money. But the undisputed showstopper is ""I Think of Demons,"" a contagious love ballad on which Roky dedicates all of his Luciferian dialogues to a certain special someone: ""I think of demons-- [pause]-- for you."" Close on that killer track's heels is the uncanny ""I Walked with a Zombie,"" on which Roky and the band do a call-and-response affirmation of the fact that he and the undead co-stroll, which accumulates to some authentically stirring Caucasian doo-wop. The bonuses on disc two (interviews, demos, rarities) are dandy, but the album is treasure enough. Its retro-metal chops have more kaboom than the irony-diluted pap of current poseurs, and its bent lyrics mop the floor with wannabe-kooks like Jad Fair. Some savvy touches-- such as Roky's progressive pre-PC designation that the swamp monsters are ""alligator-persons""-- hint that Roky was more lucid than he let on. Maybe this record was his metaphorical way of communicating that he'd foreseen that the Reagan administration would reduce Americans to extras in a poorly acted horror film. If you can get past Roky's benevolent-Manson persona and ignore the extratextual psychodrama, there's a lot of rock to love here-- especially if you find yourself getting bonkers during the last hour of an interstate road trip. The Evil One is a dashboard-pounding salve for those moments when the deer on the roadside start levitating and whispering backwards lullabies.","I hate to reduce the suffering of the mentally ill to spectacle, but damn they're entertaining!

ABCS,Various Artists,by: Michael Bernstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fe413d1975652138255/1:1/w_160/cd6f2c3d.gif,2002-05-07 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10-abcs/,Troubleman Unlimited,"ABCS are all about unity. Their bandname comes from the first letters of their last names, and their album cover shows three slightly slouching skeletons all decked out in a green glow. Their album is a proclamation about just how tight a band can get. By wielding sax (Gabe Andruzzi), drums (Josh Blair), and accordion (Pete Cafarella), ABCS deftly flaunt their skills by dealing in abrupt time changes, start and stop progressions, and a heavy mixture of solo, duet and trio work while remaining almost entirely outside of any obvious rock context. The unity demonstrated throughout the six songs on ABCS relies on the band's incorporation of strange instrumentation. An accordion is yanked out of its usual Germanic setting and thrust into a punk rock Terry Riley/Phil Glass jam that references polka, ska, and Pauline Oliveros. The sax, which sticks more strictly to its typical jazz context and occasionally adds breathy, ambient elements, is constantly yelling across the room at the other instruments, ignoring their rabid retorts. This album is the ABCS' debut release, and it shines with all the enthusiasm of anything new. It starts on an up note, kicking through the door and screaming, and doesn't stop pushing until the whole fucking mess grinds to a halt. It's mesmerizing and, oddly, very fresh sounding: though obviously informed by a variety of styles and philosophies, ABCS manage to avoid getting stuck on any of them. And there's where ABCs really transcend their contemporaries: transition. The best improvisers are those who can shuffle in and out of various modes while remaining on all the time. These guys benefit from the same skills by keeping things dynamic, yet recognizable. And because they'll continue to play with each other in a way that is truly with each other, liberally using alchemy and accordion to accomplish their tasks, the album stands as a true testament to 1 + 1 + 1 = 1.","ABCS are all about unity.

On Top,Rye Coalition,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2e1c0084474cd0c0146/1:1/w_160/634b9f79.jpg,2002-05-07 05:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6883-on-top/,Tiger Style,"I'm not going to lie to you, kids, and I want you to know that. I care about you. (Well, most of you.) So I'll be honest. Rock isn't always pretty, but sometimes that's just the way it's gotta be. Believe me, then, when I say that Rye Coalition's new album, On Top, is downright ugly, but rocks like it's about to go out of style. So all of you who just want another pretty face can stick to the safety of The Strokes and Weezer. In the meantime, Rye Coalition is gonna be busy defining arena-ready indie rock without any pretty-boy theatrics, so get out of the way or be crushed underfoot. On Top is so relentlessly energetic that from the moment Rye Coalition begins to stomp and bruise their way through the album, no one stands a chance. Once they get moving, all you can do is be dragged through the mud behind them. By the time the album ends, you're filthy, the wind has been knocked out of you and your organs hurt from the impact, but, like Loverboy, you've loved every minute of it. The only 'break' to be found is on the bluesy ""Freshly Frankness,"" which wouldn't exactly sound out of place on White Blood Cells-- if, uh, Jack White took steroids. But before I forget, the lyrics suck big time. If they're tongue-in-cheek, Ralph Cuseglio's delivery is too straight-faced to let on. Don't worry too much, though, since lyrics only matter if you can understand them-- which in this case you can't. (Just don't open the liners and you'll be fine.) Cuseglio spits and froths his way through every song with such manic adrenaline that he must be hooked to some kind of goddamn rock and roll I.V. And for their part, the rest of the band matches him, with jagged guitar lines dominating and kicking like a gas-powered mule (you heard me). On the rare occasions when Justin Morrey's bass is able to bust through the mix, I can hear Shellac-- and I probably don't need to tell you, but that's a good thing. Now, this is a pretty straightforward album, so the possibilities do exhaust themselves somewhat by the end; there's only so much that can be done with this sort of visceral, no-frills rock. But just as doubts regarding this album's staying power creep in, the showpiece closer, ""Honky, Please,"" shatters them Conan-style. The track is immediately set apart by the awkward opening sounds of seagulls and a garbage truck in reverse gear, before it launches into a menacing guitar riff. The instrumentation builds, collapses under its own weight, then resurges with such a massively gut-wrenching crescendo that nothing can follow it. So nothing does. Rye Coalition may not be what anyone had in mind when rock and roll was developed, but that's only because they weren't thinking hard enough. Did I mention the record was engineered by Steve Albini? If you don't take my word for it, at least trust Steve not to steer you wrong. Steve says, ""On Top is a juggernaut of an album.""

The River Made No Sound,Pan American,by: Will Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb3ec0084474cd0c27ef/1:1/w_160/3f78065f.jpg,2002-05-07 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6129-the-river-made-no-sound/,Kranky,"Labradford have always enjoyed a broader appeal than you would imagine appropriate. It has to do with their approach: rather than adhere to strict minimalism, the trio come across as humble craftsmen content to make quiet music. Like Kranky labelmates Stars of the Lid and Low, they've always been amenable to collaborations, and side projects like Aix Em Klemm and Pan American have been just as rewarding. The latter is a personal favorite, probably because Labradford guitarist Mark Nelson has chosen to explore more electronic areas. Pan American's last release, 360 Business/360 Bypass, was a dense, beautiful record, colored on two tracks by Rob Mazurek's cornet. Nelson reached a particular peak with ""Code,"" a gently-drifting pulsecloud paired with vocals from Mimi Parker and Alan Sparhawk of Low. Nelson's newest, The River Made No Sound, is very sparse in comparison. ""Plains"" begins with a treated piano tracing its steps in the darkness. The path converges on itself, quickening in time as patches of white noise appear, but little else happens. It's a performance that's repeated two songs later, except the plinks become waves of sound, and the hubbub of a muted crowd sample intensifies the feeling of isolation. There's an unmistakably clinical tone to these pieces, a sense that the basic pattern followed by the notes will not deviate from course. It's a feeling that pervades throughout the album-- there's something too smooth about this pretty mood music. ""For a Running Dog"" might actually be a bit of a Pavlovian behavioral test. It kicks in with the generic micro-house pads that labels like Kompakt have been treating as their doormat calling-card. Nelson pours warm reverb over the frame, and not much changes for the next eight minutes. The constant thuds have a nice hypnotic effect, of course, but there's zero variation and it quickly gets dull. There's more going on in ""Red Line,"" from the faint locomotive chugging to the high-pitched guitar noodling. The expected glitch tick pumps in, though, and nine minutes pass in monotony. Obviously, the tactic is to draw attention as much to the space between the beats as the actual sounds themselves. Like the illusion that occurs on a grid, where the eye sees black squares on the white lines that intersect, the listener realizes a sort of inverse rhythm. The problem is that the negative space opened up on The River Made No Sound is occasionally interesting but really not all that worthy of your attention. Artists like Nurse With Wound and John Zorn have done incredible things with the tension underlying these relationships, but Pan American seem to falter here. You find yourself waiting for surprises. They occur only occasionally, as on ""Raised Wall,"" which dispels the constancy of ""Red Line"" with a flux of samples and distortion a la Oval. ""St. Cloud"" exemplifies the progressive flow that we want: marbles roll scattershot across the speakers, and the bass rumbles a little later in each passing measure. Unfortunately, unless you have one of those air-traffic-control-type headphones, you're only going to hear it well on your home speakers. Another strike: this album won't sound good on little earbuds. The low rating isn't to suggest that the music here is necessarily bad, just that it's disappointingly average. There's little that distinguishes itself, and the 4/4 thump dominates the mix and too often grounds the ethereal elements that should be set free. The bass isn't as sexy as the throbbing dub of Berlin's Rhythm & Sound, nor as brilliantly paranoiac and confining as Plastikman's Consumed. The River Made No Sound: movement without evidence. It's a clear summation, but it doesn't make for very compelling music.","Labradford have always enjoyed a broader appeal than you would imagine appropriate.

Waters in Azure,Steffen Basho-Junghans,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba3a5e6ef95969322b4c/1:1/w_160/ef0b0bec.jpg,2002-05-07 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4316-waters-in-azure/,Strange Attractors Audio House,"Earlier today, I overheard this kid talking about how much he hated the accordion. My curiosity piqued, I craned my head slightly in his direction to hear how he'd justify his blanket disgust for all music produced by this one unfortunate instrument, and through a wall of half-chewed food he provided this: ""Cause, you know, it sounds like shit."" ""That's it?"" I thought. Surely there must be something deeper. But as he and his friends went on talking, it became pretty clear that this guy didn't even really know what an accordion could do. He seemed to limit its range solely to polka and romantic French guys on Paris street corners busking for change. I'd wager dollars to donuts he's never really sat back and thought about the fact that the instrument does a lot more than that. It shows up on Calexico albums playing ambient backdrops, and just today I heard a man playing one to such beautiful effect in Harvard Square that I actually stopped to listen for a bit and threw some change in his case. My point is that this kid I overheard at lunch today really had no idea what he was talking about-- he was just relying on limited information to make a snap judgment on an instrument's capabilities. I didn't bother saying anything to him, but it got me thinking about all the great music that never would have been made if more people thought about musical instruments that way. If Bartok had just stuck to writing for the violin the same way everyone before him had, we never would have had his amazing string quartets or ""Music for Strings, Percussion & Celeste."" Likewise for the steel-string acoustic guitar. Though in most minds it was considered primarily for accompanying a singer or another instrumentalist, a trio of guitarists recording for the Takoma label changed all that in the early 60s. Together, John Fahey, Robbie ""Basho"" Robinson, and Leo Kottke expanded the lexicon of the steel-stringed acoustic guitar well beyond what most people at the time could have imagined. It was possible mostly because the three guitarists actively tried to expand their instrument's language and refused to recognize its perceived limitations. This is where a young German named Steffen Basho Junghans comes in (you may recognize the Basho from the names above-- it's Junghans' tribute to his principal mentor). On his second American release (he has several others in his homeland, though all are out of print), Junghans seems poised to take up the mantle established by those three all those years ago. He approaches the acoustic guitar from every conceivable angle, milking its sonic capabilities for every last unique sound he can drag out of it, and the results are frequently stunning. On Waters in Azure, Junghans builds on the precedent of his earlier works-- like Song of the Earth, which dealt with instrumental development of elemental themes: fire, air, earth, and water. Here Junghans focuses on water only, crafting four pieces of solo guitar music that alternately flow freely, sit icy and static or envelop like a dense vapor. His liner notes reference the three-part opening suite ""Water"" as a rumination on the different characteristics of water, and what at first sounds remarkably pretentious actually turns out to be somewhat accurate. Playing a 12-string guitar with a slide, he moves between slippery portamentos, odd fret noise and rapid tremolo picking easily, putting his unique slide technique on full display. Beginning quietly, as though mimicking the approach of a rainstorm, the piece slowly creeps in, before Junghans drops in unexpectedly violent plucks that seem to represent splashes in puddles. ""Outside the Rain"" finds Junghans exploring percussive tapping, as well as offering lush, more traditional-sounding harmonic ideas, albeit played in a highly unconventional tuning. Its free-flowing, organic beauty makes it the album's best piece-- the strumming and chords are subtle, but his hard attack gives the composition a rhythmic surge seemingly at odds with that subtlety. That duality makes for a thoroughly engaging listen. The two pieces for six-string guitar, ""One No1"" and ""Azure No1"" are both textural studies, the former creeping quietly from movement to movement on a minimal structure, while the latter at first sounds as though your CD player is skipping. The approach to the second piece actually has more in common with Steve Reich's phase music pieces than it does with anything that ever came out on Takoma. The only unfortunate thing about this album is that it occasionally has a tendency to drag. As an ambient background for whatever happens to be consuming your time, it's really never objectionable at all, but in terms of active listening, certain passages can become a bit tiresome, mostly due to their intense repetition. The second movement of ""Waters"" and ""Azure No1"" particularly suffer from that. Overall, though, it's an intriguing, sometimes beguiling work from a promising talent who I hope we'll hear a lot more from in the future.","Earlier today, I overheard this kid talking about how much he hated the accordion.

Amorphic Winged,Rob Mazurek,by: David M.

The contents are, without question, less structured than anything we've heard from Isotope 217 or any of Mazurek's Chicago Underground projects. They are also, for better or for worse, befitting of the term ""ambient."" These works, like many moments or Chicago Underground releases, fall very easily into the background. They stand out enough to vaguely alter the mood of a room, but dynamically, they're mostly too static to ever really grab your attention. Unlike the Chicago Underground projects which are known to wander from noise to jazz, and ambient to funky in the period of one ten minute song, this disc stakes its claim firmly in ambient territory, and stays there. At its best, solo improvisation can be an amazing display of a brilliant mind at work-- as Fred Frith put it, ""a continuous dialogue with the unexpected."" At its worst, it can leave an otherwise able musician devoid of any structure or ideas. Well aware of the nature of this two-faced beast, Mazurek has recruited a bunch of the usual suspects to, y'know, hang around the studio and do stuff. The Sea and Cake's Sam Prekop lends some lazy guitar pickings to ""Time Coded Single,"" while Mazurek noodles about with a piano. Isotope 217's Matthew Lux creates a backdrop of noise for Mazurek's signature cornet sound on ""Strange Logics."" ""The Shaping Light"" features a Chicago scenester sextet which includes Ken Brown, John Herndon and Casey Rice. Mazurek's cornet dominates the first few minutes, though soon all that's left is post-delay residue that swirls gently around Tania Bower's vocals. She never sings anything in particular, but her voice is lush enough that it much doesn't matter-- at least not until it too falls under the control of that conniving laptop. Soon, glitched-out vocal chunks are fitting themselves into chopped up horn, Lux's bass, and orgar before Mazurek and his pure, unaffected horn take the fore once again. Elsewhere, the guest contributions are minimal, if not indistinguishable. Most of the sounds on Amorphic Winged come from Mazurek and his laptop. This is the second solo album from Rob and his laptop in the last year, the first being a minimal laptop-only musique concr√©te project on Drag City entitled Orton Socket. Winged Amorphic sees Mazurek attempting to marry the weird clicks and pops of that album with the sound he's generally known for. As such, the computer plays a larger role here than on most of his records. Most of the pieces on Amorphic Winged consist largely of cornet, piano or other such familiar noises being run through patches and effects. ""Steel Cut Oak"" is built around a recording of a piano playing backwards (cool at first, though after nearly twenty minutes, it gets old). ""Clouded Rooms"" is a short number that might as well be called ""If I Fuck With It Enough, You Won't Be Able to Tell What Sound Source I'm Using."" (It's more fun than it sounds.) If any of this sounds familiar, it's probably because a lot of these are essentially the same approaches and techniques Mazurek has beer sprinkling throughout most of his recent work. This isn't a bad thing, per se; much like the Chicago Underground Duo's most recent outing, Amorphic Winged is easy on the ears from start to finish. The problem is that, at times, it may be a bit too easy. So much of this album is like the calm-before-the-storm dynamic of a Chicago Underground piece, that I often find myself waiting for a dramatic climax that never comes. Mazurek's greatest strength is often the patience and understanding he has toward other musicians. It makes sense: some friends stopped by, but they didn't stay too long, leaving Mazurek's sound to float this way and that, without much to hang onto. Still, if you're into the Chicago jazz sound and the stuff-running-through-computer-patches sound, you'll probably find something to like here.","Amorphic Winged is yet another avant-electronic-jazz project from\r\n\ tireless improviser Rob Mazurek.

Life and Death of an American Fourtracker,John Vanderslice,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a91513d19756521397e2/1:1/w_160/9ced4a73.jpg,2002-05-06 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8402-life-and-death-of-an-american-fourtracker/,Barsuk,"Law enforcers and psychiatrists have begun to notice a new deviant sexual behavior on the rise. No, not priests diddling young parishoners-- they've known about that for ages. This unspeakable scourge is called techno-eroticism, a term loosely defined as an inappropriate romantic relations with mechanical objects. In a pornographic underworld too seedy and secret for even Nicolas Cage to penetrate, there are men and women who will stop at nothing to perform hideous and twisted acts against helpless appliances and electronic devices. Yes, I know. Is John Vanderslice a part of this perverted culture? The evidence is inconclusive at this hour, but ""Me and My 424,"" a song from his latest outing, Life and Death of an American Fourtracker, certainly has its implications. Not since Queen drummer Roger Taylor's ode to autophilia (""I'm in Love with My Car"") has a more overt display of man-machine love been foisted on the general public. Heart aflutter over his Tascam Portastudio 424 four-track recorder, Vanderslice lustfully fetishizes the spare parts he hoards in case it breaks down, adding and subtracting tracks, and his boxes upon boxes of TDKs. Freak. Yet despite Vanderslice's shameless display of techno-erotic infatuation, it can at least be said that he and his recording equipment make beautiful music together: ""Me and My 424"" is the most infectious song about (cough cough) 'alternative lifestyles' since ""Lola."" Though he's often mistaken for the New York Yankees' right fielder or the star of Dawson's Creek, Vanderslice is in fact known primarily as the man behind Tiny Telephone studios in San Francisco, where a number of your favorite bands have recorded. But he's no stranger to the other side of the soundproof studio glass, having done the cult band thing with MK Ultra in the nineties before going it solo in the aughts. Thus far, Vanderslice's solo work has occasionally suffered from that common pitfall of producer/musicians-- the tendency to drift away from actual songs towards sound experiments and unnecessarily fancy arrangements. Not so with Fourtracker, which largely finds its creator emphasizing his ear for a snappy melody over his desire to advertise the studio. The adjustment allows Vanderslice to serve up his thickest, juiciest slabs of honey-baked pop yet, under the umbrella of a concept album lyrically expanding on the teenage melodrama and aquatic imagery of The Who's ""Drowned."" Placing songwriting at the top of his priority list doesn't mean Vanderslice gives his compositions sparse environs-- he still throws a veritable encyclopedia of sounds at each and every track. This time around, the wide instrumentation accentuates, rather than distracts from, the central melody-- ""The Apartment"" builds from simple piano and acoustic guitar to big brassy peaks, while melancholy violin and cello temper the bouncy strut of ""Fiend in a Cloud."" Vanderslice excels at picking just the right sonic ingredients to evoke a particular mood, be it the Hawaiian steel guitar that lends ""From Out Here"" its hazy beach feel, or the terse clash of swooping strings and drumming that lends ""Me and My 424"" its tone of romantic desperation. Of course, it never hurts to have some famous friends to spruce up the liner notes, and here Vanderslice drafts Death Cab's cabbie, Spoon's stickman, a Mate of State and a Mountain Goat to do the honors. However, most of the contributions are pretty subtle: Ben Gibbard implicates himself in the techno-erotic world by lending his vocal and guitar to ""Me and My 424,"" Kori Gardner Hammel throws in harmony on ""Nikki Oh Nikki."" John Darnielle pens a couple (surprisingly unremarkable) lyrics. Only Spoon's skinsmeister Jim Eno leaves much of a divot, having a ball inside Vanderslice's crunchy drum sound on ""Fiend in a Cloud"" and ""From Out Here."" In fact, Eno's and Gavin Foster's drumwork plays a considerable role in keeping Fourtracker afloat, as evidenced by the unsatisfying results when Vanderslice turns to less traditional sources of rhythm. The percussion loop on ""Nikki Oh Nikki,"" comprised of coin-filled bags and cresting waves, can't shake its resemblance to Pink Floyd's ""Money,"" cycling endlessly like a funeral dirge and sedating Gardner Hammel's characteristically spunky singing. And ""Amitriptyline"" lacks the energy to overcome its clunky pharmaceutical subject matter, limping along on a nondescript synthesizer preset. But despite the soggy middle that those two songs constitute, the album stands strong alongside its quality button-down pop peers at Barsuk Records. Life and Death of an American Fourtracker finds John Vanderslice taking firm steps towards balancing both his producin' and his writin' personas. He's not quite there yet, but he's darn close. And he lives in California, where it's still legal to 'fuck around' with a four-track, if that's his bag. John, just keep it safe and use lots of head cleaner.","Law enforcers and psychiatrists have begun to notice a new deviant sexual behavior on the rise. No, not priests diddling ...

Maybe We Should Take Some More?,Brother JT,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3b5ea9e61561daa4d3f/1:1/w_160/f74a3947.jpg,2002-05-06 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/962-maybe-we-should-take-some-more/,Birdman,"Outsider music. It's hard to say what it is exactly-- you know it when you hear it, and that's about all you can say. The Rokys, Syds, and Skips, the Jandeks, Johnstons, and er, Shaggs of the musical universe. Artists with inner visions that, when squeaked out into the world, were generally met with amusement if by anything at all. But there's something that unites them, and it's not just weirdness. For example, a lot of mainstream artists are absurdly weird, yet clearly not outsiders. Like, say, Tenacious D. No, there's something more elusive to the whole outsider music phenomenon. It's a kind of hopeless, isolating weirdness, and above all, a mystique surrounding both the music and the musician. Irwin Chusid, author of Songs in the Key of X and perhaps the leading authority on the subject, says the defining quality of outsider music is that it inevitably raises the question, ""What were they thinking?"" As good a definition as any, I'd say. Which brings me to Brother JT. Why would someone want to create faux-outsider rock? Simply, because it's easy. You just act all strange for a really long time, build yourself a cult following, and before you know it, you're an outsider. It may not be lucrative, but it's an easy path for the relatively unambitious to achieve some minor notoriety, and maybe even an occasional free drink down at the local watering hole. Brother JT has been doing this a long time, so he's well on his way. Somewhat of an elder guru in the so-called Psychedelphia scene, JT's Maybe We Should Take Some More? is something like his fifth full-length. Before going solo he played in the garage group The Original Sins and he often hooks up with fellow Philly scenesters Vibrolux to make some noise. On the surface, Maybe We Should Take Some More? is a fairly decent album. You got your acid-fractured folk of the Skip Spence/Roky Erickson variety, your feedback freakouts, and your distant, barely audible muttering filling in the gaps between songs: all the basic trappings of an 'out there' album. And, yeah, it's pretty weird, even a little disturbing if you can turn off your internal critic and just kind of go with it. Apparently, that's what Brother JT is counting on, because if you pay much attention to it at all, Maybe We Should Take Some More? reeks of premeditation, like a calculated attempt to weird you out. Before you even get to the music there's the album title, the smeared cover shot, and songs titles like ""Jesus Guitar/1st Thoughts"" to clue you in that this is drug music. And after listening, it's clear that the good brother and his pals think we should be, like, really freaked out by all the drug references and drug-like imagery and, like, all these trippy sounds, dude. But the album lays all of its cards on the table, then expects you to be intrigued. Where's the hell's the mystery? There are some highlights, the best of which is ""Whatcha Gonna Do?"" which asks the timeless question, ""Whatcha gonna do when there's nothing left to do?"" complete with a guttural blast of feedback and hilarious frog-croak samples punctuating the percussion. It's a great song that pulls you in multiple directions, both humorous and sinister, without making much of a to-do about itself. In short, pure mystery. Unfortunately, there aren't many moments like this one on the album. It so obviously longs to be canonized alongside the work of such American originals as Spence, Erickson and co., yet so much of it just sits at the 'pleasant' level, leading me to believe maybe those involved took too much, got the munchies, and then went for burritos instead of pushing themselves creatively. I almost think that more downright obnoxious moments would help this album. At least then I might ask myself, ""What were they thinking?"" As it stands, the answer is all too obvious.","Outsider music. It's hard to say what it is exactly-- you know it when you hear it, and that ...

Mimic Robot EP,Nobukazu Takemura,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a720c0084474cd0c0b09/1:1/w_160/9f222f7b.gif,2002-05-06 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7921-mimic-robot-ep/,Thrill Jockey,"A guy named Ross drops me an e-mail. He wrote before about Nobukazu Takemura, saying something about hearing an amazing track in concert that wasn't on any of the man's records. Now he tells me that this track is on the new EP, and wonders if I've heard it. I haven't. I didn't even know there was a new EP, somehow. I pull out my wallet and fish for the credit card while surfing over to thrilljockey.com. I find the record in question, something called Mimic Robot. A couple of clicks later and it's on its way. It arrives in four days, incredibly. When I ordered Mouse on Mars' Instrumentals back when it was vinyl-only, it took them a month to get it to me. Mimic Robot has a beautiful pink cover, with a small graphic of a robot getting all 'two turntables and a microphone' in the lower right corner. It has four tracks, and I don't recognize any titles. The first is ""Mimic Robot (12-inch Single Mix)."" This tells me that this track will be found on the next Takemura full-length in pared-down form, just like the vinyl-only Sign EP that preceded Hoshi No Koe. It's not too terribly far from ""Sign"" or ""Meteor,"" in that it's upbeat, with prominent vocoder. But ""Mimic Robot"" is much sparer than Takemura's recent pop work, with just an acoustic bass sample, some flailing drum hits, and the familiar voice. I like it better than ""Sign,"" because the Nintendo palate saturation of the latter gets old after a while. There are hints of that here, but ""Mimic Robot"" is much subtler and more effective. Next is ""Cons (Plant Mix).""This simple piece is one the latest in what's become very long line of Takemura CD-skip tracks. There's almost nothing to it, just one note on synthesizer chopped into pieces and repeated for several minutes. It still works for me, somehow, but to me the CD skip has become sentimental, invoking emotion as dependably as lap steel does for a country music devotee. And that's the warmth that Takemura always brings to this shopworn technique. If you say it's boring as shit, I won't argue. Side B starts with a major disappointment: a track called ""Resign Part 2"" that's actually yet another mix of ""Sign."" I like that song just fine, but this is my fourth version, including the twelve-inch version and an a capella mix on the original EP, plus the single mix included on the full-length. I don't need another, even if this is a serious reworking. Most of the busy midrange is jettisoned, leaving space for deeper, gurglier beats. Finally comes the track that brought this EP to my door, the one that Ross heard Takemura doing live. It's called ""Lost Treasure"" and it again samples an acoustic bass, but the tempo is relaxed and the beats are hip-hop in Toyland style. Another voice through vocoder doesn't so much sing as scat, with unrecognizable words tumbling in unpredictable clusters. This is as stripped-down as Takemura has ever been in a pop context, with room enough for a all sorts of weird noises to pass through, rounded out by a couple vibe solos. I like it, but not quite as much as the title track. And it falls prey to Takemura's greatest weakness-- his inability to end a track at the appropriate time and leave the listener wanting more. Still, here's an EP that's got me back in Takemura mode, looking through release dates for the next full-length. Thanks, Ross.","A guy named Ross drops me an e-mail.

A History of Sport Fishing,Thee More Shallows,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a76013d19756521393d9/1:1/w_160/fa3fe90a.jpg,2002-05-05 05:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7984-a-history-of-sport-fishing/,Megalon,"Due to legalities, the band formerly known as Thee Shallows are now called Thee More Shallows, according to a sticker applied to the CD case of this band's debut album. I'm kind of wondering who threatened to sue the band-- I can't even find another band on All Music Guide called The Shallows. Hell, I can't even find this band on All Music Guide, that's how unknown they are. It's things like this that drive home just how litigious our society has become. Two completely unknown elements battling for the same moniker. It just seems silly. But whether they're Thee Shallows or Thee More Shallows doesn't matter much when you're listening to their music, so let's get our minds off of all that legal mumbo jumbo and move on a bit. Really, calling Thee Shallows a band is being a bit liberal. They're actually a duo comprised of longtime musical collaborators Dee Kesler and Tadas Kisielius, assisted by a large rotating cast of friends-- most notably two able drummers and some string players-- and the result comes across as something like a three-way collision between Death Cab for Cutie, American Analog Set and Yo La Tengo's And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside Out. Tadas' voice is almost a dead ringer for Death Cab's Ben Gibbard, especially when he hits his falsetto, which is just about constantly. His willowy tenor is wrapped in downy layers of clean, skeletal guitars and quietly droning organ. A certain dark moodiness permeates everything, staking its claim on every second of the album, from the gentle violin-dominated instrumental ""Pulchritude"" to the noisy crescendo in the midsection of the title track. By and large, A History of Sport Fishing is a nicely conceived album, opening with the tense ""Where Are You Now?"" Kisielius sings in a near-whisper over a bed of minimal guitars and gradually swelling organ. The band shifts the texture effortlessly throughout the song, making it one of the album's most captivating tracks. While the pacing on that song is nearly perfect, though, the rest of the album doesn't fare quite as well. Even a sterling track like ""The 8th Ring of Hell"" suffers a bit from an overlong guitar intro, though the most tiresome section of the album is easily the title track's aforementioned midsection. Simply put, the band doesn't do a noisy grind well enough to justify attempting it for four full minutes. Elsewhere, songs like the instrumental ""The CruXXX"" manage to develop rhythmically, but offer nothing the least bit melodic to hang on to, instead simply plowing cleanly picked guitar arpeggios into the ground. And that's the album's other primary flaw-- though almost uniformly pleasant, A History of Sport Fishing seldom casts a truly strong hook to reel you into its world. Consequently, the most memorable thing about a song like ""I Do So Have a Sense of Humor"" is its title, though the string arrangement at the end is kind of nice. With some work on building a few more barbs into their sound, Thee Shallows could have a good future with their newly modified name, but for now they'll have to settle for being simply pleasant.","Due to legalities, the band formerly known as Thee Shallows are now called Thee More Shallows, according to a sticker ...

Green Grass of Tunnel,M√∫m,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c40e69fc7814a47cd7c4/1:1/w_160/1ca1a57c.gif,2002-05-05 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5504-green-grass-of-tunnel/,Fat Cat,"Given the recent groundswell of popularity of electronic music among indie fans, M√∫m's growing profile makes perfect sense. With labels like Schematic and Tigerbeat6 working the fringe of DSP lunacy, those looking for a more 'musical' flavor of this sound found a kind friend in M√∫m's Yesterday Was Dramatic, Today Is Okay. M√∫m took the choppy beats and rapid-fire sequencing of IDM and made them soft, sweet and welcoming. It made for a great record that will be recognized as a classic of the genre. Yesterday Was Dramatic, Today Is Okay was actually recorded and released in Iceland in 2000, but only made its way stateside in 2001, partially on the strength of the hype for all things Icelandic that followed in the wake of Sigur Ros' unlikely breakthrough. The quartet, two pairs of beautiful boys and girls that look like the Platonic ideal of indie kid-ness, have spent the time since working on a remix compilation and crafting the follow-up record, Finally We Are No One. This tiny little thing is the teaser, released to coincide with the video planned for the single ""Green Grass of Tunnel."" Unfortunately, this single is on the stingy side, consisting of the album version of the song, a nice instrumental called ""In Through the Lamp,"" and a truncated and pointless ""video edit"" of ""Green Grass of Tunnel."" To me, a short CD containing a ""video edit"" of a song should also have the video in question; there are no extras to be found. In any event, ""Green Grass of Tunnel"" points to a new, more song-based directior for M√∫m. The familiar female vocals are mixed way up front, and rather thar chanting or offering another texture, they're singing an actual song. In fact, the group sounds more like a band here, with a muted backdrop of old-school organ, accordion and drum programming giving their sound a more human touch. It's a nice little song, fragile and pretty as blown glass. ""In Through the Lamp"" is a quiet, drifting instrumental centered around a few notes played or a fuzzy drone of a synth patch. Around this intriguing sound M√∫m layer plucked acoustic guitar, distant horns and sound effects. Something about this track reminds me of a deserted beach on an overcast day: desolate and lonely, yet oddly comforting. Buy ""Green Grass of Tunnel"" if you're a seven-inch collector and M√∫m fanatic looking for a nice b-side. The inclusion of the ""video edit"" of the song is annoying, and I expect it's omitted on the vinyl. Still, it's enough to pique one's interest in the upcoming M√∫m full-length.","Given the recent groundswell of popularity of electronic music among indie fans,\r\n\ M\xFAm's growing profile makes ...

My Aim Is True,Elvis Costello,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a66eb1335d7bf1698e1c/1:1/w_160/a4ed3fd1.jpg,2002-05-05 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1617-my-aim-is-true/,ColumbiaColumbia,"Once upon a time, being a bitter, frustrated male musician didn't mean being a jerkass. Perpetually wronged and rarely laid men were capable of being intelligent about their bitterness, focusing their anger not on the whole of womankind, but on particular women (usually flirts and teases) and attacking these women with a potent blend of wit and bile. Rather than self-aggrandizement, self-deprecation reigned supreme. More importantly, subtlety won out over blatant self-pity or obnoxiousness. Yeah, these gentlemen were angry, but they were smart enough to know what they were angry at-- and geeky enough to include themselves in that category. At the helm of this trend towards new-wave geekdom was Stiff Records, a small label operating out of England with a roster including Ian Dury, Nick Lowe, and the mighty Elvis Costello. With his 1977 debut, My Aim Is True, Costello exploded onto the punk/new-wave scene like a mutant hybrid of Buddy Holly and Johnny Rotten. He had the seething contempt of a punk, but a transparent intelligence, sensitivity, and melodic sense that made him much more interesting than many of his contemporaries. Punks didn't give a fuck; Elvis was sensitive enough to not only give a fuck, but smart enough to be pissed off and disturbed by that fuck. On My Aim Is True, Elvis' raw energy comes through in a way that's never completely recaptured on later records. While the songs range from mellow country twang to full-on, spitting assault, there's a strange cohesiveness to the album simply by virtue of its rough, rushed feel. Although it's a studio album, there's a latent energy to Nick Lowe's production that grants My Aim Is True all the immediacy of a live show. While Lowe's blunt production certainly enhances the record, the real star here, naturally, is Elvis himself. My Aim Is True is host to some of the best songs Elvis has ever penned. The brief kick in the balls of the opening track, ""Welcome to the Working Week,"" is perhaps the album's perfect mission statement. With poppy ooh's, a catchy melody, and an undeniably sharp edge, the song excellently captures the cyanide-laced slab of peanut brittle that is Elvis. The lyrics are rife with brilliant, subtle innuendo. From the opening line, ""Now that your picture's in the paper/ Being rhythmically admired,"" it's clear that Costello isn't going to stumble into any cheap lyrical traps. A lesser man would have just used some goofy synonym for masturbation; Elvis went and used the phrase ""rhythmically admired."" It's more subtle, more original, and infinitely cooler. That's why you love him. ""Miracle Man,"" ""No Dancing,"" and ""Blame It on Cain"" bring the album down a notch with an off-kilter punky-tonk feel. ""No Dancing,"" the highlight of the three, introduces a Phil Spector-style effect of massive percussion and multitracked vocals. ""Blame It on Cain,"" a typically Costello-ish tale of dissatisfaction, swaggers with twangy country guitar and pained vocals. Clover guitarist John McFee, whose guitar stylings accentuate ""Blame It on Cain,"" makes his grandest statement on the album's next track, ""Alison."" Besides being one of the great melancholy pop songs of all time, ""Alison"" is the finest example of Costello doublespeak to be found anywhere in his catalog. When Elvis sweetly intones, ""My aim is true,"" he could as easily be alluding to shooting his ex-lover as trying to win her back. Lines like, ""Sometimes I wish that I could stop you from talking/ When I hear the silly things that you say,"" are far too loaded and complex to be written off as simple aggression. A similar blend of pop, bitterness, and convoluted imagery comes with ""(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes,"" the catchiest pop song on My Aim Is True, and home to the immortal line, ""I said I'm so happy I could die/ She said 'drop dead' and left with another guy."" ""Less Than Zero,"" a charming ditty about a British fascist, appears in two forms on this reissue-- the original album cut, and a live ""Dallas"" version, in which Costello brilliantly twists the lyrics to focus on Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, rather than the aforementioned fascist Oswald Mosley. While every track on My Aim Is True is great, ""Watching the Detectives"" closes the album at its highest point. A reggae-flavored nod to film noir, the song rumbles with style and force. Elvis' nerdy whine sounds wonderfully displaced amidst the heavy bass and syncopated drumming, and perfectly ties up the vague themes of love and murder running through the record. This new reissue by Rhino allows My Aim Is True to end with ""Watching the Detectives,"" cramming all the bonus tracks onto an extra CD. The bonus tracks themselves are almost identical to those found on the previous Rykodisc reissue, with the addition of the ""Dallas"" version of ""Less Than Zero"" from the Live at El Mocambo disc, and previously unreleased, early versions of ""No Action"" and ""Living in Paradise,"" which both sound excellent. Indeed, these early editions of later Costello songs nicely demonstrate the tradeoffs that occur with later albums. While these versions don't sound as smooth or as distinctively Costello-ish as the later ones, they pack an energy and punch that, in some ways, encapsulates Elvis' intensity better than later renditions. But rather than being gratuitously hateful or aggressive, Elvis treats his bitterness like a fine wine, letting a complex bouquet of anger, doubt, and pity shine through. Wordy, witty, and geeky as fuck, My Aim Is True is without question one of the finest statements of brilliant nerddom ever to be released.","Once upon a time, being a bitter, frustrated male musician didn't mean being a jerkass.

Rock Creek,Capitol City Dusters,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a512ea9e61561daa5053/1:1/w_160/f0a1fc16.jpg,2002-05-05 05:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1290-rock-creek/,Dischord,"Long live Fugazi. Sometimes, Dischord Records just seems like a wacky, dysfunctional family-- despite the understanding and benevolent leadership of its flagship band, the youngsters bristle and either fly away to more lucrative record deals or fizzle out with little in the way of Epitaph. Fugazi travels with undeniable clout. You just don't mess with them. And it's hard for younger bands to avoid getting caught up in vicarious charisma and stand with any sort of equal footing in the greater musical community. I believe whole-heartedly that this is unintentional, but the subliminal message is: don't even try it. The plight of the metaphorical Dischord scions is pretty much equal to that of any celebrity child. It's an uphill battle-- not only to prove your worth, but to prove your worth relative to Fugazi. Perhaps it was a deep sense of foreboding that kept the Capitol City Dusters at bay for almost four years. Their last album, Simplicity, received scant critical praise-- though it must have sold well, because it can be found in almost every used bin across this crazy land. Still, the album garnered them enough attention that any band name involving the word 'Dusters' got scratched off potential bandname lists in garages nationwide. And the Capitol City Dusters sound like a good idea, in theory. Alec Bourgeois (guitarist/vocalist from Severin), Benjamin Azzara (original drummer of the Delta 72), and at least two sort of recognizable bass players before the current Jesse Quitslund (of the Vile Cherubs) are all devoted to bringing the rock in a way only D.C. bands with ties to Dischord can bring the rock. In short, they're light on the debauchery, heavy on the angular riffs. Does it sound like Fugazi? Well, yes, sort of. You can hear the influence-- in fact, you can't escape the influence. The first track, ""Superimposed,"" starts out sounding like an In on the Kill Taker reject, complete with driving single-note guitar, creative drumming and Ian-esque vocals. The sudden onslaught of guitars at the chorus sounds suspiciously recognizable. On the other hand, in an attempt to distance themselves from their obvious influences, the Dusters throw in some really weird structural effects. Halfway through ""Superimposed,"" the song morphs into jangly R.E.M.-sounding alterna-pop (even down to Bourgeois' voice, which sounds eerily like Michael Stipe). From this point on, the album pretty much vacillates between the poppy vein, with recognizable 1-4-5 major-key chord progressions, sing-along verses, and lyrics like ""You said it wasn't all that great in your bed."" The Dusters drift back to more prototypical Dischord territory in songs like ""Reason,"" in which the listener discovers that there is, in fact, ""a season to live in Washington."" Those cherry trees are lovely in the spring, but in the same song, Bourgeois admits ""we fall divided."" Meaning, we assume, the drummer is keener on autumn strolls along the Potomac. To be perfectly honest, much of this album sounds pretty silly to me. The pop to angular post-punk angle doesn't necessary lend credibility when your singer occasionally decides to ape Iggy Pop when singing about having a ""heart like a revolutionary."" I tried listening to Rock Creek as deliberately tongue-in-cheek, but I don't think that's the case. Of course, I'm always willing to admit I'm wrong. Come tomorrow I could find out this is concept album inspired by the National Zoo (located in Rock Creek Park). If that's the case, the chorus lyric in the title track, ""I'll make my mark here in Rock Creek Park,"" could have some pretty hairy implications, especially when coupled with the later sentiment, ""I won't deny the undead."" So they can't write lyrics. Big fucking deal, right? The final track, ""Freedom""-- which, with its dirge-like tempo, half-assed attempts at harmonies, big anthemic chorus, and relationship-tinged lyrics could be considered something of a power ballad-- is really all you need to hear. It sounds boring and incomplete, like fifty songs you've heard before. And here's the worst part: my guess is that your fifty songs would be different than mine. That's just how typical this is. So either Dischord needs to change its D.C.-only policy or provide a sudden influx of struggling musicians with affordable housing to enliven their catalog. If any of you were counting on Capitol City Dusters to lead a D.C. renaissance, you'd best be staking your claims elsewhere.","Long live Fugazi.

When I Was Cruel,Elvis Costello,by: Will Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a66bc0084474cd0c096a/1:1/w_160/0a0a1ed3.jpg,2002-05-05 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1614-when-i-was-cruel/,Island,"Ahhh, if I only had a Latin Grammy for every time some hot air-bloated rock pundit wrote that Bob Dylan's ""still got it,"" that Bruce Springsteen's late-90s social posturing is any more convincing than his Reagan-era material, that the small army of background singers and synthesizers required to create Brian Wilson's Imagination really sound any fresher than, say, ""Kokomo."" For the last seven or eight years, Elvis Costello fans have had great reason for concern. After a stellar showing with the reunited Attractions on 1994's Brutal Youth, Costello released a trio of disappointing releases. 1996's All This Useless Beauty barely used the Attractions, wandering in several different directions at once and recycling material originally written for other artists. 1998's Burt Bacharach collaboration Painted from Memory seemingly aged Costello an extra twenty years, with its preponderance of crooning ballads and arrangements that might as well have been recorded for a Dionne Warwick comeback. And last year's pairing with Anne Sofie von Otter, For the Stars, barely qualified as a Costello release at all, with a predilection for Costello's iffiest material (""Shamed into Love,"" anyone?) and a pair of Tom Waits' more forgettable castoffs. When I Was Cruel, happily, finds Costello tuning his compass with two excellent reference points: his 1986 masterwork Blood and Chocolate and the eclectic showmanship of 1989's Spike. Once again, Costello drafts Attractions Steve Nieve and Pete Thomas into the fold, but with a breath of fresh air in the form of Cracker's Davey Faragher on bass. Costello harnesses some of his Useless Beauty period's greatest strengths-- the wet percussion from Tricky's remix of ""Little Atoms,"" for instance, and the tremolo guitar that dominated ""Complicated Shadows""-- to give his new compositions a contemporary edge while anchoring the music to the ragged, rough-edged guitar sound that's been the signature of Costello's best work. The result is an immediately engrossing and challenging collection of moody, evocative songs-- an entire album of ""I Want You"" and ""Watching the Detectives"" for those so inclined. The cinematic noir of ""When I Was Cruel No. 2,"" with its point-of-view narration and looped female vocal, plays like the torch song from some as-yet unmade David Lynch film-- Twin Peaks meets Portishead in a smoky Italian nightclub. The faux-Beat rhythms of ""Dust"" and outright scat on the jazz-damaged ""Episode of Blonde"" succeed both as prose and dramatic bits of music, easily upstaging Tom Waits' hit-and-miss homages to Kerouac and Ginsberg. The balls-out rock textures of Blood and Chocolate are re-explored on ""Tear Off Your Own Head (It's a Doll Revolution),"" with its thick guitar hooks and powerful blasts of cleverly flanged bass, and ""My Blue Window,"" a cheeky nod to Blood and Chocolate's ""Blue Chair."" The guitar-driven ""Daddy Can I Turn This"" and the meaty, dissonant ""Dissolve"" are Costello-by-the-numbers, tightly wound pop gems that seem to spring painlessly from Costello's loins when he's on a roll. But it's the more experimental pieces on When I Was Cruel that are the most consistently rewarding. The percolating rhythms and locomotive bass on ""Spooky Girlfriend,"" augmented by horns and tight background harmonies, almost sound like Costello backed by Oranges and Lemons-era XTC. Likewise with the complicated pastiche of programmed beats, organ and horns on ""15 Petals,"" a confident and infectious detour into Latin rhythms (think Tito Puente, not Ricky Martin). The measured swells of backwards guitar and deep bass hits on closer ""Radio Silence"" send When I Was Cruel out on an optimistic note-- for the future of music and for Costello's own relevance in the post-modern blipscape of Kid A and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Perhaps When I Was Cruel's sweetest punch is that, at 47, Costello sounds pretty much exactly as he did at 27. Unlike Dylan, Springsteen, Wilson, or Waits-- or, god knows, Lou Reed-- he hasn't had to compromise his music to fit his aging pipes. Costello's at his most entertaining when he cleverly sidesteps an issue rather than confronting it head on, as on the slight misfire of ""45,"" which makes the trite connection between Costello's age and the number of revolutions per minute made by a hit record. Faragher's hyperactive bass proves a savvy addition to Nieve's blasting organ and noodling piano, Thomas' busy rhythms, and Costello's spy-film guitar riffs. Some of Costello's most interesting work has been fatally injured by poor chemistry; When I Was Cruel is a self-confident return to form-- sharp, solid and, though Costello should have nothing to prove-- completely relevant.","Ahhh, if I only had a Latin Grammy for every time some hot air-bloated rock pundit wrote that Bob Dylan ...

Arrhythmia,Anti-Pop Consortium,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0b313d1975652138453/1:1/w_160/fb4eb0d3.jpg,2002-05-02 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/211-arrhythmia/,Warp,"Have you ever felt your heart race or skip a beat? Well, if you weren't dropping X or having a heart attack, chances are what you felt was an arrhythmia-- an irregularity in the rhythm of your heartbeat. Like the title suggests, the Anti-Pop Consortium knows a thing or two about irregular beats. Their latest LP,Arrhythmia, is a study in them, as well as just about everything else irregular, save perhaps my recent string of emergency bowel movements. Anti-Pop Consortium is the charter member of Warp Records' hip-hop club. This should tell you something. In case you haven't been keeping up, Warp has gained worldwide accolades for its roster of IDM trailblazers: Autechre, Boards of Canada, and Aphex Twin, to name only a few. And in case you were wondering, no, APC doesn't sound a hell of a lot like Ludacris. Once someone finally does the hard work of labeling hip-hop's various subgenres, Anti-Pop just might carve out a region known as ""free hip-hop,"" not unlike the free jazz of Sun Ra who the boys cite as a major influence. Their sound is unique, drawing a happy experimental medium somewhere between the ghetto and the laptop (or maybe even the rave), with cerebral lyrics straight from the poetry cafe. To begin with, APC employs a variety of unusual samples: VH-1 Pop-Up Video bubbles, robotic video game bleeps, jingle bells, midsummer's cricket chirps, finger snaps, and the most inventive, an entire song built around the bounce of a ping pong ball (""Ping Pong [The Return]""). Behind the samples are built-from-scratch drum-n-bass beats-- largely sterile and inorganic, favoring programming over sampling dusty vinyl. The results are progressive, glitchy, angular and off-kilter. Again, not Ludacris. Anti-Pop are similarly unconventional in their lyrics, albeit more in their content than in how they flow. So you get a whole track about an unfortunate old soul bent on eliminating soap scum (""We Kill Soap Scum""), and another telling a tale of wisely avoiding crack-ho jailbait (""Minna Street""). The lyrics sound calculated, considered, sometimes profound, and always heady. For all who've heard MCs wax philosophical and come off pretentious, you'll be happy to hear that APC goes the same route, without the turgid results. Highlights include the first proper track, ""Bubbles."" which tends towards more traditional hip-hop, utilizing a P-Funk-style synth-bass hook over congas and hand claps. ""Ghost Lawns"" draws from the ""B.O.B."" school of beats, a seriously uptempo drum-n-bass number with accordingly frenetic rhymes, and the let's-get-ready chants of ""tonight, alright"" by a chorus of young ladies in between verses. Pushing hip-hop's creative boundaries has its pitfalls, however. On Arrhythmia, where progressive equals electronic, the beats occasionally come off as a tad thin. Strange to say, but they just lack soul. This is the only real weakness, but it's a significant one; even though every track is good, none push that adjective past a ""very"" prefix. Perhaps rumpshaking is too much to ask for, but one might like something nasty, or funky, or fierce. Yet despite its shortcomings, Arrhythmia has plenty of appeal, particularly to the indie crowd, for whom progressivism is a badge of pride. And after all, it is the Consortium's best release yet. Just don't expect to see these three on the cover of Source anytime soon.","Have you ever felt your heart race or skip a beat? Well, if you weren't dropping X or having ...

When not puzzling over past hairstyles (why didn't anyone tell me I looked like an idiot?) and wondering how the hell I went through one whole semester without attending a single class and did not get kicked out of college, I get a little misty and sentimental. Those were the days. Lovitt Records. I don't know you people, but you've always struck me as nice guys. Maybe because Lovitt Records began in the town where I once managed to almost flunk out of college (several times), due in no small part to attending shows at which once and future Lovitt bands played. I do not hold this against them. Say what you like about Davis and Nesmith's old band, the Sleepytime Trio. No one else in the world could call a song ""Butter Scaryflies"" and make it sound just as terrifying as the name implies. They were loud. They were self-indulgent. They may have represented the genre formerly known as emo (before the definitions of that got really weird), but they were never boring. And though I don't really listen to that kinda stuff in general, or their CD in particular, with great regularity anymore, it will never be sold back. If you knew the band included members of Milemarker, Men's Recovery Project, Sleepytime Trio, Maximillian Colby-- not a single pop group among them, and each partially responsible for Richmond, VA's reputation as a haven for weirdos on the musical landscape-- you might fear for your eardrums when inserting the CD into your stereo, too. Yet Bats and Mice sound like none of the above bands. There's not a single instance of extended clanging, shattering guitar, fuzzy, unintelligible samples, or vicious yelping on the whole album. This is fortunate for listeners with heart conditions and obscure inner ear conditions, previously denied the ability to listen to Davis and Nesmith for medical reasons. In fact, Believe it Mammals sounds quite a bit like Sunny Day Real Estate. I put this CD on the stereo (my finger resting on the volume control) expecting to be immediately jarred by noise, and instead heard something, well, kinda pretty and melodic. Nothing wrong with that, but kinda anticlimactic if you're all amped up for the antithesis of pretty. I'm not going to eviscerate this band, because, though it isn't my thing, they do it pretty well. If there were a textbook case for the genre currently called emo, I suppose Bats and Mice would fit the bill. There's nothing overtly wimpy about the album: the vocals are confident, and the musicianship is solid. The songs are effectively catchy in that melancholy pop sort of way. Opener ""Safe Bet"" is easily digestible melancholy rock in the Death Cab for Cutie vein, which erupts into a considerable amount of screaming and dissonance at the chorus. It's not terribly pretentious. The string section didn't get flown in from the local orchestra. There are no keyboards, no misguided attempts at new wave, and no covers of your favorite 80's hits. The harmonies, particularly on ""Worst Comes To Worst,"" are subtle and adept. The songs are consistent. Though light on surprises, the melodies resolve to expectation. ""Where's Ann Arbor"" is a standout track of sorts, which drops the rock of the first half of the album (to my mind, the better half, but we're speaking in relative terms here) for a more soul-influenced sound. Believe It Mammals is remarkably consistent. And though full of more scars, tenderness, pain, and hearts than you could shake a stick at, the lyrics stop just shy of sounding like Open Mic Poetry Yield at the Coffee Cantina. Is it boring? Maybe-- I can't say how many of you will go into this album with Sleepytime Trio flashbacks. It's not entirely fair to judge a new band by the prior work of its members, but usually the change isn't this dramatic. And to make matters worse, when seriously edgy musicians start sounding seriously accessible (even radio friendly) overnight, the implications aren't always so savory.","Notes on Believe It Mammals:

May,Richard Youngs,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aadb9d034d5c69bf3f0e/1:1/w_160/07569344.jpg,2002-05-02 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8839-may/,Jagjaguwar,"It's springtime-- what are you doing indoors? Oh, maybe you're at school or work. Well, it's quite nice outside-- I'm inside, too, but just through the window I can feel a light breeze, sunny sky and green everywhere. There's a bird or two whistling, and every so often I can see bits of dandelion seed drift by. God, it must feel really good out there. Good enough to take my guitar, go sit in the garden and strum out a few hymns to mother nature. Except, I don't have a guitar. Or a garden. And strumming out nature hymns sounds too much like something involving John Denver and non-profit organizations to be any fun. What a waste of a day. Unless, that is, you're Richard Youngs. On May, he seems very content to while away the hours serenading the new bloomers and ancient, perennial warmth. Born in Scotland, Youngs' music can vary from experimental psych (last year he released a record with Acid Mothers Temple frontman Makoto Kawabata), to minimalist electronic, to traditional folk. Though he's as prone to use kazoo or detuned piano in his pieces as the acoustic guitar on this release, his releases generally hold the 'less is more' aesthetic in common. He's not lo-fi necessarily, but he has a knack for wringing emotion out of the slightest recording equipment or available instrumentation. The unadorned balladry on May is generally free of unnecessary movement or texture (in that respect, most similar to 1999's Sapphie). You might call this music minimalist folk, because its melodies drift through basic, repetitive guitar figures, like a passive counterpoint to a barely running stream. The accompaniment is at once colorless and metronomic-- not mechanical, but something instinctual and never-changing. Youngs' vocals are reedy (some might say thin), closest in timbre to fellow eccentric Brit Robert Wyatt, and at times seem to lapse into overtones-- the way he elongates his phrasing, compressing his voice to hollow out its natural depth may be off-putting for someone accustomed to more traditionally 'pretty' singing. The songs themselves may have been improvised, as often the lyrics serve little purpose other than to have Youngs be able to say something while he sings. The final tune, ""Wynd Time Wynd,"" uses its title as its complete lyrics, featuring but the smallest variation (""You wynd it all the time""). It's typical for this album, in that it has two parts: the first melody and the second melody. There is no chorus, per se, or maybe there are just two very long choruses. Again, it's the basic statement and subtle variation as restatement that calls to mind minimalism. If you aren't up for very small pleasures, May could quickly become tiresome. Opener ""Neon Winter"" is an extreme example of that technique. Youngs' high-register vocals struggle to carry the simple (almost medieval) melody, while his guitar plays along in unison. When his vocal drops out, the guitar repeats the melody. If you think of a kind of music that might have been played by Celtic druids a thousand years ago to celebrate the new moon, with primitive instruments and even more primitive ideas of what constitutes engaging song, this music makes a lot of sense. On the other hand, if you aren't willing to step into nature, slow down your life's pace and drift, it could seem like torture. ""Bloom of All"" is less Spartan, featuring a more modern folk guitar figure, and some nicely lilting vocals from Youngs. It's barely there, but at least has roots in something post-Renaissance! I won't say this music is necessarily unengaging, because I can imagine a couple of instances where it might really hit the spot. Ideally, the scene I described at the outset, with a breeze and a garden to set the mood, would accommodate this stuff very well. If you don't have those kinds of things at your disposal, you might consider moving to the English countryside and stowing away in someone's old barn for the rest of the season. With May, your surroundings could make all the difference.","It's springtime-- what are you doing indoors? Oh, maybe you're at school or work. Well, it's quite ...

Three Songs EP,Papa M,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fe2b1335d7bf1697ec5/1:1/w_160/addaea13.gif,2002-05-02 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6154-three-songs-ep/,Drag CityDrag City,"Runners-up for the Most Confounding Commodification of the horrible events we've come to compartmentalize as ""the events of September 11"": The ubiquitous flag stickers, adorned with weeping airbrushed eagles and monotheistic imperatives; Official Osama Bin Laden Hunting Licenses (bummer, the back says it's fake); Lee Greenwood reissues, with covers featuring the aggressively trimmed Comeback Beard; The commemorative toboggan, stylishly embroidered as if 'Ground Zero' were a video game or brand of muffler; World Trade Center halter tops, on which the towers bend around the contours of the hootchie underneath, confirming architects' notions that the buildings were phallus brothers. And the winner: why, it's the new Papa M EP, Three Songs, packaged in a glossy envelope that sports, as its sole visual, a vivid photograph of the Papa (Dave Pajo), bedheaded and squinting in a wrinkled t-shirt on a rooftop, as black plumes billow from the New York skyline in the background. At least one of the towers is still standing. The picture somehow outhaunts most of the straightforward, photojournalistic accounts of that morning and manages to capture how we floundered to process its reality by relishing its surreality (people agree with you if you compare 9-11 to movies, but accuse you of spouting geopolitical hoo-hah if you Noam-Pompsky-ly address it as a karmic reaping of seeds sown in Nicaragua, Beirut, Turkey, and Sudan). For starters, the Three Songs cover shot is circular, with blurred edges, as if a view from some vindictive witch's crystal ball. Adding to the alchemy is the foregrounded brick cityscape of (Brooklyn? Newark?) tenements, factories, and warehouses leading up to Manhattan's smoking glass and steel. The picture serves as a time-lapse cross-section of the Industrial Revolution that offers a glimpse of an igneous, purgative devolution. Then there's Papa Pajo, looking like a bored suburban kid dragged out of his car-nap at Old Faithful, happy to not comprehend the significance of what's behind him. Or is Pajo mediating the moment, like an on-scene anchorman, or worse, like the yammering host of an ""America's Wildest Car Chases""? Surely no one involved simply had album cover art in mind? The photo inspires as much outrage and empathy as the moment when the attackers turned the rest of the world into an observation deck. Oh yeah, there's a nifty CD inside, for which the cover functions as a portentous and schlocky epigraph, like the quotes from the Book of Revelation that open cheesy horror movies. (And hey, for all you amateur numerologists and Nostradames out there, this EP's length is 18 minutes, the sum of the digits of the number of the beast!) Pajo's M-centric projects were instrumental affairs until he covered one of the Misfits' most cartoonishly brutal classics back in 1998, and since then he's recast songs by Daniel Johnston, Cat Stevens, and Bob Dylan with a plaintive starkness that's earned him an esteemed berth in Drag City's hierarchy of glorious, mopey balladeers. Many figgered Pajo to be slumming in the world of porch-plink, since his indie-rock resume overqualified him for just about every other genre-- including whatever genre Billy Corgan recruited Pajo's skills for as part of his new project, Zwan. But Pajo's done a bang-up job of paralleling the constipated-diarrhea career arcs of Bonnie Billy Oldham and Smog, releasing 25 short gems (13 singles, 12 compilation appearances) on labels with varying levels of slippery distribution. It's their world; we just shop in it. Pajo's image as a bandmember is that of a renaissance ogre, lurking in the charismatic shadows of other frontmen. And even on his own, he's got a kind of inverse charisma, a Travis Bickle tincture that he finally allows to blossom on ""Rainbow of Gloom,"" quoting Taxi Driver's sentiments about rain washing away the scum. This song and ""Lo the Rose Cease to Bloom"" only involve a harmonica, guitar and keyboard, but they're as engrossing as any of Pajo's more layered soundscapes, as the lyrics bang archetypal Irish folk syntax up against post-everything ennui with a dollop of transcendent carnality. Bookended between these affecting slow-burners, the rousing and anthemic ""O Kentucky"" stands out like the black Ghostbuster; the song is all buildup, as soft drums referee a wholesome piano riff's unfair fight against an obtusely Skynyrdian axe. Like his picture on the cover, Pajo's songs make you wonder: is he this forlorn? Or just hung over? Could he be smirking? This isn't the first time he's invoked tragedy-- the Aerial M album's liner notes credit its genesis to a great flood that year, and that record was a statementless chunk of atmospheric trig-pop that seemed designed to be played before shows to stump insecure completists. The whole mystery's enough to make me want to drop the detached/savvy pose and admit that I love America and this EP, even though its odd case sticks out in my CD collection like a Collateral Damage ticket stub. I need to confess that I drink beer and cry to these songs. Okay, I cry to them sober. Okay, I pretend that Armageddon has broken out, and that we're all doomed, and I fill a plastic kiddie pool with Wendy's Frosty dairy desserts, and blast Papa M.","Runners-up for the Most Confounding Commodification of the horrible events we've come to compartmentalize as ""the events of September ...

Alone at the Microphone,Royal City,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2bcb1335d7bf169856d/1:1/w_160/8ec3b317.jpg,2002-05-01 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6852-alone-at-the-microphone/,Three Gut,"I'm not sure why, but the Canadians seem to beat us Americans at our own game on a fairly regular basis. One need look no further than The Band and its 80% Canuck cast for proof; their first two albums are near-perfect distillations of all that's great in classic American-born music forms. And this is to say nothing of Neil Young. Presumably named after a line from Young's bleak masterpiece ""On the Beach,"" Alone at the Microphone is the second full-length album from the Toronto-based band Royal City. Their debut, At Rush Hour the Cars, was a fragile, bummed out lo-fi bedroom folk gem. Simple, straightforward and exquisite-- even if some of the songs were interchangeable-- it served as the perfect holdover while Hayden lingered in self-imposed exile. But as promising as that album's high points were, hardly anyone could have anticipated this: a dark folk album that effectively ups the ante in the ""old, weird America"" category (to cop a phrase from Greil Marcus) and accomplishes what many faceless, home-bred groups of yokels have been trying to do for the past half-decade. As far as acoustic-based indie folk goes, with its inherent restrictions and boundaries, this album is as good as it's bound to get, kids. Nearly every song on Alone is a finely detailed miniature, each one a new take on despair, loss and (occasionally) solace. Haunting and disturbing imagery is harnessed to beautiful melodies created on banjo, organ, and even steel drums, in addition to traditional rock instrumentation. Sometimes the lyrics are enough to make you wince, as on the stomping, ragged opening track ""Bad Luck"" where a line like, ""I met you in the alley all covered in maggots,"" will just get dropped in there without much warning. Still, the gore never seems gratuitous, always serving the overall purpose of the songs. The first of these songs, despite its rather cheerless title, presents probably the most hopeful moment on the album and its high-water mark. Short and simple, a chiming guitar figure accompanies singer Aaron Riches as he repeats the refrain, ""Ray of light, a pedal in my room/ I will not go forth without you,"" to arresting effect. There is an almost religious quality to Riches' assertion-- after painting a bleak scene with ""shit on the floor,"" the refrain becomes almost heartbreakingly hopeful. It brought me closer to tears than any song has been able to do in a long time. I can already envision coming back to it in years to come, and I can't remember the last time I thought that about a song. ""Rum Tobacco,"" the penultimate song on the album, is another musical exercise in build-up and release, but painted over a broader canvas. After a frustratingly slow start with Riches croaking along, the track finally bursts open with a crash of cymbals before being carried off by a slide guitar solo, then disappearing into a silent void for a good minute before exploding back again into a witches' chorus for the remaining third. It's one of those songs that takes a few listens before you know what twists and turns it's going to take. ""Spacey Basement"" and ""My Brother Is the Meatman"" are really the only two missteps on the 11-song album. And they're not really even bad songs in themselves, it's just that they don't fit very well with the rest. Their lyrical shock tactics seem slightly affected compared to the sinister edge that characterizes the better songs here. Still, even with these few weak moments, compared to Royal City's debut, Alone at the Microphone is a giant step in the right direction. I can't wait to hear what a few more years of touring does to this band. But even as it stands now, with this album, they prove that the best post-modern, devil-haunted, gothic Americana is currently being made by a pack of Canadians. And if there are any questions about authenticity, I give you four words: Music from Big Pink.","I'm not sure why, but the Canadians seem to beat us Americans at our own game on a fairly ...

Lugubrious,O-Type,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b98fea9e61561daa6ffe/1:1/w_160/797ce840.gif,2002-05-01 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5927-lugubrious/,Family Vineyard,"In the beginning, there was noise. No one could really agree where it came from, but everyone was certain it had been through a whole bunch of effects units by the time it got here. Noise: first as a tidal wave, then in short spurts with little bits of silence in between. Next came the drums: kind of meditative, and a little spare. And then, the guitar: a bit jagged, sort of high-pitched. Truth be told, it's hard to describe what any of it sounds like because it's all sort of hard to hear. This is the first thing I noticed about O-Type's Lugubrious-- all of the sounds tend to just bleed into one another, with everything sounding distant, murky and more than a bit flat. There's a blanket of noise, stacked with loosely structured guitar improvisation, gong crashes, drums that go from groping-in-the-dark to rhythmic then back again, and occasional electronic weirdness. Rarely does a single sound stand out long enough to take command of the others, to lead them towards something, anything. In other words, it's generic output from your standard improvised avant-rock band. You know the type: with the rotating door membership, the sporadic schedule of jams, and a wall-of-sound output that's clearly aided by the music-enhancing abilities of hallucinogenic drugs. To be honest, Lugubrious reminds me quite a bit like recordings I've made with friends-- long, generally unstructured, generally mediocre, but not without their moments. It's the sort of thing that's eminently enjoyable to those involved in the production, but generally rates a shrug on anyone else's entertainment scale. Still, I'm not about to put the hardcore smackdown or Lugubrious. While its long drones don't really go anywhere, and the electronic meanderings which emerge from the murk now and again don't particualrly stand out, it's really not terrible stuff. And like, any jam, there are those moments which undeniably work; like the interaction between the two drummers, about halfway through ""Hermit,"" where building cymbal fills and a tightly kept beat emerge from the ambient swamp, only to be swallowed back up in the end. Or the rhythmic electronic crackles that bookshelf the synths-plus-drone track called ""Clearing."" I was fully prepared to go easy on O-Type, to call them a vaguely interesting, if not terribly original quartet of improvisers and ther call it a day. And then it suddenly occurred to me where I knew the names on the cover from. Bruce Anderson, Dale Sophiea, Marc Weinstein, Dave Mahoney? All four of these guys are members of MX-80, one of the first non-Residents related groups to be signed to Ralph Records in the late 70's (we're talking the same graduating class as Renaldo and the Loaf, Yello and Tuxedomoon here). I can't claim to have heard much of their recent work, but I do know that ir their heyday MX-80 was an amazing bunch of musicians, as innovative as they came, always evolving, generally refusing to settle down with a signature sound. But no matter how weird they got, old-school MX-80 always had a certain logic to its abstractions, a reassuring sense that they were taking you somewhere. Which is precisely what O-Type's Lugubrious is missing. Contrary to some beliefs, ""ambient"" is not synonymous with ""aimless."" Lugubrious spends far too much time layering meaningless guitar noodling over a backdrop of thick noise and not nearly enough time giving the listener a reason to keep at it. Elsewhere, the group overcompensates: ""Escape"" pastes a Latin hand-drum and panting sample seemingly ripped from Se√±or Coconut's cover of ""Tour De France"" over guitar feedback and live drumming. But the timbres fail to mesh, and the prerecorded beats actually seem to trip up the live percussion, resulting in a messy pastiche of sounds that were never intended to go together in the first place. These are simple mistakes, the kind countless bands make daily. And frankly, I can't summon up an intense hatred toward musicians who really are trying their best. Unfortunately, Lugubrious was made by musicians with a long career that's yielded plenty of work that's head and shoulders above this. Certainly, there's plenty to be said for all-out self-serving improvisation-- for making music simply for making music's sake. I have no doubt that the recording sessions which spawned Lugubrious were fun and worthwhile for the musicians involved. But fun and worthwhile for the musicians doesn't always translate as fun and worthwhile for the listener. Put quickly and simply: your time and money would be well spent exploring MX-80's fine back catalog. You'll probably find it wasted if you spend it here.","In the beginning, there was noise.

That's right, the guitar can also be used as a compositional tool, and because playing it doesn't require using your mouth or excessive concentration, you can even sing over the music! Atkins exhibits this skill admirably on Nobody Knows This Is Everywhere, with catchy tunes like ""Photographic Evidence"" and ""Oceanbound"" that'll have you singing along while you desperately try to learn his nasty gee-tar moves! The guitar can be played without accompaniment, if you so choose, but we highly recommend that the instrument be played with a music ensemble of your choice, as Atkins himself has done with 764-HERO. With Robin P on the ""bass"" version of the guitar (a lower-pitched four-string model, also available), and Polly Johnson banging on the drumset, songs increase in volume and complexity. Listen to ""You Were a Party,"" where the band presents how melodic sequences of notes played on the bass variant and dynamic drumming can add a stable beat while emphasizing your guitar's percussive qualities. Everything's functioning like a well-oiled Rock Machine! What's more, not only does Nobody Knows This Is Everywhere show you how good making music with your shiny new guitar can be, it also gives you examples of where you can go wrong! For example, you may notice that without sufficient songwriting versatility, things can get pretty mediocre and, well, boring by the end of a ten-song album. No, kids, slowing a tune down (""Answers"") or stretching it beyond six minutes (""Confetti Confessional"") doesn't make it better. Adding more instruments, like the organ and piano on the rousing climax of ""The Long Arm of the Law,"" can sometimes help, but don't just rely on the presence of keyboards alone to shake things up (see: ""Satellites""). Also, when titling your record, never pun on the title of a classic album-- in this case, Neil Young and Crazy Horse's brilliant Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere-- just because you can't come up with something intelligent. Think and something better will come to you. Fortunately, 764-HERO have made these mistakes so you don't have to. You see, while the guitar may not be sufficient to carry a whole album, Nobody Knows This Is Everywhere shows it can at least provide you with a handful or two of peachy keen songs. And that's all you'll need to hit the road, make some dough, and meet cute members of the opposite sex! So what are you waiting for? Get your parents' credit card, dial 1-800-764-HERO, and get your very own automatic, systematic, hyyyyyyy-dromatic GUITAR!!!","Hey, kids, have you heard of the newfangled musical invention that's all the rage in the record industry?

Plugs Plus,DAT Politics,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8a6c0084474cd0c0e8e/1:1/w_160/de29ec6a.jpg,2002-05-01 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2174-plugs-plus/,Chicks on Speed,"PBS broadcasts some far-out shit. I just finished watching a program about flatworms. That was some trippy stuff. Flatworms are ocean-dwelling invertebrates that everything on the planet evolved from, or something. They've been around for trillions of years and only now is the young-buck upstart human species beginning to comprehend their almost indescribable bizarreness. Flatworms are, basically, psychedelically colored, triple-wide chow foon noodles. They lead solitary lives cruising the oceans for bits to eat and maybe a shag once in a while. Because they're loners, and the ocean's a pretty huge place-- especially when ninety of you would comprise a snack-size Cup 'O' Noodle-- natural selection has seen to it that flatworms are hermaphrodites. This is a good thing, when you consider that the chances of bumping into another flatworm are next to zero, and that if two same-sexed worms met up, there wouldn't be any offspring. Soon the oceans would be bereft of platyhelminthes. And we can't have that. Being a hermaphrodite efficiently side-steps the problem of furthering the species. Once you've encountered another flatworm it doesn't matter, from a reproductive point of view, who's going to be male or female-- the pair just has to work out who's going to be mommy. This being nature, the flatworms don't discuss the matter or toss a coin for the chance to get up the duff. Nope-- remember what Kipling said about nature red in tooth and claw?-- the soon-to-be-getting-it-on flatworms battle each other... with their two barbed penises! Yup, flatworms are double-wanged, and vicious with them. Mating occurs when the pair collides to form a writhing mass of stabbing, spineless ick. Whoever happens to get pierced anywhere on their body by one of those love-spears, and thereby injected with wormy jizz, gets to be mommy. Why am I telling you this? Well, if you're a fan of DAT Politics, you're going to be as lonely as a flatworm. If you meet another DAT Politics fan, you're going to want to mate with them-- and frequently, because the ace Plugs Plus is going to make you one horny mollusk. Plugs Plus is the band's fourth album and continues this French trio's exploration of Nickelodeon beatfuckery. It's completely brilliant, of course, in a spazzy, freaky-as-a-flatworm way. DAT Politics don't give you a smooth entry into their frazzled music; there's no gentle ambient intro. Immediately after you press play, ""Re-Folk"" gives you three-minute summary of all the cranked-up mess of chipmunk vocals and shredded Spymaniac white noise that will appear of the course of the next twelve tracks. ""Re-Folk"" also showcases the band's most favored instrument, the butt-trumpet. The butt-trumpet (my designation, not theirs) is the lead melody instrument on Plugs Plus and sounds like one of my reediest farts-- the ones when I force it out long before it can mature into a more satisfying low-frequency fusillade of ass-acoustics. In addition to spotlighting the harmonic possibilities of the butt-trumpet, DAT Politics have invited a bunch of similarly demented guests for Plugs Plus. Blectum from Blechdom shout and coo for ""Pie,"" while Lesser's Felix Kubin rides the crispy static acid gabba of ""Morgens, Mittags,"" going on about his sardines in German. ""Pass Our Class"" finds Matmos and Kid 606 trading ideas about successful strategies for acting classes, coming to the consensus that all you need really do is show your ass. My absolute favorite, though, is ""Tout Bleu,"" in which DAT Politics juxtaposes Stephen Hawking's voice-synthesizer with an erotic French mademoiselle purring about chocolate and things being all blue. As Hawking's synth starts to smoke with over-stimulation, DAT Politics turn the track into a beach-movie campathon where Sandra Dee teases her surfer hunk co-star James Darren into prematurely popping his wad to the giggling delight of Sandra's spring-breaking sorority sisters. Genius, sheer genius. Plugs Plus isn't for everyone, however, and definitely not for every mood. But if you're a sex-starved, double-wanged invertebrate drifter, Plugs Plus will make you one happy, horny hermaphrodite.","PBS broadcasts some far-out shit.

Building a Building,Pajama Party in a Haunted Hive,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb3a5e6ef95969322b77/1:1/w_160/8cc7f685.gif,2002-04-30 05:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6125-building-a-building/,Coming in Second,"Pajama Party in a Haunted Hive must really want me to compare them to Built to Spill. Sure, they'd probably say otherwise if asked flat-out, claiming that calling in Doug Martsch to produce their debut wasn't a calculated move to cast themselves as a minor-league BtS. Nevertheless, I see right through their shrewd little scheme; after all, Martsch doesn't even produce his own stuff by himself, presumably leaving much of the knob-twiddling and switch-flicking to Northwest mastermind Phil Ek. Furthermore, based on the evidence of Building a Building, it's pretty clear that Martsch is no hotshot Producer Phil behind the boards, be it Ek, Elvrum, or Spector. But the warts-and-all approach befits Pajama Party in a Haunted Hive and their rumpled sound. If a Built to Spill comparison must be made (and it must), think the fractured, Pavement-ish early period rather than the three-guitar nouveau classic rock of Doug's recent works. May the vengeful God of the Old Testament strike me down should I invoke the name of Idaho's finest again, because it's not really fair to the three strapping young lads of Pajama Party. The Jensen brothers and Dan Giberman possess an above-average amount of what we in the biz call 'potential,' and despite its short 26-minute length and rough sound, Building a Building shows it. Be it the humble presentation or otherwise, Pajama Party in a Haunted Hive sound their strongest when arrangements are stripped down and taut. Jaunty rockers ""Capitalism's a Fake Smile"" and ""Elevation Map"" showcase the trio's appealingly loose sound, bright guitar and busy drumming skipping along pleasantly beneath singer Elijah Jensen's friendly vocals. Whether sharing the mic with sister Rachael on ""Over"" or high-note straining over simple acoustic accompaniment on ""Silver State,"" Elijah's voice has just the right amount of disregard for traditional pitch to complement the band's slapdash vibe. But Building a Building misfires when the slack atmosphere bleeds over into the songwriting, with the opening ""Oh Yeah!"" and singalong ""The Day She Died"" coming off half-baked and overly fragmentary. Meanwhile, the album's one attempt at a space-rock guitar epic (aptly named ""Astrological Charts"") doesn't sit as well with the lo-fi environment created by Martsch, whose overly busy Moog stylings on the song are only a distraction. Despite the occasional wobbly step, though, Building a Building indicates a band with prospects, placing Pajama Party in a Haunted Hive on track to join Modest Mouse and Built to Spill in the northwest region spotlight. Oh shit, wait, that wasn't a comparison, it was just a-- [zap] aaaaaaaaRRRGGGHHH!!!","Pajama Party in a Haunted Hive must really want me to compare them to Built to Spill. Sure, they'd ...

Girls Get Busy,Bratmobile,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a388c0084474cd0c02b3/1:1/w_160/899584b3.jpg,2002-04-30 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/919-girls-get-busy/,Lookout!,"Following their 1991 debut at the International Pop Underground Festival, Bratmobile joined Bikini Kill as one of the preeminent voices of the riot grrl movement. A firmly bi-coastal band, with singer Allison Wolfe and guitarist Erin Smith in the DC/Maryland vicinity, and drummer Molly Neumann in the Bay Area, it took almost two years of coast-hopping to produce Pottymouth, their first LP for Kill Rock Stars. Their sound-- a kitschy, catchy, simple arrangement of spare three-note punk rock ineptitude and smokin'-in-the-grrl's-room wit separated them from their snarling peers. Where Bikini Kill, Heavens to Betsy and others delivered their message in a sneering clamor, Bratmobile were funny and goofy. Attending one of their slumber parties may have also required knowledge of contemporary feminist rhetoric, but you got the sense they weren't above shoplifting their source material. It was an awesome combination that captivated critics and fans, and won the band vicarious recognition through the mainstream's fixation on riot grrls as newsworthy and-- I say this with no small measure of disgust-- photogenic material. Bratmobile broke up in 1994, after the follow-up The Real Janelle and a Peel session. It would be a gross overstatement to say that fans grieved. By 1994, the riot grrl phenom had been fully integrated into mainstream consciousness through misappropriation by bigger acts like Hole and Babes in Toyland. Girl power was only a few short years away from being co-opted by a slew of British sex kitten pop stars, whose only real connection to punk rock was through the glittery slogans on their cropped t-shirts. And it didn't help that Bratmobile were a bit of a one-trick pony, whose ultimate message (that girls, even musically untrained girls, can rock) would be effectively underscored by newer, better bands. So, I had some reservations when Bratmobile reunited for touring in 1998/99. I assumed it was all part of some premature riot grrl nostalgia business, sparked, perhaps, by the success of the decidedly 'nicer' Sleater-Kinney. I was even more uncomfortable with the 2000 release of a new LP, Ladies, Women, and Girls. Maybe this had something to do with the fact that, due to Molly's day job, it was released on Lookout! (We could have lived without The Donnas. They're at least partially to blame for the antipathy toward women in rock.) And maybe this had to do with the fact that the snotty young grrls of Bratmobile were now older, and presumably wiser. The snarky in-jokes and playground chants sounded a little awkward coming from women approaching thirty. And truth be told, the whole thing was somewhat embarrassing-- three women trying to recapture their moment in the sun, which had already been confined to the pop culture graveyard by its own practitioners. Which brings us to Girls Get Busy. And what can I say, really? Outside of the sadness I feel at having to give this album a 4.9 (for a whole wide variety of reasons I didn't want to), I can only say that the incorporation of big crunchy power chords and anthemic hey-hey's into ""I'm With the Band"" and ""That's Happening"" only confirmed my worst fears. I'm inclined to believe Bratmobile was better when they couldn't play. Lyrics like, ""Girls make music/ We're here to stay,"" though certainly a laudable sentiment, strikes me as completely obvious. Does anyone-- and especially anyone who would listen to a new album by Bratmobile-- still question that? What's worse, the more overt politics of Girls Get Busy tarnish my cherished image of Bratmobile. ""Shop for America,"" with sentiments such as, ""We won't fight your fucking war,"" and ""Shut Your Face,"" with its repetition of ""girls are dying"" are tough to digest when you're secretly hoping for ""Girl Germs, Part II."" And while Neuman and Smith's musicianship has clearly improved from a technical standpoint, Wolfe's once idiosyncratic and instantly recognizable voice has matured into a flat, generic punk-rock-girl monotone. I have two theories. One, that Bratmobile figures that with slicker production, bigger sounding songs, new vocals, and less humorous lyrics, they will be taken more seriously. But at what cost? ""Sounds like Bratmobile"" was a phrase I used to positively describe music. Bratmobile no longer sounds like Bratmobile-- they sound like the pedantic would-be riot grrls whose presence at punk rock shows circa 1993 required your unilateral support and, of course, no laughing. What was once a breath of fresh air now feels like back-breaking labor. Second theory is trickier: trying to stay in the business once your fifteen minutes have come to an end requires either branching out into new directions or trying to conform to what the kids like today. The current batch of sixteen-year-old girls (who, incidentally, were in kindergarten at the time of the first Bratmobile show), are a harder sell. The wider public fascination with the indies has long since faded, and Kathleen Hanna no longer makes MTV News. Staying relevant is a bitch, and letting go is even harder. Is it enough to know that your band positively influenced a bunch of wide-eyed girls ten years ago, and that we're still talking about it long after the fact? I'd count myself fortunate to have influenced even one. But then, maybe that's why Bratmobile is putting out the records and I'm just writing about them.","Following their 1991 debut at the International Pop Underground Festival, Bratmobile joined Bikini Kill as one of the preeminent voices ...

Personal Journals,Sage Francis,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be13ea9e61561daa783e/1:1/w_160/ff9e2c72.gif,2002-04-30 05:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3176-personal-journals/,Anticon,"Whatever else may be wrong with the Anticon guys, at least they're not afraid to say they need their mommies. The Anticon hip-hop collective-- of which Sage Francis is some kind of member now-- have a reputation for brainy, convoluted lyrics and wordy self-examinations. Instead of chest-out bragging or shout-outs to their small-city hometowns, they use their rhymes to admit weakness, and to dredge up every small bad memory of childhood. Sage Francis lets it all hang out on Personal Journals, his first major solo release, using his assertive rapping and thick exterior to deliver a startlingly self-revelatory album. His voice, informed by spoken word performances, can take on a dramatic frenzy, matched by lo-fi but dynamic production from underground DJs like Odd Nosdam, Sixtoo, Jel, Joe Beats and Scott Metallic. And in case anyone thought that Francis was just a poetry slam-winning white boy who's here to read his diary, he also displays a sense of humor while flexing his lyrical muscles. Francis takes himself apart a dozen different ways on this album, starting with two different approaches at self-portraiture. On ""Personal Journalist,"" he explains himself with fast-paced abstract wordplay: ""Non-prophet/ Artificially intelligent/ Avant-guardian angel... Loyal son, father to none."" Chaotic street scenes and Jesus imagery fill out the track. On the more direct ""Different,"" riding on a throbbing upright bassline, he pronounces himself a drug-free vegetarian who ""wouldn't smoke the pot I was pissing in, and I had no dead homies to honor while pouring out the liquor I won't drink."" I have seen the future of underground hip-hop, and it is straight-edge. When he brings his family into the fray, the self-analysis gets murkier. Francis' relationship with his mother could fill volumes, and every track is full of haunting images and vague, unresolved guilt and blame. He talks about a childhood without a dad: ""Eviction Notice"" depicts Francis' mom fighting with her live-in boyfriends, while the disturbing atmosphere from cLOUDDEAD's Odd Nosdam evokes a picture of little Sage hiding under his bed. Francis' mom appears again in the brutal love/hate ""Kill Ya Momz,"" which lays a heavy metal offensive over a creepy, innocent recording of young Sage doing a devoted Mother's Day rap. And then there's ""Inherited Scars,"" one of the album's best tracks, about his younger sister; as he looks at her scars (self-mutilation? Tattoos? Are they the same thing here?), he implores her to ""stick it out"" at home as he tries to decide who's to blame-- their father or himself-- without ever answering the question. Grown-up Sage isn't any less complicated. The beats are not only lo-fi, but hypnotic and claustrophobic-- especially the hand drums and drum kit that Sixtoo puts behind his fevered rapping on ""Buckets of Silence."" That and ""Specialist"" are back-to-back studies of obsessive love, where the wordplay grows frantic: ""I'm a slow self-esteem engine in need of a whore's power.../ I'm holding a sleepless beauty pageant on my shark-infested waterbed until it's punctured."" The rejection and his own abusive loving give us one picture-- ""Mr. Feel-Nothing,"" who ""saves his tears inside of a cup, and he drinks and he forgets that he's an asshole."" But then there's the tender side that comes out in the unabashedly gorgeous ""Broken Wings,"" gliding on a beautiful piano line from Scott Metallic's production. It takes a tough man to sing a lyric like, ""We don't need no wings to fly,"" and Francis pulls it off. ""By the end of the record I'll make sure y'all know who Sage Francis is,"" he promises early on, though he never convincingly finishes the job-- he's still figuring it out himself. There are people who will criticize the wordy, convoluted lyrics, or resent the hall of mirrors that Francis drops us into. But being complex doesn't make this art: Personal Journals is a success because it turns the self-examination into poetry and then, harder still, turns the poems into great rap. And as dark as he gets, Francis makes sure we have a good time: dig his sub-karaoke live remake of Bob Seger's ""Turn the Page."" Clearly, nothing embarrasses this guy.","Whatever else may be wrong with the Anticon guys, at least they're not afraid to say they need their ...

TA,Trans Am,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7f8b1335d7bf169918c/1:1/w_160/a3545a92.jpg,2002-04-30 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8134-ta/,Thrill Jockey,"It takes a certain kind of music fan to appreciate Trans Am. If you listen to their records without at least a remedial knowledge of the last thirty years of pop history, with a minor in the butt-rock and the electro-pop of the 70s and 80s, you're only getting half the story. Each of Trans Am's previous records struck me as an enthusiastic homage to overlooked and underrepresented genres. It's hard to believe now, but at the time of their 1996 debut, few Americans were talking about Kraftwerk and krautrock, and none of these people were into metal. Having songs that drew from both these worlds on the same record seemed almost revolutionary. Trans Am continued to refine their craft on Surrender to the Night, The Surveillance, and Futureworld, culminating with what I think is their finest album, the comparatively serious and varied Red Line. But that's all behind us now. In 2002, with their new album TA, Trans Am makes no sense, no matter what music history text you've been reading. Ditching the more experimental direction of Red Line, Trans Am sound as though they aspire to be nothing more than a second-rate novelty act. It's an old-school album in terms of sequencing-- fourteen songs in 45 minutes-- but it feels long. Very long. The successful stabs at straight vocal tracks on Red Line apparently encouraged the band to include a half-dozen such songs here, and most of these are nothing more than tuneless 80s rock with booming drums and half-hearted Michael Sembello synth treatments. It's Loverboy-style lite-metal meets new wave, without the riffs, melodies or red leather pants. In other words, it's Survivor. When they're not trying to rewrite ""High on You,"" Trans Am revisit territory they've covered exhaustively elsewhere. ""Party Station"" and ""Infinite Wavelength"" are vocodered pop numbers that might have fit on Futureworld, but back then they'd have had the courtesy to give us some kind of hook. ""Positive People"" is a neutered version of ""Play in the Summer,"" lacking any of that song's crucial Zep crunch and driving rhythm. ""Afternight"" manages to rise to the level of adequacy, being a relatively evocative rock instrumental close in tone to Surrender to the Night. But the only truly arresting moment on TA comes as the tweaked Moog instrumental ""Bonn"" gives way to the electro of ""Basta,"" a tune with aggressive Spanish rapping and a coda of inspired military drumming. I'm not sure exactly what's happened here-- has Trans Am changed or have I? TA is, by some margin, the band's worst record. There's no doubting that. Where before their records struck me as an affectionate celebration of goofy music, on TA Trans Am feels smarmy, arrogant, and oh-so-ironic. Who's got time for that?","It takes a certain kind of music fan to appreciate Trans Am. If you listen to their records without at ...

Remember the days when the pre-digital Walkman was criticized as the most isolating and therefore masturbatory form of self-entertainment since the novel? Remember snickering about needing to buy 'head cleaner'? Remembering sacramentally disemboweling the ""I Love You Forever: The Supermix"" tape of a partner whose behavior later revealed that they were obviously disingenuous about the loving-you-forever thing? If only I had a turtleneck for every date that ended when, after showing me her new tattoo of the Chinese symbol for 'woman' that she still hid from Dad, the girl coyly asked what was in that big black trunk at the foot of my bed-- only to learn that it was full of releases from cassette-only labels. One even sneered, ""I don't even know how to use a cassette,"" as if they were a worse misappropriation of plastic and the means of mass production than oversized ""We're #1"" hands for winless football teams. As big an oddball on the underground landscape as Stephin Merritt, Mountain Goat John Darnielle understands how to harness the majesty of the practically aborted cassette format. He appeared on nearly every cassette-only label's compilation during their golden era of Xerox-ed and Crayola-ed cover art, and released his band's first three proper albums of passionate nasal-fi straight to tape. A zillion vinyl releases and ten CDs later, and the Goats have offered the world what 'they' would have us believe is the highest-profile concept album ever recorded on a jambox, complete with grinding gears that sound like Darnielle rigged a stethoscope to the saliva glands of a retired android. And despite consistently featuring more hey's, la's and whoa's than Ringo Starr's spiral lyric notebook (hanging on the wall of the Hard Rock Cafe in Bent Musket, Georgia, if you want to check it out), Darnielle's yelled lyrics continue to pierce layers of the listener's inner ice. Foes of profane merriment beware: the chorus of ""Jenny"" employs a ""hi-diddle-dee-dee-goddamn."" Who else could, with only an abused acoustic guitar accompanying him, pull off a line as prosaic as, ""We tried to fight the creeping sense of dread with temporal things""? The songs here that aren't sagas of wayward youths chronicle the trajectories of various loves, from courtship, to feeding fruit to each other, to divorce and/or death, and sometimes even to hell. Which brings up ""The Best Ever Death Metal Band in Denton,"" and its bold invocation of the Prince of Darkness: the marginalization of God cost rock one of its central components, which Darnielle resurrects with his emphatic envoy, ""Hail Satan!"" Though Darnielle palpably dissed Glenn Danzig in a recent issue of his zine Last Plane to Jakarta, moments like the chanting of ""Hail Satan,"" that blend earnestness with clever condescension, provide clues to how Darnielle does his thing. He plays with tone, dipping sophistication in the muck of primitivity, sampling bits of Emily Dickinson, T.S. Eliot, and Philip Larkin in his home-taped, sentimental wimp-rock, involving just enough brain food to prevent that Scorsese-bred part of me from suggesting, ""Ayy! I got some Clorox that'll get that heart off your sleeve."" Add ""The Mess Inside,"" with its urgent account of a love that even a September jaunt to New York can't save, to the exponentially multiplying list of songs accidentally weighted with post-boxcutter connotations of homeland insecurity (as well as the lines in ""Pink and Blue"" about Oklahoman wind smelling like blood and smoke). After producing dozens of songs obsessed with mobility (the ""Going To ________"" songs), Darnielle's last three albums have been settled in one geographic region, hinting at a fusty patience or new maturity. Would you believe that ""Blues In Dallas,"" a Hamlet-assed song with a tinny keyboard backup and JFK underpinnings, is about something as unsexy as deciding to wait, and is also really, really good? Darnielle's craft can convince you to follow his classist/nostalgic aesthetic logic: this album would sound perfect on the one-speaker radio atop a custodian's pushcart. You'll start asking, how can there be a sport so colonial that it requires as much cultivated land as golf does? Since so little gets reported anyway, what justifies the competing 24-hour news channels? Didn't 'analog' movie monsters at least take up three-dimensional space on the film, unlike the computer phantoms of Jurassic Park that leave actors running from thin air? Does every disc in my collection really have to be a performance test that justifies my investment in all of that stereo componentry? At least two songs on All Hail West Texas flagrantly bemoan the state-of-the-art burden of uncurbed, soul-charring consumption. But whether you embrace the hiss and crackle or not, Darnielle seems to be, like the poets he cites, settled in his spot on the fringe.","Remember 'audio cassettes'?

Jump Leeds,Fila Brazillia,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd9613d197565213b58a/1:1/w_160/8def87aa.gif,2002-04-29 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3055-jump-leeds/,TwentyThree,"Like gravity, UK downtempo outfit Fila Brazillia is utterly dependable. I doubt that anyone could seriously say that any of their nine albums is a disappointment. Sure, no release is without minor slip-ups, but at least the duo of Steve Cobb and Dave McSherry have never released a total wipe-out like Drukqs. Jump Leeds has a few more slip-ups than its immediate predecessor, A Touch of Cloth, but I'd like to think they result from the addition of a vocalist (Steve Edwards of Presence) rather than being an indication of pending obsolescence. A Touch of Cloth really was the epitome of downtempo. Rather than being an assemblage of quirky samples like Lemon Jelly's or Bent's output, Fila Brazillia's eighth album was a sophisticated soundtrack to a bizarre, yet meticulously plotted porno salivated over by hipsters who surely have a take on Cassavetes. It takes some commitment to get into a Fila Brazillia album-- Cobb and McSherry don't give up their goodies on a first date. During the many hours I've spent digesting their albums I've discovered all manner of concealed wit, harmonic inventions, and melodic whims. Jump Leeds differs slightly, however. The band have buried all these wonderful things and scattered the low-nutrient topsoil of Edwards' R&B; crooning all over them. As he proved on Presence's All Systems Gone album, Edwards possesses exactly the right voice for that irony-free class of deep house that acts as a rallying call for cemented-to-the-sofa connoisseurs. Edwards can warble and exercise his vibrato technique during poignant bits and can belt out the hallelujahs as forcefully as any four-hundred-pound gospel diva. But there are definite drawbacks to setting such booming skills amid Fila Brazillia's intricate downtempo. To the band's credit, they've limited Edwards to four tracks. As if a hangover from the stained-glass artwork of A Touch of Class, Jump Leeds begins with a church organ stating the compelling theme of the opening track, ""Bumblehaun."" But it doesn't stay ecclesiastical for very long. The track transforms into an exceptional parody of 80's club funk, an infectious groove those Euroclash retro-futurists would gladly pawn their Commodore 64's for. Cobb and McSherry really show off during ""Bumblehaun"" and on first listen it staggers belief that they haven't used up all their creative juices in the opening track. But the duo are merely getting started, as ""Motown Coppers"" demonstrates. Out of a buzzy analog haze, a stomping bassline gathers up all the lost children and, in a glorious series of chimes and welcoming blips, sends them out into a magical world of candy cane funk. With a cut 'n' pasted hollerin' blues man, ""Spill the Beans"" initially sounds like a bid for some of Moby's cash. After a melodic cock-rock guitar break, Edwards moves up to the mic to deliver his hammy-tender lyrics about telling the truth and feeling a whole better for the disclosure. ""DNA"" brings the mood down to make-out levels with a wispy guitar figure and a sample of Dead Can Dance's ""The Snake and The Moon."" ""DNA"" harks back to the dreamy daze of the Grid's classic ""Floatation"" and BBG's ""Snappiness."" Edwards returns for ""We Build Arks"" and, along with a pounding bass probe, he unpacks his most forceful falsetto as he warbles about Morlocks and how ""Goats run/Goats walk/But heroes ride."" Cobby and McSherry match Edwards' phantasmagoric twaddle with a wah-wahed clavinet and plenty of righteous menace. ""Percival Quintaine"" adapts the Edge's appeggiated guitar line from ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" and reworks it for a Starsky and Hutch car chase through Huggy Bear's Harlem. ""Nightfall"" returns to the surreal dreamscape of ""We Build Arks""-- but in this slumber Edwards can ""hear colours all around the world"" and see ""calcium from your behind."" Perhaps the band should have run this song by a shrink first? Though Edwards' nocturnal visions are nigh on disturbing, they're nothing in comparison with the horrendous gaffe that concludes and mars Jump Leeds. ""The Green Green Grass of Homegrown"" is a folksy ode to the herb that panders shamelessly to the fetishistic High Times crowd. This is the type of gauche mishap I expect from artists who cut and paste twee thrift store samples into their Fruity Loops song creation software, not from an exceptionally talented duo whose love of music and enthusiasm for playing is, for me, as irrefutable as Newton's great discovery.","Like gravity, UK downtempo outfit Fila Brazillia is utterly dependable.

"Oops, I Did It Again",Cex,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a57bc0084474cd0c072c/1:1/w_160/b541075d.jpg,2002-04-29 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1390-oops-i-did-it-again/,Tigerbeat6,"I'm all for keeping it real. As shelf-picked rockstar personas seem to impress more easily than sincerity and unpretentiousness, any artist who seeks to let his work speak for itself has to deal with the distinct possibility of his music going unnoticed. As the number of records being released monthly increases at a seemingly exponential rate, being a musician without a gimmick (even if it is a weak, done-to-death gimmick) means running the risk of getting lost in the shuffle. Ryan Kidwell (aka Rjyan, aka Cex) isn't one to let his music speak for itself. Cex's live show has, in recent years, developed into one of the single most entertaining spectacles I've ever experienced. Lots of performers manipulate their onstage personas to make themselves appear more interesting or more mysterious. But the true brilliance of Kidwell's show is that his whole act seems totally sincere. Playing equal parts mad rapper and welcoming host, Kidwell drops tight, witty, and endearing rhymes about balls, bicycles, and ""Bad Dudes"" over skittery beats, peppered with clever between-song banter (""This next song has some violins-- an instrument invented by Radiohead""). So, in the interest of keeping it real, I'll say I'm pretty disappointed by Oops, I Did It Again. The Cex I saw in concert was a truly original entertainer, putting the best parts of his personality to work for him. The Cex I hear on Oops, I Did It Again sounds like he's trying to incorporate a pretty wide spectrum of influences with the fun IDM that's been the bread and butter of his career this far. And while the result is certainly well executed, it lacks the personality that makes Cex such an appealing character in the first place. For the most part, Oops, I Did It Again is relatively standard IDM fare, with a much greater focus on rhythm than on melody. Most of the sounds on the album have already been used hundreds of times-- chopped-up drum samples, synthesizers with sweeping filters and the occasional odd bit of noise. The beats that make up the core of Oops, I Did It Again are certainly top-notch-- at this point, there's no question that Kidwell knows how to put together a song. The problem is, there isn't much on Oops, I Did It Again that's particularly riveting. Take the warm acoustic guitars that fill out ""(You're) Off the Food Chain,"" a track that sounds almost like the Microphones. Elements like these are never really integrated, and all are worked into similarly deliberate, repetitive song structures. In concert, Cex's rhythmically interesting and consistently amusing rhymes bring his music to life. Far too much of this record is simply boring. It's a testament to Cex's inherent talent that the most uninteresting and typical aspects of Oops, I Did It Again are also the ones that seem the most forced.","I'm all for keeping it real.

Posthuman EP,Posthuman,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a10cea9e61561daa46db/1:1/w_160/fc7ea16f.gif,2002-04-29 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6440-posthuman-ep/,Seed,"Of course, Posthuman could have gone tres repetitive and released a series of EPs that were basically lines of code in aural form. Instead, the duo have decided to hit us with five tracks' worth of twisted mechano-funk. ""Kitchen"" serves up crisp electronic breaks in the beginning and a bass drop that'll make your subwoofer shudder. Surprise, they've got a mean robot voice now, mumbling cyclically that ""the city's your identity everyday in the city,"" or something like that. Then the metal riffs enter! Except they're too subdued to serrate much, just chugging tastefully in the background with the constant cymbal taps. ""Kitchen"" works as a nice appetizer, but later ""Billy Bob's Moustache Day"" takes the formula too far. Tough drum-n-bass pops in blisters until a bluesy garage-guitar lick rises and dominates the mix. The effect is Altogether too much like Orbital's lackluster recent efforts, and the focus of the song shifts entirely to the melody, suppressing the danceable electronic elements. ""Billy Bob, Billy Billy Bob"" goes the perky little sample, as it's bounced maniacally around the speakers, and there's a garbled phrase along the lines of ""I want to marry my sister""...! Maybe it's Posthuman's way of beckoning, ""Come to daddy."" The hints of humor continue: ""It Started With a Kiss"" creeps along on a double-bass lead, the kind of classical tiptoe-music you hear in cartoons. The silence gets shredded by sputtering percussion and sped-up beeps that'll have you saying IDM faster than Pam Anderson caved when she saw that rock. It's like a slow-moving cyclone, with telephasic keyboards swelling inwards to ground all the chaotic clatter. Squarepushers will love the mathematic antics, and Boards of Canada-philes will dig the warm synth colours. The abstract ""Return to Map"" traces a hint of the dark orchestral atmosphere of Posthuman's debut, but lightens the mood with theremin-like squoogles. Some harpsichord sounds start tingling and suddenly you're in an antechamber in Castlevania, and you know there's something not-too-nice around the corner. But it's not really a novelty piece-- it's slyly aware of itself in the beginning, then combusts in violent digital shards later on. All of this is just filler compared to the centerpiece, though. ""The Absolute"" is a tale of the time electro met EBM and darkwave. It's a manifesto enough to make me beat my meat, with synths scribbling all over and this pivoting snare hiss that makes me think the boys have been listening to late-period Front Line Assembly. One of them sings a catchy new-wave vocal line, though you can't tell exactly what he's saying for all the vocals distorted Underworld-style. So yeah, I'm completely thrilled with Posthuman's appeal to the dancefloor. Almost thirty minutes of warped madness and pure electronic bliss.","Of course, Posthuman could have gone tres repetitive and released a series of EPs that were basically lines of code ...

Orion,Limp,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd1ac0084474cd0c2c1e/1:1/w_160/479b58eb.jpeg,2002-04-28 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4801-orion/,Morr,"Not to be confused with the guitarded punks on Honest Don's that Pitchfork's own Charly Gordon called ""mildly entertaining,"" this band called Limp is four men from Denmark who spend most of their time apart, each making electronic music on their own. Jakob Skatt (Syntaks), Jonas Munk (Manual), Rasmus Rasmussen (Aerosol) and Jess Kahr (just Jess, thank you) spend the bulk of their musical lives in front of a computer, looking for the perfect beat with one hand on a mouse and the other fingering some power user quick-key combo. They come to Limp when they want to rock out a bit and make some energetic guitar-based music. Not surprisingly, Limp approach the band angle from the perspective of players weaned on electronic music, which is to say, the six-cut, 30-minute EP Orion is immediately recognizable as post-rock. But we're not talking about tense, Slint-derived, Chicago-style post-rock. Rather, Orion utilizes a prettier and more refined European approach, without a hint of any jazz background. Limp paints with an impressionist's brush that puts them close to late-period Mogwai, crafting pieces filled with gauzy drones, processed fuzz-guitar bleeds, and ringing arpeggios that add subtle drama to the climaxes of each song. Limp's basic setup is guitar, bass, and drums, with added synths, sampling and studio manipulation. Though the studio tinkering never dominates, the subtle electronic touches are the elements that stand out most on Orion. There is a distinct 80s cast to the synth treatments that recalls the work Eno and Lanois did with U2. The title track is by far the most dynamic piece here, building slowly from a hushed, careful intro into a pounding rock tune. Subtle, but necessary, swaths of electronic texture weave in and around the chiming, delayed guitars, giving the band something to push against. Tracing back even further along the same path, the opening to the positively Frippertronic ""City Speaks Tonight"" is a dead ringer for Eno's ""In Dark Trees"" from Another Green World, the album that provided the template for all his later pop productions. Yet, despite the impressive resumes of its members, the band's cohesion as a unit (some of these guys have been playing together since they were 11), and the good taste of its influences, Limp just doesn't do enough to stand out in this genre. The pieces are pretty and sound nice, but fail to create a lasting impression (a problem I have with Mogwai, actually). Fans of lush instrumental guitar rock will probably love Orion; as for me, this is the kind of record I only pull out once in a great while.","Not to be confused with the guitarded punks on Honest Don's that Pitchfork's own Charly Gordon called ""mildly ...

Playgroup,Playgroup,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0a89d034d5c69bf2794/1:1/w_160/ce7cbd96.jpg,2002-04-28 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6344-playgroup/,Astralwerks,"If Pitchfork handed out awards for how lush an album sounds, how crispily hi-fi a release is, then Playgroup's self-titled debut would easily scoop up such an accolade. However, the majority of Pitchfork's readership isn't concerned with albums that give their vacuum-tube stereo systems a thorough workout. The majority of you care if an album has something to say-- if it speaks to you in some way. Playgroup, regrettably, talks loud and fast, but says nothing substantial. The face behind the Playgroup facade is Trevor Jackson. Not a household name, but you've likely encountered his production skills if you've investigated leftfield-leaning hip-hop and dub funk. Assuming the alias Underdog, Jackson remixed several Massive Attack singles (""Sly,"" ""Protection,"" and ""Risingson"") as well as Death in Vegas' ""Aisha,"" Cornershop's ""Sleep on the Left Side,"" and Sabres of Paradise's ""The Theme,"" to name a few of his many treatments. When not tweaking paying clients' work, Jackson runs the Output label. It was Output that gave Fridge their break when they released Sevens and Twelves, Ceefax, and Semaphore, as well as Kieren Hebden's first Four Tet album, Dialogue. In addition to making cutting-edge UK post-rock available, Output released full-on aggro disco/not-disco cuts by Sonovac, Gramme, and 7 Hurtz. Jackson compiled the roughest, most thrilling cuts these bands had created on the essential Channel 1 collection. Jackson's Skull project fomented some broken-sound illbience and vies with Kevin Martin's Techno Animal project to formulate some of the illest industrial dub ever produced. Jackson faultlessly summarizes the disco/not-disco sound with ""Make It Happen""-- a bare-bones masterpiece of mimicry that repairs the damage caused by Dave ""Sessomatto"" Lee's clusterfuck reworking of ESG's ""Moody."" With ""Make It Happen,"" Jackson appears to understand the sublimated aggression that Martin Hannant coaxed from the three South Bronx ladies who comprised ESG in a way that Lee completely ignored for his own financial gain. I first heard ""Make It Happen"" on the London Xpress rarities compilation Nuphonic released last year. Since then, I've longed to hear the Playgroup full-length and to hear how Jackson would recast a golden era of dance music for a 21st century audience. Playgroup, however, is all about cashing in on the current vogue for the 80s. Rather than joining the synth-pop crowd (Felix da Housecat, Ladytron, Fischerspooner, et al.), Playgroup looks to downtown punk-disco and the loft agit-dance of early 80s Manhattan and seeks to awaken the departed spirits of Larry Levan, Liquid Liquid, and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Opener ""Number One"" perfectly pastiches Larry Levan's lysergic remixes. Jackson gets Levan down so precisely that he even incorporates a variant of the analog synth squiggle that is the signature of Levan's reworking of ""Seventh Heaven"" by Gwen Guthrie. Instead of building on the success of ""Make It Happen"" and expanding beyond theory-into-praxis slogans, Playgroup is a childish game of 'let's pretend to be revolutionaries.' But most often, Playgroup doesn't even engage on that level. For instance, in his commitment to strip-mine every 80s dance style, Jackson even resurrects 'hip-house'-- that excruciating amalgam of house music and rap. I'm grateful that Jackson doesn't try to convince me that hip-house was anything but utter crap-- ""Front 2 Back"" features the lamest rhymes since Technotronic and Ya Kid K: ""Hip house and jazz, percussion and bass/ It's razzmatazz/ Just feel the flavor/ And jump right in/ 'Cuz it's a life-saver/ No special behavior/ Is ever required/ Do it until you're tired."" As if that's not torture enough, Jackson recasts Paul Simon's ""50 Ways to Leave Your Lover"" as the Fugees' ""Ready or Not""-- complete with ""Bring da hook! Yo! Sing it again, dog!"" interjections from his peeps in the studio. Elsewhere, Le Tigre's Kathleen Hanna goes through the riot-grrl motions on the Slits-sampling ""Bring It On"" without ever really believing that her hectoring will roust anyone from their Ethan Allen sofas. Edward Collins does a passable turn during ""Medicine Man,"" but only succeeds in making me go digging for my Orange Juice CD's and wishing I wasn't broke so that I could afford the recent Josef K reissues. For a couple of minutes Jackson covers the dialectic funk of Scritti Politti's ""Sex""-- well, actually just the incendiary bass line; Jackson forgoes the in-debt-to-Derrida lyrics. Beyond displaying his own flashy production skills, Jackson's only goal here (as throughout this album) is to grab someone else's groove, while ignoring their often provocative message. Since Jackson has been promoting this gaudy album by appearing at swank SoHo parties at Emporio Armani and at Jane magazine's invite-only do's, he does nothing to escape my very low opinion of this deceitful album. By co-opting and debasing punk-disco's vitality and sincerity and thereby rendering the style accessible to the botox-and-bulimia set, Jackson betrays the visions of those whose ecstatically powerful music he lavishly degrades. Playgroup is far from being people power in the disco hour.","If Pitchfork handed out awards for how lush an album sounds, how crispily hi-fi a release is, then Playgroup's ...

"The Amos House Collection, Vol. 2",Various Artists,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7fb5e6ef959693210e3/1:1/w_160/be6295ba.jpg,2002-04-28 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2014-the-amos-house-collection-vol-2/,Wishing Tree,"Charity compilation albums are the bane of a music critic's existence. Lacking the unifying theme of a soundtrack or tribute album, most compilations offer little in the way of fun, creative angles for record reviews. At best, they work kinda like a mass-produced mixtape, albeit one made up of throwaways, b-sides, remixes, and demos. Worst of all, if a cold-hearted critic like myself were to mercilessly pan the album, thus decreasing its sales, the charitable cause (in this case a homeless shelter/soup kitchen in Rhode Island) stands to make less money. Thus, I must weigh my journalistic integrity against, say, frying in hell for taking food out of homeless peoples' mouths. So I'll get that last concern out of the way by declaring up front, without qualms, that the second volume in Wishing Tree's The Amos House Collection series is a pretty solid comp, ideal for those with a predilection towards introspective indie singer/songwriter material. But that still doesn't leave me with a witty and intriguing vehicle for discussing the album, other than tried-and-true comp-reviewing formats like song-by-song analysis or categorization into ""good,"" ""okay,"" and ""Bright Eyes."" Ahhh, what the hey: Artists Who Sound Like Other People Seeing as this compilation is largely made up of acoustic, country-tinged slow songs, it's no surprise that a few of the acts sound like they're singing karaoke down at the Red House Painters bar. Drew O'Doherty's ""Oneway"" is the most obvious perpetrator of this crime, but he also does a much better job than the Clairvoyants on their somnambulant ""Don't You Know."" Aden, who count Senator Phil Gramm's son among their ranks (no lie!), steal the country-rock glory by going further up the genre's family tree to Gram Parsons for ""The Red Door,"" a laid back steel-guitar treat. The acts wary of C&W; influences opt instead to mimic the sound of Lou Barlow at his sparsest, be it Skating Club's enjoyably twee ""Stockholm"" or Son, Ambulance's unremarkably noisy ""Two Girls."" The Gentle Waves' ""Pretty Things"" sounds like Belle & Sebastian (duh), but with schmaltzier horns. Wheat's ""Test Tones (Demo for the Flaming Lips)"" ends up, strangely, not sounding very much like the Lips at all (maybe a half-hearted stab at Soft Bulletin grandeur). Yet Elf Power, as always, sounds exactly like the Flaming Lips on ""Free Will and Testament."" Artists From My Hometown: Downers Grove, Illinois Believe it or not, there is one: Kleenexgirlwonder. While the home-recorded project of Graham Smith should probably be filed in the category above due to his submission's passable GbV clone job, I couldn't resist mentioning our shared suburban heritage, nor the fact that he was my high school girlfriend's mortal enemy. People, it really is a small world after all. Remixes That Are Neither Re-, Nor Mixed A big pet peeve of mine is the remix that sounds only slightly different from the original version, and The Amos House Collection has two such offenders. An ""early version"" of Elliott Smith's ""Bottle Up and Explode,"" for instance, is basically the XO track without drums. Azure Ray's ""Rise (Deadverse Mix)"" makes more noticeable modifications, but the newly beefed-up drums and emphasized background drone sound like they're bleeding over from the next room. However, Spoon's ""Everything Hits at Once (Remix for Discos)"" subtly tweaks just the right elements for increased potency, turning the trad-rock of the original into a synth-driven new-wave number. It's the only song of the compilation that breaks the wispy acoustic mood, and it sounds all the more glorious for it. Appearances By Notorious Pitchfork Punching Bags We've gotten a lot of mileage out of sucker-punching born targets like Bright Eyes and Ida, two bands who make an appearance here. I'll go ahead and throw another jab at the former, as Conor Oberst contributes the overlong solo acoustic track ""Entry-Way Song,"" complete with shaky voice and characteristic dollops of self-pity like, ""I'll start wishing to die again."" Ida, however, covers the traditional country-folk of ""Jubilee"" to great effect, avoiding the overly precious and thin sound that's marked recent disappointing efforts. And All The Rest Other artists, both notable (The Aislers Set, Emily Sparks) and otherwise (James William Hindle?) add songs that aren't particularly noteworthy and make little effort to break the hazy aesthetic of the compilation. In fact, when all eighty minutes are taken together, The Amos House Collection, Vol. 2 is a rather sleepy affair, with a consistent mood rarely found in your typical near-random assortment of artists' leftovers. It's not unreasonable to imagine the album being used by the Amos House itself to gently drift their homeless tenants off to dreamland. Now you can pretend you're an impoverished drifter, too.","Charity compilation albums are the bane of a music critic's existence. Lacking the unifying theme of a soundtrack or ...

(This Is) What We Call Progress,Saloon,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a34813d1975652138a5c/1:1/w_160/d8cde22e.jpg,2002-04-28 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6986-this-is-what-we-call-progress/,Darla,"Some albums only seem appropriate when the earth's tilted a certain way. All winter I steeped myself in atmospheric gloom, but things change, and now a band has come along and brightened everything up for me. The indie kids are walking in the park, casting fey glances at one other, tugging shyly at their faded pastel-colored t-shirts. La femme d'argent surveys the scene with a bemused smile hidden behind a copy of Le Monde, while the rocker dude slouches by, trying to peer over her sunglasses. And for once, all this doesn't make me sick, because I've got Saloon playing in my headphones, too. Saloon are a five-piece from Reading, England. Their debut, (This Is) What We Call Progress, is an auspicious record that basically soundtracks this blossoming season. For those of you in the southern hemisphere, the upbeat chords and crisp drums on ""Plastic Surgery"" will kick-start spring back into action. Everyone's strumming to the chirps of the Moog keyboard and the fair voice of Amanda Gomez. She has one of those sweet, mundanely pretty voices, and it suits the breezy melody well. ""Le Weekend"" begins with a bassline bouncing merrily and light keyboard crests, then the instruments all swell together, guitars squealing wildly and just as soon settling down again. It's cute without being twee, and makes for great sunny-day driving music. This band writes smart little indie-pop songs, and they always seem to know where they're going. ""Girls Are the New Boys,"" for instance, begins simply. Gomez' voice coasts over the galloping drum crashes as she coolly intones, ""So this is the new world/ Just like the other one."" But after the chorus and verse, the song extends into a sidelong jam that would have the boy with the Arab Strap swaying to and fro. On a more quiet front, ""2500 Walden Ave"" floats along on an almost feathery lightness. The rhythm section swells with strains of guitar, cello and melodica, carrying the song gently while avoiding the overly sentimental. Gomez layers backing vocals over the track, creating an ethereal effect similar to the shimmery, subdued breaks on Stereolab's Dots and Loops. There's substance beyond the cheery melodies in their world, though. ""Bicycle Thieves"" is a slice of fragile introspection drifting through the intricate pulse of the bass and guitar. ""I'm a frightened spider in your mouth/ You're too frightened to speak and let me out,"" sings Gomez, backed by an achingly sad viola. Michael Smoughton lets loose one of the slow, solemn trumpet swells that grace a few of Progress' songs, always at the penultimate moment. ""Across the Great Divide"" builds more aggressively, churning forward with thick guitars and strings, its protagonists caught in the slow-motion torture of a long-distance relationship. An instrumental section follows, just humming drone and ringing glockenspiel and the high-pitched call of a theremin, leaving the listener stranded in the divide with no sense of resolution. Even these melancholy songs share a warm, sympathetic vibe. Fans of Belle and Sebastian, Broadcast and Tyro will no doubt enjoy. If there's a fault here, it's with the sound of the disc itself: (This Is) What We Call Progress plays as if mastered at a muted level, and you have to keep turning up the volume to hear the details. Maybe we can shift the blame to Mahogany mainman Andrew Prinz, who produced the album. But unlike Cruiser, whose Northern Electric suffered a similar fate, Saloon's low fidelity adds to the delicate aesthetic of their works. It's like the spring, caught between the cold of winter, with ravenous summer approaching.","Some albums only seem appropriate when the earth's tilted a certain way.

One Time Bells,French Kicks,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be24abf31b7dc71560d7/1:1/w_160/e918bcda.jpg,2002-04-26 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3192-one-time-bells/,StarTime,"I'm no fan of geographical stereotypes, residing as I do in the South. Though at a given point of cultural fascination, a band's locality may help them sell records (think Seattle, 1992), there's no guaranteeing they'll sound the way you want them to, as all those who bought Sub Pop albums on the off chance that the bands sounded like Nirvana can attest. We live in culture of near-universal ADD, where an 'it' band and a to-the-minute sound have a habit of disappearing from public consciousness with a vicious quickness. We get bored (raise your hand if you groan at the thought of another Chicago-based post-rock band), the music sounds passe (anyone remember the ska revival?), and in most of the above scenarios bands are trapped riding the coattails of the initial breakthrough act, hoping to catch some vicarious limelight before the fashion moment ends. French Kicks originated out of a high school friendship in Washington, D.C., separated during college, and reunited in the not-too-distant past in New York City. By their location alone, their sound is about what you'd expect. If you've ever wondered what a J. Robbins partnership with the Strokes would sound like, your prayers have been answered, sort of. Some tracks, like the melodic, streamlined ""When You Heard You"" sound quite a bit like Burning Airlines. Some of the more uptempo songs, such as ""Crying Just For Show"" and ""Right in Time"" in particular, sound a lot like the Strokes. The Kicks also look a little like the Strokes, have a catchy name, and walk a stylistic path that places them somewhere between New Wave-influenced, radio friendly rock and roll and dissonant post-punk. And the results aren't that bad, actually kind of tantalizing at times. Super-clean, methodical music undercut with spare keyboards and drummer/vocalist Nick Stumpf's self-conscious crooning. It seems like a recipe for at least marginal success, so long as the public fascination with this sort of thing doesn't fade into oblivion before One Time Bells has a chance to make the rounds. But that said, I'm still not sure I like this album. It's not just a question of good songs and bad songs, though there are a few of each. The primary candidates for loser status are the two tracks (""Down Now"" and ""Close to Modern"") in which the French Kicks venture into dangerous blue-eyed soul territory and come off sounding (unintentionally, I hope) like Hall and Oates. I admire the bravery required for including such eclectic material, and the harmonies are nice, guys, really pretty, but... Likewise, I would recommend that French Kicks be wary of continuing in the vein of their opening track, ""Wrong Side."" It's poppy and polished, could be a candidate for rotation on MTV2, but it's a bit boring, like a slightly above-average bar band. Just listening to it makes me want to order a beer. (Note to Miller execs: The French Kicks would be ideal for one of your indie rock beer commercials. Much better than Smog. Smog doesn't make me want to party and drink MGD. I mean, I don't really drink Miller beer, but if I did, I would drink it to French Kicks.) The New Wave-inspired numbers are a more interesting. ""1985"" (strictly speaking, it sounds a bit more like 1983, but no matter) fuses the French Kicks' fascination with early period Wire with an 80s pop sensibility. Like most of the songs on this album, there are elements here I really like-- the sparse guitar, the atmosphere-- but it's almost like they went back and tried to make the song more accessible after the fact. The harmonies don't fit, for one. The heavier guitars on the choruses sounds contrived. Seldom do I ever think music sounds patronizing, but it comes off like French Kicks are talented musicians who just don't trust their good instincts. Or maybe they can't decide what sort of band they want to be. ""One Time Bells,"" the title track, with its chiming guitars and consistent melody, is probably the album's best cut. In some ways, it best exemplifies their sound, without all the overt influences and identity crises. So, what I've come up with is this: While better than some of their previous releases, One Time Bells still isn't a mind-blowing album. But I do think the French Kicks are a good band, and I won't be surprised if, an album or two down the road, they're a great one.

Nanoloop 1.0,Various Artists,by: David M.

Man, that shit was fucked up. The music was all crazy and foreign-soundin', Mario resembled a little turd with legs, the villains were funny-looking ripoffs of the villains in the real Mario games, Mario rode in a submarine, and when you got the fireball it bounced all over the friggin' screen (well, all two inches of it, anyway). My point is two-fold. One: Super Mario Land really was, in many ways, a sub-par addition to an otherwise fine series of side-scrolling video games. Two: those Game Boys sure can make some crazy noises. The latter is the principal upon which Nanoloop operates. A real-time sound synthesis program which fits into a Game Boy and makes loop-based music with its four sound cards, Nanoloop is a video-game-nerd-turned-music-nerd's dream come true. And in case you were wondering, yes, it really can make some pretty interesting music. Basically a $15 advertisement for the Nanoloop program, Disco Bruit's Nanoloop 1.0 compilation consists of fourteen tracks composed with the program. But while there are a few winners, it's still a pretty lackluster example of what's possible with the program. AGF/DLay's ""Still Eatin'"" is a dark, foreboding track that manages to sound very little like its source. It creeps along through murky ambience, slowly building in intensity with percussive blips occasionally cutting through the tension. Felix Kubin takes the exact opposite approach with ""Ich Traume Nur in Super-8,"" crafting nothing less than traditional video game music: the kind you'll swear you've already heard a thousand times, no doubt the theme to that one level in that game with the shooting things. Blectum from Blechdom manage to retain their self-assured goofiness, perfectly replicating their personality on ""Burbanked,"" even as they use nothing but simple tones. It's an amusing track-- though, like much of the duo's work, it may be a bit too repetitive for its own good. Bruno & Michet Are Smiling's ""Everyday Bodymarket"" is a hilarious take on hardcore punk, with shrieking vocals, cheap synth melodies in place of guitars and machine-gun style-effects in place of quick drum rolls. Stock, Hausen & Walkman's ""Pillion Passenger"" is pretty solid, alternating between a pulsing gurgle that almost resembles a driving house bassline and abstract tones that remind me of Nobukazu Takemura's sparsest moments. There are some quality tracks here, but eventually one can't help but ask: would this be at all interesting if I didn't know it all came out of a Game Boy? In many cases, the answer is a definite no. Oddly enough, most of the really weak moments actually come from the bigger names. Merzbow contributes what I can safely call one of his most painfully repetitive tracks in recent memory. For ""nloopcbn,"" Pita piles an unheard of number of static tracks on top of one another, then plops a whole bunch of goofy, same-sounding, go-nowhere loops on top. Perhaps most telling is Oliver Wittchow's ""Fragment,"" which places electronic farts atop a pretty, ambient pattern made up warm, repeated tones (not unlike those that appear in much of the recent laptop work of Jim O'Rourke). At one minute and 25 seconds in, the piece cuts off, because (according to the liner notes) the DAT broke. Unprofessional? Maybe. Silly, even? Sure. But then this is music made on effin' Game Boys for Christ's sake! And that's the beauty of Nanoloop (the program) and the problem with Nanoloop (the compilation) all wrapped up in one tight package. As a musical instrument, it is completely devoid of pretension. After all, how seriously can anyone take sounds coming out of an 8-bit handheld video game system? It's a simple program-- the kind capable of making cool sounds in almost anyone's hands. That's right, you and I are just as capable of making interesting sounds and patterns with Nanoloop as the world's most accomplished musicians. And so, while there are a few worthwhile tracks here, my suggestion to you is this: save your fifteen bucks, dig through your childhood closet for your long-neglected electronic friend, go pick up the program, and start making some video game music of your own.","Remember Super Mario Land for Game Boy?

Postmodern Platos EP,Tom Z√©,by: Ryan Schreiber,Founder,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab455e6ef95969321715/1:1/w_160/3a659885.gif,2002-04-25 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8949-postmodern-platos-ep/,Warner Bros.Luaka BopWarner Bros.Luaka Bop,"Upon my pal Brent DiCrescenzo's suggestion, I've been digging on the recent Luaka Bop compilation of the ""best of"" the 1960s psychedelic tropicalia band Os Mutantes. If you'll recall, Brent raved about them a couple of weeks back, hyping their use of the Beatles' White Album recording techniques three years before the Fab Four had even conceived that album's existence. He was right, too-- Os Mutantes pretty much got it goin' on. I urge fans of recent Stereolab and Beck LPs to make a journey to the record store, posthaste. (Fuckin' do it, then!) Tom Ze's one of those 60's tropicalia guys. That's the blinding flash of brilliance I'm able to present on Ze's musical background. Y'know, he worked the same scene as Os Mutantes and Brazilian genius Caetano Veloso, drawing influences from everything from bossa nova and samba to American protest songs and Morricone soundtracks. But you know remixes these days-- they're not concerned with maintaining the original feel and emotion of the music. Rather, today's remixers take minor elements from the LP versions and warp them with experimentation. The end product is invariably a completely new track that incorporates a few samples from the original song. This is fine by me, as long as the remixers are competent musicians that can produce something that is not only worth listening to, but that the original artist would deem worthy of bearing their name. In the case of Postmodern Platos (I don't think they're referring to Dana Plato, better known as Kimberly from ""Diff'rent Strokes""-- God rest her soul), we've got five fantasmoid remixes, and a straight, previously unreleased Ze track. The selection of artists remixing Ze's material is top-shelf, if a bit predictable. It opens with the High Llamas' gurgly, liquid Squirm-style take on ""Defect 2: Curiosidade."" The keyboards are distinctly Americanized tropicalia, with jazz organs and studio effects that, at times, seem to have shot forth from the skilled hands of Nigel Godrich. Tortoise's John McEntire's version of the same song follows the Llamas' track nicely, incorporating Brazilian acoustic guitar, a solid bassline, an advanced samba rhythm and Ze's organic vocals and pitch-perfect harmonies. Sean Lennon's rendition of ""Defect 5: O Olho Do Lago"" sounds decent enough, even if his ideas are somewhat amateurish and obvious (the sample of the electric drill was more effectively executed by-- and I hate to say it-- Ministry, on the opening track of 1989's The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste). But Lennon's obviously spent some much-needed time familiarizing himself with the expensive recording equipment that dad's legendary recordings paid for. He delivers a slow, punching hip-hop beat for the first part of the track, and all-out pre-programmed jungle rhythms for the second. Amon Tobin turns in some predictably spaced-out, jazzy Brazilian drum-n-bass for his remix of-- you guessed it-- ""Defect 2: Curiosidade."" Despite the fact that we've already heard two versions of the song by this point, Tobin's beats are undeniably refreshing when pitted against the comparitively stale drum tracks of previous cuts. When, four minutes into the almost seven- minute- long nebulaic journey, Tobin breaks out his trademark frenzied rhythmic assault, he casually casts off the best one- and- a- half minutes Postmodern Platos has to offer. Sasha Frere-Jones, who you may recognize from his full-time outfit, Ui, or from the pages of Spin Magazine, dishes up the EP's last remix-- a head-bobbing, mellow spin on ""Defect 1: Gene"" complete with breathy female vocals. But I can't really be of much help in assessing the quality of Ze's non-album track, ""Canudos,"" since I'm not yet familiar with his latest Luaka Bop long-player, Fabrication Defect, the album the original versions of these songs appear on. I will mention, however, that its angular guitar part and ""hillbilly violin"" are enough to make me have to pee. Take it how you will. Postmodern Platos works on two levels: it can be experienced by Tom Ze fanatics as an opportunity to hear hip scenesters' interpretations of a tropicalia legend's latest work, or by hip scenesters who know nothing about the guy but are looking for an affordable helping of post-rock and drum-n-bass. You decide which.","Upon my pal Brent DiCrescenzo's suggestion, I've been digging on the recent Luaka Bop compilation of the ""best ...

The Eye Popping Sounds of...,Herschell Gordon Lewis,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcef13d197565213b422/1:1/w_160/c8c5dadc.jpg,2002-04-25 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4761-the-eye-popping-sounds-of/,Birdman,"[Cue kettledrum roll.] Ladies and gentleman: this CD, truly one of the most unusual ever compiled, contains sounds which under no circumstances should be heard by anyone with a heart condition, or anyone who is easily upset. We urgently recommend that if you are such a person, or the parent of a young or impressionable child now, that you and the child remove your headphones immediately. There are 37 titles being presented on this release that we would sincerely like to warn you about. The titles include ""Blood Feast,"" ""Tongue Torn Out,"" ""Get Off the Road,"" ""Blast Off Girls Rock 'n' Roll Party"" and ""Brains Knocked Out."" These are, without exception, the bloodiest, goriest songs ever produced. If you are the least bit squeamish, do not attempt to listen. We've told you about many horrific CDs you probably got a big kick out of, but these are different. If you have an impressionable teenager, under no circumstances let him or her see it. Absolutely no children will be allowed to hear this. All of these titles are in mono, which even makes the horror more palpable. We are sincere in warning you about this music. The titles, again, include ""Poolside Frolic"" and ""How Dry I Am,"" and they are honestly the goriest music ever produced! Hear them if you must, but we wanted you to know what to expect. [Dim lights. Curtain.] ""And now, some tragic local news. We have a report of another murder tonight. Another girl has been found dead in Rogers Park. The body was badly mutilated. Because of these murders, police request that all women stay inside their homes after dark. If you must go out, please have someone accompany you. Keep your door locked."" The ominous kettledrum pounds increasingly faster, like a funeral march running downhill, ever quicker, losing control, until-- a shriek! A roller-rink, soap opera organ plays the chords of terror, filling in whatever breathing space you might have left. And then, quiet. The wry kettledrum reappears, as if to warn us of impending danger. Solemn, forceful trombone plays the tune, solo of the grim reaper, accompanied now by equally grim piano and cello. But then, a note of hope: the piano tumbles down the scale, ending on the augmented chords of doom. There can be no light in Herschell Gordon Lewis' world of tragic gore! All alone he ponders how to make the movies that popularize his brand of grade-Z horror-- for it is but grade-Z, the last refuge for the semi-talented and largely penniless alike, that could hope to keep this kind of indecency far from impressionable eyes and ears. Lewis would write, direct and produce his cinematic works of uncommon devastation for the deranged audience so hungry for fresh flesh. And he would also compose music so truly terrifying, only those with stomachs of iron (and perhaps a penchant for lo-fi trash culture) could hope to remain unaffected. Classic 1960s films such as Blood Feast, Living Venus, Two Thousand Maniacs and She-Devils on Wheels contain the music we strongly urge you and your loved-ones to think twice before hearing. For who could fend off the dreadful organ stylings, replete with scatological bass-trombone interruptions, of ""Critical Condition""? What chances have you and yours against the dubious garage rock, doubling as damning social commentary of ""The Pill""? What, is that a baby's cry I hear? Truly horrifying, ladies and gentlemen. To add to the confusion and fright, Lewis has drafted authentic mountain musicians to realize his terrible bluegrass visions for films like Moonshine Mountain, and captured the wild, hormonal frenzy of youth for the modern-day rock and roll of ""Get Off the Road"". Please, do not remain on the road if you are at all susceptible to motorbike collisions! Yes, there are islands on which to rest amongst the sea of terror. ""Living Venus"" is a classic ballad; calling to mind the great composers Liberace, Welk and Torme, and featuring the warbly croon (and what a horrible warble it is) of Lewis himself! The beautiful, recurring virtuoso guitar of ""Recurring Virtuoso Guitar Bit"" fiendishly wears down your guard for the following organ and piano nightmare of ""Lister's Garbage."" If there is one thing you can be sure of, it's that Lewis has taken great care in the arrangements, even when he was the only musician available to perform the horrendous melodies. As he says, ""I'm no Paul McCartney, posing and posturing as though I'm a serious composer"", so please prepare for the unadulterated emotion (or possibly last-minute filler-material) with which he has so masterfully impregnated this music. As a final warning, we want to remind you that women and innocent children should not attempt to listen to this music without ample precaution. Even grown men have been known to run in terror from the horrifically fruity flute of ""Quicksand"". Do not make the mistake of thinking you've heard it all, and are therefore immune. We may have a registered nurse on duty, not as a phony advertising gimmick, but because she may very well be needed. Hear the music if you must, but remember-- we warned you.","Ladies and gentleman: this CD, truly one of the most unusual ever compiled, contains sounds which under no circumstances should ...

Thriller,New End Original,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1d15e6ef95969320299/1:1/w_160/4d63600f.gif,2002-04-25 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5764-thriller/,Jade Tree,"If there's anything the Pitchfork litmus test has shown time and time again, it's that despite all the conjecture regarding ethics and self-management, drugs make for effective music. The Flaming Lips' Soft Bulletin, an album which successfully approximates the ambience of a powerful psychotropic experience, is regarded as veritably perfect: a 10.0. So, theoretically, the sonic approximation of Valium would rank a 5.0 on the Pitchfork rating scale. If that's the case, then Jonah and his friends in New End Original are pleading with their parentally assigned psychiatrists, social-workers, and Big Brothers to help increase the potency of their music as we speak. Dream as we may, though, the most visceral experience Thriller induces is the lightheaded wooze you experience after a rough bout with carsickness. With ex-members of Texas Is the Reason, the Americans, and Far, one no longer needs to scour their older brother's record collection to find a stunning synopsis on the quality of musicianship that was being signed in 1991 amidst the grunge hysteria. The fact that each of these guys were in their own respective garage bands at the time ensured their being offered record deals. But your standard alternative/modern rock radio format can be a bitch-goddess; taking with one hand while disbanding with the other, and from the uninhabitable landscape produced by the post-grunge insurgence of nu-metal, New End Original came to be. Kicking things off with a track the band knowingly refers to as ""Lukewarm,"" New End Original want you to know that they've seen the revolution... and it's called the Green Album. ""People always tellin' me how happy I could be/ I'm never gonna find out,"" sings Jonah, a man so revered in some circles that, like the Greek poets and philosophers that preceded him, society needs only his first name with which to fill its history books. Potential can be heard seeping through the cracked vocals and broken equipment littering Thriller: ""Hostage"" and ""Leper Song"" recant on the group's more wounded interpretations of the Promise Ring, opting to place their subject matter in a more appropriate musical setting. For the New End Original, this means sub-par renditions of whatever Mark Kozelek threw into his dumpster yesterday evening. I'll tip my hat to the romantics out there who maintain the belief that anything written in an overtly emotional state is not only the most honest reflection of character, but is also capable of purging your sores and sins in a way that only an authentic artistic realization can. Still, relying exclusively on the hackneyed pop-punk formula and poetry that raises Billy Corgan to the upper echelons of American literature reflects a sort of self-involvement which, in all likelihood, got Jonah's ass kicked on the playground after lunch, and on the way to practice today. So yeah, we created this monster. The optimist in me wants to say that the almost childlike simplicity found in the execution, song structure, and lyrical content reflect the honest sentiments of a band baffled and disoriented by the complexity of day-to-day living. The pessimist? Well, he took his own life seconds after hearing, ""Do I have something to hide/ Who am I to say/ I'm lonely as a leper.""","If there's anything the Pitchfork litmus test has shown time and time again, it's that despite all the ...

Live,Meat Puppets,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0ed13d19756521384eb/1:1/w_160/cc2e2e9f.jpg,2002-04-24 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5197-live/,DNC,"Oh, how the mediocre have fallen. With his band's glory days nearly 20 years behind them, and the Kurt Cobain-induced second wind almost a decade gone now, Curt Kirkwood has seen fit to release yet another live Meat Puppets album, the second since 1999. That's a faster pace than Rush, for crying out loud! But wait, you say-- 1999's Live in Montana documented the Pups' original lineup, this one captures the new band. Exactly! That's why this album is even less necessary. As a big fan of their initial quartet of albums, I hesitate to even call this band the Meat Puppets. The only remaining original member is singer/guitarist Curt Kirkwood, drummer Derrick Bostrom having hung up his sticks and Curt's brother Cris still in the grips of severe drug addiction. These Meat Puppets sound like a bunch of alterna-dudes hired from a Sam Goody in Austin. So who, exactly, needs this? It seems even diehard Meat Puppet fans (and there must be some somewhere) have to be growing weary by this point. At least I'd hope so. The Pups' crumbling legacy has taken a hit with each release since 1987's Mirage. 1994's Too High to Die-- heralded as a breakthrough upon its release and certified gold-- is rivaled only by Sugar's Copper Blue in terms of used-bin-clogging alternative rock albums. But if you must know, Live is pieced together from two February 2001 live gigs, one at Maxwell's in Hoboken, the other at Higher Ground in Winooski, Vermont (I dunno, maybe some ski resort was having some kind of deal: play a gig, get a free all-day lift pass). Curt and the replacement Pups draw their set list mainly from 2000's abysmal Golden Lies-- at least they had the good sense to keep their mitts off the classics. But even if for a moment one can forget who this band is purporting to be, the songs presented here rarely raise above mindless butt-rock and metal-ish alternawank that would have sounded incredibly dated in 1994 and sounds even more so now. You can't even blame it on a poor recording, that's one of the things you can't complain about with this disc. Unfortunately for Kirkwood and the boys (as I'm going to call them from now on), this means the songs are revealed for what they really are: pure garbage. Kirkwood's once-eerie vocal growls are greatly subdued, and most of the fire is gone from the formidable guitar playing of yore. There's not much good news to report here. Of the newer songs, ""You Love Me"" is a standout if only for its ability to evoke past glories, sounding very much like ""Up On the Sun"" (which gets a weak re-reading here). But by song's end, the constantly repeated refrain just sounds like a pathetic attempt to convince the diehards they're not just wasting their time with yet another in a long string of disappointing releases.","Oh, how the mediocre have fallen.

Original Instrument,Original Instrument,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba02eb335119a49ec921/1:1/w_160/2294cd41.gif,2002-04-24 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6039-original-instrument/,Kracfive,"In the fast paced, ever-evolving world of contemporary electronica, nothing lasts long. Works once perceived as masterful often seem horribly dated only months later. The glitch-- only recently deemed the next big thing-- is now in a state of complete stagnation, with no sign of returning to its former glory. Albums thought classic a few years ago are laughing matters in the face of new technological achievements. Not even a year since most of us first heard names like Machine Drum and Prefuse 73, the idea of chopping up vocals is starting to sound like yesterday's news. Sure, there's the click-hop movement; artists like Akufen and Andreas Tilliander attempting to bring something new to the table, to resuscitate the sliced-vocals thing with their own unique styles and sounds. But despite their best efforts, it seems it won't be long before this too is old news. Been there, done that. Enter Original Instrument. Consisting of all four founding members of the Kracfive label, their approach is slightly more extreme. The sounds on this album are comprised 100% of human vocals. The name suggests a back-to-basics approach, a return to bare fundamentals, but don't be fooled. Original Instrument isn't really about the human voice, but rather those processes used to chop it up, distort, maim and manipulate it. Provided you believe the label's claim that the sounds on this album are 100% processed human vocals, then indeed Original Instrument stands less as an ode to the glory of the human voice than it does to the power of computers to manipulate sound. Does the process outshine the art? Does the music get lost in the shadow of the gimmick? The answer, surprising and pleasing, is 'not in the least.' Original Instrument is damned entertaining from start to finish, really a fine piece of electronic music, even if it does happen to fit in the oft-maligned category of 'concept album.' There's no denying the work that went into Original Instrument. The care with which these samples have been chopped up, fucked up, pitch-shifted and arranged into something undeniably melodic and rhythmic, yet not obviously vocal-based, is prodigious. These guys have taken something simple and made a pretty stunning array of beats, drones, pops, clicks, tweets, and all kinds of weird noises from the most literal of organic sources. Granted, tracks like ""Bop Me"" and ""Nake"" take the obvious approach; funny noises, hung loosely from a beat or a rhythm. Anyone whose ever spent time fucking with digital audio tracks has heard these sorts of sounds before; that vaguely robotic effect that results from stretching out or looping a very small chunk of audio. ""Coughio"" builds beats out of fragments and arranged samples of, well, coughs. Even Ferris Bueller could do that. Tracks like these are fun the first couple times around, but admittedly, they lose a lot of their gusto by the fifth listen. Other tracks are more ambitious. ""Conversong"" is an ambient track that sees the masterminds piling a few looped vowels atop one another, stretching them out over five minutes, and shifting each of their pitches gradually in different directions. ""Heavens to Betsy"" is Original Instrument's take on an R&B; groove. They layer Cuisinarted vocals around a looped sample of a female R&B; singer, and damn if it doesn't sound soulful and sexy, even if the backup singers' oohs and ahhs end up getting stretched out, hacked to slivers and spattered about, like the aural equivalent of a Jackson Pollack painting. Original Instrument is, without a doubt, a one-trick pony. But the trick is a pretty good one. And the guys running the show are versatile enough to keep it interesting, jumping from beat-driven to ambient, from soulful to abstract and back again, all without ever sounding too scatterbrained. Original Instrument maintains a strong sense of balance throughout, always sensing just when you're about to get bored with their toys, always showing up with something new to recapture your attention just at the right moment. Original Instrument won't solve your problems, find you a job, reunite your long-estranged family or any of that. But, there's no denying that it's kinda fun. And sometimes that's all that's necessary.","In the fast paced, ever-evolving world of contemporary electronica, nothing lasts long. Works once perceived as masterful often seem horribly ...

Sonic Bullets: 13 from the Hip,Bambi Molesters,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2035e6ef95969320306/1:1/w_160/4e13a999.jpg,2002-04-24 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/538-sonic-bullets-13-from-the-hip/,Dancing Bear,"Think of a place you'd associate with sun and surf. I'd wager there are quite a few minds going to California right now, maybe northern Australia or Hawaii. I'd also wager that there's not a single one of you out there thinking about Croatia. Maybe it's just the recent civil conflict that still lingers in the air there, or the Cold War-inspired perception of Eastern Europe as a perpetually cold, bleak place, but Croatia doesn't get much credit for its fine Adriatic beaches outside of the countries immediately surrounding it. I don't know much about the surfing conditions in Croatia, but regardless of what they are, as far as the Bambi Molesters are concerned it may as well be Zuma Beach. Sonic Bullets is a surf album as pure as they come, drenched in spring reverb twenty fathoms deep, and indebted more deeply to Duane Eddy's twang than you are to your creditors. All the horrifying visions of human hands defiling the purity of helpless forest animals conjured by the band's name pretty much melt away upon seeing the album cover, which features a stylized blue-hued photo of a barefoot, campy/sexy spy girl sneaking around behind an obtrusive, Ventures-style typesetting. Right there, you pretty much know what you're in for. What's really surprising is just how good the music is. The Molesters crash out of the gate at full tilt with the excellent ""Theme From Slaying Beauty,"" a tune that would sit nice and tight next to anything off of Dick Dale's King of the Surf Guitar. There are no gimmicky little samples from Japanese monster movies a la Man or Astro-Man?, just spirited throwback surf that behaves largely like irony never existed. ""Malaguena"" up the ante by adding the Spanish-influenced trumpet work of guest Boris Mohoric to the fray, as the dual-guitar assault of Dalibor Pavicic and Dinko Tomljanovic moves in tidal washes around him. The gravity of bassist Lada Furlan and drummer Hrvoje Zaborac's rhythm section drags everything along like a stiff, deadly undertow. Though Sonic Bullets was largely recorded in Slovenia, the band also spent some time in Seattle, apparently befriending the Minus 5's Scott McCaughey, who contributes organ, vibes, piano, tubular bells and even bass harmonica to nearly half of the album's tracks. Fellow Minus 5-er Peter Buck adds some guitar and fuzz bass here and there as well, though he also does his best not to overshadow the already able band. Buck's star power might shift a few more units for the Bambi Molesters, but it's McCaughey whose contributions are really worth noting. His bells on ""Ice & Pinewood Trees"" significantly up the song's creepiness factor, as though Chris Eckman of the Walkabouts' deadpan monologue about hitchhiking to the ocean wasn't enough. It follows the album's only other vocal track, ""El Corazon Del Loco Jorge,"" which features a Spanish narrative courtesy of Eduardo ""Speedo"" Martinez of Finnish garage punks the Flaming Sideburns (you can't make this stuff up, folks). Though these two songs are interesting diversions, the band is generally at their best when they concern themselves with the primary task at hand: making great instrumental rock that transcends the kitsch that colors modern surf. Most good surf has some sort of edge to it, but a few of the slower songs here actually sound a bit mournful-- something that's exceedingly rare in the genre. It makes sense, of course, given that the band members all came of age during an extremely tumultuous time in their country's history, and it adds a dense of depth that makes the album more engaging. Whereas, say, Man Or Astroman?'s fine cover of Larry Weed's ""Bombora"" was simply frenzied and wild, the Molesters infuse it with a dark energy absent from any other version I've heard. Strong originals like ""Tremble & Shake"" take this even further, sometimes to the point of sounding downright menacing. ""Final Wave for the Day"" has a wonderfully sad minor-key melody juxtaposed with manic rhythms and boisterous playing, while ""Double Danger"" drips with the edgy paranoia of a great spy theme. Finally, there's the steadily creeping closer ""Chaotica,"" shrouded in McCaughey's vibes and piano while Buck, Pavicic, and Tomljanovic each stake out their own territories, one offering texture with backward strums and volume swells, another comping chords and the third picking out a smoky lead line. Beautiful stuff. Thus ends one of the most terrific surf records I've heard in ages-- the best at least since Man Or Astroman?'s Experiment Zero. Fans of the genre are advised to hastily run out and pick this up. It's probably not surprising that the Bambi Molesters are the only Croatian group I've ever even heard, but listening to Sonic Bullets has me wondering if there's any more unexplored talent over there. For now, I'm thinking I just may call a travel agent and see about a beachfront timeshare in Croatia.","Think of a place you'd associate with sun and surf. I'd wager there are quite a few minds ...

Veni Vidi Vicious,The Hives,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0f85e6ef95969323630/1:1/w_160/3af3df6f.jpg,2002-04-24 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3890-veni-vidi-vicious/,EpitaphBurning HeartEpitaphBurning Heart,"The Hives, the safest garage band in the world today, have already conquered Sweden and are now preparing to take America with their so-called 'punk rock avec kaboom.' Like the Ramones-- if there had already been a Ramones before them-- or a Stooges who learned to make noise and then showed no more curiosity about it, the Hives dish out power-punk that's totally predictable, but will knock your ass around your hips and blow the gel out of your hair. The Hives are as tight as their groupies' pleather miniskirts, and they run as smoothly as a Japanese sports coupe: zippy, efficient, and they never need to go in for repairs. Drummer Chris Dangerous bangs the skins like a helicopter, and Howlin' Pelle Almqvist has a steady scream, with just one gimmick: every so often he lets his voice crack into a yelp, like someone just kicked him. ""Got ouAYYYEt wayAYYE late... in 200AYYYYYEEE8!"" The guitars are loud but a little textbook-- when they're asked for power chords on ""Main Offender,"" they deliver exactly like you'd expect. And those chords have made ""Main Offender"" their big worldwide single, though for my money ""Outsmarted"" has the better hook and will get you jumping higher. Plus, instead of ""outsmarted,"" it sounds like they sing ""I farted,"" which is almost avant-garde in its crassness compared to the genteel 1950s tone of the other lyrics. Veni Vidi Vicious was first released two years ago and immediately took Sweden by storm, but it's just now breaking in the States. The band is riding on the coattails of the garage-rock revival, though this band has been at it since the Strokes were too young to understand their own name: nine years, dating back to when they were teenagers. Fans of the quintet's debut, Barely Legal, will notice that the Hives have slowed a little with age. That album sounded more like straight suburban hardcore, and the great early song titles like ""a.k.a. I-D-I-O-T"" and ""Hail Hail Spit 'n' Drool"" gave way to the comparatively wizened ""Die, All Right!"" and ""Knock Knock."" Not to mention ""Supply and Demand,"" which even predicts their fame in post-Strokes America. Kicking off with the monster-movie chords of ""The Hives - Declare Guerre Nucleaire,"" they bang through twelve tunes in thirty minutes-- some of them indistinguishable from one another, but at that pace who cares? As on Barely Legal, all of the songs spring from 'Randy Fitzsimmons,' the only mysterious thing about the band. The mythology of the Hives states that Fitzsimmons is the Svengali-like manager who got them together and writes their material. Hundreds of people are arguing right now about who Fitzsimmons is and whether he's real: if it's an actual guy using a pseudonym, or a guy who has that name but can't be found, or if one or all of the Hives write everything and they just made up the name. Even New Musical Express has weighed in on this issue (they think it's guitarist Nicholaus Arson). Maybe the story is some kind of statement, their way of half-jokingly saying they're a manufactured supergroup-- a Swedish punkcore N*SYNC. Not that it matters much; this is punk rock, not the Dead Sea Scrolls. But the Fitzsimmons legend also reveals what's flawed about the band-- that they sound like five guys who took up garage-rock, instead of a band that actually played in a garage. Instead of coming from noise and chaos, they're rooted in pastiche and show business, as evidenced by their cover of Jerry Butler's 1960s tune ""Find Another Girl."" Your parents might dig this album as much as you do. For that reason, I like them both a little more and a little less than their supposed peers-- they're more entertaining, but maybe less fun. When they tour the States in the next couple of months, I'm going to check my own theory on who Fitzsimmons is: I'm betting he's the guy that meets them backstage, sticks the wind-up keys in their backs and tightens their springs to the breaking point before dropping them in front of the crowd.

Gotham!,Radio 4,by: Eric Carr,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1e4c0084474cd0bff07/1:1/w_160/f1fa07d6.gif,2002-04-23 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6650-gotham/,Gern Blandsten,"Is there any greater disappointment than a band that sets admirably high standards for themselves, yet consistently fails to achieve them? Probably, but that doesn't stop Radio 4's second effort, Gotham!, from being a big fat letdown. It's not a bad album by most standards-- in fact it's pretty good at points-- but in the end slides into a mire of adequacy after generating high expectations early on. Radio 4's roots are firmly planted in the rich tradition of British post-punk, lest anyone forget. And of course, whenever a band makes such an obvious approach toward genre that's been explored by some of the most influential bands of the past twenty-five years, they can't help but invite negative comparison. The band has yet to return the sound they borrowed from post-punk luminaries the Gang of Four for their first album, The New Song and Dance, though on this go-round, they've managed to flesh out the standard battery of clanging, jagged guitar bursts and dance rhythms with more prominent electronic elements and a little funk, to almost uniformly positive effect. They still remain fairly derivative, but at least here, unlike on The New Song and Dance, they demonstrate the ability to bring some nuances to a familiar sound. Understated but well-placed sequencers on ""Our Town,"" the impressive and sweeping album opener, work. The bite-sized funk riffs littering the album (most prominent on the energetic and genuinely entertaining ""Eyes Wide Open"" and ""Calling All Enthusiasts"") make it easier to remember that you aren't listening to some strange Mission of Burma or Wire B-sides. It's nice enough, but frankly, the album's energy is spent after the first 25 minutes, and the second half of the album feels like an aftershock from the impact of the first seven songs. Both of the real standouts on the album, ""Save Your City"" (the only truly melodic offering on Gotham!), and ""Speaking in Codes"" (a dark, nearly guitar-free offering) are tossed directly into the center of the album. Musically, it's thoroughly, thoroughly passable, although every once in a while the guitar work breaks to the fore to pleasantly take control of a tune, and the bass is particularly solid and driving throughout, if a bit generic. It's a crying shame though that bassist/vocalist Anthony Roman's voice is wasted on such award-losing lyrics. On nearly every track, the complexities of such issues as activism, economic power determining the status quo, and various other 'revolutionary' ideas are approached with all of the verbal subtlety of an eighth grader with an anarchy symbol stitched onto his backpack. Despite the criticisms, if I had heard only the first seven tracks, this could've made some big points. Gotham! is decent, catchy, and entertaining, but can't keep up the pace it sets from the beginning, which is just too damn bad.","Is there any greater disappointment than a band that sets admirably high standards for themselves, yet consistently fails to achieve ...

Island Row,Capitol K,by: Malcolm Seymour III,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a513c0084474cd0c0637/1:1/w_160/c4c22630.jpg,2002-04-23 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1291-island-row/,XLPlanet ¬µ,"The latest effort from London's one-man Capitol K outfit is an elegant stylistic cocktail that mixes indie pop and IDM (let's say the ""I"" stands for ""independent"") without compromising either. The hybridization of rock and electronic genres has become a fairly tired musical formula over the last several years, but 26-year-old Kristian Craig Robinson executes with such precision and innovation that Island Row leaves even the seasoned listener slackjawed and struggling for comparisons. K's music draws from a broad pool of influences, indicative of his geographically scattered childhood. Maltese by birth, he divided his early years between Dubai and Borneo, coming eventually to Britain for secondary school. There, Robinson encountered American indie bands like Fugazi and Sonic Youth, who inspired him to start his first band. His background gets a bit hazy beyond that point, but his music suggests that, somewhere along the line, he ate loads of psychotropic chemicals, picked up a few Rephlex records and bought himself a Dictaphone. All these jumbled elements of his past echo forcefully in his work, and more evenly on Island Row than any of his previous outings. Capitol K's recording legacy dates back to 1998, when he released a self-titled 12"" on Elf Cut Records. Two of the four tracks from that record made the cut for his full-length (the absolutely astounding Sounds of the Empire) on Mike Paradinas' Planet \xB5 imprint the following year. Of that album, Mike writes (and I concur), it ""is still one of the best debut albums I have heard."" You might even care to scratch the word debut. Material from these early releases hints only cautiously at Robinson's rock-n-roll leanings. The follow-up Roadeater EP, issued in early 2000, signaled a shift toward a more balanced mixture of vocals, samples and strumming. And Island Row carries the torch-- four of the 11 songs here have proper lyrics, and nearly all feature a bit of guitar-work. Still, the prevailing theme here is production; the inane, carnival-esque noodlings reminisce of Mouse on Mars, while the occasionally caustic drum breaks recall tunes from Autechre's Gescom side-project. But Capitol K brings so much of his own flavor to the table that likening him to either of those musicians would be misleading. Exoticism becomes a key theme in Robinson's work-- not the token ethno-techno exoticism of Talvin Singh or Badmarsh & Shri, who intersperse dull drum loops with unimaginative sitars and tablas, and earn credit for ""fusing"" different genres. It would be more appropriate to say today's world beat musicians layer different genres, always conscious of which sounds belong to the East and which belong to the West, and scarcely exploring any middle ground. Capitol K breaks this mold, and stakes out a bit of sonic territory somewhere in between. Reversed drum loops bounce between Eastern and Western time signatures, while Robinson's candid falsetto brings urgency to even the most saccharine lyrics. Out of context, many of the lyrics seem puerile, which is probably what makes them so damn effective. It wrenches even my calloused heart to hear K innocently cry the chorus of the opening track, ""Heat."" ""I'd like to know/ If you like the cold/ 'Cause when we meet/ I'll bring the heat."" On paper, it reads like a nursery rhyme, but the latent angst beneath Robinson's voice tells a more frustrated story-- one of a lost passion. ""Pillow,"" which also made an appearance on Roadeater, seems the most readily accessible song of the lot. Even while treading through bubblegum turf, it manages to retain its edge and subtlety, thanks to Robinson's production trickery. But gems lurk in the album's darker corners as well. ""Monster,"" as the name might suggest, can be at times difficult and abrasive, matching heavy guitar distortion with esoteric Eastern melodies. Other honorable mentions include ""Breakers,"" ""Lion Anon"" and ""Forgotten Duffle Coat,"" on which K collaborates with friend Leafcutter John. The album loses points for two reasons, the most legitimate being that a handful of the tracks feel disjointed. Capitol K's transitions tend to be remarkably smooth, but there are several on this album (particularly on the songs ""God Ohm"" and ""Is It U?"") that it seems he might simply have handled better. The second complaint I'm obligated to lodge against Island Row is a reprimand for the Prince cover, ""Dance On."" Robinson admits he intended it as a joke, but thanks to American copyright laws, that joke prohibited Americans from importing this brilliant record for nearly four months. I could have done without the inconvenience, especially for this lackluster song. I hope I've done this album justice, but it's tough to tell when so many terrible albums receive so much critical lip service. If my generic praise leaves you with the impression that Island Row is generic music, do yourself a favor and dig up some MP3s. These songs deserve to be heard.","The latest effort from London's one-man Capitol K outfit is an elegant\n\ stylistic cocktail that mixes indie pop ...

Protein Source of the Future... Now!,The Mountain Goats,by: Zach Hooker,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3d513d197565213be02/1:1/w_160/5cb4bade.gif,2002-04-23 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5452-protein-source-of-the-future-now/,Ajax,"I confess to being totally baffled by the Mountain Goats. First off, the band is officially comprised of several people, though the vast majority of their recordings feature only one person: John Darnielle of Southern California. The others crop up as occasional backup singers or additional instrumentalists, but very rarely; more often than not these songs are just John playing guitar and singing alone in his living room. Darnielle has revealed in interviews that he becomes very frustrated when hearing his recordings described as ""just one guy playing guitar and singing alone in his living room"" because he values the invisible input of the other Mountain Goats. He's complex like that. Secondly, the Mountain Goats record their songs on a boombox, on plain old cassettes. I've heard more professional sounding recordings come out of answering machines. I mean, several of their songs end with the clearly audible click of the stop button being pressed on that boombox. There's no multitracking, there's horrible distortion and background noise, there are dropouts from damaged tape. And it's been like that for ten years. Third, given an uninterrupted hour in a quiet room, I myself could teach most people, including my 11- year- old cousin, to play the guitar with the same proficiency as Darnielle. But when John makes a mistake or plays a sour note (which is often) he doesn't yell ""do overs"" and stop the tape. He finishes the song and puts it on a CD. Sure, he's gotten better over the years, but he still makes mistakes. The striking thing is that he appears to take great pride in them. Fourth, and this is really all you need to know about the Mountain Goats, John Darnielle has the singular ability to sing lines that nobody should be able to sing straight- faced and make them sound simultaneously absurd, melancholy, and absolutely beautiful. Lines like, ""It's gonna be so nice when the Easter Bunny comes,"" or, ""There's a monkey in the basement/ Where did the monkey come from?"" Darnielle creates miniature narratives much like those of Jorge Luis Borges: small spaces with their own rules, drawing inspiration largely from classical sources. Protein Source of the Future... Now!, a collection of 7"", cassette and compilation releases, is chock full of these weird little lines and spaces. The veiled menace of ""Night of the Mules,"" the magical realism- cum- western of ""Billy the Kid's Dream of the Magic Shoes,"" the one finger Casiotone accompaniment on ""Going to Malibu,""-- this album is rotten with lyrics and music that nobody should be able to get away with. But somehow, when Darnielle sings, ""I am evil forest/ That would kill a man on the day his life seems sweetest to him,"" you believe him. And when he plays the same chord for a full twenty seconds at the end of ""Going to Tennessee,"" you're bummed when he stops. Because he plays that one chord like he means it, godammit, and that's more than you can say about nearly everybody else out there. Rock on, John. Yeeah!!","I confess to being totally baffled by the Mountain Goats. First off, the band is officially comprised of several people ...

TaaPetSounds,Taa-Pet,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a716ea9e61561daa54e9/1:1/w_160/a7f6cfd9.gif,2002-04-23 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7912-taapetsounds/,Fact,"Don't try to deny it. I saw you do the double-take: Pitchfork finally decided to revisit the Pet Sounds review! But such is not the case. Taa-Pet means ""wallpaper"" in Hebrew, and while this disc isn't quite Baroque or Rococo, that's a closer reference point than pocket symphonies and California girls. Press play and hesitant cadences rise, mysterious ringing tones that slowly shift in pitch. Bass modulations begin to supplement the near-silence, shuddering like the purr of an electric generator. This is ambient music, of a sort. Taa-Pet is Aviad Albert and Binya Reches. The duo have been on the Israeli music scene for years. Reches was a founding member of industrial rock force Die Welt (no doubt named in part for the German paper). Albert worked for years as a music journalist and as an employee for Kasbah Records, representing foreign labels like Warp and Ninja Tune locally. The Taa-Pet project began as an exploration beyond the foreground of music into what might be considered the background. They've found an obliging label in Fact, an offshoot of Jerusalem's Balance record store which serves as a clearing house for all kinds of experimental music from Israel. TaaPetSounds was composed live on computer with MIDI sequencing and sampling; it's a test of minimalism in a pristine digital environment. The three-track ""Cold Sweet Potato"" announces itself with only a sine wave. There's something about its indelible arc that sounds so pure, maybe because it's representing itself: the sound-wave as a wave of sound. It's simple and easy to picture, yet also elusive by nature, always sounding like it's radiating from somewhere besides the speaker. Faint crackling particles start to flicker at the periphery, distracting your attention from the eerie whine. Even as hovering helicopter whirs invade, it's hard to shake the clinical atmosphere. If you're listening with headphones, you might start to wonder whether this really is just another soundtrack for PoMo art galleries. But then a two-note bass drone descends, casting the rest of the elements into contrast. It's as if all the little noises before were just glares of light rippling on a vast sea, and then the moon was suddenly obscured so you could see into the depths. These elements cycle slowly, forming their own waves of overlapping tension, echoing in more extended sequences each time, gradually creating a sense of spatiality. But TaaPetSounds is more than just a Reichian experiment in delay. Reches and Albert leave clues that remind you of their improvisational skill, like the random bird-squawk synths on ""Do the Wrong Thing,"" and the mournful guitar reverb on the following ""Prahey."" Throughout these seven tracks and 45 minutes a patient narrative develops, though at first it always seems nothing but noise. When knob-twiddlers are disparaged, it's usually because their manipulations are seen as facile; but the Etch of time and the Sketch of space are a powerful axis, and when your stylus inks with the most basic tones in the electronic palette, less often turns out to be more. ""Anti Virus"" is as evocative as ambient gets, full of brain-tingling sine squiggles and massed ethereal keyboards. Remember the old Nintendo game ""Metroid""? When Samus Aran paused to rest, these are the sounds she heard in the caverns.","Don't try to deny it. I saw you do the double-take: Pitchfork finally decided to revisit the Pet Sounds ...

Wild Love: The Detroit Rehearsals and More,Iggy and the Stooges,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0e75e6ef9596932007a/1:1/w_160/4d4a8796.gif,2002-04-23 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6405-wild-love-the-detroit-rehearsals-and-more/,Bomp,"Iggy Pop and James Williamson recorded only one proper album together, the classic and influential Raw Power. It's understandable, then, that every other year or so, a label like Bomp! graces the rock-loving public with yet another collection of recently unearthed, never-before-heard rough cuts and demos of Stooges projects that never were. Often, the value of such collections lies not in the quality of the music itself, but rather in the incidental trivia that can be gleaned from such recordings. For example, did you know that the Stooges actually practiced? Or that Iggy Pop had a recording studio inside his ass? No? Well, it's all true-- and Wild Love is here to prove it. As suggested above, this most recent release suffers from two major problems: poor content and pathetic sound quality. First, the problem of content: on the CD cover, Bomp! dubs Wild Love a ""stunning collection of never-heard songs, jams, and works-in-progress from the darkest closet of the band that started it all."" This is part lie and part euphemism-- it's not stunning, and most of it essentially sounds like band practice. The liner notes are a bit more candid, noting that the disc is composed of various ""false starts and halfway efforts,"" many of which were ""abandoned along the way."" Nonetheless, with barely a straight face, Bomp! would have you believe that Wild Love is an essential look into the Stooges songwriting process, and moreover, that it's necessary to look into their songwriting process at all. If your brain is on, you've already noted a problem with this rationale. Bomp! says it themselves: the Stooges' songwriting process consisted of arriving at a studio, filling up on narcotics, then jamming for a few weeks until a song emerged. Is this so remarkable that it requires its own CD? Doubtful, especially given that most of the tidbits documented here never materialized into actual songs, and sounded as if they never would. But even supposing it were remarkable, embracing such collections sets destructive precedent. Personally, I fear the world where bands feel free to peddle recordings of false starts and band rehearsals. Remember, Creed practices, too. Then there's the even greater problem with Wild Love-- its remarkably poor sound quality. This collection may as well have been recorded on an answering machine, or maybe in that ""darkest closet"" where they found/stored these tapes in the first place. The tone is muffled, sapping the band of all its trademark intensity. Raw, sure, but powerful? Not by a long shot. Despite its shortcomings, the disc still has a few high spots. The title track (not coincidentally, the album-opener) is one of the few completed songs on the disc. As with most bands, the Stooges sounded better when they were trying (go figure) and the song is a testament to that fact. Wild Love mostly documents post-Raw Power-era blues jams, pairing Williamson's guitar noodling (which, although capable, is nonetheless still noodling) with some of Iggy's most forgettable vocal moments. For example, in ""I Come From Nowhere,"" Pop freestyles off of the title verse, ""I come from nowhere,"" eventually arriving at the Whitman-esque ""Everybody's a square/ Dirty underwear."" I see England, I see France... There's a whole cache of Stooges material more worthy of your dollars than Wild Love. Those who own it all won't be dissuaded by this review. But unless Bomp!'s suck-up liner notes truly resonate with you, there's little point to owning this record. Practice makes perfect; so just listen to the perfect stuff, and leave practice for the fanatics.",,3.8,
Chocolate and Ice EP,My Morning Jacket,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c429eb335119a49ed8a9/1:1/w_160/b87db61c.gif,2002-04-22 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5532-chocolate-and-ice-ep/,Badman,"It's funny how selective our nation can be when arbitrarily assigning kitsch value to various pockets of humanity. The line between 'nostalgia' and 'bad taste' is incredibly thin. Whereas whole genres, turns-of-phrase, and iconic allusions to fads of yore tend to erratically resurface on the pop-culture landscape, other seemingly perfect candidates for revivalist lampooning lie dormant, unscathed by the trials of time. 2002 seems to be ground zero for kitsch-- the two most notable revivals of the moment being Gary Coleman and the commercial media's preoccupation with 1980s music. Like every red-blooded, patriotic American, I enjoy a good laugh at Gary's expense. He's certainly kept our nation together during these trying and uncertain times. Yet, the chances of him ever being regarded as a serious actor are slimmer than the chances of a new-wave renaissance. While My Morning Jacket have always steered clear of campiness, Chocolate and Ice finds the group taking a few steps back from their recent triumphs. This is an exploratory EP that really serves as a vehicle for the group's 24-minute epic ""Cobra,"" a stark, predominantly instrumental composition that bears a remarkable resemblance to the Steve Miller Band's 1982 ode to sexuality in the world of professional magic, ""Abracadabra."" To their credit, My Morning Jacket manage to carry this song for nearly its entire duration-- a feat only a handful of other groups might be capable of-- but the fact remains that bad 80s synth does not make for a good source of inspiration. Fortunately, the rest of the EP is more eclectic and rewarding. Opener ""Can You See the Hard Helmet on My Head?"" transcends its embarrasingly bad title to find My Morning Jacket taking musical cues from Jeff Tweedy and company. It's here that Jim James' whiskey-soaked voice, one of the group's strongest assets, is at its finest-- wavering between reassurance and aching desperation while hiding behind a dozen or so coats of reverb. Though these guys have always been relatively sparse in their arrangements, Chocolate and Ice takes the 'less-is-more' philosophy further than any of the group's previous efforts, possibly as a cautionary measure against the muddy production value. The dynamic is intriguing, to say the least, as tracks like ""Sweetheart"" and ""Sooner"" pay homage to the 'couples only' dance music of the 1950s-- think Patsy Cline, Buddy Holly, and Roy Orbison. My Morning Jacket are just convincing enough to make the repressed adolescent in me cry right along with them sometimes.","It's funny how selective our nation can be when arbitrarily assigning kitsch value to various pockets of humanity.

Romantica,Luna,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd9813d197565213b590/1:1/w_160/659f9f38.jpg,2002-04-22 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4914-romantica/,Jetset,"Great, cohesive albums often have messages or statements embedded ir the lyrics and musical attitude. As a highly respected and highly paid music critic, it's my job to sniff out these themes and present them to you, the reader. After spending some quality time listening to Luna's sixth album, taking extensive notes, and applying the most complex theories of musicology, I think I have unlocked Romantica's secret: Dean Wareham be getting laid! Of course, I have absolutely no concrete facts to back this up-- it's a conclusion based on equal parts hunch and dirty mind. Nevertheless, I haven't heard a collection of songs this infused with post-coital glow since Bj√∂rk's heavy-breathing exercise Vespertine. But while Ms. Gudmundsdottir's love songs are set in the wintery climate of her home country, Wareham pens tunes appropriate to the album's springtime shimmer, images of lovestruck springs and summer picnics in the park. I mean, come on, the album's called Romantica, the cover art is a Caribbean souvenir cigarette lighter, and the leadoff track's name is ""Lovedust,"" for crying out loud. While a song called ""Lovedust"" that talks about seeing ""a million, billion, trillior stars"" could just as easily be about the demon cocaine, the Jimmy Buffett-style guitar effects and the ""air is creamy/ You look so dreamy"" lyrics suggest otherwise. Throw in the sultry backing vocals of super-hott new bass player Britta Phillips, and you've got the indie rock world's answer to that steamy Robbie Williams/Nicole Kidman duet. Not that the majority of Romantica is much of a sonic departure from Luna's back catalog, a series of albums that don't feature much in the way of experimentation. Wareham's songwriting formula has varied little since his hyper-influential days in Galaxie 500: hazy minor chord vamps behind his thinly wistful singing voice. Since the peak of this approach on the band's classic Penthouse, Luna have made a number of small attempts to stretch out their sound, but Wareham's easily recognizable voice kept the songs from deviating too much from the mean. The same appraisal goes for Romantica, despite the presence of esteemed producer Dave Fridmann; nobody's going to be fooled into thinking this isn't a Luna album. Fridmann's influence is remarkably subtle, wisely keeping his characteristic thick drum sound to a minimum to preserve the band's slight aesthetic. Only the grandiose ""Black Champagne,"" with it's orchestra-in-a-can strings swelling Soft Bulletin-style around Wareham's plea to ""train the disco lights on me"" overtly reveals his presence behind the boards. What separates the album from previous Luna product is not so much instrumental alterations as the newly unabashed sentimentality of Wareham's lyrics. The twelve songs find Wareham largely rhapsodizing about food, love, or both, with stanzas like ""Salt and pepper squid/ And Singapore noodles/ I could look at your face/ For oodles and oodles,"" from ""Renee Is Crying."" Okay, yeah, wher written out, lines like that probably have you puking on your computer monitor. But if anything can pull it off without triggering the gag reflex, it's Wareham's doe-eyed voice, which practically has cartoon hearts bouncing around it. The band, meanwhile, further brightens the mood with ""ba ba ba"" backing vocals and arrangements more peppy and muscular than or previous efforts. Phillips' vocals contribute the most obvious new elements, tradingoff singing with Wareham on ""Mermaid Eyes,"" the band's sexiest song since Penthouse's cover of Serge Gainsbourg's ""Bonnie and Clyde"" with Laetitia Sadier. Instrumentally, the quartet have never sounded so confidently loose, with nearly every song spiraling off into guitar soloing sessions that would perk up the ears of jamband followers, were they not faded out after a minute or two. Unfortunately, the album takes a dive after the first seven tracks into less memorable territory, without a big ending like ""Bonnie and Clyde"" or The Days of Our Nights' clever ""Sweet Child O' Mine"" cover. Chances are you'll hardly notice, however, as by this time the album has lured you into its fuzzy trap. With Romantica, Luna shows that they know their sound and their place: nothing too fancy, just solid, cheerful music for barbecue romance and driving with the windows down.","Great, cohesive albums often have messages or statements embedded in\r\n\ the lyrics and musical attitude.

This new album of yours is in very bad shape. I'm afraid it may not even make it through the next play. I've been listening to it over and over again the way I always do when I've got a review to write, and it's driving me up the wall. Now, I'm looking at the back of the case and noticing the insignia of the Hush label, whose ""anti-rock"" dogma is all too apparent on this release. This album does not rock. Oh, how it doesn't rock! It's nearly impossible to count the ways this doesn't rock. I mean, there are plenty of amazing albums out there that don't rock one bit, but all of them have some aspect that makes up for it-- you know, jaw-dropping melodies, lushness of sound, or just a generally pleasing vibe. This self-titled Kind of Like Spitting release doesn't really have any of those things. Rather, it's like listening to some kid with a high school composition book full of lyrics sitting in the corner of Au Bon Pain singing about all the crap that's ever happened to him during his painful tenure in suburbia. He's barely strumming his guitar, and he makes you finish whatever it is you're eating just a little quicker so you can leave. All of these songs are old-- they've just been extracted from the Kind of Like Spitting archives and re-recorded for this album, but who asked for 'em? The disc opens with ""Crossover Potential,"" which may as well be the anthem of Hush Records, with its lyrics about not having any punk rock credentials or mainstream potential. It also reveals the fatal trap of being anti-rock by being incredibly boring. Ever-so-sparse acoustic guitar strumming and vocals that betray a limited range are all you get. ""Mine"" hardly sounds like a song at all, with its somnambulent finger-picking accompanied by equally sleepy vocals that still manage to sound strained. What might be a toy piano shows up in the background near the end, but it doesn't really do anything except mimic the already negligible guitar part. And this goes on for more than five minutes. I'd go on, but there's hardly much more to talk about. Two songs manage to rise out of the mire slightly-- a cover of Braid's ""What a Wonderful Puddle"" and the guitar-and-flute instrumental ""Canoe,"" which has a nice enough folk vibe to get by. As for that Braid cover, the strumming is more spirited than usual and the melody is good, but even as a standout track it's lacking. At least Braid kicked a little ass while they were emoting in your face. Now, Mr. Barnett, you say in your liner notes that you've been playing with a rock band recently, and that you've been enjoying it. Good for you. I say, stick with it and see how it works out. It's got to have more going for it than this. I'm sure there are people out there searching for an album like this-- quiet, sparse, and-- um, sorry, but I kind of ran out of neutral adjectives there.

I'm thinking of groups like Emperor Penguin, Ladytron and Trans Am, bands that make selecting the style of music -- be it neo-electro, 80's rock or synth pop -- the first step in composition. It's weird that these bands never try their hand at straight disco. It's one of the most identifiable genres of music, with plenty of wink-wink potential if that's your angle-- and, well, it's fun. And, if they know what's good for them, genre bands should about fun. I'm happy to report that Louisville's VHS or Beta emerges now to fill the disco void. Yes, VHS or Beta are a four-piece indie band (two guitars, bass and drums) who play disco and nothing but. The graphic on the inside of the CD tells the story. It's a purple and magenta drawing of four young guys on stage, guitars in hand, performing under a neon ""Le Funk"" sign straight out of that opening shot in Boogie Nights. Confirming the indieness, one of the guys sports a decidedly post-grunge stocking cap and goatee. You might ask yourself why, when there are good house records being released every week, the world needs an instrumental band playing original disco tunes. Doesn't the DJ booth provide the club entertainment? Well, there are certain qualities to this debut EP made possible only by getting a band in a room. You see, VHS or Beta are also a jam band who happen to play disco, as Le Funk's closing live tracks make explicit. The first couple minutes of ""Teenage Dancefloor"" consists of nothing more than a bass drum thump and dueling wah-wah guitars. It's like Spacemen 3 getting funky on Shakedown Street-- groovy music from where the KC don't shine. The four studio tracks are much more slick and composed. VHS or Beta being an instrumental band, the reference point for these tracks is not the Bee Gees, but the faceless instrumental tracks that also graced the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack. Think David Shire, not Donna Summer. These tracks are solid feel-good music, but only the opening ""Heaven"" really leaps out of the speakers. It opens with a glossy update on the lead riff from Shaft, then glides into a boogie wonderland of glistening crescendos, rock-solid beats, and finally, a party chorus chanting something about getting down on a Saturday night. ""Heaven"" contains by far the most prominent vocal on Le Funk and points to a possible direction for the next record. With a few proper songs and an attenuation of irony VHS or Beta could eventually turn in something truly amazing.","A few indie bands make genre exploration their biggest priority.

Let Your Shadow Out,The No-No's,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c419c0084474cd0c35fa/1:1/w_160/4d4504ee.jpg,2002-04-21 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5821-let-your-shadow-out/,Animal World,"I think the old-fashioned idea of recording a single, gauging the reaction, then recording singles until you have enough tried-and-true material to put out an album is a good one. Sure, the creative geniuses of the late 60s and early 70s, with their orchestral clusterfucks and masturbatory double albums, may have balked at this notion. But most of them were forced to operate under the former system until they either a) accumulated a fanbase so large and devoted that no one cared about being bludgeoned with a twenty-minute keyboard jam with extended drum solo; or b) everybody, including the heads of the record labels, were so stoned it made no difference anyhow. Theoretically, punk rock put an end to this (this requires we conveniently forget Sandinista), but the damage had already been done. These days bands are expected to come out of the gate with fully realized albums. The No-No's, a coed Portland indie-pop quartet, have released the musical equivalent of a novella (take your pick-- short album or long EP?) called Let Your Shadow Out. The title track is such a bang-up opener, I endangered the lives of all those traveling in the eastbound lanes of I-240 early Saturday morning (owner of large white truck with the Smiths sticker and Ohio plates-- I am truly sorry) when my overt enthusiasm compromised my driving skill. Let Your Shadow Out is one of the most perfect two-minute pop songs I've heard in a long time, from the bounce of the verses to the growl of the choruses. I would be inclined to refer to this as pop-punk-- the incontestable catchiness of the material (think the Fastbacks on a really good day) undercut with Robin Bowser's Cub-like vocals would seem to steer it that way. But for the negative associations (admit it: when I say pop-punk, you scoff and think about overproduced three-chord wonders from California and the Midwest), I won't. Three out of four bandmembers have full-time gigs with other bands, which ensures an odd sort of dynamic: the tightness of technically proficient musicians, undercut with a sort of off-the-cuff weekend project mentality. That said, there's little aural similarity to the Jicks (guitarist Mike Clark), the Halo Benders (bassist Ralf Youtz), or Dub Narcotic (drummer Heather Dunn) in the No-No's. One might be able to make a comparison to Dunn's former projects, Tiger Trap and the Bangs, but Let Your Shadow Out is neither as cutesy as the former, nor as punk as the latter. There is no other track on Let Your Shadow Out that lives up to the promise of the first. My callous first reaction is this: when three-fourths of the band is involved with better-known musical projects, there's scant time for writing and rehearsing a full album of Grade A material for a sideline operation. On the band's website, Bowser-- the only full-time No-No-- laments their inability to tour due to conflicting schedules with the other members' bands. The more obvious answer may arise from the fact that no other song-- save the under-one-minute rant, ""I've Had Enough""-- matches the tempo of the first. The other songs aren't bad-- in fact ""The Strategy"" is a great, retro pop number with nice harmonies and some charmingly wry lyrics: ""I'm not the alpha female/ I always blow it on the first impression/ I wasn't trained to be polite, you know."" Likewise, the early 60s-influenced ""Girlfriend"" has its moments, especially as a vehicle for Robin Bowser's vocals, which, in this context, sound a bit like a nouveau Lesley Gore, but without the crying. The acoustic ballads (""Empty Bed"" and ""Sunshine"") don't really work. Softer, slower songs exaggerate the imperfections in Bowser's voice, and her off-key spunk tends to be lost in the translation. The No-Nos' simplistic arrangement is designed for the unruly pop of the faster numbers. Likewise, the Monkees cover, ""Love Is Only Sleeping,"" though fairly well executed, doesn't seem particularly well-suited to the strengths of this band. The danger of working on a song-by-song basis is the possibility of never matching the strength of your best song. The relative obscurity of the No-No's no doubt diminishes their chances of landing on the next Now THAT's What I Call Music! compilation, but one really great song is no small accomplishment. I could name scores of bands with more consistent albums who couldn't put out a good single if they tried. Let Your Shadow Out exhibits the kind of infectious, yet prickly sound that characterized a certain style of Northwest indie-pop a decade ago (before the musical landscape got so subdivided that it seems all I do is hyphenate genres). Not revolutionary or challenging. Listening to it won't make you smarter, or even make you appear smarter-- it's just good fun.","I think the old-fashioned idea of recording a single, gauging the reaction, then recording singles until you have enough tried-and-true ...

Yankee Hotel Foxtrot,Wilco,by: Brent S. Sirota,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aa31b1335d7bf1699612/1:1/w_160/7aa808cd.jpg,2002-04-21 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8676-yankee-hotel-foxtrot/,Nonesuch,"Myth, it has been said, is the buried part of every story. On April 23rd, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot finally emerges into the light of day, having spent the last year interred in its own cluttered mythology: a hermetic studio gestation, with the inscrutable guidance of Chicago ex-pat/kindly wizard, Jim O'Rourke; internecine squabbles; conflict and resolution with American media behemoth AOL Time Warner; the release portentously slated for September 11th, but mysteriously delayed; the indecipherable short-wave radio prophecies; and, eventually, the hero's welcome, with the first stirrings of spring. It's all there: the miracle birth; the unlikely hero; the, um, benevolent mentor; the primordial menace; good over evil. Joseph Campbell would be pissing himself if he weren't dead. The miraculous birth narrative of Wilco's fourth album, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, is already old hat: banished from straightedge AOL Time Warner imprint Reprise on the cosmically short-sighted judgment of label executives who deemed the album a ""career-ender,"" Wilco streamed Yankee Hotel from its left-wing website to millions before signing with weirdo progressive AOL Time Warner imprint Nonesuch. Long is the way and hard that leads up from AOL Time Warner into the light, I guess. But the unique circumstances of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot's long deliverance make for more than just pointless disc jockey chatter before spinning ""Heavy Metal Drummer."" The long delay and streaming audio conspired to ensure that everyone in the world has already heard Yankee Hotel Foxtrot in part, if not in its entirety. Vast digital pre-circulation, corporate controversy, and buzz like a beard of bees have rendered all reviews afterthoughts at best. But myth is always an afterthought, and these days, the motif I like chewing on best is, without question, that of the Unlikely Hero. Who would have predicted an album of this magnitude from Wilco? As much I love the band, the fact remains that they were together for five years before they produced anything that could stand with Uncle Tupelo's March 16-20, 1992 or Anodyne. AM is rather forgettable, while the expansive Being There, though frequently inspired, travels on paths blazed by Tom Petty on Damn the Torpedoes, if not The Flying Burrito Brothers. 1999's dolorous Summerteeth was exponentially more sophisticated than anything that came before it, though its heroin innuendoes, shades of domestic abuse and nocturnal homicidal impulses sat somewhat ill at ease alongside the album's lush and infectious pop arrangements. Of course, Summerteeth was a strange and majestic, albeit dark, deviation from the alt-country genre Jeff Tweedy co-invented. But since Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, it has retroactively become more of a harbinger of things to come. Upon being pressed by the Chicago Sun-Times about abandoning alt-country, Tweedy dismissively bequeathed the old Wilco sound to Ryan Adams. And you can never go home again. So does Yankee Hotel Foxtrot justify the controversy, delay and buzz? Everyone, I think, already knows that the answer is yes; all I can offer is ""me too"" and reiterate. And after half a year living with a bootleg copy, the music remains revelatory. Complex and dangerously catchy, lyrically sophisticated and provocative, noisy and somehow serene, Wilco's aging new album is simply a masterpiece; it is equally magnificent in headphones, cars and parties. And as anyone who's seen the mixed-bag crowd at Wilco shows knows, it will find a home in the collections of hippies, frat boys, acid-eating prep schoolers, and the record store apparatchiks of the indiocracy. No one is too good for this album; it is better than all of us. But for all the talk of terminally hip influences-- Jim O'Rourke, krautrock, and The Conet Project-- Yankee Hotel Foxtrot still conjures a classic rock radio station on Fourth of July weekend. And this extends beyond the alternating Byrds/Stones/Beatles comparisons that pepper every Wilco review ever written; Yankee Hotel Foxtrot evokes Steely Dan, the Eagles, Wings, Derek & The Dominos and Traffic. The slightly disconnected, piano-led ""I Am Trying to Break Your Heart,"" is delicately laced with noise, whistles and percussive clutter, like some great grandson of ""A Day in the Life."" The muted, ""Kamera"" strums along darkly with acoustic and electric guitars; the twittering electronics in the background don't quite mitigate the tune's comparability to the clever and precise (though now largely neglected) jazz-inflected blues-rock of Dire Straits' stunning debut. The cone-filtered and anthemic country psychedelia of ""War on War"" could have been jammed straight out of a hot ""Bertha"" at a 1973 Grateful Dead show. The violin and coked-up country lounge of ""Jesus, etc."" recalls some mythical seventies in true love and cigarettes. The sharp, stuttering guitar solo that rips open ""I'm the Man Who Loves You"" could have come directly out of Neil Young's hollow body electric circa Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere. For all its aural depth and layering, Yankee Hotel tends to come off as earnest as yesteryear's FM radio. Wilco gets the benefit of O'Rourke's gift for cutting straight to the guts of every style, without the burden of his trademark contempt for the subject matter at hand. And Tweedy seems to be coming into his own as a lyricist. I still wince when I hear him sing, ""I know you don't talk much but you're such a good talker,"" on Being There. The brooding introspection of Summerteeth made for a handful of elegant lyrics, most notably the skeletal beauty of ""She's a Jar,"" where ""she begs me not to miss her"" returns as the stinging ""she begs me not to hit her,"" transforming a wistful love song into something gently bruising. But on Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, Tweedy becomes what I think he always was: an optimist and a romantic. His declaration of wanting to salute ""the ashes of American flags,"" is less cynicism than, perhaps, the devoted liberal's nostalgia for an honest patriotism (check out the array of properly lefty links at wilcoworld.com if you don't believe me). ""All my lies are always wishes,"" he sings, ""I know I would die if I could come back new."" In ""Jesus, etc.,"" there's a cascading simplicity when he sings, ""Tall buildings shake, voices escape, singing sad, sad songs to two chords/ Strung down your cheeks, bitter melodies turning your orbit around."" Sad, celestial and lovely. The final declaration on Yankee Hotel Foxtrot is one of abiding dedication: ""I've got reservations 'bout so many things but not about you."" There isn't a truer word to be had. On Summerteeth, Tweedy yowled about ""speakers speaking in code"" and I thought of that refrain from ""I Can't Stand It"" when I first heard the words ""yankee-hotel-foxtrot"" uttered by the disembodied English woman on the sublimely creepy box-set of shortwave radio transmissions, The Conet Project, which is sampled sporadically throughout this record. And in a deeper, more deliberate world, perhaps we could trace that thread to unravel the secret wonder of Wilco's new album. But I don't think there's any secret; and I don't think there's any code. Beneath the great story of Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, there are all the tropes and symbols and coincidences of a little mythology; but under that is a fantastic rock record. And why tell you? You all already knew this.","Myth, it has been said, is the buried part of every story. On April 23rd, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot finally emerges ...

All of the Above,J-Live,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9b19d034d5c69bf52a4/1:1/w_160/46886672.jpg,2002-04-18 05:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4179-all-of-the-above/,Coup D'etat,"Allow me a moment to restate the painfully obvious: to most of the big record labels, making records equals selling records. There are few moral or artistic victories in the record industry-- just dreams of platinum hardware and signing the next J-Lo. Or would that be J-Lo's hardware and the next platinum record? Hmm... Back to business, though, and our case study: J-Live, a formidable MC and producer, and one of brightest talents in hip-hop's underground today. After drawing the attention of the suits in the mid-90s with fierce underground singles like ""Braggin' Writes"" and ""Hush the Crowd,"" J-Live inked a record deal and began to cut his first LP. But owing to myriad artistic and contract squabbles, J won himself a taste of the big shaft. Not a single official copy of the LP saw the light of day until late 2001, nearly five years after the process began. I blame the record labels, defilers of vinyl, bandwidth, and all other things aurally sacred. The Best Part would certainly be close to the top of any hip-hop top ten list in any year, even a strong one like 2001. That's over now, though, and J-Live has come to a peace about his former predicament (""I've dealt with being dealt dirty, downsized and duped/Done double-paid my dues, for real""). Given the delay, though, you can't blame the guy for making up for lost time. A meager six months after finally dropping The Best Part, J-Live has blessed us again with his sophomore LP, All of the Above, though on the ever-so-underground Coup D'Etat label. And no surprise-- this shit is tight. J-Live describes his lyrical style as ""true school."" Now, I'm a lily white white-boy, and I'll admit I have no idea that means. Whatever he was getting at, though, it's clear that this former English teacher (J-Live taught seventh grade in Brooklyn) has a serious Native Tongues influence. His delivery is similar to Posdnuos, and his lyrical content is along the same lines: intelligent, educated, confident, and socially conscious. And, like De La, J can bring it. His lyrics are clever, and he does shit with meter and rhyming patterns that is simply mind-blowing. In terms of beats, J-Live's knows when to pass the mic, or rather, pass the console. One of his best moves was to enlist the assistance of virtuoso producer DJ Spinna. Spinna dishes dimes on a third of the album's 21 tracks, including two of the strongest, ""Satisfied?"" and ""All of the Above."" ""Satisfied?,"" the first single off the disc, uses reggae-flavored bass and keys in the verses, then adds lo-fi accordion in the chorus, in addition to what sounds like a boys choir. Upon closer inspection (and a peek at the liner notes) it's actually grown men (J-Live et al) singing ""are you satisfied?"" in falsetto-- a neat trick. ""All of the Above"" is easily the best track, musically, on the album. The beat has a chilled-out, transcendent quality to it, spinning a low-key jazz funk in the bass along with ethereal keys (courtesy of Ticklah) and shifty scratches in the instrumental chorus (courtesy of DP One). The rhyme is a fucking masterpiece, delivered via double-tracked vocals-- one more or less the ""melody"" track, with a ""harmony"" track lurking underneath. Sound rich? It is. As if five years of trying to get his debut out weren't proof enough, All of the Above makes it clear that J-Live is no flash in the pan. Rather, it gives you the feeling that J is just at the dawn of a fairly epic career. Good things come to those who wait-- and hopefully, somewhere, a record exec is kicking himself over this one.","Allow me a moment to restate the painfully obvious: to most of the big record labels, making records equals selling ...

Control,Pedro the Lion,by: Will Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a023c0084474cd0bfac1/1:1/w_160/1726e865.jpg,2002-04-18 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6215-control/,Jade Tree,"Jade Tree's press release hypes Control as a concept album about the dissolution of a ""hyper-modern marriage,"" but Pedro the Lion's David Bazan has a difficult time sticking to the subject on this, his third full-length. Aside from a few cynical words for pre-nups in opener ""Options"" and not one, but three meditations on extramarital sex (thanks for sharing, Dave), the album is padded with typical Pedro ruminations on the pitfalls of vanity and technology. Unlike our esteemed colleague DiCrescenzo, I enjoyed Winners Never Quit, with its thoughtful and highly personal themes of loss, regret, and competition. But where that album moved with confidence and conviction of purpose, Control wallows in an amoral netherworld of overamped midtempo ballads and incomplete thoughts. Control's lack of focus is best exemplified by ""Indian Summer,"" a synthy rocker peppered with rhyming non-sequiturs such as, ""The experts say you ought to start them young/ That way they'll naturally love the taste of corporate cum."" A sluggish, vocoder-treated new recording of ""April 6, 2039"" (now titled ""Progress"") does little but detract from the spacey, drum-machine propelled futurism of the original. With its refrain of ""your father drank a little, you're on liver number two,"" Bazan's cautionary words of children spoiled by technology and their parents' emotional detachment should be Control's moral centerpiece, yet the lackluster reading here barely registers. Instead, Bazan obsesses on the seedy details of his protagonists' motel-room infidelities. ""The mattress creaks beneath the symphony of misery and cum,"" Bazan sings on the aggressive, voyeuristic ""Second Best."" ""Still we lie jerking back and forth, and blurring into one."" But Control is never more misguided than on the silly, Metaphor 101 observations of ""Rapture,"" which cheaply likens the moment of orgasm to divine revelation and even slows the pace of the song down, post-coitally, before pepping back up again. Musically, Control breaks little new ground for Pedro the Lion, though Bazan's drumming has improved greatly since Winners Never Quit, best showcased in the loping rhythms and artfully executed fills of ""Magazine."" Unfortunately, Bazan goes on to illustrate why you should never let a drummer mix his own record on the next cut, ""Rehearsal,"" with some of the hammiest fills since Wayne's World's Garth drummed for U2 and a headache-inducing barrage of overdriven cymbals. Somebody send Bazan a copy of The Soft Bulletin, pronto! Not that Control doesn't have its moments: ""Penetration,"" co-written with Seldom's Casey Foubert, is a reasonably cathartic requiem for a dotcom layoff, with chiming, Edge-like guitars and a brash, anthemic chorus. Lines like, ""We're so sorry, sir, but you did not quite make the cut this time,"" will ring sympathetically with anyone who's ever been passed over as casually as a grade-school snot picking teams for dodgeball. ""Priests and Paramedics,"" rising majestically from the overkill of ""Second Best,"" is elevated by a lovely, Thom Yorke-ish melody custom made for Bazan's stoned tenor. It's not hard to imagine its tired protagonist stepping out of Martin Scorsese's Bringing Out the Dead and onto the murder scene of Winners's ""Never Leave a Job Half Done."" The song's evocative imagery and fetching arrangement deserve a better concept album than the jumbled pastiche of Control. Even Bazan's occasionally astute observations are offset by such poetry-contest entries as, ""It will never rain again/ It should do wonders for the GNP,"" and, ""How does that work for you in your quest to be above reproach?"" Or the half-baked philosophy of the dead-on-arrival album closer, ""Rejoice"": ""Wouldn't it be so wonderful if everything were meaningless?"" Oh, honestly, Dave. It would be easy to dismiss Control as a pompous, self-important failure were Bazan a vain and sanctimonious artist. But he's not-- he seems like a soft-spoken, thoughtful, nice-enough guy just like you and me. And while he may never make his own OK Computer or Soft Bulletin or whatever he set out to make with Control, I won't dock him points for trying.","Jade Tree's press release hypes Control as a concept album about the dissolution of a ""hyper-modern marriage,"" but Pedro ...

In Moll,Markus Guentner,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bfb7eb335119a49ed284/1:1/w_160/aebf172e.jpg,2002-04-18 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3585-in-moll/,Kompakt,"True critical consensus is rare, but I've yet to read a bad word about Wolfgang Voigt's Kompakt label. If Voigt had to set aside making music as Gas to get Kompakt off the ground, figuratively trading in his mixing console for a shiny Steelcase desk piled with telephones and staplers, at least he's done it right. Kompakt is emerging as a model electronic label, showing the upstarts how it should be done: present a unified visual aesthetic, release an impressive variety of music that manages to retain identifying reference points, and offer a number of excellent compilations that develop and refine the overriding approach. Last year's Pop Ambient 2001 compilation was the first to showcase the ambient side of the Kompakt coin. The fantastic collection offered two tracks by Germany's Markus Guentner, who has now released his debut album, In Moll, on the label. The initial buzz surrounding the record had Guentner picking up the torch of hyper-textural cloud music where Gas had left it with Pop. And it's true: Guentner's approach has similarities to Pop, especially on In Moll's first half. Keyboards focus on spiraling patterns of repeating melody, precisely mixed clusters of noise highlight the music's tactile qualities, the 4/4 thump pokes in its well-manicured head on a track or two. Mind you, I'm not complaining about the similarities-- Guentner does Gas-eous ambient extremely well. But there's much more to Guentner than mimicry. While the timbral quality of the music sure feels familiar, the overall tone of In Moll is unsettling. Rather than conjuring images of vast open space, Guentner seems to bounce around inside a concrete box. There is, for example, a distinct claustrophobic edge to the second track (the pieces are not titled). For all the squishy sonic seasoning it contains, the piece sounds like a recording of the boiler room that powers some bleak animated world. The wheezes and throbs of the machine seem to echo in some tight, dank space: industry triumphs over nature. The fourth track begins with two spare chords that suggest a peaceful ""calm after the storm"" kind of atmosphere, then takes a left turn as the pastoral chords are overwhelmed with a swell of prickly static. The fifth track is the glitchiest of the bunch, as several distinct and individually compelling swatches of music are stitched together into complex overlapping patterns. Track six adds a synthetic orchestral grandeur that reminds me a little of... well, Vangelis, really-- there's something epic and dignified about 'strings' that aren't even trying to sound real. Even In Moll's closing piece, a patient exercise in drone and assorted electronic percussion, manages to stay engaging for its sixteen minutes. Guentner's debut album is an impressive work of atmospheric electronica, and In Moll threads another feather into Kompakt's cap.","True critical consensus is rare, but I've yet to read a bad word about Wolfgang Voigt's Kompakt label ...

Some would say it's wrong even to ask that question, while others might wonder if Baltimore's The Convocation Of..., on the strength of Pyramid Technology, doesn't give us too much of a good thing. Like the religious zealots in Egypt who spent years in the desert to prove their devotion, The Convocation Of... has a solid dedication to heads-down, hair-in-your-face rock. Pyramid Technology sounds like it was recorded right in the Convocation's rehearsal space. The band is a power trio with George France on drums, Guy Blakeslee on bass and some background keyboards, and Tonie Joy, formerly of Moss Icon, on vocals and guitar. France is heavy but nimble: he sets up some plodding beats and then layers in intricate patterns behind Joy's textural guitars. Joy has a raw tone, deep and raunchy, with a thick, craftsmanlike sound. Even the seven-minute instrumental that ends the album avoids being ambling or pointless, and Joy resists the temptation to subject us to any obnoxiously flashy fretwork: they just dig in, Joy almost studiously building his anti-solo while Blakeslee's bass line thunders in the background, heavy and spare. My only issue with Pyramid Technology is that all nine tracks sound very, very similar. Each song delivers short, thudding, dirge-like rock with the same bleak atmosphere. The band starts off angry, stays angry, and leaves angry, without any frills like an arc or a resolution. ""Recognize"" and ""Walk Like a Panther"" break into (almost identical) interludes with gentler guitar and mesmerizing drumming - but those are the only interruptions, and guest singer Sheri Kadech√©'s low monotone just makes her two tracks seem grimmer. Joy's own vocals are serviceably emphatic-- the talk-shouting works for his subjects, standard hard rock fare concerning monsters, Satan, and The Man. If you're not up for the rock-- or if your dedication to the rock falters-- the Convocation may seem stifling. You may even be bored to tears. You might start clawing at the disc, digging for some kind of sugarcoating-- a catchy hook, some cheesy keyboards, maybe some really comic lyrics-- you know, something like ""Iron Man.""

Plastic Fang,The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba219d034d5c69bf53b0/1:1/w_160/9c1f4194.jpg,2002-04-17 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4292-plastic-fang/,Matador,"Pity poor Matador Records. A mere seven or eight years ago, Gerard Cosloy and Chris Lombardi's New York label was the undisputed king of the alternative rock world, sporting a roster full of just-off-the-mainstream-radar luminaries like Pavement, Liz Phair, and Guided by Voices. But since then, Matador's thoroughbreds have all weakened, be it from a) recording silence after marriage/childbirth/divorce, b) loss of uniqueness from courting radio, or c) splintering into less compelling solo entities. Were it not for lucrative back catalog sales and a pack of Scottish nancy-boys, Matador would surely be frolicking in record label heaven with IRS and Twin/Tone. Jon Spencer and his Blues Explosion weren't quite in the upper echelon of the above artists, but they were sufficiently high profile to appear in Rolling Stone and on 120 Minutes back in those headier mid-nineties. At their peak, JSBX straddled the line between novelty act and early-rock throwback by whitening up the blues behind Spencer's 'Elvis with Tourette's Syndrome' vocals. It was an entertaining gimmick, albeit one with a short shelf life, and it was already starting to fizzle by the time of 1995's Now I Got Worry. Perhaps recognizing this, the band experimented with Dan the Automator and Alec Empire for the Acme and Xtra-Acme albums, to uniformly bland results. In response to those failures, Spencer & Co. have returned to the basics for Plastic Fang: two guitars, a bag full of riffs, and frequent interjections of ""Blues Explosion!"" Never mind the tiny fact that the band's gimmick, if tired in the mid-nineties, is downright comatose these days. Nobody seems to have informed JSBX that the world's music warehouse has become overstocked on pale-faced blues, with the White Stripes, etc. improving the sound by keeping things quick and raw while dispensing with the ironic wink. Or perhaps the Blues Explosion is aware of the garage revival, and looking to claim some kind of Neil Young-esque patriarchal crown. If so, the dozen tracks of Plastic Fang fail miserably, giving off the appearance of a 35 year-old accountant hanging around the old frat house on Homecoming weekend. From the limp rockabilly of first single ""She Said"" to the faux-live party-stomper ""Hold On,"" the Blues Explosion never venture outside of territory they haven't already beaten to death, producing hollow echoes of their stronger early days. Don't fault Russell Simins, whose Grade-A drumming on ""Money Rock N' Roll"" and ""The Midnight Creep"" is comparable to putting a Corvette engine in a Ford Focus. No, blame should be firmly thrown towards bandleader Spencer, whose drawling soul man act has shifted from tongue-in-cheek egotism to outright cartoon. Punctuating verses with yells of ""Blues Explosion!"" and ""Rock and roll!"" might have amused me when I was 15, but in an age where Jay-Z self-promotes seventeen different aliases over the course of an album, Spencer sounds just plain out-of-touch. Given that Plastic Fang lyrically seems to be a loose concept album casting Spencer as a werewolf... well, that really doesn't even require further comment. The dual guitar interplay of Spencer and Judah Bauer remains spottily potent, as on ""Over and Over,"" but usually loses its charm by the one-minute point of the song. Had JSBX kept things short and poorly recorded, a stronger case could probably have been made for salvaging this project. But tracks tend to stretch out over four lifelessly produced minutes so that Spencer can make tired Frampton and James Brown references, coasting along with a fraction of the energetic kick they used to have. It's ironic, and a little bit sad, to see a band whose original goal was to steer the music world back towards Marquee Club-era Stones grow as stodgy and irrelevant as Steel Wheels-era Stones. So while JSBX hasn't formally announced Plastic Fang as their farewell album, this writer's going to go ahead and pronounce them officially deceased (hopefully tricking them into retiring). In true series finale style, it's time to fire up Green Day's ""Time of Your Life"" and run the slo-mo highlight reel: the brilliant Aerosmith/Run DMC sendup video for ""Flavor,"" that other video where John C. Reilly played Simins, the collaborations with R.L. Burnside and Rufus Thomas, and what the hell, Spencer's wife Cristina Martinez running around in a bra and miniskirt. Farewell, Blues Explosion... we knew ye too well.","Pity poor Matador Records. A mere seven or eight years ago, Gerard Cosloy and Chris Lombardi's New York label ...

Put Your Phazers On Stun Throw Your Health Food Skyward,Earl Zinger,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab38c0084474cd0c1322/1:1/w_160/a867c890.jpg,2002-04-17 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8936-put-your-phazers-on-stun-throw-your-health-food-skyward/,!K7,"Priests must get sick of this question: ""Why do bad things happen to good people?"" I've asked, consulted holy writings, quibbled semantics with philosophers-- but I've never received a satisfactory answer. But now, I think I've got the solution, thanks to Earl Zinger's album Put Your Phazers On Stun. Bad things don't happen to good people-- good people just make bad choices. Actually, Earl Zinger does not exist. He's as much a cartoon as 2-D, Murdoch, and the other Gorillaz. The sorry-ass Wizard of Oz behind the Earl Zinger curtain is unfortunately jazz-funker Rob Gallagher. Gallagher was a founder member of hempy jazz-poetry fusioneers, Galliano, and lately the mastermind behind the ace Two Banks of Four project. I first encountered Two Banks of Four on some nu-jazz compilation or other and the track ""Skylines Over Rooftops"" shone out luminously from the rest of the ooh-that's-jazz! diminished chord mush. With a fragile, fractured drum pattern coupled with a voice suggesting Sam Cooke covering the Blue Nile's ""The Downtown Lights,"" I was immediately smitten with Two Banks of Four. Amassing all Two Banks of Four material didn't take long -- there's just the City Watching album and an accompanying remix CD. I'd expected Gallagher to turn out another late-night masterpiece-- eerie, brooding, yet comforting. Alas, no. Put Your Phazers On Stun is meant to satirize dance music, especially the jazz-funk style that Ladbroke Grove hipsters adore. Gallagher's turned out a comedy-poetry album-- Earl Zinger is Wendy Cope or Pam Ayers for slap-happy jazzbos. The songs are essentially suckerpunches at pretentious twats who have to get the latest Bugz in the Attic before anyone else (""Saturday Morning Rush""). On ""Escape to Ibiza,"" Zinger mocks salmon-pink Brits who swarm the blissful island of Ibiza, but with none of the gleeful spite that Blur used for ""Girls and Boys."" Sorry, you'll get more yucks for your bucks if you slap Jamiroquai into the stereo and fall out over Jason Kay's gigantic self-delusion. Set Your Phazers On Stun fails in comparison to albums such as John Cooper Clarke's Me and My Big Mouth, because Gallagher's impotent rim-shot rhymes are no match for Clarke's cruel Manchester wit. The tiresome production on Put Your Phazers On Stun is not even on the same landmass as the futuristic art-punk that Martin Hannant fashioned for Clarke. Dance music needs acts like V/VM, Moodyman, and Kid 606 to rip into its bloated stomach and let the world inhale the fetid stench of its mega-bucks complacence. Put Your Phazers On Stun is not part of the revolution-- rather, it's complicit in dance music's demise by the slightness of its scenester references and self-important in-jokes.","Priests must get sick of this question: ""Why do bad things happen to good people?""

Skiptrace EP,Skiptrace,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4465e6ef9596932082d/1:1/w_160/6e2e99a3.gif,2002-04-17 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7225-skiptrace-ep/,Train Wreck,"I listen to a lot of music, okay? Most of my waking hours are filled with it. Hell, a lot of the time I spend in deep sleep is apparently filled with it too. I can't tell you how many times I've woken up with some song endlessly looping in my brain that has absolutely no business being there-- Rockwell's ""Somebody's Watching Me,"" for instance, or the theme song to Blossom. Alas, there is a boring sameness to a lot of music, especially rock and pop, but sometimes you feel completely jaded, like nothing could surprise you, like if the equivalent of the Beatles or Faust came out today, you'd be unable or unwilling to realize it. I know I needed some quiet time away from music to refresh my ears when I find myself thinking, ""Hey, that Slayer song kind of sounds like Gloria Gaynor."" So what does this have to do with Skiptrace? Well, if you think I'm gonna say this EP is refreshing, that it's some kind of shrill clarion call to wake us overloaded music snobs from our deep slumber, you're wrong. You obviously missed the above rating, or you need to reacquaint yourself with the key to your right. This six-song EP's only real accomplishment is how completely forgettable it is. It doesn't matter how much interchangeable music has been soundtracking my days lately, this sucker takes the cake for utter intangibility. I listened to this EP quite a few times through, but it's impossible to say how many exactly. I put it on repeat, and by the time it's played six or seven times through, nothing-- not one single lyric or melody-- has attached itself to me. It's like a collection of songs made out of massless neutrino particles from the sun, passing through me without a trace. Semisonic's moronic, once-inescapable ""Closing Time"" comes to mind when Skiptrace singer Scott Sellwood steps up to the mic, and the band has obviously paid some attention when listening to Big Star, Todd Rundgren, Matthew Sweet and Jellyfish. Not that I'd call them a pure power pop band exactly-- they have a little indie rock crud on them, tarnishing the gleam. But it's not enough to give them much of a distinctive sound. Two of the songs were produced by Bill Janovitz from Buffalo Tom. The band apparently sent him a demo and he liked it so much he asked them out to Fort Apache in Cambridge, MA to record. It's hard to imagine what it was that attracted him to this particular band out of the faceless throng. Maybe he had his eyes on his pocketbook (aren't Buffalo Tom doing a B-sides retrospective or somesuch?) because these songs seem custom-made for use in some subliminal ad campaign. Maybe when that happens I'll wake up with, say, this EP's ""Open Hands"" stuck in my head. Until then, it's difficult to remember much about it when I'm awake.","I listen to a lot of music, okay?

The Unknown Label,Zealous Fuel,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab445e6ef95969321710/1:1/w_160/c356b32b.gif,2002-04-17 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8948-the-unknown-label/,Sleep Dep Records,"You felt cool just being there, like you might be witnessing the birth of something vital. Eastern Connecticut doesn't exactly have what you'd call an amazing music scene, but there we were, several dozen people mashed into a rented room at the Willimantic Elks Club, focusing our attention on the pile of gear crammed in the corner and the musicians strewn among it, trying their best to deal with a cantankerous sound system. About ten bands played at the event that day-- the organizers called it Inertia-- and truth be told, most of them weren't that memorable. You had a half dozen of those sloppy metal bands with one technically competent member that seem to spring like weeds from the high schools of Connecticut, and some sort of electronic set that was so nebulous no one could even tell when it had begun. As far as I can remember-- and this was all years ago, you realize-- there were two bands really worth seeing that day-- the charmingly cynical folk duo Adam's Leaf, and the headliners, a four-headed monstrosity called Zealous Fuel. The Fuel came on as the sun was going down outside, and left behind a trail of splattered brains and warped minds-- more than a few audience members were left mentally paralyzed by the band's brand of particularly outre weird rock. I can't remember exactly how much time has passed between that show and the present, but listening to Zealous Fuel's first actual album (they released two cassettes that they distributed themselves in the late 90s), I can tell you that they're no less bizarre than they were back when I first saw them. Let's say this: tons of people will totally hate this music. At times, it seems like that might even be the point. Drummer Thatcher Graham's self-taught grooves aren't the least bit conventional and his fills are sometimes downright childish, but the way the band locks into his na√Øve rhythms is remarkably effective. Bassist/vocalist Mike Kelly probably has the strongest chops in the band, dishing out funky, freaky bass lines while the dual guitars of Jason Beebe and Tanner Johnson careen around him with precision or drunken abandon, as needed. And then there's the little matter of Kelly's vocals. Delivered alternately in a vaguely tuneful sneer and a low, rumbling growl, they don't really conjure much you'll have heard before. Taker together with the band's turn-on-a-dime grooves and strangely juxtaposed instrumental parts, they have an almost Beefheartiar effect, though Kelly never gets quite as affected as Don Van Vliet at his strangest. Graham is the band's main lyricist, and the boy has an odd head on his shoulders to be sure. The Unknown Label opens with ""Sticks To Your Ribs,"" blasting in with a thick drum and bass groove motoring away under Beebe and Johnson, whose guitar has just about the ugliest tone you could imagine. The music sways wildly back and forth between this, the teetering, almost martial stuttering of the verses, and the strangely melodic chorus. The effect is pleasantly disorienting, leaving the listener appropriately off guard for the rest of the album. The band's crunchy signature song, ""Zealous Fuel,"" clamors along like some sort of demo Killing Joke might have recorded after their fifth or sixth rehearsal. Kelly's sterling bass line on ""Failure"" is lodged in the middle of a muddle of guitars would shame ever Mudhoney, while ""The Sound of Corduroy"" answers the question ""what if Gang of Four and the Melvins had mated?"" Suffice to say there are a select group of wackos out there who will enjoy the fruits of their hunt if they track this down. People who aren't looking for a bizarre curio that mixes metal, funk, punk and a few other things into an indiscriminate stew should probably steer clear though. For my part, just hearing something so willfully different and strange is enough to make me breathe easy for the future of music.","You felt cool just being there, like you might be witnessing the\r\n\ birth of something vital.

89/93: An Anthology,Uncle Tupelo,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8daea9e61561daa5903/1:1/w_160/80b86ffe.jpg,2002-04-16 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8345-8993-an-anthology/,ColumbiaLegacy,"Listening to this career retrospective nearly a decade after Uncle Tupelo split up, it's not immediately clear why they were such a big deal at the time, and why their myth continues to occupy the center of the alternative country universe. Well, a lot of it has to do with the two bands that emerged from Uncle Tupelo's wreckage: Son Volt and Wilco. Both bands have displayed moments of near-brilliance: every twist and turn along their career path adds to the myth of their former band. Witness Son Volt's incredible debut, Trace, and their equally incredible decline into mumbling irrelevance, or Wilco's wobbly first steps before the masterful Being There, and their subsequent reinvention with Summerteeth and Yankee Hotel Foxtrot. Both of these storylines figure heavily into how Uncle Tupelo is remembered. So what makes Uncle Tupelo so special? On a conceptual level, what they were doing wasn't completely without precedent. Three kids from southern Illinois, inspired by old-time country and punk, form a band sounding something like Dinosaur Jr. covering the Carter Family. Their precursors and contemporaries-- Rank and File, Souled American, Jason and the Scorchers, the Jayhawks, the Replacements, the Mekons-- were all bands that combined country and, if not punk, then at least a certain DIY, anti-establishment aesthetic. What set Uncle Tupelo apart, and why did this band have, and continue to have, such resonance among listeners? Quite simply, Uncle Tupelo was the right band at the right time. Alternative music in general was gaining popularity by the time Uncle Tupelo released their first LP in 1990. That album's title, No Depression, would itself become a synonym for alt.country. As listeners revolted against what they saw as the mainstream, and the spirit of punk itself began to saturate popular music, many listeners craved a more authentic sound. And some found it in the music of Uncle Tupelo. So, almost exactly a decade after Uncle Tupelo recorded their third and best album (March 16-20, 1992), along comes this 21-song retrospective, 89/93: An Anthology. This collection is meant to be an appetizer, something to get old and new fans alike interested in the proper albums, three of which will be reissued later this year (all but Uncle Tupelo's final album, Anodyne, have been out of print for quite some time). As such, Anthology is a bit haphazard and not much of a cohesive listening experience. Anthology's goals seem split between pleasing diehards with a few rarities (a demo, an unreleased B-side, a live cut, a radio session track) and seeking new converts by means of a good band overview. Uncle Tupelo's best moments are Jay Farrar's. It was unquestionably his band, and he was hitting his songwriting peak just as they were breaking up. His ""Graveyard Shift"" (from No Depression) evokes the vast expanse of possibility inherent in the combination of country and punk traditions. Songs like ""Whiskey Bottle"" and ""Still Be Around"" should, by all rights, sit alongside Creedence Clearwater Revival's best work in the future canon of classic rock. And speaking of Creedence, Anthology rescues from oblivion Tupelo's sinister cover of ""Effigy"" (it originally appeared on 1993's No Alternative comp). Tracks like these have an undeniable exuberance and bear the mark of a great band. But Anthology tries to even the score by giving equal time to both of Tupelo's songwriters, and Jeff Tweedy's early material falls a little flat. Tweedy was clearly operating in Farrar's shadow in Uncle Tupelo, and many of his songs (""Screen Door,"" for example) seem like they're trying too hard to achieve some sort of approval. Tweedy had developed into a distinct songwriter in his own right by the second half of Tupelo's existence, as evident here on ""Black Eye"" and ""New Madrid."" Both songs hint at the mysterious and complex lyrical turns he would explore later with Wilco. When it was all said and done, Uncle Tupelo left a legacy far bigger than their recorded output. Hordes of bands would pick up where they left off, and many would be content to stay right there. Fortunately, Uncle Tupelo had the good sense to split up when they did before they were forced to choose between upholding tradition or evolving into something else. Like the Johnny Cash song, Uncle Tupelo walked the line, and were damn good at it.","Listening to this career retrospective nearly a decade after Uncle Tupelo split up, it's not immediately clear why they ...

Electric Sweat,The Mooney Suzuki,by: Brock Kappers,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3b2eb335119a49ed788/1:1/w_160/03022d60.jpg,2002-04-16 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5418-electric-sweat/,Gammon,"The Mooney Suzuki, named after two members of influential kraut-rockers Can, think they're pretty damn radical. From their press photos, one could gather that these boys have raided Lou Reed's attic (or at the very least, made off with some of the Strokes' luggage). Complete with tight leather, black jeans, and dark shades, these kids are ready for fame. In just about every picture, you've got a guy doing the rock splits, kicking out the attitude and the sexed-up pouts. With more poses than Zoolander, they'd best be able to back it up with some decent rock. Well, for the record, they do. Last year's People Get Ready was an amazing debut from the leather-clad lads, and proved to be a wonderful fusion of punk ethos and a dirty garage-rock dance party. You could throw on the LP just about any time of day and party along to the Mooney Suzuki's simple guitar hooks, a thundering bass, and tight disco drumming. With Electric Sweat, the band brings more of that goodness to the table-- and this time with more style than a Barbizon School for Modeling. Electric Sweat was recorded in Detroit, the birthplace of dirty rock 'n' roll. Jim Diamond (of soul-punk outfit the Dirtbombs) has brought a gritty recording aesthetic to the group. Electric Sweat was created at Ghetto Recorders, where the White Stripes, Jon Spencer, and the Come Ons have cut tracks recently. And the Mooney Suzuki have certainly soaked up the atmosphere of Motor City. Electric Sweat is an infectious collection of grooves that proudly utilizes the traditional vocabulary of rock 'n' roll and R&B; to maximum effect. The title track opens the record up with a guitar line courtesy of Graham Tyler's axe (rumor has it his guitar was fashioned out of a piece of wood from the bar top of the Old Absinthe House in New Orleans) that could be straight off Exile on Main Street, setting the pace for the rest of the record, lyrically and musically. ""Get ready/ Get set/ What you get is electric sweat,"" completely sums up the energy and the simplicity of this album. Or the intro to ""Oh Sweet Susana""-- a bluesy, acoustic guitar rant that leads into a laid-back southern rock groove that would make Muddy Waters grin from ear to ear. The swagger factor reaches its peak at ""Natural Fact,"" with its foot stompin' chorus and lines like: ""Mother Nature leave me be/ Desire off my back/ All this feeling killing me/ I need you girl before I crack."" It's exciting to hear the influences of such monumental groups as the Who and the Yardbirds being waved all over the record with such youthful exuberance. Overall, there isn't much to complain about, even when it all sounds vaguely familiar. Like the Strokes and the White Stripes, the Mooney Suzuki pulls from all the right influences to make a very cool, danceable sound infused with enthusiasm and energy.","The Mooney Suzuki, named after two members of influential kraut-rockers Can, think they're pretty damn radical.

Kissin Time,Marianne Faithfull,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd2cc0084474cd0c2c41/1:1/w_160/733a607c.jpg,2002-04-16 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2961-kissin-time/,VirginHut,"Reconstructing Marianne Faithfull's relevance presents a rather Herculean, and potentially Daedalian, task for the A-list 90s songwriters that contribute to her latest album, Kissin Time. Though Billy Corgan and Dave Stewart whisk thin, sun-damaged musical vehicles of feather and wax, Beck, Blur, and Pulp contribute magnificent and complex structures for Faithfull to slither through. The results as a whole, whether fabulously disastrous or formidable, offer an aural spectacle that other 55-year-old, or even 35-year-old, rock stars should dream of wrangling. Faithfull-- the nearest thing rock and roll has to a forgotten Olympian-- comfortably confronts sex in all of her work. When Jarvis Cocker duets or ""Sliding Through Life on Charm,"" he immediately seems like an ideal partner for tackling mature sexuality, nailing Faithfull's essence to a sleazy bed of Different Class e-bow wailing. Between cigarette drags, Faithfull sings, ""Suburban shits who want some class/ All queue up to kiss my ass,"" directing the statement at all those who want to ""kiss [her] snatch."" Yet in an age when Marianne's old flame, Mick Jagger, offers meaningless, coy tripe like, ""Oh joy/ The love you bring/You make me sing,"" and, ""Don't let me near the garden of earthly delights/ Because I could get used to your vision of paradise,"" it's refreshing to hear a Centrum Silver-popping singer talk plainly about fucking. Meanwhile, Beck-- an artist who toys with sexuality behind the shield of irony, whether that's humping appliances in his videos or bitch-talkin' booty rap or Midnite Vultures-- finds a chanteuse in Faithfull, who infuses a newfound poignancy in his lyrics. ""Like Being Born,"" a tale of a girl coming of age, is rife with latent, creepy tones of incest, and floats on a delicate chamber melody bettering most anything on his masterwork Mutations. A maudlir reading of that album's ""Nobody's Fault But My Own"" also appears here, the lines, ""Who could ever be so cruel/ Blame the devil for the things you do/ Tell me that it's nobody's fault but my own,"" hitting the country-tragedy mark with greater aim in a woman's voice. ""Sex With Strangers"" is typically cheeky Beck fare, and enraptures with sick beats, falling somewhere between Amnesiac and Prince's Controversy. Billy Corgan, on the other hand, crafts asexual rock as a rule. Cresting or Adore and Machina, his sexless sound tucks and covers any visceral interaction with its audience through watery washes of Flood production and coldly androgynous leather stage outfits. Faithfull deserves better thar Corgan's overproduced music for confused teenagers. His lyrics, laden with the words ""something,"" ""whatever,"" ""pain,"" ""happiness,"" and ""wherever,"" reverberate vaguely in a throat that's been around the block too many times to know better. In his continuing quest to make his keyboards and guitars sound completely indistinguishable from one another, Corgan embarrasses himself among his peers. Jarvis Cocker induces Faithfull to curse and brag; Corgan closes the album with a Herman's Hermits cover. Elsewhere, Faithfull wanders into predictable, passable glitchy electronica. ""The Pleasure Song"" stutters and crackles like Depeche Mode hoped they might, and even squeezes some neat fading tricks in surround stereo. Firsthand experience excuses Faithfull's amusingly silly lyrics and Dave Stewart's smooth synth-pop on ""Song for Nico"" (not short for ""Nicotine""), even if Stewart's stab at AAA Suede smells fresher than Corgan's contributions. But Blur's title track towers over the fouls. Damon Albarn hypnotizes with a loop of acoustic guitar over percussion clearly influenced by his recent endeavors in Mali. Graham Coxon injects sharp sounds of gris-gris pinball from his guitar. An organ, distant feedback, and chanting harmonies take recent Blur directions like ""Tender"" and ""Black Book"" into eerier, better-realized territory. And as with his work for Clinic and Elbow, Ben Hillier's rich, organic productior continues to wow. Kissin Time stands as Faithfull's best work since 1979's Broker English, and achieves such a feat without taking clich√©d ""mature"" detours into pop standards or orchestral arrangements. Here's hope that the model carries over to people like Jagger and McCartney. Aging rock stars take note: succumb to humbleness and work with others. Singers like Faithfull and Nico always utilized the songs of others to great effect. Icons of questionable songwriting talent but vivid personality can make some very entertaining records. Picture Stephen Merritt behind Courtney Love! Smog's Bill Callahar behind Iggy Pop! Or Neko Case behind David Bowie! At the very least, for the love of god, let Rob Thomas nowhere near the process.","Reconstructing Marianne Faithfull's relevance presents a rather Herculean, and\r\n\ potentially Daedalian, task for the A-list 90s songwriters ...

Pump,Rip-Off Artist,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a27c13d19756521388a9/1:1/w_160/bdbc81af.jpg,2002-04-16 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6792-pump/,Mille Plateaux,"The liner notes of Pump discuss the ""gut-wrenching loneliness and frustration"" that comes from being stuck in the middle of nowhere, working alone for long stretches of time, discouraged from associating with others. Apparently, prior to making music, Matt Haines-- The Rip-Off Artist-- worked for an offshore drilling operation. Or so the notes claim. But then, the liner notes on Haines' previous albums would have you believe him to be an android, an inventor of MIDI-banjos, and a collective of satirists during the Nixon administration... you get the idea. Bust out the grains of salt. Still, when Haines talks about isolation, about ""working for weeks at a time in twelve-hour shifts, surrounded by the constant din of sea and machine"", I do believe that he speaks from experience. After all, this is a man who makes music with a computer, and as Haines himself puts it, ""Pop music is hard work."" Listening to Pump, that much is obvious. Anything that changes direction this often must've been hard work. Though I do wonder about the lazy application of the word ""pop."" The thirteen songs here (which are, for no apparent reason, split into 69 tracks) traverse a wide range of styles and an even wider array of sounds and genres. Truth be told, I don't know what to call Pump. It's electronic to be certain-- there isn't a single organic sound to be found here-- but outside of that broad disclaimer, it's hard to peg. Pump's roots are clearly in house music: more often than not there's a clearly discernable 4/4 beat, marked by repeated drum patterns and sounds which creep in then back out a few times over the course of a song; minute details that appear, then disappear, one by one. Meanwhile, Haines cycles through a seemingly endless catalog of goofy electronic noises which suggest everything from 60's library music to old-school Warp Records to kids' toy samplers. ""Swage Nipple"" (supposedly, named after a piece of machinery used in the off-shore oil drilling industry) begins by matching a basic house formula (4/4 drum machines, four tones which switch between ascending and descending with each bar) with a crunchy, distorted rhythmic track. But before the listener can really put his finger on anything, the elements fall away one by one, leaving behind skeletons which drift around in the leftover sonic residue. The next few minutes are purely ambient, contrasting the eminently danceable opening tracks. There's some traditional keyboard noodling, a few bleeps and bloops, the sound of synthesized wind in the background. And then the a few of the random blips begin to accumulate, to lump together, to form the beat that kicks off ""Ball and Swing."" A head-nodding, glitch-laden click-hop song that would've fit just right on last year's Electric Ladyland comp, ""Ball and Swing"" practically cries out for some twisted MC's input, before giving up the search and heading in yet another direction. Haines revisits this idea later in a song called ""Eye of the Impeller,"" which opens with a loop of garbled rhymes, only to get pelted by a rainstorm of MIDI-samples and clicky percussion. You've probably heard most of the sounds here before. Haines has a propensity toward goofy Perrey-Kingsley style stuff-- pure electronics. As such, you'll find no garbled field recordings or electro-acoustic dallying here-- this is all right from Haines' hard drive. And yet, despite recent trends toward the inclusion of acoustic instruments in beat-driven stuff, Pump is by no means a step back. Unlike so many artists working with a mouse and monitor today, Haines' music is identifiably his own. The Rip-Off Artist has a decidedly unique take on traditional electronic music, one that is danceable, yet equally engaging to the mind. It's the sort of thing that'll play just as well on the dance floor as it will in any of those distant, isolated places where all these weird sounds come from in the first place.","The liner notes of Pump discuss the ""gut-wrenching loneliness and frustration"" that comes from being stuck in the middle of ...

First there was the cheesy popcraft of Julian, then came the cutesy annoyance that was Sean, and now, out of nowhere, comes a third Lennon brat convinced he possesses some shred of his father's musical talent. But no, this is not an as-yet-unheard-from member of the Lennon brood: Don Lennon is a longtime Beantown scenester with not a trace of Liverpudlian blood in him, but who still seems to have inherited much of John's sardonic wit. Though his songs can be scathing, Don Lennon's gift is in the ambiguity, subtlety, and irony with which he handles his subjects. And the subjects covered on Downtown include Lenny Kravitz, Kramer, John Cale, the Boston music scene, gay nightlife, and Dave Matthews-- who enthralls Lennon enough to devote two songs to the ice cream-hawking huckster. On opener ""Really Dave Matthews,"" Lennon sings about gaining acceptance by pretending to be a Matthews fan, and it's both funny and a little sad. On ""Matthews Comes Alive,"" Lennon assumes the role of Dave himself, recounting the band's rise to stardom, from the first nervous gig to playing at the ""Earth Day festival"" to a level of ubiquity where songs start appearing at ""cookouts on Cape Cod"" and at ""Chili's Bar and Grill."" It's scathing without being heavy-handed. After all, the best put-downs are those the person you're putting down only half gets. ""Lenny Kravitz and Lisbon"" warns of oversized Lenny concert posters threatening the city, and in a roundabout way, satirizes the false love touring artists show the places they visit. ""Gay Fun"" is the kind of song that, in lesser hands, might be considered offensive or simply trite, but it's good-natured fun for Lennon. The ballads ""Mekons Come to Town"" and ""The Night Kramer Met Anne"" cheekily spin yarns of indie rock icons with overwrought arrangements and the aching sincerity in Lennon's voice. Musically, Downtown sounds a little like Belle & Sebastian fronted by Bruce McCulloch from ""Kids in the Hall."" The arrangements are jazzy, light, breezy-- some have a West Coast country rock vibe, while others have a certain baroque touch. Strings, horns, keyboards, and sax (courtesy of Morphine's Dane Colley) make the album varied without sounding forcibly eclectic or random. But the main ingredient holding everything together is Lennon's detached delivery and wide-eyed romanticism-- a formula highly reminiscent of fellow Bostonian Jonathan Richman. ""John Cale"" ends the album on beautiful note, with soaring strings and Lennon's most accomplished vocal moment. Richman's influence is heavily apparent as Lennon sings lyrics like, ""Fucked up on heroin and speed-- in the back of someone's car-- saying all these nasty things about Lou Reed,"" and still somehow make it sound like the theme to a children's television show. It's in this way-- through ambiguity and by not laying all his cards on the table all at once-- that Lennon manages to take a bundle of humorous observations about pop culture figures and raise it above a simple collection of cheap laughs. As long as he doesn't get sued and cave in to cynicism, Don should be the musical Lennon to watch-- even if he never gets to date a member of Cibo Matto.","I know what you're thinking.

Meteosound,Various Artists,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7d913d19756521394f9/1:1/w_160/2886f451.gif,2002-04-15 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1977-meteosound/,Select Cuts,"The great god Dub is a mighty and vengeful god. Even if you have served him devoutly, his celestial countenance can so swiftly and capriciously turn on you. It takes sustained and meaningful sacrifice to keep you in Dub's favor. Look at Lee ""Scratch"" Perry, once one of Dub's most devoted acolytes, now reduced to a whibbling mangle of his former self. In order for Mad Professor to sustain his devotions and to avert Dub's punishing neglect, Tracey Thorn's body had to be separated from her head-- the resulting track, ""No Protection,"" is unquestionably superb, but poor Tracey's never quite been the same since. Some artists just aren't willing to do what it takes to fulfill their duties. Look at XTC, whose dub project, Explode Together, was nothing more than a clanking jumble of sound. The once fearsome Groove Corporation, the former motor behind Billy Ray Martin's Electribe 101 project, now fumble about remixing Ennio Morricone and Ella Fitzgerald's version of ""Sunshine of Your Love"" for feckless triphop twats. How long before such dolts attempt a dub of Frank Sinatra's ""Mrs. Robinson""? Dub will smite them sore in their minuscule loins for sending The Chairman's ""doobie-doos"" into the chambers of Dub's duplicitous handmaiden, Echo! Now, Dub doesn't shrink from allowing his worshippers to indulge in a little bit of fusion. Moritz von Oswald has formulated his own very sacrosanct liturgy by combining dub with Detroit-Berlin techno which has resulted in the consistently astounding Rhythm and Sound and Burial Mix set-ups. But it's in Jamaica where the ruffest fusion takes place. Anyone who's partaken of the Now Thing service can attest to the orgiastic writhing that Dub, in his dancehall avatar, can inspire. The contributors to Meteosound, however, align themselves more with von Oswald than to Sly and Lenky. Select Cuts has previously issued the two volumes of remixes of the Blood and Fire reissue label, allowing Leftfield, Don Letts, and the Orb to have their wicked way with original vintage dub cuts such as Glen Brown and King Tubby's ""Lambsbread Dub,"" Scientist's ""Step It Up,"" and Keith Hudson's ""I'm Alright."" Select Cuts have joined with Daniel Meteo, the organizer of the Meteosound dub nights at Berlin's Maria Am Ostbahnhof club to produce a concise overview of the current state of European dubbery. Vienna's Sugar B lays down the first slab of righteousness with an edit of his ""Authentic Dub Disco,"" with which he stokes smoky flames of herbal wisdom from a single horn sample of ancient provenance. Tikiman follows on with the appropriately vital ""The Sound"" which rides a steppa rhythm with a direct connection to the Orb's skanky ""Blue Room."" After such historically informed takes on the style, it's up to a slew of laptoppers to show how to worship Dub in a glitch style. ""Tetris"" Tom Thiel, a member of Orb-affiliates Sun Electric, takes a bunch of Rechenzentrum soundfiles and scuffs them up into a sickeningly coherent megamix. Thiel then joins with Meteo under the Bus alias for ""Treasure Island,"" in which a dirty bass line and lazy marimba force dancehall queens to mix with chill-out beach bums. Not content with forcing two antithetical groups to mingle, Bus then remix Dntel's glitch-addled ""Fear of Corners"" and thereby make it compulsory for all hipsters to imagine themselves in Gorgon dreadlocks and jamming in a Niyabinghi drum session. The presence of Thomas Fehlmann (Dr. Alex Patterson's studio partner) confirms the Orb importance as the most visible torch bearer for Dub during the wilderness years of the early 1990's. With ""Seerosengiessen"" Fehlmann does not disgrace either himself or the good doctor. In fact, the drifting bliss of ""Seerosengiessen"" might finally encourage Alex to sever all ties with the tiresome Goa-trance cobblers of System 7. While frequent Dub-botherers Manasseh and the Equalizer reach deep back into the fountain of vintage dub for their conga-and-wood-block-driven ""King of the Land,"" the A/B vs. Mina contribution, ""A to Dub"" resumes the indie rock dub action as A/B unearth previously hidden science by combining Mina's math rock with an update of King Jammy's Casiotone digital style. Fehlmann returns with quirk-pop starlette Barbara Morgenstern for ""Shazzi Riddem,"" a surprisingly splendid combination of the Chemical Brothers-in-dub and ""Superstition""-era Stevie Wonder. Meteosound closes with Jah Meek and Rootsman's ""Beautiful World,"" a confident homage to the prophetic heart of dub. With all of the power of one of Sizzla's sermons Jah Meek and Rootsman make a simple statement about the beauty that surrounds us all, movingly and gorgeously. No contributor to Meteosound need fear the wrath of the almighty Dub. In fact, I'd wager that the god will fill each of these artists' crocus bags with the finest Lambsbread for outlining how diverse and faithful Dub devotions can be and how, even in the anti-Caribbean of Berlin, you can fulfill your sata duties with one-love and obeah.","The great god Dub is a mighty and vengeful god.

Simple Things,Zero 7,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab3c13d1975652139b8f/1:1/w_160/c0e7e6f4.jpg,2002-04-15 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8940-simple-things/,Palm Pictures,"Hey, you've heard that rumor about Air's Moon Safari, right? You know, that certain something that people are always whispering and giggling to each other about? I've even read a couple interviews with the well-coifed duo where they flat-out ask them about it. I think you see what I'm getting at here. Wink, wink... nudge, nudge? Cough, cough? That's right-- they're French. Oh yeah, and I've also heard that some people consider Moon Safari to be the ultimate album for, ahem, makin' with the love. Of course, Air can't be bothered with making music for such carnal matters anymore, preferring instead to make unsexy progtronica that only Trekkies could use in the bedroom. By submitting to silly notions of ""artistic growth"" (and by the way, those are ""Air quotes""), Air has left a serious void in the music world. When Moon Safari has been played out, what's an indie couple to put on the stereo after a romantic candlelit vegan dinner and a Wes Anderson DVD? Never fear, randy music lovers-- Zero 7 is here with an album-length homage to Air's notorious makeout soundtrack. I use the word 'homage', though I could just as easily use the phrase blatant freaking ripoff. It's all semantics. Zero 7 use the same instrumentation (organic drums, bass, guitar bed with lotsa Rhodes and synth), get the same production sound (front-and-center melodic smooooov bass), and explore the same saucy thematic territory. The only Air-ish gimmick Zero 7 doesn't trot out here is the vocoder, which, given that it's been used recently by everyone from Cher to the White Stripes, is probably a wise decision. But it's a beautiful spring day outside while I'm writing this, and my savage critical instincts have been blunted by sunshine and blooming trees, so I'll stick with 'homage.' I've never been one to fault imitation-as-flattery as long as it's done well, whether that's the Stones and Dylan Xeroxes of Nuggets to the Wilson/Beatles worship of Elephant 6. Zero 7 at least has the chops to be ar above-average Air cover band, from the ""Ce Matin La"" knockoff strings in the breakdown of ""Spinning"" to the familiarly spacey ""Give It Away"" and ""Out of Town."" What I can't excuse, however, is schmaltzy lite-R&B; crooning, which the two Brits behind Zero 7 seem to have an unfortunate weakness for. More than half of Simple Things features this nauseating dreck, from the quivery female-soul vocal clich√©s of Sia Furler (""Distractions"") and Sophie Barker (""In the Waiting Line"") to the Vandrossian male falsetto swings of Mozez (""This World"" and the title cut). Without fail, these collaborations bring to mind the KZZZ easy-listening radio stations that exist primarily for piping into waiting rooms of allergists and dentists around the country. The scary thing about these vocal tracks is how negligibly different their musical backing is from the infinitely more enjoyable instrumentals. And given the more-than-passing resemblance to Moon Safari's content, Zero 7 makes me wonder if Air was just a bad singer decision away from this kind of musical syrup. I'm tempted to begrudge Zero 7 for retroactively spoiling my appreciatior for Moon Safari. But then again, Air is already Revlon's house band, so the commercial potential of this kind of limp-tronica isn't too shocking a realization. Zero 7's cosmic instrumental journeys are no less marketable as hipster easy listening (""I feel like I should be driving in a hybrid car,"" my roommate commented during one listen). If you're the kind of forgiving soul that can get past Zero 7's dalliances with copyright infringement, and if you have a CD player that can skip over the vocal tracks, Simple Things is a decent soundtrack to get your freak on. Otherwise, go on and give the Air some air.","Hey, you've heard that rumor about Air's Moon Safari, right?\r\n\ You know, that certain something that ...

Albert Marcoeur,Albert Marcoeur,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3aeea9e61561daa7f9a/1:1/w_160/b510fae7.gif,2002-04-14 05:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5105-albert-marcoeur/,Freres,"Some people call him the French Zappa. He overcomes this comparisor by 1) not really sounding very much like Zappa (although he does tend to favor similar instrumentation), and 2) by remaining alive. By default, Marcoeur wins, right? Not if notoriety has any bearing or the decision, because most of his albums were very hard to come by until the percussionist/clarinet player/composer got his act in gear by setting up a website and reissuing his first record from 1974. As French avant-rockers with a flair for flutes go, Marcoeur has toiled in relative obscurity for quite a while, so I hardly blame you if you have no idea who I'm talking about. Born in 1947, Marcoeur studied clarinet as a child at a music and drama conservatory, later joining rock and R&B; bands while ir school (a lot like Zappa, come to think of it). He switched to drums in the mid-1960's with his band The Lake's Men, who were keen or making it big in Paris with the hip sound of soul (Marcoeur said they wanted to ""back black singers""). From 1970-73 Marcoeur and pals acted as resident studio musicians for Fr√©montel Studios, and had ample opportunity to work out their ambitions in between backing whatever pop stars who happened to be recording there. All of this seems pretty pedestrian until you actually hear what it was they were working on. Marcoeur's sound is a fusion of Zappa-esque jazz-rock (circa Hot Rats), Kurt Weill's common-man art song and strange, classically tinged art-rock. Apparently, the soul ambitions were left on the back burner. Marcouer's first album, from 1974, is the work of an already well-prepared artist. The arrangements are all ace (and unique-- featuring recorders, exotic percussion, with an emphasis on acoustic textures over electric ones), the playing airtight, while the songs all seem to have been written by an estranged circus freak. ""C'est Rate, C'est Rate"" begins with a loping, hard funk groove and harmonium doubling the acoustic guitar's spook-riff, as all the while Marcoeur explains who knows what in French. There are mini-clangs going off in the background (sounds like someone playing a few broker cowbells), and then it breaks away to an incredible chorus, a cross between some unplugged punk band and a carnival barker. It's quite surreal, as are many of the best moments on this album. ""Simone"" features Marcoeur's wheezy clarinet stylings, as well as a recorder line that is most similar to the sound of a coffee maker's burbles stuck on repeat. The downtrodden blues groove gives the song an all-important strangeness, and the coda, with a beautiful clarinet melody supported by bells and guitar, seems a bit random. Yet, ir the spirit of the album, it makes sense. Same goes for the acrobatic ""Tu tapes trop fort,"" with its circus beat and New Years' noisemaker sax figure, leading to a chorus of some guy hammering wood in a shack somewhere. It's at once totally goofy and at the same time the best thing Mark Mothersbaugh didn't write for Rushmore. The least interesting music happens when Marcoeur plays it straight, as on the smooth lounge-balladry of ""Que le Temps Est Long"" (nice Astrid Gilberto impression, except for that strange middle part with the shouting and trombones). The tune sticks out like a sore thumb on this record, especially as it's preceded by primal space jazz, then followed by a song that I can only describe as what happens wher musique concrete, can-can music and frantic free-rock mingle unabated. Marcoeur released two more albums in the 1970s (also regarded as classics by a small community of freaks) and continues to record and put out stuff today. Though Marcoeur remains ever obscure, I'll do my part by giving you the leg up on this album, and allow the circus freak in you to proceed with abandon.","Some people call him the French Zappa.

Loess,Loess,by: David M.

[Uh, Dave... didn't you get the memo? -Ed.] With a body of work as ubiquitous as Richard D. James', saying something sounds like Aphex Twin seems on par with a pop critic who compares everything he hears to the Beatles. It's not that the comparisons to James are irrelevant or untrue (good luck finding a bedroom composer who wasn't at least slightly influenced by him)-- it's just that the connection could be drawn without saying. And yet, there are those times when such a comparison deems itself necessary. Like the premiere album from Loess-- the second release from Nonresponse, a label which previously brought us Codec Scovill's Clinical Imperfections. In fact, Loess' members are two-thirds of Codec Scovill. And though the music they make under the two guises shares a similar dark beauty, the two groups are set apart by more than names. Loess aims for a fuller sound, adding bass and beats to the elemental backdrops of Clinical Imperfections. But while these more traditional elements make Loess more accessible than Codec Scovill, they don't necessarily make it better. The songs on Loess are plenty enjoyable, but they're nothing we haven't heard before. Which brings us back to good ol' Richard James. Loess' arrangements are built around old-school beats that unfold over long dramatic waves of synths, creeping between crescendo and decrescendo over long expanses of time, yet always in tune with the occasionally unpredictable beats. Of course, if you're going to rip off anyone, Aphex Twin is a good choice. There's nothing wrong with wearing your influences on your sleeve, so long as they're just that-- influences. Loess has plenty of moments that are distinctly their own, which promise of greater things to come. There's the prepared piano that weaves its way through ""Spring Street,"" for instance. It begins with just a heavy repetitive clunking, alongside incoming waves of synths and glitches, but it soon transforms into something reminiscent of a John Carpenter score-- the on-edge tinkering gives the track a nice creepy bent. Then there's the ten-minute ambient piece that appears out of the silence after the last track, which trades beats for a low rumbling-- barely audible, slowly shifting high-pitched tones and a chorus of sopranos looped and layered upon one another. Or the beats which loiter aimlessly through the dark, questioning murk of drawn-out chords of ""2nd Twelve."" Small crackles linger behind each beat, like the smell of sulfur that remains even after a match goes out. Indeed, the beats themselves are what save Loess from falling in with a seemingly endless line of imitators. No mere drum machines here, the sounds themselves are rather unique. They appear to be lo-fi recordings of simple everyday sounds, garbled, chopped up and painstakingly molded into patterns. It's this vaguely organic feel that keeps me from pointing out that songs like ""Pleuston"" and ""Maple Cill"" sound, at times, an awful lot like something off the first Selected Ambient Works comp. But artists have always learned by stealing. And there has always been a distinction between those who are mere copycats and those who build upon the work of others by developing a style all their own. Loess falls clearly into the latter category. There are enough moments on Loess' self-titled debut to distinguish them from their inspirations-- enough ingenuity in the building blocks of the songs to prove that these guys are hardly Xerox artists. Give them some time to evolve, keep an open ear, and give in to the subtle rhythms. You'll be hearing great things from them in the future.","Maybe there should be a rule that electronic music reviews shouldn't be allowed to use Aphex Twin as a ...

Streams of Whiskey,The Pogues,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0bcb1335d7bf16980b0/1:1/w_160/6a2fa0a8.jpg,2002-04-14 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6364-streams-of-whiskey/,Castle,"The Pogues are one of the great live acts of our time, but their concerts have been poorly documented on record. Streams of Whiskey is a re-release of a bootleg, Live on Rain Street, from a 1991 show in Switzerland. Typical for a bootleg, the sound is terrible and the performance is rough. The Pogues, who are planning an ""official"" live album from their reunion tour, are asking fans not to buy this: they weren't consulted on the release and aren't happy with the quality. If you're not already familiar with the classic 80s punk band, the Pogues are hard to define. Creating their sound on traditional Irish instruments, they rocked harder and played wilder shows with tin whistle and accordion than most of their guitar-trashing contemporaries. The band played tight and floor-pounding music, yet Shane MacGowan, the wrecked but strangely babyfaced singer, was an increasingly erratic performer. Rightly called one of the great modern Irish lyricists-- writing about the low and downtrodden with uncommon eloquence-- MacGowan would play concerts too plowed to sing his own words. He was notorious for wandering off-stage to care for his various addictions, and at a Chicago concert with the Popes last year, he even threw up on stage! A more melodramatic artist would turn this self-destruction into performance art, but for MacGowan it's just who he is: there's nothing romantic about it-- especially when the audience fights over his vomit-streaked towels, as they did at that Popes gig. Streams of Whiskey takes the subtleties and peculiar genius of the Pogues and smashes them into a big loud mess. The concert took place after Hell's Ditch, the last album MacGowan made with the band, and the fourteen songs cover all of their records together. They start with exciting performances of ""Streams of Whiskey,"" ""If I Should Fall from Grace with God,"" and a tight reading of ""Sally MacLennane."" It's also interesting to hear Philip Chevron take the vocals on his song ""Thousands Are Sailing"" (MacGowan sings it on the original)-- his singing is more earnest and heartfelt. MacGowan's own vocals get progressively worse throughout the show; he hacks out ""Dirty Old Town"" like phlegm from his lungs, and the otherwise terrific lyrics to ""The Sickbed of Cuchulainn"" just slur together. The poor quality of the album keeps even the best numbers from living up to the studio versions. Now that this is packaged as a real release instead of a bootleg, it comes off as a substandard product. The mix is incompetent, for starters: Terry Woods' vocals are cut off on ""Young Ted of the Hill,"" and on songs like ""The Sunny Side of the Street,"" MacGowan's singing and Spider Stacey's tin whistle come through loud and clear (with every bum note on display) while the rest of the band is stuck in a murk. To add insult to injury, MacGowan's name is even misspelled on the cover. This would deserve a worse rating, except that ultimately, it's too damn much fun. This was obviously a great concert and everyone is having a blast. And no matter how sloppy MacGowan gets, he's still a hell of a frontman. His stuporous singing and the farting horn sounds on ""Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah"" don't stop the song from rocking. From the title track through ""Fiesta,"" the band is unrelenting, and it sounds like you're listening from the second row, mashed in by hundreds of screaming fans. This may not be an essential album, but it's a great souvenir for the hardcore fans. Everyone else should wait for the real live album, just like the Pogues want you to.","The Pogues are one of the great live acts of our time, but their concerts have been poorly documented on ...

Wood/Water,The Promise Ring,by: Brent DiCrescenzo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a142ea9e61561daa4760/1:1/w_160/c5d70eb3.jpg,2002-04-14 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6492-woodwater/,Anti-,"Davey Von Bohlen had a spongy growth clipped from his brain around the time his band, the Promise Ring, issued a song called ""Make Me a Mixtape."" It's understandable that, in his condition, the about-30-years-old lisp-singer would re-evaluate his and the Promise Ring's place in the Grand Scheme. So it's odd, then, that his latest album, which jumps from the one-finger ""power"" pop of previous records to mellow bells-n-thistles studioscapes, feels more like failed market research than soul searching. Saves the Day and Dashboard Confessional's success must knot TPR's tight little vintage t-shirts in a bunch. The Promise Ring were way ahead of the curve with that stuff; on their first seven-inch, they sketched the emo template with a mechanical pencil rubbing of Sunny Day Real Estate. Then, over the course of a few gigs at Fireside Bowl, Von Bohlen whittled his songwriting down to the sound of two guitars and two hands clapping. The ba-ba-ba's of Pepsi-shilling sheep replaced the whines and cries of college guys lamenting unbearable distances (154 miles, typically) between upstate public universities and hometown honies. At first, emo purists-- and those kids really knew how to stand for something-- guffawed. But this scene criticism gave way to wholesale copping. Hey, this new minimal guitar pop was easier to play, and more favorable with girls. You could even sing it suckin' on a Dum-Dum. And this Dashboard Confessional tiger bop comes along looking like John Stamos' idea of Social Distortion repeating the embarrassment of TPR's 30 Degrees Everywhere? Calling this trend vanilla is an insult to good ice-cream and yogurt everywhere. Now into these bands' wake jumps the Promise Ring, arms extended for that golden ring. First thing you notice visually is the absence of the two chubby older guys. ""Make Me a Mixtape"" and ""Happiness Is All the Rage"" are hard to swallow coming from guys who should have at least 10G's in their 401Ks. Yes, it was back to Wisconsin for the bassist, and a steady diet of nothing for the guitarist, who now pulls his weight with the artwork and website. Dig the new press kit with the two young ringers. Excuse the cynicism, but this is business and we're talking about a band making their big shot at stardom. Before hearing a note of Wood/Water, knowing the band's history and future at stake, and noting the enlistment of Britpop producer Stephen Street, one'd expect this disc to buzz and bounce like the Rentals or Menswear. Which still doesn't sound very good on paper, but you can't expect Street to magically whip them into the Smiths or Blur. The humdrum result actually droops and drips as much as the boggy fauna in the artwork. Tracks one through three genre-jump like a band uncertain of which adult-indie trend to follow-- Coldplay or the Flaming Lips or, um, REM's Monster? ""Size of Your Life"" lifts and weakly leaks the guitar from ""What's the Frequency Kenneth?"" as digital distortion strains to conceal Von Bohlen's toilet-paper tube larynx. It's a test, not a song. ""Stop Playing Guitar"" spews nonsensical lyrics: ""If I had a dime for/ Every time I should stop playing guitar/ And put my nose in a book/ My head would be healthy/ My guitar would be dusty."" Finish that clich√©! Would you be rich? Could you barely buy some vended Wahoos? Accumulating dimes has nothing to do with head health. Granted, by putting his nose in a book, Von Bohlen would be protecting his delicate nasal cartiledge with pages, spine, and jacket. But unless his skull is a bank, this has nothing to do with dimes. ""Suffer Never"" follows, mimicking The Soft Bulletin's ""Race for the Prize."" It towers over the rest of the album, even if the Delgados, Mercury Rev, Lenola, Aspera, et al rip it off more convincingly. From this point on, the disc sleepwalks through acoustic hangover ditties. Davey yawns his vocals. The band experiments with keyboards and percussion from beyond the realm of emo. Thematically, the lyrics cover themes of apathy and out-growing. It's an album from a guy questioning whether he wants to make albums anymore-- the soundtrack to rubbing sleep from your eyes. So it slogs and slogs and slogs and slogs, until... oh my god, until ""Say Goodbye Good."" Undoubtedly this will be the song everyone talks about. It was crafted for such a response. The track saddles everything that is lamentable about the Promise Ring with everything that is lamentable in overwrought rock albums. A choir and strings swell from typical non-clever wordplay and it's-serious-because-it's-slow plodding. The target is obviously songs in the ilk of Spiritualized, Blur's ""Tender,"" Smog's ""Knock Knock,"" and the epitome, ""You Can't Always Get What You Want."" Indeed. Mario Caldato Jr. mixes in misplaced electro-phase effects and Quincy McCrary. What, don't know Quincy? He sang back-up for Lionel Richie and Jennifer Love Hewitt. Smooth soul wails from Q, like an elevator version of Clare Torry on ""The Great Gig in the Sky,"" launching the song into pure parody. For such a supposed introspective record, session singers with no connection to the music betray the band's intent. At this point, Von Bohlen is M.I.A., an admission that something must be done to compensate for the complete lack of melody in his voice. Simply one of the most laughable and misguided songs of all step-up-to-the-big-boys releases, ""Say Goodbye Good"" immolates all positive new directions from the band. TPR even fail to recognize the finality and place of such Epic Songs on Big Albums and tack on another meaningless solo guitar tune afterwards. From a commercial standpoint, Wood/Water misses the boat where another predictable pop album like Very Emergency could have hit big. Experimentation is admirable, but you can't put a Sizzler sirloin on a gold plate and call it a filet. What seems like an attempt to market records to a growing thirtysomething market-- guys who groove to Starsailor while Swiffering the hardwood-- sounds entirely miscast. The Promise Ring last sounded like themselves on Nothing Feels Good, and from here there's always idyllictronica.","Davey Von Bohlen had a spongy growth clipped from his brain around the time his\n\ band, the Promise Ring ...

Things are falling everywhere, as if the room I'm sitting in will break apart at any moment. How can these people play like this, without concern for their instruments or ears, and with so much drive? They are staining the walls of the studio with violent noise. It's off-putting to say the least. I can hear bells and lots of drums, and deep down, there's something electronic-- perhaps guitar feedback. And I can hear sine waves-- Yoshihide and Sachiko M are forever playing sine waves now. The waves' howling is terribly overwhelmed by the rest of this cacophony. It's a fucking hurricane! How can Yoshihide have planned for this to happen? Why would anyone want this much chaos and lack of restraint? Maybe they don't care anymore, or maybe it's the kind of thing that sounds better on paper than it does in reality. This sounds like hell, or at least what the journey to hell might sound like. And yet, this is oddly hypnotic at the same time. I can't imagine anyone sitting down in front of their stereo listening to this like they might listen to a normal song, but I don't want to remove my headphones, either. It's a huge rock tumbling down a mountain, and I want to see how it destroys anything in its path, and whether or not it will yet destroy itself. And that is truly what this is: destructive and excessive. I've heard how the musicians were instructed to bang and stomp, making new sounds before the old ones ever had a chance to disintegrate. Each sound is trampled over by its successor, just like twigs under a boulder. And the worst part is that when it finally hits bottom, nothing happens. The thing simply stops, unnaturally, without slowing down or being broken into smaller rocks. The rolling giant seems to have parked next to a swamp at the base of the mountain, as there are lots of watery sound effects (probably from Sachiko's and Tetuzi Akiyama's microphones), and a scummy residue from what sounds like large Asian cymbals. The atmosphere has quickly become static, and despite a loud gong crash, I still feel the humidity and stillness. For this part of the piece, I read how the players were instructed not to listen to each other. If this is true, then why do they remain so consistently in ""harmony""? There aren't any tonalities to speak of, but the nine members of the orchestra do sound as if they're working towards a common goal. And this is distinctly symphonic music: each part is essential, as Yoshihide has chosen the perfect arrangement to fulfill his murky impressions. But this is improvised music, so how could there be impressions at work, from the composer's point of view? And ultimately, how much credit should be given to Yoshihide at all? The second movement of his ""symphony"" is intimidating in its efficiency of movement and sound, but then again, it could all very well be one big accident. The above are my impressions of the first half of Otomo Yoshihide's improvised suite, Anode. As referenced, each movement contains specific instructions for the musicians as to what they are allowed to play, and even to whom they're allowed to listen. Conceptually, it's similar to John Zorn's game pieces, wherein the ""rules"" determine the outcome of the music as much as the actual sounds produced (at least in theory). The general strategy for the music is simple, though describing what actually happens from a listener's point of view can lead to any number of strange mental images and associations. Impressionism? Maybe, though probably only as impressions are immediate and sacrificed for the next. Yoshihide plays guitar, and presumably conducts. His background as a renegade turntablist, guitarist and all-purpose catalyst for free-improvised music in Japan is precedent enough for a record like Anode, though the sound should still surprise most people. His most recent solo albums opt for near-ambient, ultra-minimal sine wave pulses and glitches. And his small-group records with Filament (featuring Sachiko M) and I.S.O. venture even further into the sounds musicians can squeeze from computers and turntables without any actual source material to play. Before all this, he led the seminal outfit Ground Zero, a band that blasted through so many barriers you might have had a hard time convincing yourself rock music wasn't invented for the sole purpose of the avant-garde. But other than the companion piece, 1999's Cathode, very little of his work really sounds like the transparent impressionism of Anode. The second half of the suite is almost a mirror image of the first, as the third movement continues the static ambience of the second, and the final movement witnesses the reemergence of the full ensemble: percussion crashing, microphones squealing, sine waves howling, and a general tumbling sensation prevailing. My rating for this record is probably instable insofar as translating the ""depth"" of the piece (or remarkable lack thereof), and is based more on the obvious conceptual ambition at work. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of people hearing Anode wanted off within seconds-- but they'd be missing a very intense experience.","It sounds like an avalanche.

Disco Nouveau,Various Artists,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a790c0084474cd0c0c03/1:1/w_160/cc288789.gif,2002-04-10 05:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1897-disco-nouveau/,Ghostly,"In the spirit of full disclosure, I should first divulge that I know the owner of Ghostly International, the label that released this Disco Nouveau compilation. We went to college together, and would sometimes discuss Olympic art and EPCOT, two topics that please me greatly. And I should mention, he sent me this CD for free (plus a sticker!). But let it be known that the $5,000 bribe I requested was not sent. Dammit. In the spirit of further full disclosure, I should divulge that I know next to nothing about electronic music. No Mark Richard-San am I. I don't know techno from Tecmo. The expansive terminology and rapid genre proliferation frighten me and give me indigestion. And generally, IDM makes me feel, well... very un-I. Okay, so for the three or four people reading who still respect my opinion on this album, I think Disco Nouveau is a pretty neat compilation-- and with excellent packaging! I came to this conclusion by holding it up to my highly scientific three-question yes/no electronic music evaluation: 1. Does it make me feel cooler when I play it in my car? A. Yes. 2. Does it conjure up mental pictures of robots and/or people in sequined outfits dancing wildly in some kind of retro-futuristic club? A. Yes. 3. Does it make me feel sexy? A. Well, not really. But as Mr. Loaf once said, two out of three ain't bad. The disco nouveau sound, according to the extensive liner notes, was a late-70s-to-early-80s movement bridging the gap between the heyday of Studio 54 and the rise of rave culture. To me, it sounds like the electronic music equivalent of old-school rap-- poppy and accessible, with somewhat primitive beats over which a David Gahan or Simon LeBon vocal would not sound out of place. This compilation features fourteen international and presumably well known (even I've heard of some of 'em) artists composing original tributes to this glitzy era. What this means is no less than three tracks starting off with beats reminiscent of ""Billie Jean,"" a definite plus in my book. Given the movement's infiltration into a lot of early-80s pop music, I'm obliged to go for tracks that most recall my childhood MTV habit, like Adult's classic combo of synths and handclaps and monotone female vocals on ""Nite Life."" My inner child is further stroked by electro-kitsch act DMX Krew teaming up with vocalist Tracy for ""Make Me,"" a collaboration that lands somewhere between ABBA and Madonna's early NYC club days. Other tracks downplay vocals and are slightly more sonically complex, though never to the point of losing danceability. With its eerie background noises, funky guitar, and rubbery bassline, Mat-101's ""Haunted House"" could be the theme song for some blaxploitation/disco horror flick. Charles Manier's ""Change You"" employs live drums and percussion in either a polyrhythmic Afrobeat style, lending the track a propulsive edge over its compatriots. The downside of the compilation's theme is that all fourteen artists seem to be referencing the same inspirations-- primarily the light-up floor anthems of Giorgio Moroder. This makes for a somewhat homogenous affair, and by the end of the disc's 75 minutes, it becomes a challenge to figure out when one track ended and the next began. Furthermore, any form of disco doesn't exactly lend itself to emotional range, and Disco Nouveau is no exception. Even Solvent's ""My Radio,"" the lyrics of which mourn the death of a favorite 80s radio station, has all the reflective somberness of a Bee Gees concert. But I'm no dummy-- I realize this is largely a compilation for hip cocktail soirees and the Friday night drive to the club-- not for chin-stroking and reading Tolstoy. It's not blowing my mind or expanding my musical horizons much, but it is right up my alley as far as electronic music's concerned, especially considering I'm roughly fifteen years behind the curve. At the very least, it'll give my well-worn copy of Rio the occasional break.","In the spirit of full disclosure, I should first divulge that I know the owner of Ghostly International, the label ...

Ghost Plants,Thuja,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7a69d034d5c69bf3851/1:1/w_160/ec71a0bd.gif,2002-04-10 05:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8050-ghost-plants/,Emperor Jones,"Thuja are a quartet based out of San Francisco. They play improvisational music and mostly lay down live takes, no processing. Glenn Donaldson and Stephen Smith were former members of psychedelicists Mirza, sound collagist Loren Chasse has worked with Id Battery, and pianist Rob Reger provides the most distinctive element of the band's sound-- his piano lines add a slight sense of structure to the instrumental meanderings. Thuja don't write songs, per se. Rather, their albums flow together like field recordings of poltergeists romping through abandoned factories. It's intense, sometimes dissonant music, but often highly rewarding. The review of Thuja's The Deer Lay Down Their Bones was my first for Pitchfork, so it might be forgiven that I never quite said outright what I was getting at. I mentioned that one of the virtues of ambient and improv music is that you can pay different levels of attention to it. It's an ideal form of music to play while at work, because you can get too caught up in pop songs and their catchy choruses. But I neglected to illustrate the implications of Thuja's music, which sounds for all the world like springs busting out of clockfaces at times. Their structural unsteadiness was a secret pleasure for me during the nine-to-five, a way to fantasize the collapse of all the machines of industry. Ghost Plants is more of the same. Again, with the new album's title and the tree photo in the insert, they seem to make an appeal to nature. The cedar (genus: Thuja) can cause dermatitis to those who touch its sap, but refined tinctures can ease a variety of toxic reactions. Ghost plants, a more informal grouping, are defined by their benign nature, so it's interesting that the music here should be more dark than that of the band's debut. You're greeted with the death knell of a chandelier, almost, sounds of glass fracturing and being swept about. Enter a guitar chord, plucked over and over, monotonous, dull yet aggressive. A few piano notes whisper from some faded place, but it does little to temper the alien modem-garble patches of noise. Each of the tracks are untitled, but they cut between each other more obviously now. Track three begins abruptly with hand-drumming and chainlike rattling, shackles being shaken perhaps. It's the only overt rhythm on the entire album, but of course the funk quickly fades from the musique concr√®te to be replaced by thick keyboard hum and phantom synth oscillations. The stark, oppressive atmosphere moves towards a more quiet, fluid flow by track six. Reger taps out short Morse code messages on the piano, and slivers of heartfelt melody are wrangled out of the guitar. The piano cadences and reverbed clangs later on would feel dissonant if left on their own, but cycled together they create a whirlpool similar to G√ºnter M√ºller and L\xEA Quan Ninh's work on La Voyelle Liquide. The album shifts into a more appreciable silence, but could hardly be called peaceful. There's a moment when you realize the silt that's been sifting through the background is gradually becoming a giant cloud of distortion, shimmering prettily and yet hiding disturbing things inside like the best Ah Cama-Sotz tracks. And though there are signs of Harold Budd-style minimalist composition near the end, the faintest sample of a woman's voice singing wordlessly probably ends things best. Thuja's environmental allusions just don't hold truck; I'll opt for the other image in the title: Ghost Plants as phantom factories. If The Deer Lay Down Their Bones was the sound of those rusty iron cogs turning, these later tracks are the humming power sources that feed the wheels. Though I preferred the more consistent segues on the debut, it's amazing that this music is played by human beings. Fans of the Shalabi Effect and Einst√ºrzende Neubauten would do well to track this one down.","Thuja are a quartet based out of San Francisco.

Sometimes Good Weather Follows Bad People,Califone,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4dab1335d7bf1698a71/1:1/w_160/d4ea313d.jpg,2002-04-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1235-sometimes-good-weather-follows-bad-people/,Perishable,"Upon learning that Nancy Kerrigan's Olympic dreams had been dashed by the unforgiving crowbar of Jeff Gilooly, a famous rabbi posed the following question to God: ""If you, God, are so great, then why do bad things happen to good people? That is, if God is so good, why evil? Shant Nancy have been spared the rod?"" Although ordinarily fairly reflective and considerate, God, in this instance, wasn't much for patience or tact. ""Kushner,"" he replied, ""are you fucking daft?"" Only then did the rabbi realize his error-- Kerrigan, in fact, was not good. No, Kerrigan was a bitch-- God knew it, the rabbi knew it, hell, even Gilooly knew it. She got what was coming to her. Picking up on the rabbi's apparent dilemma, Califone hath chosen for its newest album title the converse of that age old conundrum. Yes, bad things happen to good people, but what about the demonic among us? What about the Hitlers, the Linda Tripps, the Big Poppa Lou Pearlmans? What about them? According to Califone, even minions like Tripp and Pearlman share in the bounty. This claim, however, obviously lacks substance. Because as much as good weather may follow bad people, it also clearly follows some really good people, as evidenced by the band's own career. The Chicago-based ambient neo-folk band Califone was formed way back in the late 90s by two musicians (Brian Deck and Tim Hurley) and two pasta dishes, Rutili and Massarella, and rose from the ashes of another respected Chicago blues-rock outfit, Red Red Meat. Subsequent to that band's breakup, the four remaining members pulled a Voltron and came back hard, but with a new and innovative musical approach: blending southwestern Americana, blues, and bleak, rugged folk with updated, atmospheric percussion and drum programming. The result was at once unique and compelling. Good Weather Follows Bad People is the condensed, environmentally friendly reissue of Califone's first two critically acclaimed EPs, with the addition of two unreleased bonus tracks. The first seven tracks are drawn from Califone's self-titled 1998 debut EP for the defunct indie label Flydaddy. Among the highlights are... well, all of them. Yes, each of these seven are damn near golden, including the damp, bass-heavy opener, ""On the Steeple with the Shakes,"" the punchy, rustic folk of ""Silvermine Pictures,"" and the lonely, emotive distance and sparseness of the guitar and piano riffing on ""Dime Fangs."" Tracks 8-12 are culled from the band's second EP, a 1999 Road Cone effort. The EP was less mood and composition-oriented than the debut, actually employing discernable songwriting elements like hummable choruses and bridges, as on ""St. Martha Let It Fold"" and the quasi-pop of ""Beneath the Yachtsman."" Still, though, the same innovative approach remained, solidified by Rutili's restrained and expressive vocal grit. Being as it is a re-release, the question for fanatics is whether the two bonus tracks are enough to warrant another purchase. The answer for fanatics is no, they're not. One of them is a retread of ""To Hush a Sick Transmission,"" already the least listenable track on the debut EP. The closer is ""When the Snakehandler Slips,"" a dark, aggressive, full-band tune featuring more tempo and fuzzy distortion in everything-- vocals, guitar, and bass. It's a decent track, but by no means indispensable. Newcomers, on the other hand, will find Good Weather to be a perfect starting point.","Upon learning that Nancy Kerrigan's Olympic dreams had been dashed by the unforgiving crowbar of Jeff Gilooly, a famous ...

Essex,Monorail,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3a613d197565213bd99/1:1/w_160/97e2d6cd.gif,2002-04-09 05:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5406-essex/,Ameriband,"Monorail! Monorail! Monorail! I just can't say this band's name without thinking of that classic musical number from ""The Simpsons,"" led by the late Phil Hartman's delightfully shady salesman Lyle Lanley. Naturally, in true Simpsons fashion, nothing regarding Springfield's short-lived foray into the world of efficient mass transportation goes well, and the town ends up with yet another big, useless folly to put next to the tire fire, the popsicle stick skyscraper and the escalator to nowhere. Thankfully, this Louisville, Kentucky quartet's debut album is pretty much the exact opposite of Springfield, USA's monorail-- not only is it well-structured, but it even delivers its hooks on time. Though in fact a rock album recorded for an indie label, Essex is not a wholly typical indie rock album. First of all, it opens with a sound collage of disembodied drum fills and voices recorded in varying states of lo-finess called ""Regularize."" While this in and of itself is not especially revolutionary, it's the fact that the band doesn't shy away from using similar tactics to spice up the batch of songs they've cooked up to fill the rest of the album that truly impresses. ""It's Hard to Keep Things Clean"" kicks off at the end of ""Regularize"" with pounding drums and chugging rhythms to support the slightly off-kilter melody. Though his phrasing gets better as the album wears on, it's already apparent here that vocalist Tom Cantrell has a strong set of pipes. But it's not really until the album's centerpiece, the spacy ""Valley of Green Lights,"" that his potential as a singer really becomes apparent. Over what could best be described as a clean shoegazer backing, his voice just soars, tackling lyrics about all manner of little mundanities that color small town life, from the guy on the ""rumbling crotch rocket Honda"" waiting for the light to change to the bowling league meeting every Thursday. The iridescent keyboards in the background fit appropriately with the title, effectively conjuring the artificial lights of the modern world. Elsewhere, ""Master Plan"" takes a fairly conventional song chassis with programmed beats and grafts live drum fills onto it, bringing Charles A. Bailey II's solid drumming into the forefront of the mix. Bailey also plays a rhythmic foil to the drum machine, battling its steady pulse with syncopated playing and intentionally moving out of synch with it at the song's conclusion. Meanwhile, on top of this, there's a pretty interesting song happening. Marc Linquist's synths squeal like mad and the simplicity of Cantrell's melody is subverted by the crazy dub going on behind it. It's remarkable that such a young band manages to pull off a song like this without derailing. Er, thank you. I'll be here all week. Perhaps the album's finest song, though, is ""Kentucky Morning,"" a slow-burning anthem laced with feedback-drenched guitars that pour into every crack of the song, but never overtake the vocals. In fact, considering how much sound there is packed into the song, it's amazing how clear the mix is-- importantly, the emphasis is on restraint and texture, not visceral response. This is followed by ""Hummingbird,"" with booming drums that would sound nice and cozy on a Flaming Lips record and floating electric piano lines that help propel the harmony. The song builds to tense, synth-soaked climaxes in each chorus, which highlights just how fluid the verse rhythm is. The band rounds out their sound with a few more straightforward rock songs, like ""Padre,"" ""Arcane,"" and the bounding closer ""With Your Eyes Closed."" ""Padre"" boasts a particularly catchy chorus and some sterling lead guitar work. Even these songs exhibit as certain flair for what Cantrell terms ""sonic parlor tricks,"" though, as found in the phased drums that open ""Padre,"" or the way John Poole's catchy bass hook bursts forward in the mix between lines in ""With Your Eyes Closed."" Monorail seem to constantly strive to give their songs an edge of experimentation when they could just as easily leave them for what they are and get by. It stands to reason that the occasional melodic wrinkle that pops up here should be fairly well ironed out by their next effort, which I'll be looking forward to. So now comes the part of this job that I like perhaps more than any other: the part where I recommend an utterly worthy record that might not have otherwise crossed your path. If we know what's good for us, mass transportation will be the wave of the future. Be the first one on your block to check out the monorail.","Monorail! Monorail! Monorail!

Kittenz and Thee Glitz,Felix Da Housecat,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd77abf31b7dc7155f5d/1:1/w_160/48af334a.jpg,2002-04-09 05:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3029-kittenz-and-thee-glitz/,Emperor Norton,"Felix Stallings, Jr. has been at the pinnacle of the second generation of Chicago house music since his wildpitch debut, By Dawn's Early Light. On that album, released under his alias Thee Maddkatt Courtship, and very much under the influence of his studio mentor, DJ Pierre, Felix took Pierre's multiply layered hypnotic grooves and added melancholic intimacy via his own soon-to-be-trademark heavily processed vocals and those of Harrison Crump, the Marvin Gaye of house music (right down to the unfortunate surname). Felix's follow-up to the swirling electro-soul of his debut was the avant-techno funk of Alone in the Dark which blurred the distinctions Felix had made between his soulful work under the Thee Maddkatt Courtship name and the brooding vengeful techno of his Aphrohead work. Common to both, though, is Felix's unique skill at creating serene surfaces that conceal tremendous undertows beneath. Despite receiving bouquets from critics and DJs alike, the public never took to these releases. Felix refused to compromise his vision or diminish the power of his music until 1999's I Know Electrikboy. With its fusion of Controversy-era Prince and Dare-period Human League, I Know Electrikboy laid out the blueprint for the current synth-pop/euroclash trend. With contributions from all his regulars, and with an especially sublime-sounding Harrison Crump, I Know Electrikboy is a remarkable play for both cash and kudos. The same cannot be said for Kittenz and Thee Glitz, Felix's Electrikboy sequel. With guests drawn from outside of his usual circle, the record quickly becomes Felix's New Power Generation-equivalent. And just as NPG releases were unmistakably Prince-derived yet also Prince-diluted, so Kittenz and Thee Glitz is Housecat watered down by trivia and outside egos. I Know Electrikboy revolved thematically around Felix's love of music, and naturally, Kittenz has a concept, too (though it may not be as distinctly international this time around): the price of fame and the lack of superstar privacy (Naomi Campbell's precedent-setting victory against The Daily Mirror came too late for Felix to adjust his stance). The Italian rip-off James Bond cover of the Emperor Norton issue of the album loses the power of the European City Rockers cover which blankly replicated the paparazzi-sniper-lensed layout of celebrity magazine Hello!. Felix and collaborator, Miss Kitten, are ""shot"" perusing what indictingly resembles a Cheesecake Factory menu, getting to luxury cars with bimbettes, shopping for designer items-- a vapid parade of every superstar's humdrum daily routine. Complimenting the artwork, the album is a humdrum collection, and hardly the stuff I expect from Felix. Nothing here comes to life like his previous mini-masterpieces ""My Life Muzik,"" ""Metropolis"" and ""Wet Wednesday."" The limp ""Harlot"" opens the disc, thereby introducing Melistar to the world. Melistar rides a fuzzed bassline similar to Thomas Heckmann's ""Amphetamine"" and blankly mimics Miss Kittin's vacant delivery. The rigid funk of ""Walk With Me"" follows, dipping into the same fountain as ""My Life Muzik"" without ever taking its shoes off. ""Pray for a Star"" is classic Harrison Crump, with an angelic, mournful voice tripping through minimal accompaniment. Felix has never failed to allow Crump all the space he needs within a song, and that rule applies here as it did nearly a decade ago. But it's such a pity that Felix grants Crump only two slots on the present album. Quite why he didn't reject Miss Kittin's contributions (""Voicemail,"" ""Madame Hollywood"" and ""Silver Screen - Shower Scene""), is uncertain, though it likely has something to do with a severe lapse of judgment. Miss Kittin obviously saved her more charming performances for her albums with the Hacker (First Album) and fellow Swede, Goldenboy (Or). Felix applies the same hands-off technique to ""Madame Hollywood"" as he did to ""Pray for a Star"" but Kittin's dull-as-dishwater celebrity fantasies and irritatingly neutral delivery pale in comparison to how Harrison Crump performs in an identical environment. It's the difference between true talent and a plastic knock-off. At least for ""Silver Screen - Shower Scene"" Felix breaks out a devastatingly massive club groove. The Godzilla bassline pounds hard enough it's actually easy to ignore Miss Kitten's twittering about nicotine and ""endless pleasures in limousines."" I read more intriguing fantasies in Dan Savage's ""Savage Love"" advice column on Thursdays. But Oprah Winfrey in a career-destroying scat gangbang scenario is tough competition, so maybe we'll give her a break on this one. For ""Control Freaq,"" Felix collaborates with Junior Sanchez to produce an all-stomping, all-tweaking but essentially dull Daft Punk sound-a-like. Melistar and Miss Kittin join together in blandness for the Level 42-does-jungle track ""What Does It Feel Like?"" At least Felix emulation of Visage's ""The Anvil"" during ""Happy Hour"" goes some way to redeem yet another one of Melistar's catalog of superstar room-service, chauffeur-driven things she must endure as such a major celebrity. The sad part is that none of this banging on about celebrity status has even the remotest whiff of parody or sarcasm about it. Can anyone imagine Felix and his crew writing screeds like V/VM's ""Hate You,"" whose proclamations actually change minds about our media-whore society? Well, regardless, however much of a disappointment the majority of Kittenz and Thee Glitz has come to me, I can't lose faith in Felix. Closing the album with ""Runaway Dreamer"" and Harrison Crump at his most charmingly dolorous, I know that whatever Felix does these days, he'll never lose my admiration for his previous truly stellar achievements. With any luck, Kittenz and Thee Glitz will bring him such fame and notoriety that the dire exhaustion of it all forces him into seclusion. There he could return to his true calling: creating poignant dance music without equal.","Felix Stallings, Jr. has been at the pinnacle of the second generation of Chicago house music since his wildpitch debut ...

Mr. Boy Dog,Cerberus Shoal,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a573b1335d7bf1698bd6/1:1/w_160/62205744.jpg,2002-04-09 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1382-mr-boy-dog/,Temporary Residence,"Assigning ratings is risky business, especially in a ten-point tier system. After I gave Cerberus Shoal's 1999 album Homb a 7.5, I worried whether it should have been scored lower. I liked their solemn approach to left-field post-rock, but would others find it too serious and self-important? Their follow-up, Crash My Moon Yacht, took a dip down in quality, from the over-exuberant Lion King Africana of ""Yes Sir, No Sir"" to the hippie-dance vibe of ""Asphodel."" The band seemed to grow in expressive talent but the choral theatrics just didn't fly, which retroactively cast further doubt on the rating I'd given Homb. Mr. Boy Dog has been tagged as a major comeback, and as their ""hardest"" album yet. Maybe those descriptions came from critics hard-of-hearing; as with most double-disc albums, it's more of a spotty affair. The key songs continue in the modus operandi of the six-member group, combining ethnic instrumentation with oddly tuned guitars and brass to create tumultuous works chock-full of bizarre surprises. But the tracks between these epics indulge an ass-annoying experimental trend. Mr. Boy Dog's twelve tracks total about seventy minutes, and though each set of six songs flows together in a loosely structured narrative, I can't help but think they would have fit better on one disc. The first record begins with fierce start/stop squalls that share some real estate with Zorn's Naked City. But the blurts quickly settle into ""Nataraja,"" a typical Cerberus piece featuring hand-drumming and slowly swooning horn lines that eventually lock into the kind of fluctuating arpeggios that (for better or worse) Philip Glass had already trademarked. It's far too single-minded and compromised to realize its full potential. Worse, ""Camel Bell"" follows, which begins promisingly with chiming glissandi but then busts into this absurd carnival arabesque, flinging itself headfirst into parody. The horns on this band's early albums added a nice depth to the bass/guitar/drums setup, but here there's a lot of pomp and too little circumstance. In case you had any doubts that there's a joke being played, ""Tongue Drongue"" begins with six minutes of belch-like vocals. It's not challenging, it's not the Shoal channeling the ghost of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan, and hopefully, it's nothing more than a field recording of someone croaking drunkenly. Maybe now I know what it's like to be on the business end of an April Fool's joke, but all the thumb pianos and funky drumming that follow in the next six minutes don't make up for the cringe-worthiness that precedes. Take heart, o reader, for the second record cures some of the injustices of the first. ""Unmarked Boxes"" contains many of the same instruments mentioned above, but weaves the guitar strands together in a carefully echoing chorus. This time the vocals comprise actual lyrics, which crest powerfully before fading into ""Telikos II,"" an instrumental elaboration. The two brief pieces that follow, each titled with a symbol unrepresentable here, are some of the most fascinating on the album, juxtaposing an organ and building-block jam with television samples and the sound of a running faucet. And the album ends with its one essential composition, ""An Egypt That Does Not Exist."" The group blends their voices, singing, ""I die daily/ I lay down,"" a mantra that repeats over and over as the flute mourns concordantly. Is there a contradiction? One minute, I'm accusing Cerberus Shoal of taking themselves too seriously, the next they're just screwing around. There are a few genuinely playful moments, as with the funky 70s bassline squonk on ""Stumblin' Block,"" but more often, the grooves on Mr. Boy Dog are a Barnum & Bailey procession gone bad. Improvisation taken to the most zany extremes of logic can so easily result in music that's focused on process and technique at the expense of being stimulating. It's the Cerberus Shoal collective as cult, obsessed with ritual without the sacrament to make it meaningful. Groups like the No-Neck Blues Band are doing similar, more intriguing things. What's mystifying is that Cerberus Shoal seem incredibly satisfied with their current position, as if this is the peak they've always wanted to reach. If so, then march on! Their music will always be unique, but I can only imagine those dedicated to the weirdest tangents of rock to follow. The average listener's question will be: ""What the hell are these guys on?!""","Assigning ratings is risky business, especially in a ten-point tier system.

Endrass's Vice Versa, however, is not a wholesale return to the time before glitch. That sound is in the album, yet Endrass has reformatted it. Vice Versa, unlike Mouse on Mars' Idiology or Posthuman's Uncertainty of the Monkey, revels not in contrast or juxtaposition, but rather in interchangeability. Elements don't jar; they become subjugated to Endrass' harmonic concept. Vice Versa is a very confident album. It's a brave musician who kicks off an album with a fourteen-minute track. Yet Endrass' bravery is far from hubris. He produced over thirty vinyl releases before he issued his debut long-player, Infam, in 2001. Unfortunately, Endrass limited his vinyl productions to about 300 copes per title, and consequently, the Markant name was known more by reputation than by experience. Endrass, answering only to himself, begins Vice Versa in a digital haze reminiscent of a cloud of well-meaning mosquitoes dancing about your ears. After nearly four minutes, the harmonic and melodic elements of the opening track, ""Spurwechsel,"" emerge. It's as though he's cleansing the listener in anticipation of the Markant concept of music. Fortunately, Endrass has the skills to match his boast. Vice Versa abounds in idiosyncratic and original melodic twists, dips, dives, and arches. Unlike Mouse on Mars who sometimes disguise their tunes in offbeat programming or Venusian ska-otica, Endrass doesn't parade prodigious programming abilities. Like Galerie Stratique or Isan, Endrass would rather expend energy on increasing the vocabulary of melody rather than gene-splicing sound. Initially, I bemoaned the lack of sonic innovation, but after many listens, I've become more fascinated with the sedate glass harmonica beauty of ""Natura Morte"" and the glacial drift of the title track. You might say that Geir Jensen (aka Biosphere) definitively mapped out this territory with 1997's Substrata, or that Thomas K√∂ner took ambience to its bleak extreme with 1998's Kaamos. And you could say that ""Deserto"" compares just as favorably to Amber-era Autechre, or that ""Laissez Faire"" sounds like Global Communications' mechanized excursions under the Reload moniker. And I couldn't even disagree with you. But I would retort that no one should visit a place just once. Endrass' terrain may be familiar, but his assessment of them is utterly his own.","Markant's lone ranger, Carsten Endrass, is through with glitch.

Advisory Committee,Mirah,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3535e6ef959693237ea/1:1/w_160/ee48a5da.jpg,2002-04-08 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5329-advisory-committee/,K,"It's pretty sorry what passes for intimacy in recorded music these days. Anything with an acoustic guitar, too-closely-miked vocals, and lyrics about relationships can garner acclaim as ""deeply personal,"" ""moving,"" and ""profound""-- even when it's about as intimate and deep as a fucking Hallmark card. Sorry, but a trite, unimaginative confession has nothing to do with intimacy. The most intimate depths of the human mind-- even the mind of an obnoxious midwestern singer/songwriter-- are inhabited by things far more interesting than three chords and a little reverb. The human mind is a place of imagination-- grandiose dreams, nagging fears, perplexing memories, and a batch of other insanely complicated thoughts and emotions. Expressing something so complex through music is not at all easy. Doing it in a way that's consistently interesting-- and without ever edging towards self-indulgent experimentation-- is a serious accomplishment. Phil Elvrum, the sonic genius behind the Microphones, has made a name for himself making records that are both personal and incredibly inventive. But while Elvrum's music focuses largely on his role in nature, Mirah's second Elvrum-produced album, Advisory Committee, is a more purely introspective affair. What sets Advisory Committee apart from these kinds of records is that, while it does address age-old album fodder like romance and heartbreak, it does so in a way that's both accessible and interesting. Many of the things said on Advisory Committee have been said before, but Mirah says them with a potent combination of sincerity, wit, and innocence. The centerpiece of Advisory Committee is ""Cold Cold Water,"" a piece of romantic fantasy that sounds every bit as dramatic and beautiful as the sentiments it expresses. ""Cold Cold Water,"" with its lonely, Morricone-influenced desert twang, its passionate, icy strings and its innovative, varied percussion, is nothing short of a masterpiece, fully deserving the in-depth treatment it received on the EP that bears its name. The spooky, windy echoes, and powerful, resonating xylophone of ""Special Death"" is another highlight, with a guitar and melody that vaguely evoke late-90s Radiohead. ""Make It Hot"" sports one of the most compelling arrangements on Advisory Committee, opening with just acoustic guitar and Mirah's lovely, girlish voice singing what could be the album's second-strongest melody, behind the unfuckwithable ""Cold Cold Water."" The next track, ""Mt. St. Helens,"" would feel right at home on a Microphones record, with plucked acoustic guitars, nature-centered lyrics, and Elvrum's trademark thundering percussion. Perhaps the only major complaint that can be levied against Advisory Committee is that, when Mirah attempts quasi-operatics, it comes across as borderline ridiculous. Still, this is a vast improvement, considering that 2000's You Think It's Like This But Really It's Like This was brutally cloying throughout. Advisory Committee rarely falls into that trap. Here, Mirah is rarely interested in sounding precious, and instead adapts a more mature vocal style whose confidence reflects more Bj√∂rk than Juliana Hatfield. Of course, ""maturity""-- like ""intimacy"" and ""introspection""-- is a word that far too often translates to ""suck."" In fact, all of these words have been used and abused to the point where they don't mean much of anything anymore. And that's what's so great about Advisory Committee-- when you strip down these adjectives to their purest meaning, they actually do a pretty damned good job of describing the music. Imagine that!","It's pretty sorry what passes for intimacy in recorded music these days. Anything\n\ with an acoustic guitar, too-closely-miked ...

The Quiet Storm,Ocelot,by: Cory Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b99c5e6ef959693229d9/1:1/w_160/de4d60e0.gif,2002-04-08 05:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5939-the-quiet-storm/,Moodswing,"I think the kids call it math-rock. I'm not hip on the current lingo, so I'm not positive, but I'm pretty sure that's what they call it. I do know that I have a friend named Eric, and a few years ago Eric said to me, ""Your rock and roll music has too many words."" It took me a long time to see what he meant, but had I heard Ocelot when he first muttered the immortal phrase, I would've gotten it right away. The man's no fool. Atlanta four-piece Ocelot's sophomore release, The Quiet Storm is a very aptly titled instrumental rock record. Robotic rhythms back layers of guitar which flutter between lush and discordant while basslines pummel your ears with their density. The album opens and closes with quiet ambient tracks (""Empathy and Projection"" and ""The Quiet Storm,"" respectively), but sandwiched in between, there's hardly a chance to breathe. The majority of the tracks alternate between tight rhythms and raucous, frenetic moments that can be described no way other than chaotic. ""Loss Prevention Officer"" is a prime example, its repetitive riffs giving way to feverish bouts of sheer intensity. ""Throwing Away a Perfectly Good White Boy,"" copping its title none-too-subtly from the John Cusack classic Better Off Dead, is much more subdued, showing Ocelot's ability to siphon emotions other than anger into their instruments. The layered guitar and bass are wonderfully arranged, and leave little room for distraction. And just when you think it's safe to get comfortable with the more relaxed mood of ""White Boy,"" they tear into the gravely vicious ""Is It a Drug, a Virus, or Religion?"" which changes so frequently that you're never quite sure where it's headed, or if it even gets there. Bryan Harris' smooth bass playing leads you through ""Things with Molecular Structure"" like a slow, peaceful jaunt through a smoke-filled bar at closing time, proving once and for all that the lead guitar doesn't always have to be the star of the show. The real monster lurking under the bed, though, is ""Tear You Down Build Me Up."" It opens with a single guitar riff that sounds like it could be the intro to a slow metal song-- but don't let that fool you. At exactly 33 seconds in, the floodgates come crashing open, and it's tough to figure out who in the band is kicking the most ass. The drums are a flurry of hi-hat and snare drum, the bass is a jumble of rapid-fire notes, and one guitar lays down a dense fog of noisy chords while another squeals over it all. It's a lot to take in, but the result is staggering. You have been warned. The other true standout track is ""A Principle or a Butterfly,"" which features drummer Mackenzie Cole pounding a mechanical beat that is hypnotically cyclical. In the end, all of the instruments fall away except the drums, which continue to pound. After a moment, a second drummer (!) kicks in, and the levels slowly increase until you're sure that either your speakers or your goddamned eardrums are going to burst-- and then everything stops suddenly, almost as if your stereo just gave up the fight. Christ, who needs vocals, anyway? In Ocelot's case, a singer would only get in the way and distract us all from the musicians and their true talents. The songs on The Quiet Storm take me back to a time when I first discovered indie rock with bands like Unwound and Car vs. Driver. And much like those bands, Ocelot's ability to display a wide range of emotion is a true testament to the shocking power of sound.","I think the kids call it math-rock.

Walking in the Sunlight,Arthurs,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a111c0084474cd0bfd16/1:1/w_160/3828bc98.gif,2002-04-08 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/304-walking-in-the-sunlight/,Dirigeable,"It's funny how so many social trends seem to have at least some root in the politics of elementary school. A scary notion, considering the rationale of any ne'er-to-do Kindergartner whose top priorities are dictated by ""The Pok√©mon Trading Card Guidebook."" Which brings us to the most obvious reflection of human fallibility: the desire to be popular. One should note that it's during the infancy of our formal education when we first become the unassuming targets of manipulative marketers who would have us believe that their product ensures our acceptance on the playground (and will, through some magic turn of events, make Daddy stop yelling at Mommy). Unfortunately, such misemployments of our na√Øvet√© work all too well, occasionally giving birth to a ""cult-fad"" or ""cultural phenomenon."" It goes without saying, though, that once a formula for success has been established, the wave of would-be imitators held back by their own unimaginative nature champion it as their own, flooding the market with unabashedly derivative commodities far more economically priced than their brand-name counterparts. It was strange how on the heels of Pok√©mon's success, the similarly themed ""Digimon"" made it to American airwaves. Such was the case with the ""Snorks,"" Hanna-Barbera's ill-conceived reaction to the wildly popular success of the Smurfs (albeit, with less communist rhetoric and subtext). Now, in the more utilitarian aspects of life, I fall into the pro-genericism camp. Being thrifty, I've found that an RC Cola is much less of a strain on your pocketbook than Coke, and just as refreshing. But I bring this up because, a few weeks ago, a good friend of mine who's had to endure my incessant praise of the Elephant 6 collective for years on end approached me with the Arthurs' debut album and tried to pass it off as the second coming Christ (i.e. the Beatles). I listened attentively to the record's first few moments, which boasted a chorus of decidedly off-key children singing, ""Please don't take my sunshine away,"" before my attention was diverted to the far more pressing issue of who would win in a hypothetical fight: Jeff Magnum or the tag-team of Will Cullen Hart and Bill Doss. It's unfortunate that the Arthurs and I got off on such a bad foot because, for what it's worth, they're not really a ""bad"" band. As with any semi-lucrative psychedelic pop album, Walking in the Sunlight has its fair share of sharp hooks, hummable melodies, and Liverpudlian meanderings. But these ingredients alone do not insure an intriguing alchemy. In fact, it's when these structural cornerstones are prized over good ol' fashioned experimentation (the very source of psychedelia) that one is faced with such middle-of-the-road""","It's funny how so many social trends seem to have at least some root in the\n\ politics of ...

Bar Torque,Elton Dean & Mark Hewins,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8d413d1975652139751/1:1/w_160/f74e7936.jpg,2002-04-07 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2223-bar-torque/,Moonjune,"How many of you are scared of free jazz? Come on, I know there must be more than a few. I was certainly intimidated reading about people like Pharaoh Sanders and Albert Ayler when I was growing up, just a young, na√Øve Beatle freak. The way the writers spoke of these men and their incendiary, transcendent music; the way it seemed I was expected to have done about 40 years of jazz preparation before I could really appreciate the music at hand-- it was all too much for me, until the day I actually discovered the music. The thing is, when I actually heard some of it (I believe my first exposure was via Coltrane's Ascension LP, which I'd borrowed from my school music library), I was shocked to find out how ""normal"" it was. That is, normal in the sense of not being the alien, restricted music I had mentally formulated from so much reading. Coltrane's band wasn't playing ""heads,"" that's for sure, but the sounds did seem to make sense, as if I was listening in on some kind of brainstorming session of geniuses. When I really let my guard down, I swear I heard conversations and hundreds of details passing from player to player-- in a way, it was still too much for a neophyte to comprehend, but in a good way. As it turns out, the free jazz on that record was actually some of the more chaotic (though certainly not unstructured) I've heard, and in fact, I've become so accustomed to the conversational and brainstorming nature of the music that sometimes I don't even register that it's happening. Case in point: Elton Dean and Mark Hewins' duo release, Bar Torque. The music contained on this disc (from a 1992 performance) can often seem like atmospheric mood music-- the kind you hear in the background of made-for-Cinemax flicks and the tenser moments of ""Law & Order."" Other times, the two Englishmen conjure up spooky, post-In a Silent Way impressionism, where moments later they'll venture into unabashedly new age textures. At no point does this record ever become the ""incendiary"" skronk-fest I thought I was reading about all those years ago. And yet, this is free jazz in the purest sense of the term: unrehearsed, unedited musical communication and invention. And there's nothing scary about that. Saxophonist Elton Dean (yes, Elton John really did steal his name from this guy) has been pushing the boundaries of improvisation in a rock setting for over thirty years, most notably with the Canterbury outfit, Soft Machine. He appeared on their first three albums, as well as working with like-minded musicians Hugh Hopper, Keith Tippett, Roswell Rudd and Tony Levin. He plays with a lyrical style not obviously akin to the hard, expressive styles of Sanders and Coltrane, but just as willing to explore any number of harmonic avenues. With over twenty albums as a leader, he's easily the more well known of the duo. Guitarist Mark Hewins has worked with many of the same people Dean has, though generally as a sideman or backing musician rather than a featured player. He filters his guitar through MIDI devices on this record to such an extent that it's sometimes hard to tell whether there's even a guitar in the mix. Occasionally, he pulls out his acoustic for more familiar sonorities, but for the most part, his role on Bar Torque seems that of lush harmonic pallet to Dean's soft, watercolor brushstroke. The title track is an epic (just under 25 minutes) display of extended impressionism. It begins with distant motives from Dean, echoing over the ominous, almost growling deal note from Hewins. What sounds like celesta notes reverberating even further back than Dean's figures initiates the movement of the piece. I won't lie: if you turned the volume down a bit and walked away, this might be mistaken for serious background music. Hewins adds a touch of Iberian-flavored acoustic, though I still have the feeling this is an enormous prelude to something, rather than a firm statement of the here and now. Several minutes into the track, Hewins opts for more traditional guitar figures, though his MIDI effects surround everything with a warm, almost choral ambience. Meanwhile, Dean is content to jump around the backdrop like a restless fly circling a dim lantern. It's actually quite a relaxing mix (especially when Hewins' guitar imitates church bells), if a tad on the passive side for anyone looking for kinetic interaction. ""Sylvan"" begins with some processed guitar feedback, and yet flighty saxophone motives. Dean will sometimes lapse into figures that sound very close to traditional melodies, and occasionally, Hewins will even provide chordal accompaniment to the point where you might think they're actually playing a ""song."" This, of course, is always short-lived, as the players opt out for sheer weightlessness, which often results in frustratingly indistinct soundscape. Sometimes, though, Dean and Hewins inject just enough dissonance to make their relatively small peaks and valleys seem larger. Taken as a whole, Bar Torque can be an impressive display of free jazz at its most fluid and familiar. However, despite the high level of musicianship in evidence, I could use more of that ""incendiary transcendence.""","How many of you are scared of free jazz?

Bright Yellow Moon,Nurse With Wound & Current 93,by: David M. Pecoraro,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c448c0084474cd0c3662/1:1/w_160/047d6c2a.gif,2002-04-07 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5868-bright-yellow-moon/,World Serpent,"You know, for a death-obsessed, doom-foretelling all-around creepy guy, David Tibet sure does have a lot of friends. Since the dawn of the whole British-Industrial-Experimental-Noise-Collage scene close to thirty years ago, Tibet has played with everyone from Death in June to 23 Skidoo to Psychic TV. Perhaps most notable, though, are his frequent collaborations with Steven Stapleton (aka Nurse With Wound), arguably one of the most important noise artists of the 20th century and-- without a doubt-- one of the most prolific. Throughout the years, Stapleton and Tibet have worked together countless times, yet it took a near death experience to bring them together for a double-billing. Built by Stapleton and Tibet around lyrics written by the latter while in a hospital, recovering from a near fatal bout with appendicitis (complete, it would seem, with hallucinations of angels of death), Bright Yellow Moon is the first official collaborative record between Nurse With Wound and Current 93. Given the two fine musicians at the helm, and given such a vivid experience to draw from, one would assume Bright Yellow Moon to be a shocking look at human mortality-- already a recurring theme in Tibet's work. The results, however, are decidedly hit or miss. There are a few great moments like this on Bright Yellow Moon. Unfortunately, they're all sandwiched between often thick slabs of Tibet's so-called ""apocalyptic folk"" and chunks of go-nowhere filler. ""Disintegrate Blur 36 Page 03"" is little more than aimless keyboard tones accompanied by cymbal crashes, kind of like the ones scattered throughout Homotopy to Marie, but without any of the creeping tension that made that record so stark and twisted. It drags on for nearly ten minutes, before it gives way to overly dramatized spoken word that ultimately goes nowhere. Tibet is accompanied by a computer-voice (which I can best describe as the British cousin of Conan O'Brian's Pimpbot 5000) repeating the mantra, ""Your time is mine."" I guess this is Tibet's (perhaps characteristically odd) way of trying to communicate the feelings of helplessness which came with the unexpected onset of a potentially fatal disease. On the next track, though, his music hits this mark with far greater accuracy than do his words. ""Mothering Sunday (Legion Legion)"" is an astonishing sound collage, glorious in its complexity. As a vocal sample from an old folk song and field recordings of a train are drowned out by a burst of noise (imagine a giant furnace spitting flames), the listener can imagine that this is what Tibet experienced as he lost consciousness in that hospital, only dimly aware of his life slipping from his hands. Simple, static tones resonate behind waves of sheer droning sound, each shifting in and out while, off in the distance, a saxophone squeals away madly. Or is it the horn of the train, the sound of its wheels still haunting your memory? Eventually, the chaos gives way to near silence. A few plaintive synth tones and an apathetic, arrhythmic clicking appear, tentatively padding the void, while occasional echoes-- garbled human voice, Berio-style tape manipulations, chopped up bits of distant radio-- cut through. Effected sounds resonate; loops appear and disappear. Sounds linger just loud enough so that you can hear them, but just quiet enough that you can't make them out. Over the course of twenty minutes or so, Tibet and Stapleton watch their world destroyed, and then rebuild it to the best of their ability. This is a piece that stands with the best of either artist's material-- merging the dramatic sensibilities of noise units like SPK and Throbbing Gristle with the musique concr√®te techniques perfected by artists like Cage and Xenakis. It's a lot like both groups' earlier works-- in fact, the hit-or-miss acoustic poeticism and the simplistic drum machines that have infected their most recent offerings is nowhere to be found. ""Mothering Sunday"" is followed by ""Nichts,"" a painfully boring acoustic piece. David strums his guitar, and sings/speaks aimlessly with an admittedly fragile voice about insistent cuckoos, silent children, drowsing poppies, sunny fields, walking like shadows, and lots of other uncharacteristically romantic schlock. ""I lose myself/ And dream of worlds/ That lie between/ Your fingers,"" he tells us at one point, in a stylistically dead British swagger. ""And hide behind/ Your eyes/ And dream of forests/ And forts of snow/ Where we may kneel/ And hold each other/ In our still young arms/ Till the moon goes out."" Though such aimless poeticism was no doubt a crucial part of Tibet's healing process, the decision to share it with his listeners is questionable, especially when one considers the hefty price tags on your average limited-edition World Serpent record ($34.99's the price tag on this one). Tibet occasionally tosses off a fine couplet while pondering the relevance of time or the futility of human existence. Unfortunately, these occasional insights about mortality only serve to remind the listener of his time being wasted when they're followed up by lines like, ""When the snake is dead, they put roses in their head/ When the roses die, they put diamonds in their eye."" ""Die, Flip, or Go to India"" is difficult in a different way. An instrumental bridge between a long folk number and the album's closing (and admittedly stunning) collage, it does little more than reprise the dullest parts of ""Disintegrate Blur."" It seems obvious that Stapleton and Tibet intend these aurally plain segments to contrast the chaos of the record's noisier portions. Sadly, they succeed at little more than boring people to sleep. At times, Bright Yellow Moon is quite stunning, but it drags on far longer than necessary, placing it firmly into the ""less-than-the-sum-of-its-parts"" category. Tibet and Stapleton are both fine musicians with excessively large back catalogs, much of which is far more consistent than this. All but the most fervent industrialists would do well to look elsewhere for their fix of either artist. Bright Yellow Moon, despite its moments, just isn't worth it-- especially given that whole human mortality thing.","You know, for a death-obsessed, doom-foretelling all-around creepy guy, David\n\ Tibet sure does have a lot of friends.

Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me Is Gone,The Walkmen,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a9c5b1335d7bf1699549/1:1/w_160/c20880e5.jpg,2002-04-07 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8571-everyone-who-pretended-to-like-me-is-gone/,StarTime,"The buzz on this record has been released upon us like a cloud of Prada-clad insects: the Walkmen have been on MTV all week, and the Village Voice has instructed me to consider them my ""favorite new band."" Formed two years ago with members of Jonathan Fire*eater and the Recoys, they already sound like they've been making the rounds for years and are eyeing some arena dates. In fact, they're thinking so big that they're already worried that Sony could sue them over their bandname. And I don't see anything wrong with that. It's actually refreshing to hear a new band that seems so confident. It's not that they sound commercial-- yet-- but that they remind us that ""pop"" stands for popular. From the start of Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me Is Gone, their first full-length, they aim high: the two minute warm-up of ""They're Winning"" comes throbbing from the ether like a machine revving to life; and on ""Warm Up"" that machine is taking bold strides-- the guitar attack, the brutish drums, and Hamilton Leithauser's showmanlike vocals rage in unison. Leithauser is being compared to other rock vocalists, and as one reference point, he sounds like Bono: he veers to the high end of his range and he's not afraid to make every note sound important. But more crucially, he's a true frontman. He's remarkably self-assured and you can hear his exertion, particularly on the potential single, ""We've Been Had."" The Walkmen record in their own studio, Marcata Recording, and they've nailed their sound: Everyone Who Pretended is a pleasure to listen to, a visceral recording with a large soundscape. The palette is also nicely limited: the atmospheric sweeps come from many sources but they have a consistent feel, and the most prominent sounds are the basic drums, bass and guitar that anchor each track. The Walkmen have one innovative texture: an upright piano that's recorded with a warbly, slightly distant sound, like small rocks knocking against each other in the sea. It sounds so neat that Paul Maroon can just idly twinkle out notes, like the plinks that dot ""Revenge Wears No Wristwatch."" Its texture even dominates the quiet ""Stop Talking"" and the creepy introduction to ""Roll Down the Line,"" and it carries the pretty, rolling melody of ""The Blizzard of '96."" The piano helps create their signature sound without becoming a distraction, and also, it's just nice to hear a band use stark arrangements-- for example, the album closer, ""I'm Never Bored,"" starts with just drums and vocals until Maroon and Leithauser layer in the piercing and grinding guitars. These guys play quietly and simply enough that when they pile on the sound, well... it's pretty damn magnificent. The songwriting on Everyone Who Pretended is solid, but it's the title track that really impresses. It harkens back to bands like U2 or the Cure-- not just in tone, but in magnitude: skyscraping guitar smears and then a striking riff, the texture taking flight, and Leithauser insinuating his vocals on top, never weighing down a song that's already soaring. The only complaint you could make is that it's too short-- that, in under four minutes, they play a song that sounds like it should go on for eight or nine, with big video screens looming behind and Leithauser doing something filthy to the mike stand. Remember when U2 was younger and hungrier, and Bono could sing about ""the desert sky"" so boldly that you could picture it? It's rare today to hear a rock band think that way. This is why the Walkmen deserve attention. There must be some way to make the kids rebellious and excited about the things of this earth, and when I hear a song as vast and propulsive as this one, it gives me hope.","The buzz on this record has been released upon us like a cloud of Prada-clad\n\ insects: the Walkmen have ...

Moment in the Sun EP,Clem Snide,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5f35e6ef95969320c09/1:1/w_160/d92a9990.jpg,2002-04-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1500-moment-in-the-sun-ep/,spinART,"Indie rock bands have a hard time reaching big audiences, but Clem Snide found an interesting way to break their new single: this past fall, ""Moment in the Sun"" became the new theme song for NBC's ""Ed,"" after the show lost the rights to the Foo Fighters' ""Next Year."" Eef Barzelay's nasal croon has replaced Dave Grohl's pretty boy vocals, and Clem Snide gets to put themselves in front of 9.4 million Americans every Wednesday night. ""Moment in the Sun"" was a left-field choice for the biggest television network in America, but there is some synergy between Clem Snide and the show: ""Ed,"" which is executive produced by David Letterman, is a comedy about life and love in a small town, with a romantic storyline and plenty of subplots about the wacky locals and their goofy schemes. Ed is ""quirky""-- in other words, non-threatening, mildly funny and dismissable. Detractors of Clem Snide accuse the band of the same flaws: Eef Barzelay's songs dare you not to take them too seriously, as they use clever wordplay (""Joan Jett of Arc""), picturesque settings (""Dairy Queen""), and most damning of all, pop culture references to drive that home. The listener has to pay closer attention to see how these lighter elements front serious statements. ""Moment in the Sun"" is a bright, euphoric song: from the easygoing guitar line that opens it, to the horn fanfare and big finish, it tries to make you feel good. And yet Barzelay's lyrics are sardonic, making fun of empty-headed do-gooders: ""I think that hunger, war and death are bringing everybody down,"" he sings, mocking the hippie types who don't understand why everything has to be so hard. Barzelay claims to have written it about that pop yodeler-turned-poetess, Jewel, but he turns it around yet again. As he imitates what he's making fun of, he sings with uncommon gusto. ""When it's my moment in the sun/ Oh, how beautiful I'll be,"" he belts with conviction, and you wonder if he isn't making fun of himself-- and if he is, why he's enjoying it so much. The EP includes two versions of the single: the album version, and a shorter, less effective radio edit that fades out before the big finish. The other reissued material is a remix of ""Your Favorite Music,"" from their album of the same name. Master Cylinder and the Fruit Key give the song a plusher synth background and some cheesy sax fills; it adds some bounce to the melody, though it doesn't surpass the simpler, gorgeous original. There are also three new tracks, all solo recordings by Barzelay: two with acoustic guitar, and one that adds keyboards and a drum machine. ""Now the Moment's Gone"" is unexpectedly vicious: he bears down on his guitar and turns the chorus into an unfettered sneer. Even the jokes-- ""Now the costume party's ended/ Will the ghost return your call?""-- make the song meaner instead of lighter. On ""I Believe Your Lies,"" he sings the line in the title but trails off to indicate how conditional the statement is; his voice conveys a guarded vulnerability. ""Do You Love Me"" may be one of his least enjoyable songs, but only because it's so honest: he whines through the verse, asking a girl if she loves him or hates him but implying that their relationship has just gone stale. These songs are more direct and raw than his earlier solo features. And as always, he wraps his sentiments in ambiguity and good lyrics. Clem Snide's appearance on ""Ed"" has yet to turn them into America's New Sweethearts. Though they've probably won new fans, many of the show's viewers have been turned off by the new song: the ""Ed"" fan sites are full of attacks, listing all of the animals you could strangle that would sound like Barzelay. Even Snide fans could admit that Barzelay's voice is not commonly beautiful, but the real problem may be that his vocals are challenging and complicated: they're definitely too interesting for a TV theme song. Clem Snide may seem idiosyncratic, but they know how to transcend that to create something meaningful-- and this slim EP, a memento of their first brief moment of nationwide fame, proves it as powerfully as any of their albums.","Indie rock bands have a hard time reaching big audiences, but Clem Snide found an interesting way to break their ...

A Wild Man Brandishing an Uprooted Tree,Geoff Soule,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4df5e6ef95969320983/1:1/w_160/f4e6ce12.gif,2002-04-04 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7371-a-wild-man-brandishing-an-uprooted-tree/,Supermegacorporation,"This little jewel of a CD is exactly the kind of release that's in danger of slipping through the cracks. Aren't you grateful to have us catchers in the rye here at Pitchfork rescuing innocent little artistic statements like these from the chasm of obscurity? Limited to 500 copies and lovingly packaged, A Wild Man Brandishing an Uprooted Tree is the minimally heralded and seemingly intentionally obscure solo outing from Geoff Soule, the drummer of Fuck (who should in no way be confused with the God of Fuck). And while, in the pantheon of solo albums from drummers, this one doesn't deliver the goods like, say, almost anything by Robert Wyatt, it beats Peter Criss hands down-- even in the arena of cheese-factor, as Wild Man comes packaged with a miniature book of haiku detailing, level by level, the classic video game ""Mr. Do,"" accompanied by full-color illustrations. This same kind of perplexing attention to detail (or rather, attention to perplexing details) carries over to the music, which was modestly recorded on a four-track at home. Wild Man is nothing that's going to single-handedly breathe renewed life into the beleaguered genre of lo-fi, but it easily trumps anything Fuck has released since 1997's Pardon My French. Cramming angular indie rock, harsh post-punk freakouts, and folky ramblings into a highly digestible 24\xBD minutes is no easy feat, but this record does it by striking a deal between tossed-off elegant ease and careful concision. Even the brief instrumental interludes don't come off as mere filler-- hell, they make up some of the album's best moments, and seem very purposefully selected to ease the transition between the wildly dissimilar styles presented by the ""proper"" songs. It's all carried off with a similar kind of fractured feeling of running-off-in-too-many-directions-at-once that characterizes Skip Spence's Oar-- a vision spelled out with the language of surrealism. ""Ghost,"" probably the mellowest track, leads off the album with an almost country vibe as Soule sings, ""My life is a ghost's life, standing at the window watching, waiting."" This is following by a jarring guitar workout fittingly titled ""Punk"" that has the treble cranked to 11, and sounds something like a lost track off Wire's Pink Flag. The weakest track is next, the very Seattle-circa-'92 sounding ""Kant,"" but fortunately, this is followed by a wonderful series of songs, beginning with ""Ur,"" which reminded me why I still love a lot of lo-fi, bedroom-recorded indie rock, no matter how much garbage is released under that mantle. Soule moans, ""You are one six billionth falling around the sun,"" while a bassline lurches, followed by a little bit of planned sloppiness on the guitar. No drums. Nice and simple, but effective. Next is the highly Sebadoh-ish ""Stay,"" dishing up lines like, ""Oh, your hair is pawful and my paw is so careful."" Again, the key is that the song doesn't outstay its welcome. Two pleasant enough, though not too outstanding, instrumental songs come up next, both sounding something like Wowee Zowee-era Pavement. ""Monkey"" has a slightly goofy guitar riff propelling it along, but then again, it's kind of an intentionally goofy song to begin with, so it works. ""Vegas"" ends the album on a note similar to the opener: observations like, ""Is my arm around your waist? Is my head clear to the dump?"" delivered in such a straightfaced manner as to elude to some kind of inner logic. It's these kinds of moments that present the album as a riddle to be solved. And the most surprising thing about the album as a whole is how long it holds out, revealing its secrets slowly, remaining puzzling enough to bear repeated listens. It arrives with all the outward trappings of a vanity item for hardcore Fuck fans, and with almost no fanfare-- but when given time to present its case, it ends up being quite a bit more. All this from the drummer (of all people) of a mid-level indie rock band whose catalog is hit-or-miss at best. Sometimes you get more than you expect.","This little jewel of a CD is exactly the kind of release that's in danger of\n\ slipping through ...

Plays That Good Old Rock and Roll,Neil Michael Hagerty,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c03913d197565213b9f5/1:1/w_160/61e559c6.jpg,2002-04-04 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3701-plays-that-good-old-rock-and-roll/,Drag City,"When I heard about the Royal Trux split-up last year, I figured it had to be a joke. Something about the Hagerty/Herrema combo seemed so right and inevitable; the idea that indie rock's Adam & Eve had gone their separate ways was something I just couldn't process. I figured Neil would use the press surrounding the split as a little free publicity for his debut album, and before you knew it the jig would be up and Royal Trux would be back on the rails. Well, if the break-up was a joke, it's a media prank of Kaufman-esque proportions, because here we are nine months later, with another Hagerty solo album and still not a peep out of Herrema. What's she up to? Neil himself says he has no idea, but he's stayed busy with songwriting and has gone back to collaborating. So, in a way, it's sad that Plays That Good Old Rock and Roll ends up the sound of Hagerty forming a rock band and getting on with his life. As such, we get a full-band effort featuring two drummers, a sax player, and a handful of strings, instead of the first album's lonely, home-recorded homage to classic rock. Plays That Good Old Rock and Roll has some new textural twists for Hagerty, but one thing hasn't changed: he's pulled the loaded six-string from his back and is soloing his ass off. Only a precious few tracks sneak by without him lurching into a feedback-drenched ode to axe-slingers past, and how you feel about that probably depends on whether or not you play guitar yourself. Quite honestly, the only way a track like ""The Storm Sons"" (with its pitiful ""only god can rescue me, only god can make a tree"" couplet repeated endlessly) could have lasting appeal is as an instructional tape. Hagerty's lines are distinctive and weird, with an intriguing internal logic. But with a few exceptions, I'm not somebody who can listen to balls-to-the-wall guitar soloing for minutes on end. Caveat emptor on the fretwork. Of the nine tracks on this brief record, four seem nothing more than noisy excuses for Hagerty's solos. What's frustrating is that the remainder are solid, and two are even great. ""Gratitude"" is a shuffling blues/rock number with a killer rhythm hook and minimal lyrics (basically ""thanks a lot"" said a few different ways) that manages to stay in your head despite its surface-level banality. The obligatory acid-fried guitar solo here works well because of its brevity. Also great is ""Oklahoma Township,"" with its 60s R&B; vocal feel and a clever integration of violin that reminds me of Alejandro Escovedo. The guitar solo on ""Oklahoma Township"" very nearly spirals out of control, but Hagerty reels it in and sings alongside it in parallel, nicely redeeming it. The violin makes another appearance on ""Some People Are Crazy,"" elevating what is essentially an excellent late-60s Stones ballad with Hagerty on acoustic and a disciplined vocal. And both ""It Could Happen Again"" and ""Rockslide,"" both of which sound like lost Woody Guthrie songs performed by a garage rock band, are instantly memorable. So that's two great songs, three pretty good ones, and four stinkers. Hagerty's always been a little erratic, but that's still not a good ratio. One excellent album could have been salvaged from the two he's released in the last year, probably, but in these post-Royal Trux days, we have to take what we can get or move on. I'm edging closer to the latter, myself.","When I heard about the Royal Trux split-up last year, I figured it had to be a joke. Something about ...

Soul Rush,Nicolai Dunger,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba36eb335119a49ec987/1:1/w_160/c0fc7773.jpg,2002-04-04 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2480-soul-rush/,Virgin,"This one's for you sensitive types. And I don't mean sensitive as in ""fey,"" where the singer's every emotion curls up into a little ball. Nicolai Dunger is a hunky Swede who's made many a crowd of Scandi-boppers melt into puddles, and his latest album, Soul Rush, is big-time, unabashed pop. It's the sound of the first week of spring, of kids flying kites and playing doctor. This is an album you can throw on at a barbecue when you're flipping bratwursts and drinking cheap beer, and the cutest girl or bulkiest Abercrombie & Finch model will walk up and say, ""Hey, when did Van Morrison put out a new record?"" Yes, he sounds like Van Morrison, though his voice is deeper and more guttural. He chews every word like an inch-thick steak, and he slurs the lines so much that he almost sounds intoxicated-- until you realize that every note is right where he wants it. The country-like opener, ""I'd Rather Die,"" starts clean and simple, giving you a chance to get used to the voice; the tune is pretty, and the acoustic guitar appropriates the signature hook of ""Stand by Your Man."" And then, at the chorus, something just lets go: the steel pedal and organ swell, Magnus Ostrom starts bashing the drums with the lightest heavy touch-- and Dunger's voice soars while simultaneously digging ruts in the ground. Dunger's earlier albums were more austere, and sometimes experimental; in the past he's even worked with folks like Robert Fripp. But it's not a slight to say that this album is easy on the ears, and his experience shows not through any sense of adventure but through good taste and craftsmanship. ""Dr. Zhivago's Train"" spins on a catchy guitar riff, trainlike drums and blasts of horns, underscored by weird electronic noodling-- all sweeping around a killer chorus, with the most convincing ""oooh-oooh-oooh"" to come from a blue-eyed soul singer in years. Bj√∂rn Yttling's arrangements are impeccable but organic, swelling out of nowhere but hitting with just enough power-- for example, the horn section on ""Ballad of a Relationship,"" offering fitting accompaniment for Dunger's ruminations. The piano and violin on ""Return of Love"" contribute to a song that's more kicky than blue-- imagine a drunk Randy Newman singing the theme from Toy Story-- yet even here, the chorus can't help but take off. Even when they verge on cheesy, like the second-string Lyle Lovett-styled horns of ""Something New,"" they're balanced by the severity of Dunger's throaty vocals. ""It makes me feel free,"" and, ""I want something she can't give me"" may not be Strindberg (or Morrison), but I defy you to make out enough of these lyrics to mind. In any case, Dunger has several nice turns, like ""Lick my soul,"" from the title song. The serious moments on the album-- his solo features like the title track and the fragment-like ""Nest""-- have genuine weight, and the last song, ""Pass the Chains,"" is a downer, with grim guitar and a creepy piano resonating quietly behind. Dunger's somber moments are brought in as if to remind us he's a heavy soul, no matter how pretty the album can be. But I'm not sold. The ballads are nice, yet they don't have the punch of the brighter moments; this is a record that can't stop to brood.","This one's for you sensitive types.

& Yet & Yet,Do Make Say Think,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9e3ea9e61561daa70cc/1:1/w_160/a1e56f20.jpg,2002-04-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2399-yet-yet/,Constellation,"Do Make Say Think make music to, for lack of a better word, decompress to-- instrumental music that has a canny sense of tension and release, and knows when to build and when to recede. Mostly, though, it's music that doesn't put any pressure on you like the rest of your day does. Coming home from a crap day of work or school or running errands or whatever it is you do, this is absolutely perfect music to put on and space out to. In certain ways, it fits Brian Eno's definition of ambient perfectly-- you can put it on let it color the mood of a room, or you can sit attentively and listen; the music doesn't care. In short, it's easy to relax to, and yet still maintains an air of intelligence. Despite having four action verbs in their name, Do Make Say Think never really seem to be in a hurry to get anywhere. Their music unfolds at a leisurely pace (those weaned exclusively on shorter-form music may even find it a bit boring), and often even fails to really arrive at a logically perceived destination, instead choosing to take a little side path that the musicians find more interesting. The result is a highly unpredictable album of constantly shifting textures that feels fresh even after several listens in a row. The Toronto five-piece actually opens the album with some of its most taut music, building ""Classic Noodlanding"" like a gathering storm for a full two minutes over fervently tapped cymbals. Then, at the two-minute mark, drummers James Payment and Dave Mitchell burst into a rock groove, setting the other instruments free. Guitars and horns mingle on the buoyant undercurrent, and by the song's end, the band sounds almost ebullient. ""End of Music"" benefits from a similar change in propulsion at its midpoint, moving from a slow, keyboard-dominated crawl to an open gallop, with guitars blazing in the foreground. The dual drums augment each other quite unselfishly and prove one of the band's best assets. ""White Light Of"" contains yet another amazing drum part, this time supporting bassist/trumpeter Charles Spearin and guest Brian Cram's deft horn arrangement and minimal melody. This finally breaks down into a wet scape of sparsely strummed, tremeloed guitars recalling Bark Psychosis' ""Scum"" or Talk Talk's ""Myrrhman."" Those guitars return for the album's finest track, the transcendent ""Reitschule."" Wandering guitar melodies criss-cross each other before the drums enter on an unexpected beat. Distorted guitars pile up on top of it all until a final, brief buildup, which opens into a dubby passage with a bassline Doug McCombs would be proud to call his own. The process is repeated, this time with horns providing counterpoint to the urgently strummed guitars. The breakdown after the second climax leaves the bass alone with a sparse, clean guitar for accompaniment before a yearning trumpet line enters. Instruments are slowly added, and the process again repeats, each time following a different permutation on a similar concept. The album's other three tracks offer further variations on the band's basic sound, from the muted tones and almost Hood-like pulse of ""Chinatown"" to guest Tamara Wlliamson's stirring wordless vocal contributions to the aptly titled ""Soul and Onward."" Closer ""Anything for Now"" features some beautifully interwoven guitar and organ over a downright breezy undercarriage, before flattening out into a warm drone. The album concludes with skittering dub guitars swelling over muted static-- the type of ambient texture that you can immerse yourself in fully. If you haven't achieved full decompression by that point, you must be incredibly high strung. & Yet & Yet proves to be Do Make Say Think's most fluid and satisfying album yet, masterfully conscripting the slow-burning dub of their 1998 self-titled debut to the service of the jazz-inflected textures of 2000's Goodbye Enemy Airship, the Landlord Is Dead. God only knows what the future holds for this band, but if their current direction is any indication, things are looking glaringly bright.","Do Make Say Think make music to, for lack of a better word, decompress to-- instrumental music that has a ...

Coat of Many Cupboards,XTC,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929aad8c0084474cd0c1280/1:1/w_160/d5aea034.gif,2002-04-03 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8834-coat-of-many-cupboards/,Virgin,"XTC are a frustrating band. Founding members (and at this point, the only ones left) guitarist Andy Partridge and bassist Colin Moulding are at once highly idiosyncratic, obsessively formal, brutally honest as songwriters, and yet suspiciously self-aware. When Partridge references, in ten separate interviews, the same ""exorcism of influences"" in regard to his fondness for the music of Brian Wilson and the Beatles, or Moulding spins his bandmate's decision to stop touring as the best thing to ever happen to their writing, their old record contract with Virgin isn't the only thing that seems fishy. Though XTC could rave it up, most fans will tell you that their strengths probably were closer to the studio than the dressing room. However, it might have been nice not to read about the ""quirky, cult heroes from Swindon"" for the last twenty years, but rather to see headlines proclaiming the great bringers of creativity and classic pop back to the Top 40. I can't even imagine what Andy and Colin would look like on the cover of Spin-- these guys deserved more than they ever got. From the press, the public, their label, and various managers, XTC have been a tragically under-appreciated band in every sense. End sermon. Coat of Many Cupboards celebrates two things: the first being the history of XTC, as told through their own viewpoints, and with an extensive essay by super fan (and fellow obsessive-- Chalkhills regulars, you know what I'm talking about) Harrison Sherwood. The second is to raise the joyous flag for XTC's final chapter involving Virgin Records. The band left this label in the late 90s, and started up their own mess. Partridge, especially, has been quite happy to expound on the plethora of injustices and molestation brought against him by the label (who, ironically, are probably in worse shape now than he is), and this set collects material recorded during the band's residence under their no-good wing. Sound bitter? Tell me about it. The four discs of this set are roughly divided into the periods of 1977-79, 1979-81, 1981-86 and 1987-1992. Now, many bands half XTC's age already have career retrospectives in box form, so this set shouldn't really be special in and of itself. What's odd, though, is that when Partridge and Moulding were plucked their choices for the set, they decided that, rather than compiling a selection of singles and choice album tracks, they'd fill the majority of the box with demo versions and live recordings of their songs. Bam! Now you see why this set is so necessary for the devoted XTC fan. In fact, this set is another in a growing line of collectible paraphernalia for dedicated fans (along with recently issued demo recordings of their proper studio records), as the uninitiated will most likely prefer the studio albums over a set of rare rarities and alternate takes. The first disc showcases the only era in the band's history when they might possibly have been confused for punks. Tunes like ""Science Friction,"" ""Traffic Light Rock"" and ""Radios in Motion"" are fast, a tad out of control (for XTC, anyway), and certainly not without their own charming irreverence. But even at this early stage, XTC were more DC Comics than CBGB's. And how many punk bands put Beach Boy sopranos in their songs like Partridge did in ""Radios""? These boys cast themselves much nearer the new-wave camp with the Farfisa spunk of the previously unreleased ""Fireball XL5/Fireball Dub"" and the buoyant ""Are You Receiving Me."" Of course, the best songs are the ones that sound like they're too hard for real punks to play at all, like the single version (featuring way more funky clavinet than an English band in the late 70s should have been able to get away with) of Partridge's wonderfully lucid ""This Is Pop"" or Moulding's sophisticated acoustic jaunt, ""Ten Feet Tall."" The second disc picks up the story wherein XTC were making the transition from attention deficient rowdies to something altogether brainy (and yet, still rocking hard enough to be mentioned in the same breath as the Jam). ""Life Begins at the Hop"" is a peppy piece of ska-pop (reportedly featuring Sting on ""lead handclaps""), and one of the last times XTC could claim to be addressing the ""boys and girls"" on record. The finest moments are during the room-clearing zeal of ""No Language in Our Lungs"" and the wonderfully quaint demo version of their minor 1982 hit ""Senses Working Overtime."" There's also an excellent, early live version of ""Snowman"" which is almost worth the price of admission, if only to show what kind of band they might have been had Partridge not suffered a crippling (and apparently permanent) bout of stage anxiety. The band sounds invincible, tearing through a song that sounded almost ambient at times on the English Settlement LP, yet never loses grasp of its whimsical atmosphere. Disc 3 begins with an unused single recording of the non-album track ""Punch and Judy."" ""Punchy"" is a good word to describe the rocky ping-pong groove of the tune, though it's clear that even by 1981, XTC were already more interested in working in the studio (check the nifty piano line, and subtle, panned guitar work) than onstage. ""Fly on the Wall"" is more processed pop strangeness (and as legend has it, a song which Virgin was planning as a single, only to listen with devastation at the rather impenetrable thing which XTC had produced), and the live ""Yacht Dance"" is a pretty convincing argument for the band not touring-- its refined arrangement, and emphasis on acoustic rather than electric textures wasn't the kind of thing that could ever rile up the concert crowds. Of course, the band would venture further into progressive pop craft and studio experimentation than most people ever might have predicted in 1978. 1983's gorgeous ""Ladybird"" and ""Love on a Farmboy's Wages"" sparkled with such delicacy and fine craftsmanship that you'd have a hard time besting it outside of classic Beatles or Kinks. A modest demo version of their biggest American hit, the controversial ""Dear God,"" points toward their increasingly baroque tendencies, while at the same time showing that, despite the fact they'd given up the music biz game, XTC were hardly becoming complacent. The final disc captures the band at its most overtly Beatlesque (with a fair amount of Beach Boys and Burt Bacharach as well), and even features a couple of gems by their psychedelic alter egos the Dukes of Stratosphear. However, fans will probably want to check previously unreleased tunes like ""Terrorism"" (an aggressive, mildly Middle Eastern rocker), ""Find the Fox"" (a mild-mannered, loping acoustic song that wouldn't have sounded out of place on Skylarking) and ""The Troubles"" (a South African-styled, straight pop number). XTC will reportedly release several more discs of previously unreleased songs and demos over the next few years (with the project moniker of Fuzzy Warbles), but for now, these will do nicely. The disc also features an interesting home demo of ""The Mayor of Simpleton"" that's very stripped down, and with largely different music altogether from the Oranges & Lemons version. XTC's final entry for the set is a modest live version of ""Books Are Burning,"" which closes things on a solemn yet hopeful note, just as it did on 1992's Nonsuch. Of course, things have turned out okay for XTC. After leaving Virgin, they released the acclaimed (and very nice, if I may say so) Apple Venus, and followed it with the more straightforward Wasp Star. If this box set demonstrates anything, it's that there really has been a clear journey imbedded in their music. Just as Partridge is fond of detailing the cycle of life in many of his songs, so too can you hear the growing pains and heady mixture of angst, joy and awkwardness of change in XTC's music at various moments. You know, they were (and are) a pretty fucking cool band, so far be it from me to dock them for staying home on weekends.","XTC are a frustrating band.

On Hashish,Sam Shalabi,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3b9c0084474cd0c0328/1:1/w_160/71235e87.gif,2002-04-03 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7093-on-hashish/,Alien8,"A quick glance at this album cover might make the long-time Pitchfork reader yearn for the skewed-but-effective prose of Mr. James Wisdom, but the title does not, in fact, refer to the mindset of its construction. As detailed on the inside cover of the album, On Hashish is an homage to German cultural theorist Walter Benjamin, who worked on a book bearing the same title, which remained unfinished at the time of his death in 1940. Shalabi's On Hashish would probably make lousy drug music for anyone but the most daring, anyway, because this album is packed with dense, unsettling passages of sound likely to trigger a bad freakout in even the most seasoned psychedelic traveler. It's been creeping me out, even though I've been sober as a judge every time I've heard it. Shalabi's method for this record was to record instrumental passages by some of his favorite Montreal musicians (including bassist Alexandre St. Onge from the Shalabi Effect, and Thierry Amar and Norslola Johnson from Godspeed You Black Emperor!) and then completely rearrange the recordings into an abstract soundfield that owes something to musique concr√®te. As would be expected given the circumstances surrounding its creation, On Hashish is a more difficult listen than the more band-oriented affairs of the Shalabi Effect, and winds up being closer in spirit to last year's satisfying collaboration Kristian, Shalabi, St. Onge. The centerpiece of On Hashish is the 26-minute opener ""Outside Chance (Dreamfangs)."" Whether or not the title was meant as a pun, it seems plausible that chance indeed played a role in the track's composition. The beginning section consists of cymbal splashes that sound like a glass endlessly shattering in extreme slow motion, random piano tinkles, some distant vocalizations, and periodic bows from the double-bass of St. Onge. A couple minutes of indeterminate percussion form a bridge to the next section, a thick cluster of flute tones organized to sound like otherworldly sobs. Stabs of noise, probably emanating from instruments being manipulated in non-traditional ways, punctuate this moving passage. From there, the piece incorporates assorted field recordings and coasts out on a deep, rumbling drone and some analog glitches. An air of ceremony pervades the effective ""Outside Chance (Dreamfangs),"" giving it the quality of mourning music from another dimension. ""Soot"" begins with a collective free-jazzy blast of reeds and horns, and then modulates into a disturbing bit of drone music anchored around a constantly wavering and badly distorted sine wave tone. The electronics continue to do battle with the swirl of the horns as other noises fold in, lending a Cageian air of chaos. An abrupt cut leads to ""The Wherewithal,"" a nearly eight-minute piece cooped mostly of hiss, chirps, static and subsonic rumbles, which manages to be comforting despite its noisy surface, almost like a sleep-inducing wall of pink noise. While passages of ""Outside Chance (Dreamfangs)"" are undeniably powerful, ""The Wherewithal"" has a truly odd tranquility, and ""Soot"" is impressively abrasive, something keeps me from labeling On Hashish as a great album. Part of my problem is that it's difficult to imagine the mood that would compel me to pull the record from the shelf-- but there's something else missing. These long, abstract pieces are definitely meant to be heard in a single sitting, but the album as a whole never quite congeals. The pacing seems slightly off, with some stretches that degenerate into tedium, and, ""Soot"" aside, there isn't a lot of dynamic range. Still, there are more than enough riveting passages here to demand attention from Shalabi admirers, and one has to marvel at the consistently high level of the man's prolific output.","A quick glance at this album cover might make the long-time Pitchfork reader\n\ yearn for the skewed-but-effective prose of ...

Read Music - Speak Spanish,Desaparecidos,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b96dc0084474cd0c25e6/1:1/w_160/87a10820.jpg,2002-04-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2288-read-music-speak-spanish/,Saddle Creek,"From: halighhaligh@hotmail.com
Subject: You sucking. My friends and I have a long-running bet about where Pitchfork gets its writers from. St. Maria's School for the Grumpy Deaf? A work-release program for recovering gasoline-huffing addicts? The annual meeting of the Bitter, Failed Musicians Organization? But not until Rob Mitchum's horrid review of the Desaparecidos' Read Music - Speak Spanish have I felt compelled to write. Never I have a read such a wrongheaded, closed-minded, biased, bumblefuck, all-around wrong review. Shame on you, Mr. Mitchum. Shame on you, Pitchfork. For starters, what the hell was that lead? I can't for the life of me figure out what the grandmother from ""Who's the Boss?,"" the chemical properties of sodium, and the writer's Little League memories have to do with the Desaparecidos. And that joke about a nun, a box of banana bread mix, and Conor Oberst? Completely tasteless and irrelevant. At least once he finally started talking about the music, he got the basic facts right (must've spent a few minutes on the Saddle Creek website). Desaparecidos is, in fact, Oberst taking a break from Bright Eyes by putting together a full band and ""cranking up the rock knob,"" as Mitchum so poetically puts it. However, your assertion that Oberst has simply exchanged ripping off Jeff Mangum for ripping off Gene Simmons is completely unfounded and unfair. In fact, the entire review is permeated with an obvious distaste for the work of Oberst, despite Mitchum's elitist claim that he ""kind of likes Fevers and Mirrors in an inner teenager sort of way."" Backhanded compliments like ""the distortion-heavy setting at least makes Oberst's emotional breakdown vocal theatrics seem somewhat more believable"" or ""this time around, Oberst chooses to read from the diary labeled Super Terrible Political Injustices rather than the one labeled Girls Who Broke My Heart"" imply a grudge against anything Bright Eyes-related, invalidating the writer's entire opinion. Why would Pitchfork assign an album to someone who isn't going to like it? Perhaps if Rob Mitchum had given the album a fair shot, he wouldn't be so quick to write off the inter-song sound clip segues as ""devices so unoriginal, they're older than Oberst himself."" As if making fun of Oberst's age hasn't been done to death, asshole. I personally think that the tape recorded conversations about urban sprawl and the television commercials sprinkled throughout ""$$$$$"" nicely underscore the theme of the album, unlike your ""writer,"" who says he'll ""bet anyone ten dollars that Naomi Klein's No Logo is sitting on Oberst's bedside table right this second."" And don't even get me started on Mitchum's music commentary, which ranges from describing the riff of ""Mall of America"" as ""a metalhead practicing scales in a guitar store"" to writing off ""Man and Wife, the Latter"" as ""a less intelligent Zack de la Rocha fronting Puddle of Mudd."" You need to clean out your ears, wax-man. Conor has said in interviews that Desaparecidos is all about the ROCK-- about playing loud music and sending out an in-your-face political message. Just because a band isn't gazing at their shoes all day and playing their guitar through 38 effects pedals doesn't mean they're ""Mongoloid metal."" Cock. Mitchum's so hellbent on being clever and pleasing your bloodthirsty audience that he can't even unconditionally praise the songs he claims to enjoy. Oh, he'll admit that the melody and energy of ""The Happiest Place on Earth"" is ""irresistible,"" but then he has to go and pan lyrics like ""opiate of the populace"" and ""our freedom comes at their expense"" as being ""less resonant than the latest Rollins Band album."" And since he can't find anything to dislike about the blistering punk and keyboard mixture of ""Manana,"" he claims that he only likes it because ""Oberst's singing is so slurred that it shields the listener from the gut-wrenching lyrics."" Pretty much the whole misguided appraisal of Read Music - Speak Spanish stems from your conclusion that ""Oberst shows occasional, genuine skill as a talented songwriter, but he's constantly tripped up by taking himself way, way, way too seriously."" Heh, I'm sure Pitchfork writers never, ever take themselves too seriously, do they? I think your real problem, Mr. Mitchum, is your unwillingness to accept the political truths of which Conor Oberst speaks, all content in your comfortable little status quo world. You disgust me. If Schreiber knows what he's doing, he'll can Mitchum's hack ass and find someone who gives a fuck. Sincerely,

Wave Motion,Fat Jon the Ample Soul Physician,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd5cc0084474cd0c2caa/1:1/w_160/155f53e4.gif,2002-04-03 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3004-wave-motion/,Mush,"Instrumental hip-hop is a tricky proposition. Until DJ Shadow's Endtroducing, the idea of releasing instrumental versions of rap tracks seemed ludicrous. Who'd want to listen to It Takes a Nation of Millions bereft of Chuck D's searing commentary and Flav's wisecracking? Would an instrumental version of Three Feet High and Rising be anything more than just a collection of oddball samples? Endroducing changed the rules. Shadow's curatorish crate-digging made voiceless hip-hop engaging and worthwhile pursuit. Of course, it wasn't too long before less notable and skillful beat-forgers converted Shadow's pioneering endeavor into a budget-priced bandwagon. Dan the Automator is largely to blame for this. After resurrecting Kool Keith with the Dr. Octagon project, few Automator projects were deemed complete without an accompanying instrumental version. These albums attract me even less than remix albums. At least with a remix album, you might get an intriguing take on a tune you'd previously considered wet shit. Prime example of this is Matthew Herbert's Secondhand Sounds remix collection where he transforms putrid slurry such as Moloko's ""Sing It Back"" into fascinating concr√®te funk. But with your usual instrumental hip-hop album, it's the same album, only with the vocals excised-- and without even the expense of hiring Norman Cook to bully his engineer to rig up four samples and roll them into a wire ball of predictability. It need not be this way! Reggae has a long tradition of released vocal and ""versioned"" readings of albums, like Burning Spear's Marcus Garvey with its Garvey Ghost dub version, and Johnny Clarke's Don't Trouble Trouble, and the Aggrovators' aptly-titled Johnny in the Echo Chamber. Surely, there's something that can be done about this! Enter Fat Jon the Soul Physician, the beat creator for the Five Deez crew and a salve to all of us that have been exhausted by waiting for true instrumental hip-hop. Though the cover of Wave Motion may make blatant reference to Stevie Wonder's early 70s third-eye soul, the music is deep and dubby hip-hop cool. This ain't the stuff that'll sell K-Swiss trainers-- nor will Fat Jon be appearing on the glossy cover of Vibe. This, rather, is the stuff that discerning heads will take to their hearts, just as they did with the even more daring Soulmates by Bay Area genius Nobody. Wave Motion opens almost programmatically with a sumptuous female vocal crying, ""To the Sky! Take me home!,"" as some unidentified hepcat saxophonist hollows his low-down mojo. With these two contrasting elements, Fat Jon states that this record will be a celestially jazzy homecoming. A tight snare creeps in to add just the right amount of head-bobbing funk. With an opening as brazenly self-assured and soulful as this, I forget all my previous notions regarding instrumental hip-hop. ""Feel the Void"" adds to my enthusiasm. The track creeps up with a liberated bassline that wanders from rhythm to rhythm until a steady pattern emerges. Above these elements, a lonesome flute charts a course through heartache, only to be goaded into lovelorn desperation by occasional bass clarinet farps. Two tracks in, and I've forgotten all about Shadow's over-hyped (not to mention disappointing) The Private Press. ""Visual Music"" is not as oxymoronic as its title suggests. It's an uncomplicated, gorgeous t√©te-a-t√©te between a restrained drum kit and an array of gently chiming guitars, reeds, and keyboards. ""Watch Out"" possesses a distinguishing brightness, a feisty club cut after the almost contemplative vibe of the preceding tracks. ""For Stress"" clothes the Neptunes' tighter-than-spandex snare sound in ambient spangles and Gil Evans horn ensemble lines. ""Eyes"" continues the jazz without sounding anything like a Digible Planets or Tribe Called Quest clone. ""Wet Secrets"" vies with ""Watch Out"" for the club action. ""Wet Secrets"" will lose out, as the harmonic piano clusters lend the track a meditative quality that will be lost on the Kristal'd and Red Bull'd masses. And that's the overwhelming thing about Wave Motion. Fat Jon is a conscientious and gifted producer with a talent for creating tracks that work on multiple levels simultaneously. The grooves here are never less than utterly accessible and smartly funky. But like the album's artwork, there's a depth and a melancholy to almost all these tracks. ""Feel the Void"" is a standout in this regard, but ""Depths"" aches, too. Wave Motion isn't an accessory or an alternative like so many instrumental albums; Wave Motion is a serious proposition and a statement not only of Fat Jon's studio abilities but also of his introspective aesthetic. With the resilience and the emotional draw to outlast much of what constitutes any variant of hip-hop these days, this record puts Fat Jon on the radar. Expect great things.","Instrumental hip-hop is a tricky proposition. Until DJ Shadow's Endtroducing,\n\ the idea of releasing instrumental versions of rap ...

Birds Fly EP,Aspera,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a125b1335d7bf16981ad/1:1/w_160/5797b863.gif,2002-04-02 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/324-birds-fly-ep/,Suicide Squeeze,"Okay, so you're lost in space. The way I see it, you've got two immediate problems: You must navigate through a vast, soundless expanse with only a handful of recognizable landmarks and; You must to carefully ration the air in your own small space to avoid suffocation. It's a unique situation in its ability to spook the hell out of both claustrophobic and agoraphobic character types. Aspera's Birds Fly EP is a terrific musical simulation of the above conditions. This is a weird little disc, full of moonboot synthesizers, short snatches of eerie, reverbed guitar, and the kind of overwhelming drum sound I tend to associate with latter-day Flaming Lips. Of course, the Flaming Lips are an obvious comparison-- as is Spiritualized! But where those bands cultivate sound so thick it could swallow you whole, Aspera pulls back just at the moment you expect a thunderous chorus. This is not bad; in fact, the relative sparseness of some of these songs creates a serious sense of weightlessness. For a psychedelic band leaning ever closer to space-rock with each subsequent release, this, for me, is a desired result. But just as a single body, drifting through the vastness of space, seems awfully tiny and insignificant, the vast majority of these songs suffer from their disproportionate ratio of instrumentation-to-silence. I had reservations about this technique from the very beginning of the title track, which begins with a high-pitched carnival keyboard and super-spare drumming. When the guitar and bass enter for the chorus, the song recovers enough density to keep me from wondering whether the tinny quality of the music was a deliberate effect or an offshoot of poor recording. (For the record, I'm almost positive it's the former, but I could be wrong.) Despite its chorus of synthesized voices, ""Heaven's on Your Right Side"" never completely solidifies, perhaps because the dirge-like drums of the verses do little but call attention to what's missing. That the chorus reminds me of a zero-gravity rendition of ""You Are My Sunshine"" only exacerbated the problem. There's a very nice instrumental bridge that again reaches nearly reaches full sound capacity only to end too quickly. And this is a problem that plagues Birds Fly as a whole. In contrast to psych and space-rock's progenitors, Aspera keep the vast majority of their songs at just under three minutes-- a feat achieved by stopping just before what seems to be the natural conclusion of the song. This is fine for one track, maybe, but when an entire record follows this model, it makes you wonder if it isn't just a contrivance to mask running out of steam. Or, put another way, these are not bad songs-- they just sound unfinished. Yet, where an album might suffer terribly from so much vacancy, the brevity of the EP format (and of the individual songs) makes the affectation somewhat more digestible. Aspera's departure from the more straightforward psychedelia of their earlier releases bodes well for future innovations, and the time that passes between this record and their next full-length may give them time to grow into all that space.","Okay, so you're lost in space.

Lapalco,Brendan Benson,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2755e6ef959693203ff/1:1/w_160/8ece8223.jpg,2002-04-02 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/655-lapalco/,StarTime,"Lou Pearlman is in a world of shit. After a series of highly publicized in-court battles with the Backstreet Boys and N'Sync resulted in the legal annulment of his managerial duties, he's been forced to subsist on a disrespectfully small severance package (only one-sixth of the respective groups' entire earnings?) and a diet of ""exclusive"" tell-alls. But the question plaguing every pre-pubescent music lover and-- let's face it-- the whole world is: what will this self-professed 'pop guru' do next? Though his name is nowhere to be found amongst the album's succinct liner notes, it's pretty hard to ignore the argument that Brendan Benson's Lapalco could very well mark Pearlman's return to the world of image consultation and pre-packaged musical commodity. Nevermind that there's no actual evidence of any official contact between Benson and Lou (or ""Big Poppa,"" as he's come to be known in the most elite circles of Tigerbeat fandom). All the tell-tale signs of Pearlman's influence are here, if you look hard enough. Lapalco's cover art, for instance, finds Benson dressed in prototypical thrift store attire and eating from a single-serving box of breakfast cereal; an ingenious marketing ploy that immediately establishes the album's target demographic! It almost makes one feel guilty for enjoying the disc so thoroughly. With 1996's One Mississippi, Brendan Benson crafted an impressively catchy collection of songs whose instant accessibility belied the complex arrangements that resided just beneath the obvious hooks. Pieces such as ""Sittin' Pretty"" and ""Tea"" invoked the ghosts of early R.E.M. and the Beatles while managing to elude the nauseating sense of pastiche induced by many like-minded acts who populated mid-90s alternative radio. Unfortunately, Virgin's mishandling of the album squandered whatever commercial success Benson was poised to achieve and precipitated a number of label disputes, delaying the recording of a proper follow-up for years on end. Die-hard fans-- and there actually were a handful-- wept. Luckily, their wait was not in vain, as Benson has fashioned yet another sterling pop record replete with his standard jangle-pop songs and anthemic rockers, and a smattering of pastoral psychedelia. Aside from guest production by Jason Falkner and his occasional vocal accompaniment, Brendan performs, sings, and produces every note of Lapalco, lending even the most aggressive tracks an indefinable sort of intimacy. Nowhere is this more evident than ""Metarie,"" which features a surprisingly effective lyrical meditation on lost love while skirting an obvious structural similarity to Elton John's ""Rocket Man"" (of all things!). Occasionally, though, the very elements that make Benson's music endearing can, in excess, be counterproductive. ""You're Quiet"" which boasts the refrain, ""I've been a little down on my luck/ I think you know where I'm coming from/ I need a pick-up and I don't mean truck,"" typifying the record's lyrical pandering and goofiness. Elsewhere, ""What"" strives to use the word ""girl"" as many times as humanly possible within a 3\xBD-minute window, which not only proves that Brendan ascribes to the musical school of thought which prizes quantity over quality, but also hints at his presumed employment by Big Poppa. But regardless of its spotty lyricism, Lapalco's intelligent and understated melodies indicate that we have a true talent on our hands-- especially on ""Tiny Spark,"" which launches the album with an infectious Moog riff that soon blossoms into one of the most driving tracks in the man's canon. His unadulterated giddiness is certainly contagious and, when channeled correctly, makes for some surprisingly potent music. Though it's futile to predict whether or not he's capable of transcending his influences, it's comforting to know that, with rave reviews in Esquire and an endorsement from Jack White of the White Stripes, Lou Pearlman will sleep soundly tonight.","Lou Pearlman is in a world of shit.

Split EP,My Morning JacketSongs: Ohia,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1d4c0084474cd0bfede/1:1/w_160/49df9179.gif,2002-04-02 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5530-split-ep/,Jade Tree,"Split EPs. What's the point? Not eclectic enough to be enjoyed as a sampler, too confining to be much of an extended statement, and too long to highlight the strength of a single song like a seven-inch could, they tend to come off like pathetic time-stalling ploys between albums or repositories for second-rate (or worse) material. But, as with all things, there are exceptions. And this, my friends, is a big one. Within the realm of country-leaning indie rock, one will be hard pressed to find three better songs from My Morning Jacket than the three they lead this record off with. And the lone Songs: Ohia track, though more of a completist affair typical to these kinds of releases, is nothing to scoff at, either. What My Morning Jacket confronts us with here is a band on top of its game. Though any discussion of these guys will almost assuredly bring up their sounding like somewhere been Neil Young and the Flaming Lips, the whole truth is they sound like a lot of classic bands and artists-- ranging from the Allman Brothers to Television-- but in the final summation, they sound like no one but themselves. ""O Is the One That Is Real"" is the kind of song a well-wishing fan would hope they'd release as a college radio single from an album, instead of on a split EP that'll likely be overlooked at the end of the day. It's a song that positively could break the band to a wider audience, easily bettering anything the band has recorded so far. It has the mark of a classic stamped all over it: a catchy but slippery guitar riff, slightly anthemic lyrics, and powerful, confident delivery. An attention-grabbing snare crack kicks off the song before singer/guitarist Jim James wails, in his reverb-drenched, honey-n'-whiskey-soaked voice, ""Always leave your television on/ Always keep your answers by the phone..."" By the time the song's reached its peak, with James singing his guts out, ""The radio will play"" over and over again, you find yourself un-self-consciously singing along, and maybe even dusting off the old air guitar. In one fell swoop, it eliminates years of indie rock indoctrination forbidding all non-ironic displays of enjoyment and identification. And it's a beautiful and liberating thing. ""How Do You Know"" is a quasi-ballad with amazing if perplexing lyrics that manage to be evocative despite themselves: ""Who fanned the fire that burned down the lake? One, two, three, four things I'd rather forget."" The songs builds in a similar fashion to the first, with a great dual guitar solo and a classic-rockish drum fill bridge that comes off as completely necessary. ""Come Closer"" is a full-on ballad with no apologies, and though it may sound more like a Neil Young song than anything of My Morning Jacket's previous work, they pull it off like Crazy Horse-- I can say with a fair amount of confidence that it would have made a great b-side for ""Heart of Gold,"" had that space not already been occupied by ""Sugar Mountain."" The subject is love and longing (what else?), and James has never sounded more genuinely forlorn. And that's no small statement for a man who once sung, ""When dark touches your skull, you can dump that on me."" After a 2\xBD-minute palette-cleansing track which sounds like the first three songs sped up and reversed, Songs: Ohia evens out the EP with a 10-minute version of ""Be Your Own Guide,"" a song that appeared as an untitled track in a vastly different form on last year's live album, Me Sei Apparso Come Un Fantasma. A sparse, acoustic jam session captured to tape by Paul Oldham at his studio in Shelbyville, Kentucky, it's notable for featuring his brother, the Bonnie Prince himself, and Appendix Out's Ali Roberts. But, before you wet yourself, it should be noted that Will Oldham's backup vocals are mixed low in the background (we're talking the next room here) and his words are few and far between. Even so, his voice is unmistakable, even at a distance, and his harmonizing with Ohia frontman Jason Molina on the Emersonian title/refrain is stark and moving. It may not be the dream match-up fans have envisioned since Songs: Ohia released its first single on Palace records so long ago, but it is far more affecting than you might expect. And so, what we end up with is a split EP of another breed-- one on which actual talent meets top-shelf songwriting, rather than the usual we-found-this-one-in-the-closet contributions. Showcasing both bands at what is, thus far, their artistic apexes, the record is well worth its $7.49 sticker price. And that's a hell of a lot more than you could say for Rancid and NOFX's BYO Split Series, Vol. III.","Split EPs. What's the point?

Valis,Christian Kleine,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbd8abf31b7dc7155ba4/1:1/w_160/01d6180c.jpg,2002-04-02 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4491-valis/,Morr,"In 1981, Philip K. Dick published what is arguably his most demented, paranoid and self-referential slipstream novel, Valis. What meager plot the book contained concerned Vast Active Living Intelligence System (VALIS), which, in short, attempted to explain what every religion and creed known to humanity is really on about. Valis was Dick's search for discernable reality, if such a thing exists, through the Tractates Cryptica Scriptura, a system of precepts that Dick's alter-ego Horselover Fat had constructed. Given that Horselover Fat was the English translation of Dick's name, Valis was a dialog between segments of his mind, which had been driven ever more to fracture since Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974. The message of Valis seemed to be that the only coping mechanism for a bonkers world is to go mad yourself. But Christian Kleine offers a second solution-- one that actually might offer temporary respite. Kleine's Valis will definitely not answer any nagging theological doubts you have, nor supply you with a first-class ticket to paradise, but these six indie-inflected chill-out tracks are soothing enough to release you from your woes. Kleine's music is based on the principle that simple things can become complex when aggregated. For instance, the bassline of the opening track, ""Boon,"" is the bassline from the Cure's ""The Forest"" but played by a simpleton. This otherwise inept bassline deftly props up all manner of chiming Cocteau Twin-ish guitar sounds and digital atmospherics that everyone has been familiar since Warp's Artificial Intelligence days. Kleine adds a minimal hip-hop rhythm for the chillheads to bob along to, and lets his concoction roll out. ""H:Y"" sounds like a dubbed-out b-boy instrumental as performed by those austere manipulators of sound, Appliance. Oddly, ""Red Norvo"" contains no detectable vibraphone, as one would expect a track named after one of the foremost players of that instrument. Yes, Kleine's ""Red Norvo"" has plenty of chimy rings to it, but whereas your typical IDM track achieves the effect with synthtones, Kleine appears to be using an electric guitar. ""Accent"" is an altogether tougher beast-- the beats are spiked brass knuckle-dusters and their patterns are almost as furious as Norwegian junglist DJ TeeBee's. But to maintain at least the sense of chill, Kleine swamps these angry beasts in tranquil ambient pads and a nervous melody that skitters through them seeking resolution. ""Unauthorized"" finds Kleine at his most fractured. Here, the militant beats win out over the ambient pads-- they're still present, just buried under the thrall of beat-down percussion. ""Several"" is something like a fusion of Papa M, Carsten Nicolai, and the highbrow applied jungle of Elliot Sharp. But however unsettling that sounds, Kleine tames these competing elements to produce a gentle compromise. This compromise is the key to understanding Kleine's version of Valis. Kleine juxtaposes antithetical elements and challenges himself to seek a resolution to the contrast, just as Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth used massive blocks of stone to express the form of voids. If the solution to any problem is to be judged by both its efficiency and its beauty, Kleine's version of Valis far outranks Dick's. But if I were you, I'd hold out for the much more daring Our Noise, Kleine's collaboration with Morr Music labelmate Thaddeus Herrmann-- it's far less beholden to Ulrich Schnauss' Far Away Trains Passing By and elevates both Kleine and Herrmann to the top of the premier league.","In 1981, Philip K.

Deceleration One,Califone,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4de13d1975652138df4/1:1/w_160/85929965.gif,2002-04-01 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1240-deceleration-one/,Perishable,"There was a time in my life when I wouldn't have touched this record with a ten foot pole. Early in my musical development (in my case, we're talking high school here, or maybe eighth grade), I was full of biases against all kinds of genres. I was certain that hip-hop sucked, electronica was all just a bunch of boring, go-nowhere beats, and that bastard rock music had been monopolizing the airwaves for upwards of forty years. I'm sure the young, arrogant me would be awfully surprised going through my record collection these days and seeing just how much of it was recorded after 1990. My friend Brian has always said that if he ever went back in time and met himself, he'd want to kick his own ass for being such a moron. I often find myself feeling the same way, but I think that instead of giving my younger self a good whomping, I'd be more apt to put an album like this in his hand and tell him to really listen to it. I'd tell him that it's free music, totally improvised live as a soundtrack to a few independent films. And he'd be incredibly skeptical. Improvisation was another one of the categories that I had shut myself off from. Somehow, I got it in my head that, if a song hadn't been pre-written, it couldn't possibly be any good. And I'd have argued that point, too, with no evidence to back up my claim. Of course, I don't really know what I would have thought of this when I was thirteen, but I imagine that hearing it would have at least opened my eyes to the fact that freely improvised music doesn't have to be abrasive or difficult (though sometimes the best of it is). But my views on just about everything have changed since then, and at this point in my life, free music fascinates me to no end-- be it the jazz freakouts of the Art Ensemble of Chicago or the chance music created by a guy like Steve Reich. I basically support Ornette Coleman's notion that being free from the confines of regular structures and chord progressions opens musicians up to limitless expressive possibilities. Much to my delight, this new Califone disc supports that notion remarkably. Several of these pieces seem to have at least some sort of verbally conveyed structure, but virtually none of them adhere to the conventions of form that most music does. The pieces themselves are all quite varied in approach from each other, some building in long crescendos, some pulsing listlessly, and others behaving almost like songs, with steady beats and coherent melodies. This approach to scoring films is nothing especially new-- Pink Floyd was doing it as early as 1969, and I'm sure they weren't the first-- but I've always found it to be incredibly effective at evoking the emotion or the mood present on the screen. Pinetop Seven's stunning improvised score to The Wind is so vivid that I could practically visualize the film before I even saw it. And while Califone's scores for a series of film loops, as well as one other short film, are quite so visually evocative, they do carry a profound sense of emotion that keeps me connected to them even when they're at their most obtuse. The first six tracks are music set to film loops constructed by Jeff Economy (who also performs some accordion and live foley) and Carolyn Faber. By and large, the ensemble avoids the obvious trap of performing repetitive music over it, instead opting for sounds that flow freely from one emotional state to the next. This is really a Califone record in name more than in practice, as mainstays Ben Massarella and Tim Rutili are accompanied by five other musicians (and Economy), each of whom contributes rather evenly to the overall sound. The eight-minute opener ""Handpainted Halo/Ceiling"" is one of the album's most stunning tracks, opening with an extended series of ambient washes and organ drones. At the six-minute mark, Massarella and Joe Adamik enter with drums and assorted other percussive objects (including sheet metal and bedpans), giving the music a more songlike feel and a steady pulse for the delayed guitars and mellow organs in the foreground to rest on. As the tune progresses, the drums and percussion gradually move out of synch, eventually stopping to leave the other instruments to wander and drone for a couple of minutes before moving on to the shorter ""Rooftops/Static."" ""Rooftops"" employs some deft live electronics (courtesy of Gary Schepers) and tribal drums to drive along the ominous organ and swelling, warm synth. ""Face Under Hat/Old Streetside"" has the feel of a lazy nighttime jam, with its wandering lap steel, dingy guitar riffs and eddying electric piano. The drums punch out a laid-back but steady beat as the interplay between the melodic instruments slowly moves into bluesy territory and then back again, finally devolving into a disorganized ambient soup for ""Parade Queen/MilkWaltz/Dirt Moon."" And out of that rises ""Lakewater/Parachutes,"" a gorgeous jam that rides on a steady backbeat. Rutili and Rebecca Gates' heavily delayed guitars reverberate over a gossamer web of organ, and one of them actually ends up crafting a sort of hook for the whole proceedings. The first set closes out with ""Peel,"" a duet between Gillian Lisee's accordion and Rutili's guitar that benefits from subtle interjections of organ. The second set originally provided accompaniment to Ladislaw Starewicz's The Mascot, and finds the band moving more rapidly between textures. It opens with the quietly graceful ""Intro/Sleepy Child Asks for an Orange,"" and moves through all manner of material, from the electronic ""Monkey, Cat, Ballerina and Hood Escape from Moving Car/Clown Loses Head/Dog Stays"" to the raw ""Fruitstand Floor/Ankle Bite/Dog Steals Fallen Orange/Broom,"" a bluesy junkyard jam that would've fit nicely on last year's Roomsound if not for its brevity. Jim Becker's fretless banjo provides a kind of drunken lead as the rest of the group motors away underneath, expanding and contracting the tempo on a whim. One can only begin to imagine what the film in question looks like, confronted with sectional titles like ""Hellions Assemble,"" ""Hell Orchestra with Dancers,"" ""Cat Fights Devil,"" and ""Garlic Head Clown Serenades Ballerina Crying Vaseline Tears."" The set closes with ""Dog Feeds Orange to Sleepy Child/Outro,"" which is one of the most straight-up beautiful moments on the album. Warm synths, organ, swelling guitar leads, and lightly strummed chords are all that comprise the spare track, and it closes things on a remarkably serene note. Taken as a whole, Deceleration One is an enjoyable, richly textured listen, full of moments of quiet incidental beauty and dense noise alike. I'd even go so far as to say that it may be a good introduction to improvised music for rock fans who feel a little queasy about jumping straight into an Ornette Coleman or Sun Ra Arkestra album. Granted, the gentleness of this music puts it apart from a lot of other improvised records, but it's a great primer on the absence of rigid structure and planning. Regardless of your motives or biases, though, if you're looking for an excellent instrumental disc, this disc delivers. i","There was a time in my life when I wouldn't have touched this record with a ten foot pole ...

I just can't get that image out of my mind. Man, I flew into a crazy rage, stormed out to my 81 Buick and tore dirt right out of that greazy hellhole. The only thing that helps this pain in my gut is the new album by Okkervil River. I don't know what you'd call their music-- alt-country or indie rock or avant-folk or some such crossbred super-genre. Calms the nerves, though. Sure, it's kind of a downer, but without hitting the gutbucket misery of real country. And Okkervil can also let fly, too: the best song on the album, ""Lady Liberty,"" smokes like a raccoon in a chimney, with horns blasting behind singer Will Sheff as he moans about loving the wrong woman. ""I can picture you inside some stranger's house/ Inside some stranger's bed/ You're trying to seem mysterious/ The covers pulled over your head."" Ain't nothin' stings like the truth. Okkervil River sounds like a loose outfit; their self-released 1999 debut, Stars Too Small to Use was raw, shambling stuff, but with this new record they're starting to pull it together. The songwriting is impressively poignant, and the music is as tight and comforting as any old noose: under producer and engineer Brian Beattie's wing, the band has filled out and arranged these songs beautifully with every southern-flavored instrument you could dream up-- mandolin, pedal steel, fiddle, organ, and strings and horns. The record maintains a nice, lush air, but manages to stay somehow raucous simultaneously-- it's ponderous indie rock and country charm frequenting each other's local haunts. But while these guys may be rising stars, they're still looking for comfort and a little love, if the lyrics are any indication. Damned if ""My Bad Days,"" for one, isn't as stark as they come: Sheff can sound like a man who's been beaten back to a lost little boy. ""Dead Dog Song"" is a mandolin-propelled tune with great, hokey lyrics (""He'd never been to church, so he doesn't have a soul""). And the guys even bring in Daniel Johnston to duet on ""Happy Hearts,"" just coming straight out and pleading for what we're all after: ""Unconditional love, why did you leave me?"" Come on, guys, you're killing me. But one song in particular got my attention: ""Westfall,"" the account of a murderer coming to trial. As alt-country serial killer ballads go, this one has nothing on Jim White's ""The Wound That Never Heals""-- but it's a good song about evil and murder, and it almost sounds convincing when these nice boys sing: ""They're looking for evil/ Thinking they can trace it/ But evil don't look like anything."" So it's past two in the morning and I'm still driving, when suddenly I see someone by the side of the road-- a woman, hitch-hiking-- and damned if she doesn't look like, well... just like my wife on her best day (twenty years ago). I know it can't be her, but I'm transfixed. She's got her thumb out and though I know it's wrong, I decide to pull over. I swerve to the side of the road and let her walk up to my car. Satan was arm-wrestling for my soul, but this time the Lord won: I hit the gas and skidded away before she got to my door. She didn't look too happy, but hell, she doesn't know how close she came to having something awful happen to her, 'cause I know I'm still in a funny mood. Anyway, there isn't room enough in the trunk for a third body.","It was the worst day of my life. I get home from the plant and there's my woman: rolling ...

Eudora,The Get Up Kids,by: Brad Haywood & Ryan Schreiber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf1213d197565213b836/1:1/w_160/f9070a63.gif,2002-04-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3433-eudora/,VagrantHeroes and Villains,"We don't like the Get Up Kids much around these parts, but not for the usual reasons we tend to rough up their sort. It isn't because they're fey little rockers with penchants for intolerable whimpering; it isn't because their songs are overwrought with empty frustration; and it isn't because their fashion sense is anally pre-meditated and accessorized (though all three certainly apply). No, our complete disregard for this band-- whether you or your five-year-old cousin thinks it's unwarranted or not-- stems from a much simpler base: they aren't any good. Need some proof with that statement? What excellent timing! The Kids are in the studio as we speak dishing up another plate of steaming teenage caricatures for springtime consumption. And in the meantime, they've given us Eudora. In 1997, when they dropped their first full-length for Doghouse Records, Four Minute Mile, the Get Up Kids instantly made a name for themselves by beating tried-and-true pop formulas over the cracked skulls of aspiring pro-skateboarders. And this was enough for me. But with Eudora, they somehow succeed at making some of the greatest pop songs ever written-- songs by the Pixies, David Bowie and the Cure-- sound like just another GUKpile. Eudora, for better or worse (and I know which I'm siding with here), is a 17-track collection of hard-to-find, but nonetheless previously released material. The Kansas City bad boys horde far more than their fair share of covers on this disc, resulting in a vicious bloodbath of unprecedented brutality. Pulled from the wreckage are ""Alec Eiffel,"" ""Suffragette City"" and ""Close to Me,"" as well as the Replacements' ""Beer for Breakfast,"" New Order's ""Regret,"" and-- yikes!-- M√∂tley Cr√ºe's ""On with the Show""?! While these songs improve the songwriting of the standard Get Up Kids release by roughly infinitely, it unfortunately taints these time-honored classics to know that these guys have had their way with them. Still, like I said, these are far greater songs than the Get Up Kids should have the privilege to soil, and if I'm choosing between this and, say, Something to Write Home About, I'm gonna side with the one that actually had some talent involved somewhere down the line. Besides, it really is hard to fuck up a great song. All you have to do is show up, and play the notes-- it'll sound decent, perhaps even convincing. But all of this fails to answer the real question: why bother? It's like Donald Trump's AC version of the Taj Mahal. Does anyone need a head-on collision between Sum 41 and Hello Kitty grossly reanimating the Spiders from Mars? No! Nobody needs this! And just like no one needs to familiarize themselves with a hackneyed cover of a brilliant song, so it goes for the hyper-drivel and anti-melody of ""I'm a Loner, Dottie, A Rebel,"" and the constant reversion across the album to vocal harmony in a sad attempt to achieve some kind of homogenized catharsis. ""Shorty"" takes a shot at dynamics with chunky guitars and scream-sung vocals, fading out with *extra-*chunky guitars and super-screamy scream-sung vocals. Let me say it one more time for emphasis: NOBODY NEEDS THIS. That is, except for those among us infected by rabies-- i.e. the card-carrying members of the Get Up Kids fanclub. As they froth at the mouth, they will remain unpersuaded by anything I have to say. They'll probably spend (or have already spent) their hard-earned allowance on this collection of diddly-poo. The rest of you should laugh at them and their pathetic recalcitrance. Feel good about yourself, because god knows they don't.","We don't like the Get Up Kids much around these parts, but not for the usual\n\ reasons we ...

Euphemystic,Son Ambulance,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4ac9d034d5c69bf310f/1:1/w_160/d1e2ab0a.jpg,2002-04-01 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7326-euphemystic/,Saddle Creek,"Seems like every year alternative radio brings forth yet another growling Ten-era Eddie Vedder knock-off or a sensitive lad throwing his voice up and down the register like Dave Matthews. What you end up with is the musical equivalent of the generic-brand cereals strewn across the bottom shelves of the nation's grocery chains. You know, those ones with the slightly altered names like ""Captain Crunchy"" and ""Honey Hives."" It's a phenomenon that's always intrigued me: are these singers just reflecting their primary influences, or is it a shameless attempt to penetrate a jaded radio listener's brain by momentarily convincing them they're listening to a new song by their favorite band? I wouldn't accuse Son, Ambulance of such crass commercial manipulation. After all, they record for Omaha's tiny Saddle Creek label. What are they gonna do? Tour with No Doubt? (Uhh...) But I can't help getting hung up on the fact that Euphemystic really, really sounds like it was recorded by a lisping Ben Folds with a slight head cold. I'm sure bringing up Joe Knapp's vocal resemblance to Mr. Folds is a well-trodden comparison, but goddamn, it's hard not to make. If Folds' voice were a portrait, then Son, Ambulance would be one of those guys who sits in a museum every day for weeks painting a near-exact replica. Perhaps I'm being unfair, and Knapp's resemblance to Folds is nothing more than a bizarre evolutionary convergence of the two singers' vocal cords. But Knapp doesn't do himself any favors by choosing the piano as his weapon of choice for the majority of these songs. And ""Brown Park"" from Son, Ambulance's debut EP, Oh, Holy Fools (a disc which also featured labelmates Bright Eyes) sounded so much like a Whatever and Ever Amen b-side you could probably convince Robert Sledge that he played bass on it. Euphemystic, at least, never reaches that song's blatant Ben Folds Fivery. For one thing, Knapp's songwriting style is considerably less traditional, incorporating abrupt tempo shifts, complex rhythms, and sparse arrangements rather than bright harmonies and orchestral bombast. The album opener, ""An Instant Death,"" is enough to make a drummer go on strike, accelerating and decelerating between spacy finger-picking, piano-driven strut, and guitar riff-rock worthy of an early Big Star album. Despite these gymnastics, Knapp and Co. present significantly brighter skies than the gloom-and-doom melodrama of labelmates Bright Eyes and the Faint, with unabashed romanticism like ""I Promise You'll Never Grow Old,"" a track which segues into and out of the theme from ""Sesame Street"" without breaking stride-- and it doesn't sound half as cheesy as you'd expect. Meanwhile, attempts at gravitas, like the Taco Bell Latin inflections of ""Maria in Motion,"" are embarrassing missteps. Knapp is at his best when he sticks to the piano, as on the striking solo track ""A New Dress for Maybell,"" rather than throwing overly precious synth swirls onto tracks like ""A Book Laid on Its Binding."" Ironically, the more Son, Ambulance emphasizes the piano, the more it sounds like (to further beat a dead horse) Ben Folds outtakes. Luckily, I have a soft spot for the ""Brick""-layer, so it doesn't bother me like a vocal resemblance to, say, Don Henley would. But sadly, Euphemystic is not quite a strong enough album to let me forget the similarity, nor does it present any other characteristic noteworthy enough to structure a record review around. Should Joe Knapp ever find his voice-- literally-- his band may be yet another band to watch out of the city Time Magazine is calling the ""Rock Scene to Watch.""","Seems like every year alternative radio brings forth yet another growling Ten-era Eddie Vedder knock-off or a sensitive lad ...

Let's just say that Armstrong and Lars Frederiksen's sloppy vocals are a far cry from harmonious. The real standout in Rancid's half of the record is ""Sticking in My Eye,"" which they play very true to the original.\xA0 Matt Freeman funks up the bassline in typical too-many-notes-in-too-little-time fashion, proving once again that he's far too good a bassist to be in Rancid.\xA0 The track is full of catchy melodies and infectious harmonies, and is the only time on the record where Rancid doesn't come sounding like a drunken garage band. \v\vIt's a steady downhill decline from there.\xA0 Specifically, ""Don't Call Me White"" is borderline unlistenable.\xA0 Lars Frederiksen's barf-bag vocals are so off-key it makes you wonder how the rest of the band lets him get away with it.\xA0 They slowed this one down quite a bit to give it more of an ""Oi!"" feel, and yet, it just turns into a boring, sludgy mess. Sorry, fellas, the joke ain't funny when a white guy sings it.\xA0 It is, however, funny when Fat Mike sings it-- he's Jewish! The same problem prevails on ""The Brews"" (as in 'Hebrews', not a 30-pack of Stroh's), the other side of the ""Don't Call Me White"" coin.\xA0 It's also about being Jewish, but this time they sped up the tempo. The original was slow, with fuzz-drenched guitars mixing well with the poppier vocals, whereas Rancid's version is a generic upbeat rocker. It's still relatively effective, but far inferior compared to the original.\v\vRancid's final offering comes with ""Vanilla Sex,"" a mid-tempo campfire protest song about censorship.\xA0 Lyrics like, ""Don't ever take away from me my pornography"" may've sounded fresh to 2 Live Crew back in 1989, but it just doesn't cut it in these fast and furious times. Note to protestors: if you're fighting against censorship, don't use porn as your main prop.\xA0 No senator is gonna get behind a pro-porn bill. NOFX's half is stronger, thanks in no small part to the fact that NOFX actually have some personality.\xA0 They're as tight as ever here, adding an interesting flair to the Rancid songs.\xA0 They kick it off with ""I Am the One,"" which is either about suicide, or god, or both.\xA0 Beats me.\xA0 It's a pretty generic punk rocker (and I don't even necessarily mean that in a bad way), with the group yelling, ""Hey! Hey! Hey!"" NOFX adds some much needed humor to plenty of these Rancid tracks, like here when guitarist El Hefe pulls off a perfect Fat Albert.\xA0 Hilarious. Fat Mike admitted that he made no attempt to imitate Freeman's bass style, but he holds his own in ""Tenderloin.""\xA0 This is a typical Rancid song, combining gutter punk and rock and roll.\xA0 It's pretty weak, really.\xA0 But it's short, so that makes it okay. Then there's ""Olympia, WA,"" which has an intro guitar lead that's catchier than the clap.\xA0 The breakdown towards the end practically dares you to not get fired up when it kicks back in. The whole thing closes with another classic NOFX stunt.\xA0 They took one of Rancid's bigger hits, ""Radio,"" and transformed it from a punk-rock anthem into a laid-back reggae jam.\xA0 El Hefe takes the lead vocals on this one with an odd combination of Jamaican and Hispanic accents.\xA0 The result is really pretty funny-- similar to NOFX's own staple ""Kill All the White Man."" When Screeching Weasel and Born Against teamed up back in 93 to perform songs written by each other, the results were great.\xA0 A big part of their success with that project, however, stems from the fact that each band only did two songs.\xA0 With the NOFX/Rancid CD clocking in at 12 tracks, it's just too much.\xA0 I'm sure they had fun with it, and I'm sure they love listening to each others' contributions, but for us, the record-buying public, a lot of it just seems unnecessary.","**

Fever,Kylie Minogue,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c54b5e6ef95969323aa4/1:1/w_160/e479ca03.jpg,2002-03-31 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5313-fever/,Capitol,"[from April Fool's Edition, 2002] She's back.\xA0 The woman who brought American audiences that terribly rigid version of ""The Locomotion"" in the late 80s has risen from the dead (or massive overseas popularity, depending on how you look at it) to sock it to the red, white and blue just like she did 15 summers ago.\xA0 Okay, so that may not have been Kylie Minogue's primary motivation behind Fever, her ninth album overall, but it's probably going to be the subject of the most of the press she gets in the U.S.\xA0 In fact, this is hardly her ""comeback,"" since during the time she last made the Top 10 here, she was the most popular female pop singer in Europe and Australia. Perhaps a re-introduction is due. \v\v33-year-old Minogue first achieved fame as a child actress in several dramas, most notably the soap opera ""Neighbors."" When the soap began airing in the UK, Minogue's popularity soared. In 1987, she recorded a demo version of Little Eva's 60s pop hit ""The Locomotion"" for charity, and actually submitted the recording to the UK label Mushroom. Mushroom was fairly keen to release something by the young star, though weren't necessarily impressed by the recording.\xA0 The label decided to turn the Minogue situation over to a team of producers they'd just entered into a partnership with: Stock, Aitken and Waterman, who were fresh of producing major hits for Bananarama, Rick Astley and Dead or Alive. Of course, Stock, Aitken and Waterman wanted to work with Minogue, but didn't take her very seriously, and didn't even have material for her on the day she showed up to their studios.\xA0 Legend has it, they came up with the tune ""I Should Be So Lucky""\xA0in ten minutes, which became Minogue's second #1 single in Australia and England. Perhaps due to the relatively haphazard experience of recording under the SAW blade, Minogue gradually took matters into her own hands throughout the 90s.\xA0 The team continued to work with her in the early 90s, as Minogue scored more hits, and even began contributing her own lyrics. Her work ethic has been similar to Madonna's, in that she makes it a habit to produce interesting videos for her songs (usually opting for the role of seductress rather than clean cut girl-next-door), and always keeps her sound current. She also worked with many different collaborating producers after leaving the SAW team in 1991.\xA0 Her relationship with the late INXS singer Michael Hutchence resulted in further musical experimentation, going so far as to work with Nick Cave for the tune ""Where the Wild Flowers Grow,"" in addition to working with members of Manic Street Preachers for her 1997 release Impossible Princess. It wasn't all good times for Minogue, though, as her jaunts outside the dance-pop realm weren't received very well, critically or popularly.\xA0 She was actually dropped by her label after Impossible Princess (the gall!), only to resurface in 2000 with the back-to-basics, disco-drenched Light Years LP. She received co-writing credits on about half the tunes, and managed to retain control of her career while simultaneously jumping back into the limelight. Fever continues in this vein, adding a touch of adult-contemporary soft-groove in amongst the dancefloor escapades. \v\vMinogue brought in former dance-pop star Cathy Dennis to collaborate this time around, resulting in three songs: ""Can't Get You Out of My Head,"" ""Come Into My World"" and ""Dancefloor.""\xA0 The first song launched Minogue back into relevance in the U.S., with its very dry arrangement, straightforward disco pulse and breezy, Xanadu-esque bridge.\xA0 The song exudes a catchiness that belies its inherent simplicity, so reassuring during an era when chart acts sound increasingly baroque and producers race to see who can ape electronic music trends first. And with the tag ""set me free,"" perhaps Minogue is saying something about her relationship to trends in modern pop. The album initially brings to mind the sound of younger acts like N'Sync or Britney Spears, but where they tend to favor more aggressively spectacular production, Minogue seems comfortable with a basic groove, minimal backing, and vocals bared up in front. ""Come Into My World"" is a more traditionally disco-oriented track, reminiscent of Eumir Deodato's fantasy soundscapes, and with the alluring refrain, ""Come, come, come into my world."" ""Dancefloor"" is straight club music, along the lines of old-school Lisa Stansfield or the Real McCoy's eurodisco standards. Songs that don't quite succeed on that level are the title track, which is punchy but sounds a little too clean cut for someone who's asking if ""you feel the fever like I do."" The production isn't quite as current as the rest of the album, as if Minogue suddenly had an 80s flashback. ""Fragile"" is nicely atmospheric, but verges on being indistinct if you're not paying close attention.\xA0 Conversely, ""Give It to Me"" attempts a more aggressive posture, though I think at this point Minogue is better at being straightforward and smooth than down and dirty.\xA0 As a whole, Fever works well as an icebreaker for grown-up parties and the Sunday mornings after. It's a mature sound from a mature artist, and one that may very well re-establish Minogue for the VH1 generation.","**

No words could better describe the last two substandard LPs by heralded Christian contemporary artists Jars of Clay, once purported to be their genre's artistic torchbearers. But after ascending to popularity with their critically acclaimed 1995 self-titled release (indie cred: co-produced by King Crimson's Adrian Belew, et. al.), which blended lush harmonies, organic guitars and spacious sampled drum tracks, the quartet regressed into something more ass-like. They recorded two albums of standard pop fare, the kind enjoyed less by college kids, and more by their 30-something, married and mustached youth group leaders. If Jars of Clay's mission was to prove that Christians really aren't lame, they were fighting a losing battle. Facing an uncertain artistic future, the Jars had two clear options: 1) make a career-saving pact with the devil, or 2) return to form. With option one foreclosed by the irresistible grace of our Lord, the Jars chose the path less traveled-- and that has made all the difference. Jars of Clay's newest disc, The Eleventh Hour, is triumphant, just as likely as their debut to tug at your heartstrings and stoke your inner-burning flame. Like Lazarus, they arise. Thank God. The album opens with the edgy pop of ""Disappear,"" reminiscent of their 1995 MTV hit, ""Flood"" (and its confusing video of a tormented retard stuck in a mud bog). ""Disappear"" shows more melodic polish and punch than ""Flood,"" though, reflecting seven years of songwriting maturity. The lyrics are as strong and suggestive as ever, radiating with an odd, bubbling joy. Following that is ""Something Beautiful,"" and man, is it! The album's first single, ""I Need You,"" continues with the passion and intensity that Jars fans know and love, expressing a deep desire for God and harking of ""Love Song for a Savior"" with the simple lyrics, ""I need you/ I need you/ I need you."" (And someone needs to get on the horn to McCartney about that lyric, maybe he can recoup some of the plagiarism damages on ""My Sweet Lord"" for Harrison's estate.) The lyrics of ""Scarlet,"" on the other hand, focus on a more earthly sort of need-- booty (well, not exactly, but it is about men and women). Musically, the song continues with more of the Jars' style of creative, sensible pop-folk with a clever and catchy result. It's probably the strongest track on The Eleventh Hour. I don't know what woke these guys up; maybe it was the tragedy of September 11th, maybe it was some sort of revelation. Maybe someone in the Jars camp just got sick of biting the fat one, what with the acoustic chaff on ""If I Left the Zoo."" Whatever it was, their return from their three-year hiatus and seven-year swamp is more than welcome-- it's positively refreshing, a fragrant and pleasing offering to the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The Lord may reign over the heavens, but The Eleventh Hour proves that Jars of Clay still rule over Christian rock.","**

Under Rug Swept,Alanis Morissette,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3bdeb335119a49ed7a7/1:1/w_160/22c0a6bb.jpg,2002-03-31 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5429-under-rug-swept/,Warner Bros.Maverick,"[from April Fool's Edition, 2002] One of the great, universal inspirations throughout the history of rock and roll has been the death of a relationship.\xA0 In 1972, Carly Simon scored a hit with ""You're So Vain,"" a thinly-veiled sendoff to former beau Warren Beatty.\xA0 John Lennon, while separated from Yoko Ono, wrote some of his most harrowing songs, such as ""Jealous Guy.""\xA0 And at the core of Fleetwood Mac's Rumours was the searing open wound of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks' messy breakup. Throughout her career, Alanis Morissette has railed in a similar manner at an unnamed lover from her past, a mysterious figure described only as an older man from her days at Nickelodeon.\xA0 But now, on the promotional tour for Under Rug Swept, Morissette has bravely revealed the identity of her bitter muse: Dave Coulier! That's right, when Morissette had one hand in her pocket, the other hand was giving the finger to Uncle Joey on the 80s television hit ""Full House.""\xA0 It was like ray-eee-ain on your wedding day when her and Dave Coulier broke up. And yes, the person she went down on in a theater was... Dave Coulier. The man don't mess around. Coulier's ghost continues to float over and around Morissette's music, perhaps while doing his famous Popeye impression and mugging wildly.\xA0 The Canadian confronts this secret relationship in her most direct manner yet on the first single from Under Rug Swept, ""Hands Clean.""\xA0 By assuming Coulier's voice and singing lecherous lines like, ""Just make sure you don't tell on me, especially to the members of your family,"" and, ""I might want to marry you one day if you'd watch that weight and keep your firm body,"" Morissette must be making Coulier very uncomfortable wherever he is today. This fierce independence finds its way into every aspect of Under Rug Swept, her first album without the assistance of professionally licensed hitmaker Glen Ballard.\xA0 Morissette was obviously taking notes during their previous two collaborations, however, as these eleven songs retain the Jagged Little Pill formula of safely looped drums, angry guitar, and Alanis' trademark clenched-teeth yodel.\xA0 The immediacy is further amped by the fact that Morissette plays nearly all the instruments on the album, finally putting to rest the rumors that she's nothing more than a producer's puppet. The most marked effect of breaking away from Ballard's input is the unmitigated and highly concentrated ferocity of her lyrical confessions.\xA0 It's no mistake that Under Rug Swept comes off like a 45-minute glimpse into her daily therapy session.\xA0 Morissette wants to put a little bit of her head inside of yours, riding on a catchy hook-- to give all of us a taste of what it feels like to be dumped by Dave Coulier. Because even though ""it's been over a decade/ It smarts like four minutes ago.""\xA0 Observe: ""Flinch"": ""How long can a girl be haunted by you?"" ""That Particular Time"": ""I kept on ignoring the ambivalence you felt/ And in the meantime I lost myself."" ""So Unsexy"": ""I'm 13 again/ And I'm 13 for life."" Obviously, the emotional pain persists, many, many long years after ""You Can't Do That on Television.""\xA0 All Alanis wants is for the world to dance and sing along with her catharsis.\xA0 Can you really hold it against her? Of course not! So don't think you can write Morissette off as doing nothing more than cataloging her relationship grievances.\xA0 On ""21 Things I Want in a Lover,"" Alanis files an audio personal ad of what she's looking for in a man (note to fellas: be against capital punishment, and inventive in bed!), a move that could come off as self-indulgent, but in a personality as luminescent as Ms. Morissette, is nothing short of entrancing.\xA0 And on the somber ""A Man,"" Morissette boldly composes lyrics from the perspective of... a man! Perhaps the target of one of her many incendiary diatribes: ""Born of your bellies I yearn for the cord/ Years I have groveled repentance ignored."" Dude, that begs for a Mustaine solo. If Under Rug Swept has a weak point, it's in the lack of musical variety, with few tracks deviating from electric or acoustic versions of the above-stated formula.\xA0 These exceptions show a knack for appropriating the sonic vocabulary of other artists to fit Morissette's vision, such as the Elton John-inspired piano rocker ""That Particular Time"" (""This Train Don't Stop There Anymore,"" anyone?). Her skills at adaptation are most striking on ""Narcissus,"" in which Alanis mines the familiar Liz Phair trademark of minor chords, swear words and attitude, and shows once and for all that, while Phair may have invented the modern angry-female act, Morissette perfected it. Frankly, it's a small matter, since with lyrical messages this strong and profound, a little bit of stylistic homogeneity can be forgiven.\xA0 Even without the disturbing, sad, confusing, and (okay, I admit) mildly hilarious knowledge that her songs are directed at Uncle Joey, the emotional potency of Under Rug Swept's songs cannot be denied.\xA0 On ""So Unsexy,"" Alanis admits that sometimes she ""feels so boring for someone so interesting.""\xA0 But with an album this compelling, she really needn't worry.","**

After all, the country is absolutely gorgeous, rich in natural resources, and offers the best health care system known to man. How could anyone stay away from the place? Well, you see, Canada is plagued by what we in the business call ""sameness."" Yes, its true that each respective city is built from a different ilk of lumber, and that wayward ice flows occasionally interrupt daily life, but there's simply not enough topographic diversity to warrant the bursting tourist industry Canadians so desire. Similar criticisms can be made of uninspired music, which often finds an artist reiterating a particular sonic trick one time too many. Which is why its painful to call the music of Greg Davis uninspired. The kid's certainly got some talent and originality up his sleeve, but no matter how many subtle variations in accompaniment garnish Arbor, his debut for New York's Carpark label, its songs tend to bleed into one another like those indistinguishable Canadian territories. Music critics will revel in such horrible headliners as ""M√∫m's the Word"" or ""Aphex's Twin"" when reviewing Arbor. The latter being a catch-all, a last resort for any and all electronic music artists to have the unfortunate role of being reviewed by an unimaginative writer. While it's true that Davis and M√∫m both conjure up glitchy meditations of very similar moods, Davis' instrumentation is confined to his laptop, guitar, and the occasional sampling of an iconic folk legend. And though he does manages to explore a fair amount of sonic territory in spite of this, there's not enough compositional diversity to sustain repeated listens. But Arbor isn't without its merits. The opening track alone, ""Submersion Tank Part One (V.2),"" justifies the record's release and makes for a gorgeous introduction into Greg's world of escapist musical montage. Here-- and nearly everywhere else on the album-- he employs deftly struck vibraphones, small flourishes of muted white noise, and the occasional interjection of computer-generated beeping as foundation for his valium-induced haze of sound. Elsewhere, the album's title track finds Greg plucking out a desperate and unadorned acoustic melody for nearly nine minutes. And in fact, the song manages to remain engaging for the majority of its duration. Yet, at other moments, Davis' experiments fall short. ""Nicholas"" is the worst offender here. It samples the fragile refrain of Nick Drake's ""Introduction"" before mutating into a big beat-cum-IDM number and dousing Drake's original material in gauzy phaser effects. Though it does lend the album some much-needed diversity, its pandering and derivative performance is awfully weak, making ""Nicholas"" an awkward inclusion on an otherwise decidedly down-tempo affair. Regardless of its flaws, Arbor pulls off a rare feat: a promising debut. In fact, Davis' more concentrated efforts often rival-- and occasionally better-- his contemporaries, based purely on originality. But until his tendency to wander aimlessly about is firmly inhibited, I'd wait on investing my hard-earned money in his music.","Travel agents worldwide have long speculated as to why Canada suffers from such an\n\ anemic tourist industry.

Claro,Brothomstates,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a3b6c0084474cd0c031b/1:1/w_160/a7888b3b.jpg,2002-03-28 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/963-claro/,Warp,"Warp Records is the obvious home for Lassi Nikko's latest guileless fusion of Autechre's algorithmic expositions and the Boards of Canada's ingenue nostalgia. Despite a deal with the Finnish label Exogenic, Nikko's previous album, Kobn-Itch-Ey, was an MP3-only release posted on his website-- Nikko thereby set his sights further abroad than merely his Finnish homeland. What irks, however, is that Lassi expanded his outlook only when it came to distribution. Claro, like its predecessor, is exactly what you'd imagine an Autechre/Boards of Canada collaboration to sound like, provided neither of them gave half a fuck. No surprises here, then. Just another diligently focused album that demands you pay attention to its careful approximations of other people's styles. Claro opens with a modicum of promise. ""In"" is an intriguing collection of calliope flutters that cluster around a hummable tune. However, the following track, ""Brothomstates Ipxen,"" simply sounds recovered from the Confield recycle bin. And it's decked out in triggered aerosol hi-hats that hiss to a close in a series of end-of-the-pier Wurlitzer flurries! ""Kava"" serenely drifts through the subdued moments of Autechre's Tri Repetae accompanied by... yet another diverting calliope! And on ""25101999,"" Nikko returns to more mechanical Autechre-isms, never appreciating Booth & Brown's unraveling narrative mathematics. ""-"" is almost as empty as its title, a skipping broken-beat pattern playing host to a frolic of tinkling toy instruments. Then comes ""Mdrmx,"" Nikko's adoring tribute to Music has a Right to Children, with its softly echoed, fragile melody wanders through a poppy field of percussion. Beginning in a gloomy tide of thick bass burps, ""TeNochRP"" soon embraces a labored imitation of contorted steel. Just to heighten his sincerest brand of flattery, Lassi adds a dose of hip-hop swagger to the track in honor of Autechre's more b-boy side project, Gescom. With a judicious remix, the lumbering ""Natin"" could be transformed into a formidable Freq Nasty nu-school electro cut. As it stands, the track is far too pleased with its crinkled sophistication to be the effective battle weapon it could be. Claro (thankfully) concludes with ""Viimo"" which, at the last opportunity, does nothing to pull originality from the jaws of accomplished predictability. As I've found with all too many recent IDM albums, Claro is utterly beholden to the twin fontes et origines of the style. And like too many others, Nikko proves himself a disciplined and occasionally astonishingly beautiful mimic, but a mimic nonetheless. This record does nothing to show the world what Lassi Nikko has to contribute, other than adding yet another light to the other bright but derivative lights that seek to eclipse each other in atmospheric intensity. Nikko's addition to this firmament, already radiant with banality, does nothing but blind me and force me to take a break from this whole genre temporarily. At the moment, I'm finding the murkier no-drama beats of Req's Sketchbook so much more illuminating than all of this dazzling but formulaic imitation.","Warp Records is the obvious home for Lassi Nikko's latest guileless fusion of Autechre's algorithmic expositions and the ...

Clinical Imperfections,Codec Scovill,by: David M.

Not too warm, now; just right. The breeze is perfect, not too strong, yet with enough of a presence to remind you that you're alive as it brushes across your face. It's a perfect day. An acharacteristically pleasant day in a usually gloomy part of the year. And no matter how cynical you may be, you can't restrain the first hints of a smile creeping across your face as you head home, where your girlfriend waits, cooking you dinner. Your favorite dinner, at that. When you walk through the door, you can tell from the look on her face that something is wrong. She says nothing-- just meets you with a grim stare-- then turns her gaze to the answering machine across the room. Without a word, your eyes meet its persistent blinking. You cross the room, press the button. It's a message from your doctor. He asks you if you remember the routine tests he did the last time you visited the office. He says that something's come up. Something's not right. You don't even wait for the message to end. You call him up, your heartrate pacing, there's sweat on your brow. Your awareness of the world around you has suddenly vanished. When you resurface, it's harboring the news that something is horribly wrong indeed. Chronically wrong. You've now got anywhere between a month to twenty years left to live. There's really no way to tell when, but you are definitely going to die. Across the room, she stares at you. Your eyes meet hers. No words are exchanged. She cries; you say nothing. Your eyes fall to the ground as you drag your feet out the door again. Outside, it's still a gorgeous day-- the sun still hits your skin just right, the birds still sing the same as before. And yet, suddenly the whole world is different. Everything is ominous where before there was only beauty. Everything from the sound of traffic to the cock-headed gaze of your neighbor's dog has become a harbinger of your imminent doom. Nothing's actually changed about the world. Except your perception of it. This is what the music of the ambient trio Codec Scovill is like. It's comprised of subtle little changes that occur in the midst of long, beautiful, repetitious segments. Little, ominous changes. The kind that turn the world on its side. The kind that can turn a perfect day into the worst. When the album begins, it does so peacefully. Four tones are layered upon each other repeatedly, allowed to float around, to vibrate and harmonize in empty space. But soon, effects and feedback build up, and the anxiety sets in. Like most ambient music, Clinical Imperfections doesn't change much. There are lots of long tones here. They start out quiet and they build. They have some particular destination in mind, but rather than reaching it, they meet up with other tones halfway there. And they'll disappear only to return later and repeat the process. But while the sounds themselves rarely change, the context in which they are presented does. When five-to-ten minutes of signal-routed tones are interrupted by anything-- be it a minimal beat and fidgety static (""Alpine""), or a jarring wash of feedback (""Hohner 36""), it's hard to listen the same way when the tones return. Jarred from the peaceful introspection often induced by ambient music, the listener is now forced into an uneasy awareness, intimidated into paying attention. This inherent paranoia is nourished later by beautiful yet chilling tracks like ""Traipsing,"" where a faint ghostly melody lingers like the memory of a deceased family member that will not pass, at once disturbing in its insistence and reassuring in its familiarity. But familiarity is not always a good thing. If there's one fault to be found with Clinical Imperfections, it's that bands like Nurse with Wound and SPK have covered similar territory to better effect. Still, Clinical Imperfections is well-executed: ambient music twisted into something alarming by the right interjection at the right moment.","Imagine, if you will, a bright and sunny day.

Edison Woods,Edison Woods,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bc03c0084474cd0c29b6/1:1/w_160/7bab318e.gif,2002-03-28 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2683-edison-woods/,Endearing,"Today's Pitchfork Music History Lesson: A Short History of the E-Bow The e-bow is a small electronic device for playing guitar, and was introduced in 1976, inspired by the mad violin-bowing antics of original Iron Butterfly guitarist Danny Weis. When applied correctly, a sound somewhere between the spacy whistle of a theremin, the slow swell of a guitar looped backward, and that electric violin Poindexter played in Revenge of the Nerds is emitted from the ax of your choice. E-bows have long been a favorite toy of bands from all genres, used by everyone from Radiohead and Built to Spill to Nazareth and Metallica to Flock of Seagulls and Modern English. Now that's diversity. E-bows are one of those musical gadgets cool enough to liven up even the dullest musical product. Case in point: Edison Woods, a Brooklyn quintet (give or take a cello player) whose motto seems to be ""not rocking out is the new rocking out."" Reflecting a galaxy of influences ranging all the way from Low to Low's side projects, Edison Woods subscribes to a musical sensibility some would describe as ""minimalist"" and some others (guess who) would describe as ""boring."" The songs of Julia Frodahl are largely built around a simple acoustic or electric piano riff of four or five notes, cycled over and over and over for the duration. The bass and the drums play similarly non-evolving patterns, blending in with the keys to produce a constant drone throughout most of the eight tracks. Meanwhile, Frodahl's vocal timbre never strays beyond the slowcore standard-issue breathiness, and the background vocals of bassist Alex Emanuel fail to push the band's singing into the complex harmonies of similar acts in this vein. This looks like a job for the e-bow! And a fella named Joe Mendelson is happy to oblige, layering his device's astral sounds over and above otherwise languid tracks with poetry slam titles like ""Dream of Things"" and ""Fear and Yearn."" With his contributions, ""Vivian"" builds to a washed-out climax like a low-budget approximation of Sigur R√≥s, who, incidentally, prefer to bow their guitars the traditional way. Later, Mendelson squeezes out soft tones from his guitar that make the coda for ""Lullabies and Goodbyes"" sound like Brian Eno submerged in goo-- it's the one moment on the album where the calculated quietude becomes dense, interesting ambient ambiance. Taken together, these cuts serve as an excellent demonstration of proper e-bow usage, flavoring the songs around it with an otherworldly texture. 'Tis sad then, that Mendelson's deft handling of the device is surrounded by the pedestrian stylings of Edison Woods; even my low-bpm-loving roommate found the majority of the album to be a snooze with its piano and cello set pieces like ""Winterlude."" With luck, Edison Woods will trade Mendelson to a better band for draft choices and cash before the deadline, and the e-bow will find a home more worthy of its technological brilliance.","Today's Pitchfork Music History Lesson: A Short History of the E-Bow

Beautysleep,Tanya Donelly,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9f49d034d5c69bf5344/1:1/w_160/59bff08a.jpg,2002-03-27 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2417-beautysleep/,4AD,"Tanya Donelly has many talents, but first and foremost, she's a beautiful singer. And there are times on her new album when all you really hear is that voice. The album's first single, ""The Storm,"" may be her best ever vocal performance: the lines unfold like a bridge spanning a river. Majestic yet varied, she can sound so real-- a stark jolt, a breathy pause-- that the high points become that much more angelic. And she still writes those weird but powerful lyrics: ""You have carbonated my bloodstream"" is freakishly romantic, followed by the strength in vulnerability of ""when I stumble, it will be under your spell""-- the chorus then yielding to a stretched note that drifts like clouds on a cold Halloween night. There is a band on this album, but it's just an expensive, perfect frame that you put around the picture-- it's best when least noticed. And that's one of the problems with Beautysleep. Five years have passed since Donelly's last album-- the poppier but less consistent Lovesongs for Underdogs-- and she has put down her guitar for now, leaving almost all axe duties to her husband Dean Fisher. Fisher and the others are like studio session players for a country singer: simpatico but anonymous. There are nice touches to the album's sound, like the perfectly moody organ on ""Life Is But a Dream."" But I had to look at the liner notes to find out that the deep voice shadowing ""Moonbeam Monkey"" belongs to the late, great Mark Sandman from Morphine. This duet between Boston's greatest high and low voices is a milestone, but it would be nice if Sandman were easier to hear. Donelly gives us some menacing and bizarre songs, such as ""Moonbeam Monkey"" or ""Wrap-Around Skirt""-- ""This world is a fickle young girl/ It's high time we married her off/ How about to gassy old Jupiter."" Sure, why not? But at its least energetic, it falls into ""adult alternative"" territory: it's not background music, but it could be treated that way. Donelly is extremely, consistently happy on Beautysleep, and it may take a few listens to single out and sink into ""Another Moment,"" or the erotic home and hearth (and killer chorus) of ""The Wave""; and while ""Keeping You"" is a strong single, it feels like another victory lap on an album that already has several. The joy of domesticity warms some great moments: that opening heartbeat that reminds us of Donelly's motherhood, or the assurance of ""The Night You Saved My Life"": ""Now I sit with my babe at my breast/ I was never this good at my best/ Never higher."" But by the third or fourth ballad, she's made her point. Part of me misses her guitarwork. But I can accept that the album has a calmer sound-- and anyway, so few of you bought Belly's criminally underrecognized second album, King, that you can grab it now and compensate for Beautysleep's lack of hypercatchy pop gems (though ""The Night You Saved My Life"" is a hard one to resist). Her decision not to rock doesn't mark this album down: Beautysleep's weakness is that so many songs are pretty instead of awe-inspiring-- that she gives us only a little greatness. That naked, breathless intimacy on ""The Storm""-- as she reaches for the words ""can it be...""-- is unbelievably gorgeous. In those moments, it's clear that she has elevated herself to a new stage of her career. If only this album could consist only of those moments.","Tanya Donelly has many talents, but first and foremost, she's a beautiful singer. And there are times on her ...

Further Reminders,Two Lone Swordsmen,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a8555e6ef959693211ae/1:1/w_160/7c4c2673.jpg,2002-03-27 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8225-further-reminders/,Warp,"Following the deserved attention of their great album Tiny Reminders, Two Lone Swordsman followed last year with the obligatory remix collection. Credit is due for avoiding calling on a diverse cast, mostly of relative unknowns, who take liberties with the source material. Some tracks here incorporate guitar and vocals, while others push the neo-electro of Tiny Reminders into hardcore glitch territory, and there's a lot of room between those two poles. Four tracks in particular stand out from the rest of Further Reminders because they take a small dollop of the original album and place it in a traditional instrumental setting, essentially creating a new song with faint echoes of Two Lone Swordsman intact. Two separate versions of ""Tiny Reminder No. 1"" by C-Pij (isn't this a label and not a band?) start and end the record. The first take assembles the digital gurgles of the original track, while C-Pij add a fingerpicked acoustic guitar, organ, and assorted keyboards to create a moving little track that almost seems like latter-era Swans. The track is enhanced further on the C-Pij ""vocal mix"" that closes the album, as the same instrumental backing is used behind a singer who sounds a bit like Hope Sandoval. Morr Music faves Lali Puna take ""It's Not the Worst I've Looked... Just the Most I've Ever Cared"" (a track that was pretty close to rock in its original incarnation), dress it up with vocals and some ghostly organ drones, and manage to improve the track immensely. Calexico's remix of ""Tiny Reminder No. 3"" takes the low-level static of the original and weaves it into a new composition in their usual style, with a muted trumpet, some nylon-stringed guitars, and loose drumming. Though the attempt at fusion is commendable, the result sounds half-assed, like Calexico merely dubbed part of the song into a pre-rehearsal warm-up jam. Once you get past the band tracks, which are a mixed bag but nonetheless all a bit unusual, the rest of Tiny Reminders feels very familiar. As is often the case on remix records, one of the highlights turns out to be by the artists themselves. This Two Lone Swordsman version of ""Rotting Hill Carnival"" is a clever inversion of the peppy original, moving the focus away from the busy snares to the bottom end and transforming the electro-pop sheen into bare-bones techno. Cause takes an even more floor-friendly approach to the track, adding some house spicing to the skeletal sources. My favorite of the more standard electronic remixes is the Dry & Heavy remix of ""Neuflex,"" which also happened to be my favorite track on Tiny Reminders. The slow reggae rhythm has a stiff but earnest gait that reminds me of Ras Command, and the dub processing of the original's unforgettable sequencer riff blends nicely into this spliffed-out space. But even as remix records go, Further Reminders is a bit of a disappointment. Part of it could have to do with just how much I enjoyed both the tracks and the sequencing of the original release. Hearing them picked apart and haphazardly scattered like this is disconcerting. But the real problem is that there are so few standouts. Serious fans will need Further Reminders, of course, but more casual listeners would be better served by a deeper dig into the Two Lone Swordsman back catalog.","Following the deserved attention of their great album Tiny Reminders, Two Lone Swordsman followed last year with the obligatory remix ...

Heart and Crime,Julie Doiron,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9e95e6ef95969322a93/1:1/w_160/a72eb603.jpg,2002-03-27 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2405-heart-and-crime/,Jagjaguwar,"I do not speak French. At some point in time, just prior to a trip to Paris, I managed to learn enough garbled individual phrases to order food, get the check, and ask for the bathroom. Embarrassed at my lack of linguistic skill, I spent most of my trip to France a deaf-mute. Since then, Francophone friends have put forth considerable effort into my mastery of the tongue, but all was largely for naught. I remain a linguistic idiot, confined to English and occasional vague memories of high school Latin class. So, for me, a new Julie Doiron album in English is a good thing. Despite the ethereal beauty of Desormais, I could never shrug off the feeling that certain things were lost in translation. Doiron's music is painfully intimate, and the distance invoked by the language barrier almost made me feel like I didn't deserve to hear what she had to say. Heart and Crime now falls immediately on the heels of Desormais. And like its predecessor it relies heavily on a spare finger-picked style, adding little instrumentation aside from Doiron's vocals, her guitar, and an occasional burst of trumpet, piano, organ or drums. What separates Doiron from Chan Marshall, Edith Frost, and other such sad chanteuses, is not easy to express. It has to do with the way Doiron breaks down barriers between listeners and herself. In part, this results from the warmth of her vocal quality, assisted by a clever recording style which creates the illusion that Doiron is literally murmuring into your ear. This mode lends credibility to lines like the ones in ""Sending the Photograph,"" when she refrains with, ""He's the best thing to happen to me/ And I'm the best thing for him."" An unremarkable lyric on paper, sure, but there is conviction in Doiron's voice-- enough to make you believe that she believes, whether or not the song is fiction or based on life experience. And it gains greater weight with the sincerity and deftness of her musical accompaniment. The album maintains a tenuous relationship to chamber-pop in its occasional integration of jazzy instrumentation. The lone trumpet line in ""Shivers"" complements the union between Doiron's muted guitar style and her vocal technique, evoking a more sophisticated uptown sound. And though the sparseness is affecting, most of the best tracks on this album feature small doses of other instruments, whether it's the piano on ""The Surgery Is Over"" or the harmonica in ""All Their Broken Hearts."" Heart and Crime is pretty sensual stuff. Too sad, perhaps, to qualify as ""sexy,"" but ideal for solitude. There's something comfortable about this album-- slow and soft and effortlessly listenable. Perhaps it's that Doiron never sounds as if she's got anything to prove. No textbook studies of morbid depression and incipient madness, no moments of screaming catharsis. And it's good to know that singer/songwriters can still maintain that sort of no-frills approach without string sections and concept album style narrative. If nothing else, this is a significant measure of her skill. That being said, I'm not predisposed to distrusting mellow music, and the relative simplicity is an undeniable asset. But this is not an album that will grab you in a roomful of people. Doiron provides the listener with a fair amount of created mood and atmosphere, but there's not a lot of variation song to song. She lets you in immediately, but it's your responsibility to listen closely to what she has to say. And this could become pleasant background noise with the slightest amount of effort. That all the songs maintain roughly the same tempo and almost the same key is even more noticeable on the second half of the album, which starts to drag a bit somewhere around ""Who Will Be the One,"" a guitar-and-voice-only track. This precedes two others, ""The One You Love"" and the (ironically?) titled ""I Love to Dance,"" which sound strikingly similar. Heart and Crime works particularly well as an English companion piece to Desormais. The closeness of the release dates and the overall similarities between the two albums seem hardly coincidental. But, linguistic challenges aside, Heart and Crime doesn't improve much upon its predecessor, and I wonder if it would have achieved greater effect as the second half of a double album. Idle speculation, perhaps. Or a more polite way of saying, ""Good, but not quite as good as I wanted it to be.""","I do not speak French.

Words of Wisdom and Hope,Jad FairTeenage Fanclub,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a744ea9e61561daa554a/1:1/w_160/d5ba9442.jpg,2002-03-27 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7954-words-of-wisdom-and-hope/,Alternative Tentacles,"""I'd let Godzilla step on my head
And I'd let a mummy chase me around and throw me in a dungeon
I'd let space aliens perform an autopsy on me
If I could just be near to you I'd let Dracula drink my blood
I'd let a zombie eat my arm
I'd let a Frankenstein punch me in the stomach
Just if I could be."" --Jad Fair, ""Near to You"" Man, that's devotion. Jad Fair wants to be near you so badly he'd undergo just about any hardship the universe could throw at him to make it happen. I guess the only question remaining would be this: would you want Jad Fair to be that near to you? Your answer is likely to vary based on your point of view. Words of Wisdom and Hope is one of those records that just begs questions about its intent. This is due entirely to Jad Fair's presence, as Teenage Fanclub's musical contributions can practically be viewed as a separate artistic entity from Fair's geeky rambling. Still, the questions are there: is this brilliance or ignorance? Na√Øvet√© or irony? Transcendent or annoying as hell? Once again, your answer is likely to vary based on how you view music like this. Of course, this is nothing new where Jad Fair is concerned. Over the course of around 40 albums-- many recorded with his band Half Japanese-- Fair has constantly reveled in his own lack of conventional musical skill and consistently begged these sorts of questions. Many have come to revere him as an iconoclastically charming artist or even a sort of outsider artist, while just as many really can't stand the guy. So here's where being a record reviewer becomes especially difficult. It's supposed to be up to me to figure out the answers to those three questions I asked earlier, and I'm finding that I really don't know any of them for sure. It does seem obvious enough that Fair is no idiot, and he must have some concept of just how hokey his delivery and words are, but it seems just as obvious that he doesn't care one way or the other. So, in lieu of a real solution, let me say this: people who already like Fair will likely enjoy this, as will people who revel in impromptu-sounding performance and unabashed sentimentalism. And just as many others will hate it outright. To figure out which camp you're in, perhaps a bit of dry objective description will help. Fair's delivery on this album's twelve tracks is entirely spoken, mostly in a dry, subdued Mr. Rogers tone, though he occasionally offers a little coo or tiger growl to drive home how in love he is with his anonymous subject. He never gets melodic, he only rarely tailors his rhythm to the music, and he frequently sounds like he's having a one-sided conversation with a soundtrack in the background. The subjective description: Fair's straightforwardness is occasionally refreshing, and many of his quirky observations are quite charming, but more often they're irritating and cloyingly cute. Whether or not he's being ironic or na√Øve ceases to become important after a while, because most listeners will be utterly sick of listening to him by the time the album is halfway over. Consider the following lines: ""Early in the morning. No chance of robot uprising. Look what the sunshine brings. It's a brand new day."" --""I Feel Fine"" ""My heart is literally jumping like a kangaroo. I mean, not literally, but poetically. I mean... well, you know what I mean."" --""The Power of Your Tenderness"" ""I want to be your Superman. I would not be satisfied being your Batman or your Aquaman. No. I want the very best."" --""Cupid"" These are three of Fair's more amusing observations, though even the funniest moments in his monologues are probably best described by one of his past album titles: somewhat humorous. Often, he finds himself talking with nothing to say, but he invariably keeps talking anyway. The pun on the title ""You Rock"" of ""you came along when I had nothing and gave me a rock"" gets hard to swallow after he's already said it a couple of times, especially when he follows it by mumbling ""rock solid love."" On the other side of the coin is Teenage Fanclub, fresh off the U.S. release of their sixth album, Howdy! The band offers up a batch of instrumentals for Fair to talk over that draws from every one of their past periods, from the fuzzy rock of their earliest records, to the country flavors of Songs from Northern Britain. The highlight for both the band and Fair is probably ""Near to You,"" for which the band offers up an alternately jangly and fuzzy stomp that propels Fair's rambling perfectly. Nearly as successful is ""Love's Taken Over,"" wherein Fair actually almost sings (without ever actually getting there) and the band's blend of uplifting harmonies, bells and delayed snare drums proves one of the most interesting textures they've ever come up with. The album's other major musical peak comes with the seven-minute ""Crush on You."" Though the song is undoubtedly far too long, the band offers up a spontaneous-sounding jam that somewhat makes up for it. Opener ""Behold the Miracle"" is also brimming with fine organ work and an excellent bassline. Elsewhere, the band doesn't seem to have as many ideas. As a result, ""The Power of Your Tenderness"" is overly repetitive, while ""Vampire's Claw"" benefits from some pretty banjo and fiddle, but ultimately doesn't go much of anywhere musically. ""Secret Heart"" attempts funk, but never gets propulsive enough to truly achieve it. Okay, so if I've done my job, you now have at least some idea of what to expect from this album. In the end, I think a straight five is the only rating that's really appropriate for a release like this. Chances are that when you hear it, you'll either fall in love or hate it. As for me, I don't think I'll be listening to it again for a long time. Rather, it's the kind of record I'll be filing away and pulling out now and then when I feel like springing something truly odd on my unsuspecting friends. The nutshell: proceed with caution.","""I'd let Godzilla step on my head

But Iron Flag gives me an approach: it's the most solid Wu album in years. I guess the Clan wanted to slice through rumors that they were falling off, because they holed up at the Wu mansion and punched out twelve solid cuts. First they feint with ""In the Hood,"" for once an intro that's listenable. It's RZA's panoramic sweep from freestyle diss to jump-up anthem, with brass blasting and glocks clicking in the background. Then the segue to ""Rules,"" which opens with Ghostface Killah just like on 36 Chambers. Piano jabs keep a tight rhythm as he belts, ""Who the fuck knocked our buildings down/ Who the man behind the World Trade massacres, step up now!"" Ghost gets his in, but of course Method Man gets more, taunting, ""Who y'all kiddin'? Tryin' to act like my shoe fittin'/ Confused with your head up your ass like who's shittin'?"" Still, it's weird to hear him up in the chorus asking, ""How the fuck did we get so cool, man?"" We know it, Meth, you don't gotta say it. But it's obvious the Wu wanted the sharpest tongues in the front because he's all over Iron Flag, as are Ghost, Raekwon and a surprisingly on-point Inspecta Deck. On the opposite, Ol' Dirty Bastard's conspicuously absent, doing time for crack possession and fleeing probation. If anything, the Clan's more cohesive without the presence of that chaotic God. They're all in together now on ""Uzi (Pinky Ring),"" the prototype single where every head gets a verse. The RZA's clearly on to some old-school flavor, and it's a lovely thing because it makes each song perfect for cruising. There's horn samples lacing most tracks, bringing an upbeat, playful vibe-- despite the dirges, Rakeem knows how to have a good time. ""Chrome Wheels"" drops these nasty mechanical squiggles that combine and interlock with bumping bass. I thought I'd dread the day that divas came to the Wu, but Madame D begs, ""Bang us in your cars, bang us in your Jeeps, bang that shit retarded,"" and it's far from R&B; (""Rapping Bullshit,"" per RZA parlance). Even the tracks he farms out to Wu-Tang Incorp. affiliates thump hard. ""One of These Days"" rolls on funk guitars and a blunt beat courtesy of Nick ""Fury"" Loftin; the southern-playa-listic Cadillac music keeps U-God from ruining it when he's mumbling about being ""so unique"" and then wanting out of the Clan (?!). But U-God redeems with his verse on ""Soul Power,"" where he sketches the best vignette: ""Crack a Coca-Cola, summer heat was my boredom/ Dr. J before Jordan, Al Green on the organ."" Flavor Flav provides the shout-out chorus, and he's kidding around with Meth at the end, talking about family in Long Island. Lyrically the Wu are much more earthy on Iron Flag-- maybe the ""thousand-dollar lesbians"" weren't catching many fans? Likewise, there's about five percent of the Five Percent, though GZA of course drops his characteristic science. You don't get much introspection, just grandstanding like on ""Y'all Been Warned,"" where RZA digs, ""You can't Etch-a-Sketch all my rhyme threat/ Try to bite my flow, you catch ya throat step."" The only time they return to the languorous street noir of tracks like ""C.R.E.A.M."" is on ""Babies,"" a grim Raekwon/Ghostface tale about a crooked cop. The title track is the lone downtempo diversion. The needle scratches and the synths blow like wind before the music descends into ""The Glock,"" a subsection with little more than a percussion loop rumbling and the Clan gathered round shouting into the mic. It comes across real cold, but then ""Dashing"" ends the album with Deck singing nursery rhymes; GZA leaves behind a smooth verse James Bond-style before he disappears. With all the catchy choruses, each song on Iron Flag hits like another single to be released. The kung-fu samples are back, Masta Killa's still trying to carve out a name for himself, and the Wu prove they never need guests like Snoop or Isaac Hayes to throw down a strong joint. It's an album about brotherhood, fueled by the national war but no doubt sparked on a more personal level. As Method Man deadpans on ""Uzi,"" ""Give you the same advice that I gave my wife: don't fuck with mine."" Damn.","How the hell do you cover the Wu-Tang Clan?

Live in Liverpool,Echo and the Bunnymen,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1529d034d5c69bf2926/1:1/w_160/80de2a03.jpg,2002-03-26 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2668-live-in-liverpool/,spinART,"I'm going to open this review by admitting in no uncertain terms that, by and large, I am biased against live albums. I like going to shows and experiencing music live, but hearing that same experience on a disc loses something in the translation for me. I should mention that I'm talking about rock and pop live albums-- obviously, styles like jazz rely on the spontaneity of a live performance to be effective; even most jazz studio albums are performed in live takes. Maybe it's just my love of production and the completeness that truly great studio records have, or the fact that a lot of bands don't do much to distance their performances from the studio versions of their songs, but live albums usually go back on the shelf after one or two listens, never to be heard from again in my house. I'm not sure if I'd call this Echo and the Bunnymen live record an exception to that rule-- I definitely enjoy their studio material more-- but I can say that I've been spinning Live in Liverpool on a pretty regular basis since it arrived in the mail, and as live albums go, it's a pretty impressive showing. Now a duo consisting of Ian McCulloch and Will Sergeant, the Bunnymen have assembled an able, muscular backing band and chosen a set list that gathers songs from throughout their career for what amounts essentially to a fantastic live career retrospective. Most of the versions presented by the band here faithfully recall the songs' original incarnations, and longtime fans should be more than pleased with what they hear. Echo and the Bunnymen are one of only a handful of older bands out there who haven't really lost any of their vitality, and these performances bristle with the enthusiasm and energy of a much younger band. When the guys dip into their post-reunion catalog, it often sounds a great deal more charged than those songs' studio counterparts. That's especially true of the three tracks taken from last year's Flowers, an album that saw them returning to their dark post-punk roots. They take ""Eternity Turns"" at breakneck speed, but McCulloch's voice is clear and even throughout the song, and Sergeant's heavily effected guitar work is simply sterling. ""King of Kings"" is even more psychedelicized here than on the album, with Sergeant throwing up scudding clouds of guitar to offset McCulloch and the band's stable delivery. The band also tackles ""Buried Alive"" and ""Supermellow Man"" from that album in spirited versions that rival the originals in terms of sheer charisma. Aside from a somewhat lackluster rendition of ""Nothing Lasts Forever,"" from 1997's Evergreen, the band sticks to some of the best songs of their 80s heyday, drawing at least one from every album they released in their original incarnation as a quartet. Expectedly, ""Ocean Rain"" figures the most prominently, with fully amped versions of ""Seven Seas"" and ""My Kingdom"" and a propulsive reading of ""The Killing Moon"" confirming that album's timelessness. The slow take on ""Ocean Rain"" that closes the album is unfortunately less than exciting, but well delivered nonetheless. The two biggest highlights of the album both reach back to the band's 1979 debut, Crocodiles. The band rips and snorts its way through ""All That Jazz"" with both Sergeant and McCulloch tearing into their guitars while some hired heads bash out the rhythmic backing with abandon. ""Rescue"" opens things in a similarly pounding fashion, and the cheering audience knows exactly what to expect when Sergeant lays into the massive guitar lick that kicks the song off. McCulloch's voice warms into the song a bit, but by the end, he's belting out the words as loudly as ever. Another early peak is the single ""Never Stop,"" a song that never made its way onto any of the band's proper albums, but proves to be one of their best with its loose, Police-y groove and sweeping chorus. Live in Liverpool's climax comes with ""Zimbo,"" a retitled version of ""All My Colours"" from the band's sophomore effort, Heaven Up Here. This is one of the few songs that's actually significantly rearranged, but the band nonetheless manages to capture the apocalyptic slow burn of the original. Admirably, the band have chosen to include two versions of songs from 1983's trippy, experimental Porcupine, which is widely regarded as their most difficult record (it's also one of their best). The version of ""Back of Love"" is amazing, bursting with post-punk fury and Sergeant's gravity-defying guitar playing. ""The Cutter,"" though not quite as frantic, reads similarly well, as McCulloch's vocals are at their best, booming on the tense chorus and cutting straight through Sergeant's spastic outbursts with ease. So, in the end, there's not a whole lot to complain about on this disc. The performances are uniformly great, the set list draws on a lot of their best material, and the recording is crystal clear (though occasionally there's a bit of hiss from the crowd microphone). I suppose it would have been nicer if the album was all taken from a single performance-- the tracks are selected from two August 2001 shows at the Liverpool Institute for the Performing Arts' Paul McCartney Auditorium-- as it's nice to hear live recordings in the context of one complete show. But that's a minor gripe. The band manage a strong consistency of mood and performance acumen, which is what's really important when you're listening at home. Suffice to say, fans of Echo and the Bunnymen should check this out-- it will not disappoint. As for neophytes, I suppose it depends largely on how biased you are for or against live albums. If you're an audiophile or an album person, you may want to start with Ocean Rain or Crocodiles, but if you're just looking for a good overview of the band's career and some strong performances, this could be the place. Either way, Live in Liverpool is one of those rare live albums that keeps me coming back, and there's a lot to be said for that.","I'm going to open this review by admitting in no uncertain terms that, by and large, I am biased ...

Rhythm of Snow,Yagya,by: Paul Cooper,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ab169d034d5c69bf3f6d/1:1/w_160/2a44839d.jpg,2002-03-26 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8895-rhythm-of-snow/,Force Inc,"The subhead to Rhythm of Snow would read, ""Computer science student de-nerds himself."" By day Aalsteinn Gumundsson (for Yagya is he) taps away at code and virtual logic gates. But by night, he and his computers attempt to ""reflect the beauty of the world."" And I hear tell that there's a lot of beauty up there in Iceland. It snows a lot and there's plenty of precipitation and wind. Not everyone finds such things beautiful, though there is something inviting in Gumundsson's drony representation of drizzle, sleet, and ice. But I have to break up my lovefest because, while nice enough in exectuion, Rhythm of Snow is an imitation (albeit a faultless one) of Wolfgang Voigt's Gas project. Both Voigt and Gumundsson expertly arrange natural ambient sounds (wind, rustling leaves, rain) and weave dulcet melodies through nature's soft white noise. Gumundsson has divided the seventy-eight minutes of Rhythm of Snow into ten sections, all titled ""Snowflake."" While I'm uneasy about a rain shower being called a snowflake (a rain shower is the central motif of multiple ""Snowflake[s]"") the fact that Gumundsson has titled his tracks identically is fitting, because they pretty much are identical, apart from microscopic differences in size and shape. ""Snowflake 8"" pushes the rain shower sounds of ""Snowflake 7"" further back in the mix and brings forward a Rhythm and Sound digital skank. ""Snowflake 4"" incorporates micro-house clicks and hiss but backs them up with a formidable warping groove that Detroit's Ion would badmouth DJ Assault's ghetto-tech for. The most dynamic of the snowflakes, ""Snowflake 5,"" bears a deep house bassline that sustains the same Mellotron ""aahs"" that the Orb used at the beginning of ""A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain."" ""Snowflake 6"" pads out nine minutes with cricket chirrups and a dulled kickdrum for low-end action. ""Snowflake 9"" is much more lugubrious, all but discarding the kickdrum that sounds increasingly redundant as the album progresses. Much of Rhythm of Snow is interchangeable. Gumundsson shows that he can riff on other musicians' themes. But if you're in the right mood (whether pharmaceutically, or whether your brainwaves are flattening out in preparedness to slip into the arms of Morpheus), you can't beat this stuff. At seventy-eight minutes, even the most cranked-up speed-freak would be lulled into the realm of dreams. However, judged only by Rhythm of Snow, Gumundsson certainly hasn't exhibited the range of style that Wolfgang Voigt has shown. As well as this type of soft beat, Voigt has produced crazy acid, house, and synth homages to Marc Bolan. Rhythm of Snow is as a commendable a starting place as any, but Gumundsson will have to release very different, original material if he's not going to melt swiftly away from collective memory.","The subhead to Rhythm of Snow would read, ""Computer science student de-nerds himself.""

When We Were Small,Rosie Thomas,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a786c0084474cd0c0bea/1:1/w_160/fa1985f2.jpg,2002-03-26 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8020-when-we-were-small/,Sub Pop,"Every review I've read of Rosie Thomas-- of anything she does-- makes sure to mention her stand-up alter-ego, Sheila, an extremely self-conscious social outcast who wears coke-bottle glasses and a neckbrace. Some are thrown off by the comedy act, especially juxtaposed with Rosie's otherwise earnest and passionate stage show. But me, I find it adorable. In all honesty, I find Rosie Thomas adorable. I get a tingle just thinking of her. Rosie, if you're out there, I love you. Now make me babies. Have I said too much? Okay, since the cat's out of the bag, I'll just admit it. At 25 years of age, I have a crush on someone I've never met (although Rosie must share my affections: I also have a non-sexual man-crush on Brad Pitt). Rosie won me over at a concert last fall, when all I knew of the young songstress was that she'd made a cameo appearance on Damien Jurado's ""Parking Lot"" (off Ghost of David). I didn't like the tune that much, but recognizing her association with Jurado's low-key, honest folk-pop, I felt I couldn't lose. In the final analysis, I lost two things: jack and shit. The show was amazing, really, a reminder that some indie rockers can actually sing. Rosie's voice is stunning-- a delicate timbre, a beautiful hushed passion, with the requisite lung-power when she needs to drive home a melody. If singing range were a climbing rope, Rosie would ring the bell, and ring it often. To hit the high notes, Thomas employs a gorgeous (and apparent) transition to falsetto. You can tell she likes that shift, and the falsetto itself, as a number of the tunes on her album make that vocal acrobatic a prominent part of the melody (e.g. ""Lorraine""). Moreover, in concert, Thomas obviously had a keen sense of dynamics-- during the quieter moments it became clear that, except for Thomas, the venue was in utter silence, captivated. Until she releases another album, however, I must romanticize my love for Rosie. The soundtrack to my dreams will encompass only a few of the songs on When We Were Small, notably ""Farewell"" and ""Bicycle Tricycle,"" the most sparse and fragile. I like to imagine Rosie alone on stage with a piano, a guitar, and otherwise utter silence. Her sparse compositions reveal a stunning vulnerability, her voice allowed the full measure of its expressiveness. An album with ten tracks of that sort of pure, barren indie-folk would be spellbinding. It's not unfortunate so much as it is just a fact, but much of the rest of the album is more pedestrian, weighing in with melodies and compositions that tend towards the ""pop"" end of the folk-pop spectrum. Like ""Finish Line,"" for example, which harks of Sarah McLachlan, or the darker ""I Run,"" which features a hackneyed melody and orchestration that fails to sell the mood (not to mention that the repeated lyrics ""I run far from you"" are a tad weak). None of it ramps up the tempo much, or adds density to the mix-- it's not bad stuff, just somewhat unexceptional. There are some who will fall in love with this album. Others will fall asleep to it. Both will agree that it's a solid debut, long on talent but maybe a bit short on melody or lacking in appropriate production. I had big expectations, some of which were met, but others of which were disappointed. Nonetheless, I remain devoted. Now make me babies.","Every review I've read of Rosie Thomas-- of anything she does-- makes sure to mention her stand-up alter-ego, Sheila ...

In Search of...,N.E.R.D.,by: Michael Bernstein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3ca69fc7814a47cd723/1:1/w_160/5b13d6ff.jpg,2002-03-25 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5748-in-search-of/,Virgin,"Hip-hop relies heavily on the foundation created by the dichotomy of repetition and novelty. This takes many forms, from the struggle of producers wishing to maintain a semblance of recognition for utilizing old-school techniques, to the desire of new MCs to push the boundaries of lyrical delivery. Recently, this shifting between repetition and novelty has reached a manic pace, to the point where it seems essential fare for a producer to shout over a track or re-use bass sounds and drum patterns to emphasize their signature. In the advertising world, it's called ""branding."" The Neptunes are the reigning kings of beat-branding. Throughout their best-known tracks-- from ""Superthug"" to ""Southern Hospitality""-- some elements have remained more or less constant: the bass sound, a gritty, ultimately recyclable sample, and the off-time kick/snare combination that seemed revitalize hip-hop for a minute. But that minute has lasted two years, and the same sounds now cross the board from Britney Spears to Limp Bizkit. Shit is getting ugly, and N.E.R.D. is the truest testament to this fact. Quoth the Neptunes: ""In Search Of... seems like a bland title, but for us, it's In search of love. In search of happiness. In search of smiling. In search of that bitch with the big ass. In search of the answer to why my brother smokes crack. It's all of that; it's about being open."" In Search Of... joins Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo (the Neptunes) with hometown friend Shay. (That hometown, incidentally, is the same Virginia area that brought up Timbaland, Missy Elliott, and Teddy Riley.) This album conceivably brings the group back to their ""roots,"" which, in a letter written by Pharrell on the group's website, heavily emphasizes the AC/DC side of things. The album has had a relatively tumultuous history-- especially over the last few months-- with a domestic release date pushed back by the Neptunes' decision to re-record the album with the help of some live instrumentation. Over a year ago, the original version of the album was released and garnered exactly no glowing reviews (with the exception of a positive write-up in Rolling Stone). Whether or not this was the incentive for the group to re-record is unclear. The result, however, is an album's worth of hot-to-death Neptunes hooks and bass sounds tainted with the despicable addition of rap-metal drumming and distorted guitar posturing. To backtrack a bit, when the ""original"" album came out about a year ago, the first single was the ""BET Uncut Video""-worthy ""Lapdance,"" which promised to fulfill Pharrell's promised prophecies of hip-hop as revolution via chorus lines like, ""The politicians are lookin' like to strippers to me."" See, Pharrell has been talking a lot of shit since the Neptunes began to get some serious props, stressing that doing a beat for Jay-Z was a way of ""getting their message out"" to the masses. But somewhere between ""I Jus Wanna Luv U"" and ""Pass the Courvoisier,"" signals got crossed. Pharrell, Chad and Shay took the drum tracks off most of the album, and added a drummer who could easily have cut his teeth in a Slipknot cover band. While Rap-Metal 101 drums bang away in the background, the basslines are replaced by chugging guitar riffs reminiscent of your high school hardcore band. What remains, though, is the exceptional quality of Pharrell's voice, which, unlike the bass sound, doesn't lose its intensity due to repeated radio exposure. The lyrics here are mostly decent, too, with the exception of ""Brain,"" which, before it was re-recorded sounded clever, and now sounds like a frat house anthem. ""Provider"" hints at the fact that were Pharrell and Chad born twelve years ago, they'd be bumping this album along with Kid Rock's Cocky. One of the greatest benefits of being multi-million dollar producers is having access to recording equipment that will make your sounds even more super-flawless. This, coupled with the Neptunes' five years of hitmaking experience, make for a ""well-produced"" album, which generally doesn't mean shit to me. Chalk it up to an oversight on the part of N.E.R.D. And their acronym speaks the truth, and No one Ever Really Dies, maybe we'll get our hands on a third, less compromised version of the album, where the drummer has been fired and the guitar is being used to prop up the reconstituted drum machines.","Hip-hop relies heavily on the foundation created by the dichotomy of repetition and novelty.

The Worst You Can Do Is Harm,The Long Winters,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd49ea9e61561daa7692/1:1/w_160/39c9528a.jpg,2002-03-25 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4843-the-worst-you-can-do-is-harm/,Barsuk,"WASHINGTON-- In a stunning move reflecting yet another shift in our nation's defense strategy, the Pentagon today unveiled plans to resuscitate a controversial weapons project that has been neglected for over a decade. ""Ladies and gentleman, tomorrow's battles will not be fought on the ground, in the air, or even under the water, but will require entirely new military technology to be developed,"" Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld announced in a press conference this morning. ""To defend ourselves from the increasingly powerful forces of terrorism worldwide, we must turn to one of our country's most valuable resources: the supergroup."" The American supergroup arsenal has been steadily dwindling in power since the late 1960s, when star-studded projects like CSNY and Blind Faith were used as a deterrent in the Cold War with the Soviet Union. Further development of supergroup technology occurred during the Reagan Years, focusing mainly upon the Traveling Wilburys agenda. But recent reports have warned that these weapons lie mostly in a state of disrepair, with the majority of their components dead, fat, and/or balding. As such, the Pentagon has started from scratch by introducing entirely new designs. ""Our first rollout in the new American Supergroup Program is the Long Winters,"" said Nick Person, Director of Supergroup Strategy for the Department of Defense, ""a project being developed at a confidential location somewhere in the Northwestern United States. Many details of this operation are highly classified, but I've been authorized to tell you it centers around singer/songwriter John Roderick, and features members of the Posies, Built to Spill, Sunny Day Real Estate, Fountains of Wayne, and Death Cab for Cutie."" Thomas Zimmermann, founder of the private organization Citizen Supergroup Monitor, notes that the announcement of the Long Winters reflects a profound shift in the military's use of its supergroup resources. ""Recent attempts to develop new supergroup weaponry involved taking musicians from high-profile groups, like the embarrassing failure of the Phish/Primus/Police hybrid, Oysterhead. Researchers found that placing three or more egotistical, renowned musicians in a band creates a volatile mixture prone to excessive noodling and horrendously ineffective songwriting. The Long Winters project, by assembling its components from less popular but critically lauded bands, indicates a new direction for the Supergroup Program."" An anonymous source from inside the Pentagon confirmed this analysis. ""When Canada went public with the New Pornographers last year, it was a big embarrassment for the entire military. We'd always joked about Canada's seemingly negligible supergroup capabilities, laughing at the idea of the Canucks combining Bryan Adams, Celine Dion, and the bassist from Loverboy. But when the Canadians tapped into their surprisingly rich indie rock resources and released Mass Romantic, we were all caught off guard."" Meanwhile, when pressed for information during a Pitchfork interview, Death Cab's Ben Gibbard refused to directly comment on rumors of his involvement in the Long Winters: ""I've never met a lot of those people, we're not comrades or anything, we don't play music together."" Despite this denial, inside sources have confirmed to this reporter that Mr. Gibbard plays drums on the album's radioactively catchy ""Carparts,"" while bandmate Chris Walla lends his quirky production and keyboard skills throughout the album. The Worst You Can Do Is Harm is the name of the debut release from the Long Winters, and we feel it adequately reflects the considerable strengths of this new project,"" Mr. Person explained at today's press conference. ""Rooted in the traditional American country-rock style of Wilco and Clem Snide, developers have also added a glaze of poppy harmonies and synthesizer melodies. With highly infectious songs like 'Government Loans' and 'Scent of Lime,' the album has more than enough firepower to keep the Axis of Evil states in line."" However, some skeptics temper the government's optimism about the Long Winters agenda. ""The album most definitely has its flaws,"" says Mr. Zimmermann. ""Roderick's throaty nicotine vocals really wear thin over the course of ten tracks. 'Medicine Cabinet Pirate' and 'Unsalted Butter' are both good songs that run too long, and, well, 'Samaritan' and 'Copernicus' are just flat out duds. Generally, however, it's a strong first step for the revival of the Supergroup Program. I can't get 'Carparts' out of my frickin' head."" But Zimmermann cautions, ""Technically, the Long Winters are not so much a supergroup as a collection of Roderick's songs recorded with the assistance of his luminous friends in the indie rock world. By unconditionally labeling them a supergroup, it's as if the military were writing a highly conceptual, overly clever record review and needed to fudge the details slightly to make an album fit the idea."" Nevertheless, the American Supergroup Program is once again a top priority of the Pentagon. ""Searches of seized bunkers in Afghanistan show preliminary indications that al Qaeda has been developing their own supergroup, purchasing guitarists and drummers on the black market from former Soviet Republics,"" said Person. ""In response, we are pursuing Dan the Automator for a high-ranking position in the supergroup developmental program, and trying to arrange a resource-sharing coalition with England. By 2003, we project a Thom Yorke/Del tha Funkee Homosapien/Will Oldham assembly will be ready for deployment to armed forces stationed around the world.""","WASHINGTON-- In a stunning move reflecting yet another shift in our nation's defense strategy, the Pentagon today unveiled plans ...

This Is Our Music,Ornette Coleman,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a621ea9e61561daa52d1/1:1/w_160/e2d86aec.gif,2002-03-25 06:00:01,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1544-this-is-our-music/,AtlanticAtlantic,"Ornette Coleman has followed a strange path. Most of the major figures in jazz spent their late teens and early 20s apprenticing with bands led by veterans eager to surround themselves with young players, such as those run by Art Blakey, Dizzy Gillespie, Horace Silver, and Miles Davis. Coleman's early development as a soloist and composer, on the other hand, can only be a matter of speculation. Because Coleman's unusual ideas about music had difficulty finding in a foothold in the post-bop jazz world of the mid-to-late 50s, he had a late start with recording. And so, the first record he appeared on was one issued under his own name: 1958's Something Else! He was 28 at the time. Coleman's debut stands out in his discography not because of its quality, but because the record features a piano. Coleman was a self-taught student of music who entered the arena with a beef against jazz: he felt that chords exerted an undue influence over improvisation and limited a player's expression. Striving to improvise with greater melodic freedom, Coleman ditched the piano for his second album, Tomorrow Is the Question. Signing with Atlantic in 1959, Coleman obtained a higher profile (and generated controversy) with releases including The Shape of Jazz to Come and Change of the Century, all leading up to the 1960 double-quartet release that coined a movement, Free Jazz. Look again at the titles of these early releases: The Shape of Jazz to Come, Change of the Century, Free Jazz. One imagines Coleman as a self-confident visionary aware of his effect on the world of music. The title of this recently reissued album provided a similar challenge to the populace: ""This is our music,"" Coleman might have been saying. ""Are you going to listen?"" Originally released in 1960 (the last Quartet record before the Free Jazz session), This Is Our Music features Coleman on alto, Don Cherry on trumpet, Charlie Haden on bass, and Ed Blackwell on drums. What amazes me about this era of Coleman, especially in light of the literature surrounding it, is how accessible it is. Back in the day, this band had the intelligentsia calling for Coleman to be fitted for a straightjacket, but to one weaned on the 60s Impulse! catalog, the music sounds joyous, pretty, sensible and sane. The uptempo tracks here are teeming with life. On ""Blues Connotation"" and ""Folk Tale"" the band sounds ""in the moment"" and brimming with ideas, as if these four- and five-minute compositions are far too brief to ever contain them all. The sporadic surges in tempo are early experiments in elastic time (a trend that would be explored at great length as the 60s progressed), and these bursts of energy make these pieces seem, well, bountiful. Also adding to the loose sense of fun on tracks like ""Poise"" is the interplay between Coleman and Cherry. At times, they seem to be chasing each other around the tune, while other moments find them doing a modern take on the call-and-response ensemble soling of Dixieland. Despite the occasional rubbery rhythmic passage and playful tone, all the faster pieces here swing in the fullest sense of the word, with Blackwell and Haden's pulse set firmly in the tradition. If the faster tracks on This Is Our Music come across as buoyant and almost pop, the more drawn-out pieces are mysterious and pleasantly disorienting. ""Beauty Is a Rare Thing"" is drifting and impressionistic, with Blackwell's drums and Haden's bowed bass used for color and shading instead of rhythm. Cherry and Coleman's lines are not concerned with melody or even pitch, but manage to find expression in a series of squeaks, groans, and grunts. The Quartet's take on the Gershwin standard ""Embraceable You"" (the only track not composed by Coleman, and indeed the only standard he recorded during this period) is necessarily more conventionally tuneful, but it still moves with a peculiar gait. The theme is familiar, but Blackwell uses mallets for the drums and barely touches the cymbals, and both Cherry and Coleman take serious liberties with the melody. We'll never know what it was like to hear Ornette Coleman in 1959 and 1960, but there's an upside to encountering music stripped of its context. We can just listen and not concern ourselves with determining which rules are being broken. In 1960, people literally wanted to beat the crap out of Ornette Coleman because of what he was doing to jazz. But now, his work just sounds exceptionally fresh and timeless.",,9.4,
Tvi,Yuji Oniki,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9e2c0084474cd0c26ed/1:1/w_160/a45328e6.jpg,2002-03-25 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6008-tvi/,Future Farmer,"How to say this? Yuji Oniki sounds like the male version of Natalie Imbruglia. Now I realize that's a pretty strong thing to say about someone whom most people are unfamiliar with, and because I still have some feeling left for struggling artists, I thought twice about the comparison. Nevertheless, the only other reason I can see not to compare Oniki with the frail adult contemporary demon is that his production isn't quite as good. Also, he doesn't seem to have her knack of sounding tortured and generally malnourished-- so, hopefully he's got health on his side. Man, this is not starting well. Oniki is based in Oakland, California; most of the record was recorded at his house, with a small band. He then sent the tracks all over the place, including to Japan, where Katsui Yuji of Rovo added a little violin, and Sakana's Nishiwaki added some guitar. Next stop for the tapes was Cleveland, where Guided by Voices' Doug Gillard tacked on a couple of guitar solos. Furthermore, Beulah's Bill Swan blew his horn (trumpet) to flesh out some of the arrangements. Initially, this seems to be a neat concept in making a ""solo"" record, because the resulting sound should reflect more than just the idiosyncratic vision of the writer. However, in practice, this is basically just Oniki roping in his favorite session players, which isn't that different from what, say, Donald Fagan does. And what's so great about that? Other than the fact that I'm not terribly fond of the music Oniki brings to mind, the real issue is that I'm not all that fond of Oniki's music. I will say that, as a pop auteur (he wrote, produced and arranged all of the music on Tvi), he gets points for the understated (some might say simple) arrangements, and overwhelmingly straightforward, melodic tunes. We may have seen the last days of pop artists who have ProTools at their fingertips, and yet don't produce whacked-out electronic pieces or acid-damaged Beatles homages. Oniki certainly seems to be aiming for AOR heaven here, and I guess props are in order for him sticking to his guns. So, yeah. Some of the tunes are nice: the opener ""40 Seconds"" is a good showcase for Yuji's sometimes nasal, rarely very expressive, but generally strong tenor. It takes a lazy groove, and adds a pinch of spacy reverb, distant violin, and some acoustic guitar, making for a pleasant, dreamy backdrop. ""Skeleton Station"" is a short, piano instrumental, and a very nice accompaniment to staring out the window into the rain. ""Reminders"" is something of a torch song, with a brooding chord progression and a relatively expansive arrangement (mellotron strings, soaring background vocals, shimmering electric guitar) that actually turns the tune into something like the younger cousin of Blur's ""Universal."" However, the majority of music on Tvi isn't that distinct: the low-key drama of ""One Bright Summer Day,"" with an energy level that stays constant (approaching comatose) for far too long; the upbeat ""Transport,"" with its perky college beat and peppy ""ba-da-bop"" backing vocals, threatens to dethrone the Rembrandts as the kings of annoyingly passive pop; ""Between Beds and Clocks"" is almost as cute as Imbruglia, but then again, Oniki's not a hot ex-soap star, so there shouldn't be any way he gets away with being this twee. If light, faintly emotional pop is your thing, by all means check this record out. I could see it appealing to the over-stressed, no-time-for-noise crowd, but even then, I'd take something tougher-- I hear Kylie Minogue is back.","How to say this?

Inside Views,Circulatory System,by: Matt LeMay,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a5d95e6ef95969320bd1/1:1/w_160/a83ea01a.gif,2002-03-24 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1477-inside-views/,Cloud,"Of all the complaints levied by vinyl purists, the only one I've ever really given much credence to is the fact that compact discs essentially suck as artifacts. A limited-pressing seven-inch, a dusty old slab of vinyl-- these are the kind of relics that can be treasured for ages, and can provide that sorely missed goofy fanboy sense of connection with an artist. CDs, on the other hand, reek of mass production. Not only is the packaging all secured behind flimsy plastic, but the music itself can be reproduced infinitely without any change in quality. Though it's handy, bite-sized, and generally convenient, a CD generally doesn't leave you with the sense that it's a precious artifact-- a gift straight from the artist to you to be appreciated for years to come. But Will Cullen Hart (along with a number of other experimental weirdos like Jackie-O Motherfucker and Acid Mothers Temple) aims to change all that. With the Olivia Tremor Control, Hart's wonderful artwork helped make each of that band's releases feel like something worth admiring, as well as setting the mood for the records themselves. Now, with Cloud Recordings' homemade project, Hart is releasing beautifully packaged CD-R's, all made with decidedly analog implements such as spray paint and tracing paper. Every Cloud homemade release is unique-- each has its own slightly varying artwork, made lovingly by Hart himself and his Athens cohorts. Musically, the homemades are similarly intimate-- smaller projects that would appeal to people who are particularly in tune with Hart's musical sensibility. Inside Views, one in the first series of CD-Rs to be released, is a revisitation of the Circulatory System's excellent self-titled debut record. Whereas Circulatory System was, in many ways, the most straightforward album to be released by Hart yet, Inside Views takes the tracks from that album on a Black Foliage-style ride, complete with sound collages and abrupt song changes. Circulatory System had nearly infinite sonic material to mine. With some songs from that album containing upwards of 60 simultaneous tracks, and countless additional tracks not having made it onto the final mix, an almost entirely different record could have been assembled from source material. Inside Views makes it clear, however, that Hart's intention wasn't to create something entirely new, but rather to provide alternate sonic perspectives on an incredibly complex record. Over its thirteen untitled tracks, Inside Views covers many of the best songs from Circulatory System. Its first track is a sparser interpretation of ""Yesterday's World,"" with a slithery guitar line taking the forefront, and a more subdued rhythm. This less structured rendering allows Hart to introduce a whole new slew of weird, trippy sounds and little cut-up edits of the song. Elsewhere, Hart pulls out to focus on some of the most compelling sounds on Circulatory System individually-- the deep chanting of ""ancient voices"" on ""Outside Blasts"" being the most notable example. Around the tenth track, Inside Views becomes deeply sparse and ambient, providing an interesting change of pace from the oft-breakneck sonic exploration that precedes it. This period of quiet segues into a skeletal interpretation of ""Inside Blasts,"" perhaps the best track on Circulatory System. The whirling background drones that were once pushed way back in the mix are audible now, and make a prime case for Hart's talent as a creator of incredible, unusual sounds. Ultimately, Inside Views succeeds wonderfully in providing some new vistas on a brilliant record. By abruptly picking you up in the middle of one song and dropping you down in another, Hart shows just how successful he was in creating a whole variety of strange environments on Circulatory System. As a stand-alone effort, Inside Views is far from stacking up against the body of Hart's other work. But as a handmade companion piece to one of last year's most memorable albums, it's something to treasure.","Of all the complaints levied by vinyl purists, the only one I've ever really given much credence to is ...

Mishawaka EP,Marmoset,by: Christopher Dare,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3b55e6ef959693238c1/1:1/w_160/69b308d6.jpg,2002-03-24 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5112-mishawaka-ep/,Secretly Canadian,"What is it with musicians and madness? Why does rock lend itself so easily to the loons? Of course, as Ben Watson has pointed out in a recent Wire column, there's a big difference between the mentally insane and the popular image of the rocker who's come unhinged. It's the Velvet Goldmine syndrome-- you're offered a thrilling sense of transgression, but you're kept safe because it's all objectified in the form of some garishly-clad star on stage. Lady Stardust shows some leg; Jim Morrison thinks dark thoughts about his mum; you're fingering the ticket in your pocket and nodding along. Somewhere in that haze of drugs, sex and glam lies Marmoset. Yes, they're from Indianapolis of all places, and yes, you will believe that in spite of it all when you hear this EP. ""The Living Illusions"" reflects on late-60s psych-rock with lazy chords (two or three at most!) and barebones drum backing. An organ hums as guitarist Dave Jablonski's tenor insists, ""I'm not right in the head/ I truly believe I'm not connected upstairs."" His other main number on the EP, ""I'm Always Too Late,"" wanders as whimsically as any of Syd Barrett's spacy old tunes. The chorus begins in good nature but somehow, in only three minutes, the strums and sing-song repetition add up to something almost unsettlingly obsessive. I focused more on Jorma Whittaker, Marmoset's bassist and other lead singer, in my review of their 2001 album Record in Red. A song by the same name appears here on the EP (though not on that album), and it's a distillation of their entire lo-fi ethic. Drummer Jason Cavan sets a swaggering downbeat to the buzzy garage-rock guitars, and Whittaker's suddenly insinuating himself onto your lap with lines like, ""I came to see you/ Want to know who you are."" The guy's always halfway between flirt and freakout, as on the title track. Mishawaka is apparently a small town near South Bend, Indiana, and in the song of the same name, Whittaker's driving alone towards it. ""The truth is like a rattlesnake/ I hold it in my arms, satisfy the charms,"" he sings, letting each syllable slip off his tongue. And true to form, the guitar slithers playfully just on the edge of tension. What we have here is another twenty minutes of vintage Marmoset, a taste that will appeal across lines from Brit-poppers to Nuggets collectors. The EP is rounded out by a cover of the Fourmost's 1963 hit ""I'm in Love,"" penned for them by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Marmoset's take on Merseybeat is of course somewhat subdued, but if anything, it sounds even more genuine than the original. Then there's the instrumental ""Soft Evenings,"" placed strangely as the first song. It's the longest, just three minutes of the bass pulsing quietly and Whittaker cooing strangely. He sounds both serene and yet vulnerable, and also quite mad. ""Soft Evenings"" clearly rose from a jam, which sparks a thought: maybe that freeform mind-state that gets equated with insanity finds itself easily in music because of the immediacy of the connection. It's like painting, where you can slather oil directly on canvas, whereas other forms, like film, require preparation. Writing is an interesting middle ground, because you can definitely scratch down whatever comes to mind-- but in practice, I'd guess there are more Boredoms listeners than readers of Burroughs cut-ups. Still, you did read this review, didn't you?","What is it with musicians and madness? Why does rock lend itself so easily to the loons? Of course, as ...

Rever,Larsen,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcaceb335119a49eccfa/1:1/w_160/fefcfe35.jpg,2002-03-24 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4692-rever/,Young God,"What I get here: gray skies, hollow trees, gallows poles, night beasts along the moors, bouts of depression lit afire with trance, and trash can percussion-- not to mention more than an ounce of poetic pretense. But of course, when was emotional music supposed to deliver anything more weighty? It's very contagious, and I can hope that was the intention. Truthfully, I have no idea how or why this mysterious Italian band made this music. Furthermore, I'm not alone in this. Last year, Swans founder Michael Gira (and Young God Records chief) started getting odd packages from Torino, Italy. Inside were CD-Rs of sounds compiled, produced and otherwise emitted from a band of people known simply as Larsen. On his website, Gira describes the music therein as ranging from soft, accordion-based abstractions to ""sometimes just a single sound or noise, a scraping sound, as if someone were slowly etching a piece of rusted metal with a blade of some sort."" The final package he received had nothing like that, but rather a wad of cash, a ticket to Italy, and a request for him to produce an album for Larsen. And as anyone with even a hint of adventure (or sadism) would, Gira accepted the invitation. Upon arriving, Gira was never actually permitted to see the members of Larsen. Apparently, he was relegated to the control room as the band, behind a silk screen, made music and, when it fancied them, communicated to Gira via translators and other strangers. He speaks of frequent ""heated, violent arguments"" and ""watching the shadows"" from behind the cloth barrier, as Larsen played for hours on end before deciding it was time to actually start recording. This is the introduction I had before me as I listened to Rever, and never let it be said that a band's lore can't be as much a factor in their music as the sounds they make. Now, taken on its own, this record doesn't possess quite as much of the macabre as its back story would indicate. It does come awfully close, though. Larsen's sound has elements of damaged, arty rock from all over. I can hear lots of Sonic Youth-- conceptually, even when it doesn't directly call to mind their music-- in the dread-full, repetitive figures and omnipresent guitar noise. That isn't to say that Larsen are necessarily ""noisy,"" but a lot of the playing reminds me of similarly tense, rock deconstructions by the American band. There are also some hints of post-rock, though what I really want to say is that Larsen doesn't mind taking a groove and running into the ground, all in the name of lulling me into a damp, sickly stupor. Gira calls them ""highly ritualized sounds,"" and if that means they're often uncomfortably numbing, I agree. The opener, ""Impro #2,"" features just such cyclical meandering. It begins with an up-tempo (for Larsen, anyway) march pattern, featuring triangle, accordion and lazily strummed, clean electric guitar. Soon, an unidentified male vocalist (musicians include Roberto Maria Clemente, Paolo Dellapiana and Sylvia Grosso, though no specific performance info is provided) chants indecipherably, sounding like a cross between a Tibetan throat singer and a restrained death metal growler. I would call this a mantra if not for the old recording of a trombone which comes in at the very end. The epic ""Radial"" follows, and this is where Larsen really lets its strengths shine. Thunderous reverberations act as fanfare, and a distant accordion waxes the floor for the onslaught of distorted bass and guitar which has crept up so subtly as to make me wonder how things got so impenetrably loud all of a sudden. Someone begins to saw at a zither (or some such piece of arcane craftsmanship) in the background, until about four minutes in when the rainstorm softens a bit. The bass is still hacking away, but slowly receding to reveal that the accordion from the beginning has in fact never stopped moaning. The track is 11 minutes, and Larsen doesn't let on that this was just an introduction, until the ""tune"" starts at the 5\xBD-minute mark. At that point, they rip into genuine fuzz-trance, Goth-psych-- let's just say that it's gloomier than This Heat, yet punchier than late-period Swans. The fairly brief ""Mentre"" lightens the mood considerably (and the fact that it's in a major key tonality helps a ton), and even manages to use the guttural growl of the male vocalist as a droning counter-line to the spoken female narration. ""Finger Number Six"" tightens the rhythmic arrangement (just sticks and a tom), though retains the light electric guitar strum as an accompanying instrument for the ultra-minimalist (read: two notes) melody. During their more experimental moments, Larsen might seem to fall into the psych camp, with big, echo-treated atmospherics and dark, acid-purified espousals from the unknown singers. However, the beat strategies presented on this tune (and others, like the aggressive ""Akin"") often tighten the reins on the group's tendency to spill. Chiefly, my issue with Rever isn't that the band works up too much lather in their mud bath; rather, they only really seem to make one mess, over and over. Fifty minutes of brooding, pensive mood music might hit the spot for me on occasion, though could be a bit tedious if I'm not up for it. But at least as I write this, it's fairly impressive. With any luck, Larsen may one day raise their black curtain to reveal something frighteningly good.","What I get here: gray skies, hollow trees, gallows poles, night beasts along the\n\ moors, bouts of depression lit ...

Single Crown Postcard,Brando,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a37fea9e61561daa4cb7/1:1/w_160/ea3eb2e1.gif,2002-03-24 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/912-single-crown-postcard/,RecordheadMr. Whiggs,"Some albums have to be played a few times before they're appreciated-- which is the polite way to say that, upon first listen, they sound unremarkable or even irritating. The latest release by Bloomington, Indiana's Brando, Single Crown Postcard, provoked immediate dislike that slowly grew into a genuine respect. This is a complicated album, straightforward in small doses but hard to interpret as a whole. Start with the sound quality. Brando makes the most of their four-track recordings, but maybe the format shouldn't be pushed this far. Home taping can be kind to straight-up rock and solo bedroom confessional records, but Brando's arrangements are much more complicated: the band parts are tight and precise, with primary songwriter and performer Derek Richey layering lush sounds and synthesized string backdrops. Shoehorning all of this into a four-track can sound like taping music off the TV by holding a cassette recorder to the speaker: the result is weak and distant when you want to hear it soar. And there's Richey's vocals. He's a good singer-- on key, confident and distinct-- but his high voice, which resembles David Sedaris', is an acquired taste. His delivery is so precise and his expression so unvaried that it's hard to tell where he's coming from: on the first track, ""French Algiers,"" he's almost apologetic (""I've got more game than it appears,"" he assures us), but on other songs, he sounds more bold and assertive, bordering on snarky. It's after a couple of listens that the strength and diversity of the songwriting comes through: Single Crown Postcard is a mess of classic pop styles. ""Partisan"" echoes whimsical late-60s Brit-pop, with its biting yet sing-song lyrics. ""By and By"" could have shown up on a Dusty Springfield album, and Richey forces some genuine soul out of his voice. Other songs borrow from more modern styles: the piano line on ""Driving to My Desert"" could have come off the soundtrack to a Hal Hartley film, and ""The Great Unwind"" cribs from every wistful indie pop song of the past ten years, maybe sounding a little more sincere than average when you detect some rare vulnerability in Richey's singing. For as much as the songs are clean, solid pop, Single Crown Postcard combines them into a hard-to-fathom package: it shifts from somber to psychedelic, from the pining of ""Two Views (Of Your Glass Gloves)"" to the oompa-loompa gait and twinkly keyboards of ""Two Years."" A simpler album would be taken at face value, but Richey gives up so little of his intentions and opinions that he almost dares you to keep listening and digging in. I don't know what the hell he's really singing about, but it's starting to sound pretty interesting.","Some albums have to be played a few times before they're appreciated-- which is the polite way to say ...

1942 EP,Soul-Junk,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4d75e6ef95969320973/1:1/w_160/ec027448.gif,2002-03-21 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7366-1942-ep/,Sounds Familyre,"In the forward to his book Escape from Reason, the noted Christian philosopher/apologist Francis Schaeffer wrote that every generation of Christian has the ""problem of learning how to speak meaningfully to its own age."" Soul Junk is Glen Galaxy's means of solving this problem. Galaxy (aka Glen Galloway) formed Soul Junk in 1994 when his band, Trumans Water, relocated to Portland. He stayed behind in San Diego (although he does still sit in with the band on occasion). Anyone familiar with the freewheeling experimentalism of Trumans Water will hear it echoed in the music of Soul Junk, as there's a similar sense that anything might happen at any moment. There is one notable distinction, however: a good percentage of Soul Junk's lyrics (especially on the earlier releases) are drawn from the Bible. Verbatim. That probably bothers a lot of people, and frankly, it bothers me a little bit, too. But I've come to realize that maybe to be bothered is exactly the point, or at least one of the points. Maybe it's supposed to shock us, hearing those words and stories in these various musical contexts, into re-evaluating them. Imagine a coarser-voiced, born-again Steve Malkmus and you've got a bead on Mr. Galaxy's style: a musical polymath, conversant in all genres without sounding contrived, or, at times, sounding so knowingly contrived as to be a self-reflexive comment upon itself. At times, Galaxy seems so drenched in irony that he comes full circle to being sincere again. As for this 6-song, 23-minute EP, it's straight-up solid. The Beck-meets-Madlib brand of hip-hop that permeated the last Soul Junk full-length is here replaced with a frantic, spazzed-out kind of indie rock and shambling folk-pop. Synths, banjo, trumpet, and anything else found around the studio gets thrown in, creating the feeling of some sort of strange, postmodern hootenanny. It probably goes a long way toward explaining what this record sounds like to say that a few members of the Danielson Famile lend their skills, including Daniel Smith, who also recorded and produced the EP. The loose, free-flowing vibe is best captured on the bright, EP-ending mini-epic ""Good as Dead,"" on which Galaxy strains his vocal chords to the limit, howling, ""'I will speak to you,' and as he spoke his spirit came into me,"" as organ swirls in the background. But if you just want to know whether or not an adventurous-listening non-Christian could get into this, I'd say-- like with the Danielson Famile-- the odds are probably better than those of your average Jesus freak.","In the forward to his book Escape from Reason, the noted Christian philosopher/apologist Francis Schaeffer wrote that every generation ...

On that cloudy afternoon in the high school parking lot? You brushed up against me as you unlocked the door of your car, and I noticed your shy smile and your Pedro the Lion t-shirt. I said hi. And you said, ""There's a sharp December hush/ In the clearing where she kneels/ Frost upon the ground/ Shoes worn in the heel/ This could be paradise."" I shivered and said, ""Oh, wow. Is that Braid?"" You sighed. ""No, that's the Atari Star."" I'll never forget the way our hands touched when you gave me the CD. It had this really pretty leaf drawing on the cover, and it was titled, And Other Smaller, Brighter Worlds, which is so beautiful and internal and intense. Your eyes lit up like soft September musing and you said, ""It's your new favorite band."" Later that night, when we met on Instant Messenger. I plied you for more information. You told me that the Atari Star was on a record label called Johann's Face that put out a lot of bands you used to listen to back when you were ""sort of a punk rocker."" And there's a close label association with the Alkaline Trio, which is one of my favorite bands. And you said Marc Ruvolo, lead singer/guitarist for the Atari Star, is a co-owner of Johann's Face Records. And I was so excited to hear the CD, because most bands that have ""Atari"" in the name are good. Except that one that's sort of goth. You told me to listen to track four, ""Occasional Genius and Everyday Polite Terror."" I did. And I heard these beautiful arpeggios of a keyboard on glockenspiel setting, and these repetitive, but totally sincere guitar lines. And I thought for a minute it sounded like elevator music, but that was cool because it also sounded a little bit like that band, Spandau Ballet. But not quite so good. Then this sweet, sort of off-key voice comes in singing, ""I cross my fingers/ Your look of sadness melts away."" And I teared a little, Josh. For real. Especially when he sang, ""You will become the things you say/ But stay with me tonight."" The whole CD was that good. Even on ""Capricorn"" when the keyboard in the opening line sounds a lot like ""Jaws,"" but slower. I guess that's unintentional. Because these guys totally know how to rock the keyboard. So much so that I went up to the attic and pulled out my old Casio, and you know what? I could play most of the songs after a couple hours. Not all the songs were slow and sad, either. Some of them, like ""Black Licorice and Gas Fumes,"" were up-tempo and dancy like my favorite songs on old Promise Ring records. There's this piano part that mom says sounds kind of like Neil Diamond, or maybe Billy Joel. And ""[hands]"" was just an instrumental with vacant white noise and disconnected voices, which sounds like a sonic interpretation of my totally hardcore ennui. On our first date, we went to the vegetarian restaurant next door to Barnes and Noble, and after dinner we hooked up in your car to the sound of ""Ordinary Clock."" You wept when the keyboards crescendoed in those pretty, childlike chords at the line, ""She whispered to me un-self-consciously/ She whispered to me with gravity/ That this, too, shall pass."" And then you tried to take off my bra. It was like that for two weeks. Then my sister came home from college. I dragged her up to my room. ""This is my favorite band,"" I said. I proudly played all our favorite songs, but halfway through the third, she stood abruptly, holding her ears, and said: ""Lindsay, this sounds like my ninth grade, over-enunciating, tone deaf actor ex-boyfriend, singing his own poetry, and playing a Casio keyboard at a Karaoke bar on 80s night. The only song that sort of works for me is ""Hands Accidentally Touch,"" which is fairly benign, quiet, and pretty. Even if the lyrics are silly and the keyboards are cheesy. Your boyfriend turned you onto this?"" I was so embarrassed, Josh, because the more I thought about it, she was right. The CD was pretty bad. But not even bad in a funny way. Bad in a depressing, pathetic, spineless sort of way. And that's not sexy. It's not even very appealing if you think about it. Kinda like how you'd get all sensitive and emotional right before you tried to take off my underwear. That wasn't a coincidence, was it? So, I'm dumping you for a Strokes fan I met on Makeoutclub.com. His name is Jeremy. He smokes, and he doesn't like Atari Star. That's all you really need to know. And so, what better way to end than with a line from our song, ""Hands Accidentally Touch""? The same line you wrote in the fog on my window when we were making out in the car last week: ""I fix this image and then file it away/ Hands that touch/ Linger briefly/ Then withdraw/ Landslides of silence touch the ether.""

It's a community of musicians popularly known to be directed by a two-headed beast, the madman and the sober prophet, Lee ""Scratch"" Perry and Osbourne ""King Tubby"" Ruddock. ""Digital music"" is shunned as artificial by fetishists. ""These Fetishists are nothing more than pallid traditionalists"" is the secret message delivered by these 15 tracks, a message encoded in bass. This compilation comes at a terribly appropriate time. The collective consciousness of the electronic music scene has advanced to a point where they can finally recognize the contribution of reggae music to their own production techniques. These producers are looking for something else: a ""Now Thing."" The artists represented on this collection come forth as serious innovators of the dub music style. They've managed to incorporate the heaviest aspects of dance music into crashing anthems and psyched-out battle cries. It seems almost impossible, listening to these tracks, that this kind of music could be released in this day and age without anyone knowing about it. The joy of hearing something new is accompanied by a sense that you're getting a gift. ""Z2010"" by Lenky impresses such a sense of urgency on the listener. With its distorted melodies and a vocoded voice chanting ""madness... madness... madness..."" throughout the length of the song, it's easy to imagine the type of scene that could accompany this music, which sounds like Timbaland creating propaganda music for the Government. Similarly, ""Grass Cyaat"" by Richard Browne has a repetitive chant of ""fever,"" which has an even closer apparent relationship to hip-hop music, thumping with sped-up synthlines and slowed-down bass. ""Jigga"" by Slam Productions samples Jay-Z's rendition of Scarface: ""OK!"" These affirmations are beautiful reminders of the grinding desire by these producers to move people physically. The organ and synthesizer sounds pervasive on these songs demonstrate the amazing ability of present technology to effectively reference tone and melody in an interesting manner. These artists, like Steely & Cleevie, fucking kill it on ""Nightcrawler,"" a death walk track with a shouted ""hey"" and unintelligible echoing garbles, bass-heavy and menacing. The synth sounds evoke high danger. The connections to the original Holy Dub Music which brought this all about is apparent throughout the song selections: the rhythms are constant reminders of the genre's roots. Now Thing is Perry and Tubby through a digital guise, a literal transformation of time. The beauty of the music lies in the intersections between its stark originality in beat construction and precise melodic and bass constructions, and its ability to properly reference its nascence in Jamaican ska and reggae. Perhaps it's the inability of most contemporary producers to properly achieve the latter. In any event, this document will prove influential to all those who hear it. May the gospel of the Now Thing be spread amongst all willing participants. The tools are all present and reliable: vocoders, reverb, echo, bass, drums and uncompromising rhythm.

Western Culture,Henry Cow,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0ac5e6ef959693235ae/1:1/w_160/fb3021c4.jpg,2002-03-21 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3817-western-culture/,BroadcastBroadcast,"At the end of the day, perhaps it comes down to the argument of escapism versus elitism. It's been so long since prog was a popular genre that the argument over its relevance has seemingly been left by the wayside. However, there are several attitudes we take for granted today that may never have existed outside of the general pop-critic population, but seem to have been perpetuated over the past thirty years to the point of being distorted and disproportionately trusted. Ultimately, that there is a humbly active prog scene today (check the cults of oddly named groups such as Spock's Beard or the Flower Kings if you're in doubt) might be the funniest anti-climax in rock. Allow me to shoot down some stereotypes: ""Prog is pretentious and bloated."" Yes, and Emerson, Lake and Palmer are often cited as the prime examples. While I can't defend a couple of those later 70s Yes albums, and the insane clown affair that is Pictures at an Exhibition, I will say that at their worst, these bands never approached the bombast of the slightest Sex Pistols or Stooges album. ""Only Dungeons & Dragons nerds listen to prog."" This idea may stem from prog's often-whimsical subject matter or mythical album covers, though I have to say that I've never heard a prog tune about the King of Carrot Flowers. Prog doesn't rock."" ... Despite the superficiality of these kinds of criticisms, many of the original bands took them to heart, and by 1977 or so, most of them had receded into crass commercialism, or were forced out of the music business entirely due to changing trends. The ones that lived on were generally one of two ilks. The first was the style chameleon: Yes and Genesis are the two most famous examples, with the latter band going so far as to allow their frontman to lead them into the worst regions of MOR banality. The second type was the far more interesting proposition: bands that graduated from prog into even stranger realms. Henry Cow was this type of band, and what follows may change your perception of prog forever. Henry Cow was founded at Cambridge University, England by guitarist Fred Frith and keyboardist/reed player Tim Hodgkinson. Percussionist Chris Cutler joined in 1971, by which time the band had settled into a regular unit. A diverse mix of influences (Zappa, modern classical composition, free jazz, etc.), along with the natural creativity and intelligence of the group members (most had finished their college degrees before Leg End was released in 1973), spawned a sound unlike any contemporary prog band. They were one of Virgin Records' first acts, and made their first tour with relative ""superstars"" Faust (and would later tour with Captain Beefheart)-- all of this during the heyday of ""symphonic"" prog bands like Yes and Genesis. Henry Cow's sound always seemed to me a direct response to what was popularly passing as experimental music during their time. Where a band like Gentle Giant (one of the more compositionally complex prog bands) would take classical counterpoint and color it with rock groove and volume, the Cow would remove color altogether, opting for sheer intensity through concept (often manifested in Marxist political statements) and relentlessly dry arrangements. It wasn't enough that their tunes sounded like boisterous Schoenberg etudes, but they usually featured chamber classical instruments such as oboe, bassoon, clarinet and violin. And, where a typical prog band would have used this to evoke the Romanticism of composers like Brahms or Strauss, Cow laid all their cards on the table by naming themselves after the experimental American composer Henry Cowell. They seemed very intent on opposing (Cutler would later even initiate the musical collective Rock In Opposition) any stereotype one might throw at them. I must admit this has always colored my perception of the band. If Yes were the double coconut-fudge of rock, perhaps best for escapist fantasies, then Henry Cow were certainly wheat germ. It's not that they weren't cool in their way, but there's a not-so-subtle academic aftertaste to much of their music for me. Western Culture was their final record, and is probably the most overtly influenced by modern classical composition. It's not very hard to hear why this music is important, in the sense that it lays the groundwork for a whole school of avant-rock and prog that doesn't cause cavities. My caveat would be one of aesthetics, because if you're looking for a party, you'd best dig out ""Long Distance Runaround"" instead. By the time Western Culture was released in 1979, the group was mostly separated. Cutler and Frith would soon form the excellent Art Bears with Dagmar Krause (who had performed with Cow during several occasions), and Hodgkinson and reedist Lindsay Cooper wrote the pieces on this album exclusively. ""Industry"" begins things with a brain-freeze, as the opening organ screech gives way to dissonant guitar and hacking drums. Hyper-rhythmic figures (but certainly not ""beats""), accentuated by stinging guitar and angular violin lines, suggest quite well whatever inhuman, technological madness the title implies. There are no vocals anywhere on the album, so the difficult melodies rely on the arrangers' skill with voicing in order to stand out. Now, if all of this sounds a bit technical, rest assured, that's probably appropriate. ""The Decay of Cities"" brings in familiar sonorities with Frith's rather gorgeous acoustic guitar exposition. All of the players were unsung in the grand scheme of prog, though Frith was arguably the most important element for this group if only because he brought a much needed touch of the ""real world"" to the music. After the intro, an ominous trombone and piano duet ensues, and Frith reenters with guitar figures at once Asian and Cageian. There are some very clever things happening here, with kinetic trading of figures by percussion, guitar, piano and winds. Later on, saxophone carries the tune, sounding like a cross between an intense, somber jazz balladeer and flighty, post-Ornette bopper. Cooper's first piece, ""Falling Away,"" opens with a chorus of woodwinds, similar to some of Zappa's classical/jazz fusion experiments of the early 70s. This reference is short lived, as the band bangs through with drums and a mad ostinato line that reminds me of their Belgian brethren Univers Zero (another classically minded band, who were somehow even more deadly serious than the Cow). This leads to some of the most intense stuff on the record, as themes fly by at breakneck pace, while Cutler never stops pounding his kit (and still never actually playing beats). ""Coretels Tale"" is more of the same, with enhanced moodiness via creepy flutes, and some nicely Cecil Taylor-esque piano playing. The original Western Culture closes with ""1/2 the Sky"" (though the reissue includes three more tunes, including a tribute to one of Cutler's favorites, Pere Ubu). Still no rest for weary ears, though I must say that I've always been impressed at Henry Cow's purity of vision. Whatever you want to say of prog, even on the experimental end, bands that remain true to their original spirit are rare enough that I respect these musicians based merely on principal. Of course, all of the individuals involved here would go on to very interesting careers in any number of odd settings, and I would be remiss if I didn't point out that even twenty years later they are more interesting than the majority of current experimental rock groups. So they're not as ""entertaining"" (or as easy to poke fun at) as Yes, or as cool to name drop as Can or Faust, but Henry Cow were as original an act as ever played ""rock,"" and will probably continue to challenge listeners for as long as their work remains available.","At the end of the day, perhaps it comes down to the argument of escapism versus elitism.

Freedom in Fragments,Fred Frith,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be37c0084474cd0c2e51/1:1/w_160/15bf6bed.jpg,2002-03-20 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3210-freedom-in-fragments/,Tzadik,"I'm too cheap to get HBO. Every time a new season of ""The Sopranos"" comes on, I wait for some friend to tape it, and then I borrow the whole thing-- all thirteen hours-- and watch it in one, or maybe two sittings. But later, if I go back and watch just one of the episodes, it's a different experience: every season is driven by a few main arcs, but watching it piece by piece, you can focus on the smaller stories and subtle structures that you miss when you plow through the whole thing. Each episode both gains and loses something when it's jammed in with the others. Fred Frith's suite Freedom in Fragments, written for and performed here by the Rova Saxophone Quartet, explores the same idea: the relationship between the parts and the whole. He says in the liner notes that he wanted to write compositions ""which could reach their narrative potential by a force of accumulation... small stories that, when heard together, become big stories."" Each of the twenty-three sections of the suite has narrative qualities-- a feeling of drama, tension, or of action unfolding-- which reinforce each other when the sections are taken together. Take the third piece, ""Song and Dance."" The song bolts out with an anticipatory, pulsing rhythm under a soprano sax solo by Bruce Ackley. It transitions to a whirling folk song as Steve Adams steps up on alto, before changing again to a driving but mournful finale behind Larry Och's tenor. This is a strong and exciting piece by itself, but placed between the fanfare of ""Advertising"" and the probing introduction of ""Void Where Prohibited,"" it acquires a sense of drama: it's establishing a scene, or introducing a story. At the other end of the record, the conflicts and tensions throughout the suite culminate in ""Chained to the Skyway,"" an ominous song that breaks into rapid, angry firing. There's some kind of a fight going on that barely gets patched up on the next track, ""Batteries Not Included/Nostalgia,"" where Raskin's baritone stumbles in to make a guttural statement, and the others quietly join him. The closer, ""Freedom Is Your Friends II,"" sounds bleak and wailing-- and if there's any complaint you can make about the piece as a narrative, it's that the conflict and woe prevail without much of a catharsis. Tony Soprano may never escape his emotional struggle, but at least he gets to whack people. Though Freedom in Fragments forms a loose story arc, this is just one configuration of the work. Frith intended to keep it abstract and open: none of the compositions implies a specific story or theme, and further, they're written to be played in any order. Some arrangements work better than others, but there's no definitive sequence. Freedom in Fragments was commissioned in 1994 by Rova, leading interpreters of new music who perform works that rely heavily on improvisation. Their experience with this piece (it's still in their repertoire today) shows in how well they interpret this flexible music. The suite's greatest strength is the way it lets Rova crawl around their instruments, from the melodic ballads to noisy skronk. The sax quartet is a powerful format, and for as little as it's been adopted, groups like Rova and the World Saxophone Quartet have demonstrated the awesome harmonies and pulsing rhythms that a small all-sax ensemble can produce. ""Freedom in Fragments"" is a great workout, from ""Ikue's Song,"" a curious one-minute duet; the smooth and elegant ""Water Under the Bridge,"" which has the richest melody; or ""T Square Park Lark,"" a ten-minute piece that acts as its own epic, with Rova shifting seamlessly into group improvisation. Each member of Rova is a capable soloist but it's the ensemble sections that are really impressive: their growth over two decades together is undeniable. Tzadik has done a typically great job of recognizing and recording an undervalued piece of music. However, this time they made a critical mistake: probably to make a good listening experience, the album only includes sixteen of the twenty-three pieces in the suite. A few sections have been recorded before, but this will probably be the only major release, and a different specialty label would have thrown in every single measure and every scrap of music. If Tzadik had included the other sections as bonus tracks, or included another disc with an alternate sequence, this would be a definitive release; but as it stands, it's a great record of a fascinating work.","I'm too cheap to get HBO.

I Break Chairs,Damien Jurado,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929ba46eb335119a49ec9af/1:1/w_160/5a5b94ce.jpg,2002-03-20 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4326-i-break-chairs/,Sub Pop,"There is a certain comfort to be found in habit. My father recognized this while yet a young man; it took me much longer to recognize the same with regards to him. For years I attempted to give Harlan imaginative, heartfelt Christmas and birthday presents, only to be dismayed when I would find said presents months later resting atop bookshelves, uncracked, or in the bottoms of a cardboard boxes, prepared for storage. All Harlan ever asked for was v-neck t-shirts, old-man boxers, and the occasional pair of khaki ""slacks."" It took me over 20 years to finally acquiesce in this boxers and slacks philanthropy. To some degree, we all prefer the familiar. This explains the stateside failure of the metric system and, to a lesser extent, vegemite. Like they say, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I feel the same way about women's hair. For example, what heterosexual male has not been forced to answer this question: ""Honey, how do you like my new haircut?"" For your information, the ""correct"" answer is always ""I love it. You look like Bo Derek."" The large-nutted boyfriend, however, would reject appeasement and instead offer the following rejoinder: ""You mean the one that makes you look like Billie Jean King? What the fuck were you thinking?"" If Damien Jurado's music were my girlfriend, I just might grow nuts and drop that bomb. The folk-pop of Jurado's prior three releases was honest, introspective, moody, sometimes peppy and sometimes heartbreaking. The new Jurado is none of those things. It is the long-haired girlfriend who gets mowed by Fantastic Sam's. Produced by Pedro the Lion's David Bazan, I Break Chairs consistently presents a more direct, aggressive rock tenor that is very surprising, and for a fan like myself, a bit disappointing. Not disappointing at all, however, is the first track on I Break Chairs, ""Paperwings."" The rollicking pop-rock number has a gritty, foot-stomping edge to it, and a powerful chorus built around descending, overdriven bar chords (replete with Jurado yelping a high note way beyond his range). The tunes on the rest of the disc are recognizably Jurado, with sparse lyricism and Damien's characteristic melodic tools (like the guitar tracking the vocal melody, as on ""Inevitable"" and ""Air Show Disaster""). Orchestration is simple and direct, with guitars at the forefront and bass and drums locked and solid. Jurado's voice lends a folksy, country timbre to the mix. Another high moment comes on the instrumental denouement of ""Never Ending Tide,"" which balances a background of controlled feedback and drum machine with a wistful, reverbed guitar riff. ""Like Titanic"" blends pop-rock Damien with shades of the sweet, quaint, and thoughtful Damien of earlier years. It's sappy but rewarding. By the end of the record, though, the songs begin to blend together (some even seem to blend into other albums, like ""Lose My Head,"" which I swear I've heard before). Jurado was aiming for thematic consistency with the disc; he wanted a rock record, and that's what he recorded. Stylistically, however, there's little room for error when writing pop-rock songs, especially those with a creative approach as generic as this collection. Without a recognizable hook, there's very little to set a song apart. So songs like ""Big Deal,"" ""The Way You Look,"" and ""Castles"" just seem to take up space. They're well executed, with plenty of sonic punch-- they just lack that certain je ne sai quoi that digs itself into your subconscious. When you learn to love something, the word ""change"" is inherently bad. It inspires a reflexive hatred regardless of the merits of the change. So maybe I Break Chairs was doomed from the start. But like short-haired women, I've warmed up a little to the new-look Jurado. It's not half bad-- it's solidly executed and very consistent. There aren't any obvious weak spots, and there are a few peaks. But in the final analysis, I yearn for the Damien of old. He just did what he did (the melancholy stuff, in particular) better than anybody else. To use the 9/11 vernacular, a return to normalcy would be welcome. Let's just hope Damien's got a little Harlan in him.","There is a certain comfort to be found in habit. My father recognized this while yet a young man; it ...

Life Starts Here,Airport 5,by: Will Bryant,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a02e13d197565213830a/1:1/w_160/fcddf673.jpg,2002-03-20 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/83-life-starts-here/,RockathonRecordhead,"Look, I know you're thinking about buying that new Airport 5 record. You saw it at the record store the other day and it has that glossy sticker on the front: ""Airport 5 is Robert Pollard and Tobin Sprout."" The packaging even looks pretty cool-- it's got that distressed typewriter font like on the Under the Bushes-era singles, and that enigmatic Jason Pierce-style collage on the cover. But I hope that doesn't mean you're assuming it sounds like Under the Bushes, too. Pollard and Sprout wrote some incredible songs together-- I mean, ""14 Cheerleader Coldfront""? ""Hot Freaks""? Guided by Voices' discography isn't exactly known for its consistency, but sometimes Pollard hits when you least expect him to-- After Mag Earwhig, I was about to throw in the towel, but the kick-ass lo-fi record they cut old-school afterwards, Tonics and Twisted Chasers made me believe again. ""Optional Bases Opposed""? ""The Top Chick's Silver Chord""? That record's their best-kept secret, man! It was the first album to really recapture the living room magic of Bee Thousand; rather than the band aesthetic they aimed for on Alien Lanes and Under the Bushes. So last year, when I read that Pollard and Sprout were collaborating again on a Tonics II, I mean, that's got to totally kick ass, right? I pre-ordered it from Fading Captain the first day! Then it came like a couple of months later: Airport 5! Tower in the Fountain of Sparks! And... it wasn't their best work, but it sure sounded great. There's no mistaking Sprout's bright, trebly guitars and cheapo drum machines beneath Pollard's Marlboro-enhanced growl. And there were some nice hooks here and there-- ""Stifled Man Casino"" was pretty catchy, and ""Circle of Trim"" was prime GbV. So I got the new one, Life Starts Here, and it's pretty much the same deal: Pollard's lyrics and vocals over instrumental beds provided by Sprout. It's the formula Pollard's been mining since Waved Out-- recording the instruments at home in his spare time with friends, then knocking out the vocals and mixes in a couple of days in a real studio with a proper engineer. Only now he doesn't write or play the music-- he just has friends like Sprout or Superchunk's Mac McCaughan send him instrumentals and sings over them, karaoke-style. So there's no real opportunity for interaction, you know? There's no re-taking the songs, no adding a bridge here or taking a few bars off the chorus there. My biggest complaint about Guided by Voices has always been that there's a built-in disposability to the songs that leaves the listener always craving something more, something better. ""That's so sweet how 'You're Not an Airplane' just ends the album like that, play it again...""; ""If 'Motor Away' had just been recorded better, I know it could have been a major radio hit...""; ""I can't believe they left 'Shrine to the Dynamic Years' off Do the Collapse,"" etc. Their live shows are the same way: ""That's so cool that they just played 'Cut-Out Witch' and 'Echos Myron,' but when are they gonna play 'Peep-Hole'?"" And so it goes with Airport 5. ""Yellow Wife No. 5"" and ""I Can't Freeze Anymore"" coast along on generic Sprout bass grooves, with nothing particularly offensive or exciting to stand out. ""We're in the Business"" steals shamelessly from Sprout's back catalog-- essentially a slowed-down, DOA retread of ""Beast of Souls"" with embarrassingly off-key delivery from the Fadin' Captain. The attempts at variety in the instrumentation-- I'm thinking about the faux-horsetrot percussion on ""However Young They Are"" and the tinny synths on ""Out in the World""-- do nothing but ham-handedly disguise more of the same ol', same ol'. The interminable, pretentious epic ""Wrong Drama Addiction"" and unlistenable spoken-word fragment ""The Dawntrust Guarantee"" kick it up a notch in the canons of awful self-indulgence. Surely Pollard, as a former schoolteacher, must once have told a kid, ""You are capable of better than this."" Great music is about how it makes the listener feel, not about who appears in the credits. Albums like Life Starts Here are about as exciting as a contractual obligation, and make a mockery of good, solid songwriting and recording. It is, to be blunt, a waste of both the performer's and the listener's time.","Look, I know you're thinking about buying that new Airport 5 record. You saw it at the record store ...

Meet Yr Acres,The Capitol Years,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a517ea9e61561daa505c/1:1/w_160/712af723.gif,2002-03-20 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1294-meet-yr-acres/,Full Frame,"Call me old-fashioned, but I'm a big fan of traditional English. I don't mean Shakespearean Middle English or even the formal English used in legal documents and treaties; I'm talking about simple syntax and spelling, and at the very least, some sort of shadow of grammar. Of course, I'm not perfect myself-- I use sentence fragments all the time in my own reviews-- but I usually try, anyway. I guess it's just a byproduct of our age and imperfect educational system that a lot of people simply don't write very well. People either haven't learned how to write correctly, or just don't take the time to check themselves. I get dozens of emails each week that don't even begin to resemble popularly accepted grammatical structures-- hell, just look at the angriest responses in our reader mail section for a veritable museum of mangled usage. All of this fogeyish complaining stems from reading the title of this album, the debut from the Capitol Years. Confession: it doesn't make a damn bit of difference whether or not this guy spells the title of his album Meet Your Acres or Meet Yr Acres, but I'll be honest and say that it just bugs the crap out of me. I lay the blame for all this sans-vowel spelling of ""your"" on Sonic Youth, who probably weren't the first to use it, but definitely helped popularized it in the underground during the 80s. Lest I waste any more of your time with my obsessive rambling, though, let's have a look at the record. First, let's mention that the Capitol Years isn't a band. Rather, it's a Philadelphia man who calls himself Shai, Son of Eli. You can make your own judgment about that. He variously gives himself credit for each of the instruments heard on the record, placing his name several times over a series of photos of adorable horses-- it's actually pretty endearing. Shai also shares recording and mixing credits with Thom Monahan of Pernice Brothers fame, which gives him something close to autocratic control over the making of the entire record. Of course, it takes a remarkable brand of artist to make a truly great recording with little to no outside aid, and let's just say that Shai isn't quite there yet. Based on the evidence presented here, he may get there someday soon, but all this album shows is a promising talent still in its infancy. Shai and Monahan have managed to make the album sound excellent, and the songs flow together pretty well on the whole. The meat of any rock record has to be in the songs, though, and while it all may sound great, most of the songs Shai has cooked up here aren't really that amazing, though not for lack of trying. Songs like ""May"" and ""Sitar Fixer"" develop unexpectedly away from their basic rock premises into more dissonant territory, while ""Faces and Beer"" is a highlight with its waltz beat and cleanly strummed guitars. ""Faces and Beer"" contains one of the album's best melodies, and Shai delivers it ably, harmonizing with himself and keeping the feel laid back. It's nice, but the problem is that it doesn't really go much of anywhere. It's verse after verse after verse, and it doesn't have a strong enough chorus to justify the lack of other sections. ""Siamese Suns"" is somewhat similar in structure, but includes an acoustic guitar part that nicely answers the understated verse melody. It's actually somewhat close to Elliott Smith's Kill Rock Stars output, with a quiet grace that suits Shai as a performer quite well. ""Rolling Hills"" follows with a similarly pastoral vibe, though it's locked into a more standard rock groove. The processed vocals in the chorus, which consists solely of the lyric ""come on, come down,"" resembles Mark Linkous playing it straight, while the massed Shais that echo the line in the background sort of sound like they wandered off from Mott the Hoople's ""All the Young Dudes"" sessions. The album's folk-inflected midsection is definitely its best swath, and the other sections that surround it are plagued by a kind of facelessness that keep them from sticking. ""Roller's Row"" opens things with off-kilter harmonies and a restrained rock feel that sort of resembles the Shazam with a lot less personality, while ""Here Comes..."" makes employ of that distorted Sparklehorse vocal sound to little effect. It's the kind of thing that could be great if the writing were more consistently memorable. The harmonica solo at the end adds a good texture, but nothing substantial musically. Then there's the aforementioned ""Sitar Fixer,"" which begins over strummed acoustic guitar with a repetitive melody before a tuneless, heavily distorted guitar invades things and the drums come way up in the mix, playing a disjointed beat. It's unexpected and even kind of interesting, but it doesn't seem to serve much of a purpose-- the song doesn't build to its ending naturally, and once the dissonant section does arrive, it's not developed beyond a short, repeated passage. On the other end of the album, ""What's Yr Problem?"" is a fairly inconsequential instrumental featuring layered guitars over a programmed beat. It functions well as a textural exercise, but as a piece of music it's aimless. This brings us to the closer, a faithfully rendered cover of the Velvet Underground's ""All Tomorrow's Parties."" It feels considerably folkier in his hands, given that he uses predominantly acoustic instrumentation, and even if he can't spell ""your,"" his pronunciation is certainly better than Nico's. All in all, though, the version is pleasant without adding anything to the original or making any attempt to reinterpret it. So there you have it. Meet Yr Acres shows a young artist with a ton of potential doing what young artists with a ton of potential often do-- making a spotty but competent debut album. Obnoxious spellings aside, there aren't many glaring faults to be found with the Capitol Years' sound, just some areas that could use improvement. Here's hoping the next record lives up to its potential, and maybe works on its spelling a bit.","Call me old-fashioned, but I'm a big fan of traditional English.

12 (+1) Imaginary Views,Ellery Eskelin,by: Dominique Leone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bca4c0084474cd0c2b25/1:1/w_160/22e49d87.jpg,2002-03-19 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2833-12-1-imaginary-views/,Hatology,"""Post modernism"" is already a maligned enough generalization that critics hate using it as much as musicians hate being labeled as such. Over the past twenty years or so, what was once a sly reference to integrating the mundane into Real Art has become a catch-all for anything that quotes lines from Coke ads or after-school specials. I don't believe it was ever supposed to be a joke (though irony must have figured in somehow), but now when I hear musicians strutting their pop culture stuff, it provokes slight annoyance and suspicion more than any kind of serious attempt to find meaning in their second-hand statements. Of course, there are exceptions to this: Beck's often interesting (and sometimes contrived) AM Gold amalgams, John Zorn's manic Saturday morning freak-outs, and the downright odd cinematic society collages of David Lynch. Some might argue that these artists are famous enough that their work has, by definition, surpassed the whole idea of ""post modernism"" and is merely ""modern."" Others might claim that their fondness for iconic imagery and reference is actually a crutch to disguise their lack of originality (and I have heard that criticism, ridiculous as it is). But really, my only qualm with someone like John Zorn is not that he depends too much on the mundane-- it's that he doesn't spend enough. It's as if he has a disability to remain fixed on one aspect of his work long enough to maintain a clear relationship to anything, and rather bounces like a mosquito from bright spot to bright spot. It makes for very interesting music, albeit often frustratingly flighty. Saxophonist Ellery Eskelin may yet be the supreme prophet of the ""post-modern"" in music. This is a man who has seemingly taken it upon himself (and conspirators Jim Black and Andrea Parkins) to find the missing link between jazz, rock, electronic music, pop and plain old everyday static. Where fellow New Yorkers like Zorn or Tim Berne might take the high road by writing unplayable tunes with insane levels of intensity, Eskelin organizes improvisational sessions for his band to summarize the chapters of their backgrounds-- all of which are considerably varied. Eskelin is also not afraid to play music that is superficially ""familiar""; i.e., many of his tunes sound like things you would hum on your own, like melodies everyone knows without ever having been expressly taught. The trio that made this album (the seventh in a series, part of a development program for the Swiss hatOLOGY label) has been together since 1994. Eskelin had previously issued several solo albums, in addition to gaining fairly widespread exposure with drummer Joey Baron's Barondown project. Percussionist Jim Black came to New York from Seattle in the early 90s, getting his biggest props with Tim Berne's Bloodcount (he's since become arguably the most in-demand experimental percussionist in New York), and keyboardist/sampler player Andrea Parkins has made her name with Eskelin's group and for solo performances. Together, they form one of the most interesting units in jazz, and if there is any justice, they'll find more funding to continue this series of recordings (their grant only ran through 2001). Similar to previous albums in the series, 12 (+1) Imaginary Views calls on the collective experiences of the players to feed the music. Eskelin's heavy jazz background (he studied with Dave Liebman and George Coleman, among others) and knack for penning subtly memorable melodies reminds me of similar strengths of another jazz populist: Thelonious Monk. Like Monk, his music is often simple on the surface, but repeated listens reveal a marvelously advanced efficiency in the arrangements (as a bass-less trio, this is a plus) and compositions. Fittingly, this group plays the old master's ""Oska T"" as a virtual encore at the end of the disc. The anthemic ""Opener"" describes its purpose as the first track, and wastes no time in starting the show. Black is all over the kit, and if you haven't had the sincere pleasure of hearing him play, by all means obtain this record. The man is a genius, and certainly deserves more space than can be allotted in this review to espouse on his imaginative, virtuosic playing. Eskelin's repetitive (and forcibly catchy) melody is supported by Parkins' accordion patch. Furthermore, though I took this stuff without so much as a second thought, I would be hard-pressed to say what kind of music they were playing. It wasn't really jazz (where's the ""swinging"" and solo section signpost?), certainly not rock (even though Black is terribly fond of dropping mad beats all over the place), maybe a bit influenced by Balkan rhythms and textures, but not really. Best of all, this lack of a label applies to every second of music on the album. ""Four Chords"" features more hard beats by Black, and like the title says, Parkins giving you four chords on the piano. There are a few dozen other things in there, too, such as what sounds like Eskelin running his horn through a sewer pipe while playing ""Flight of the Bumblebee."" ""Low(ly)"" is the first tune to really take advantage of the wide array of electronic effects at Parkins' disposal. It begins with a spooky backdrop that sounds like a chorus of flies, and leads to very aggressive piano/organ improvisation. Soon, Eskelin enters over the by-then restrained organ, playing relatively straightforward solo lines, reminiscent of his old mentor Liebman (who was, in turn, following late-period Coltrane). What first seemed like an exercise in Artistic Electronic Composition ends up an abstract funeral dirge. Elsewhere, they kick out the jams: ""Plastiche"" makes life all the more worth living about three minutes in when it hits on the fucked up beats and super James Bond-style suspense melodies. All praise be to Black! They pull a similar trick on ""Grafik,"" but wait until four minutes into a hefty improv session to hit you. ""Modular"" may be the best groove on the album, though I can only describe the opening as Kiss trying to play an Ornette Coleman tune. They stretch out the middle with some rather hectic impressionism (sounds like a hurricane to me), and nail the tune to the wall at the end like be-bop Ruins. I could go on about how the best stuff here was actually the softer, yet more detailed electronic pieces like ""Naked Eye"" or gorgeous minimalism of ""Combulatory,"" but hopefully you'll just go out and pick up the disc to hear for yourself. Eskelin doesn't quite get the headlines of some of his New York compatriots, though it certainly isn't for lack of experience or creativity. Maybe the jazz instrumentation throws off all but the hardcore improv-philes, or maybe people just don't have time for more than one or two downtown New York sax players. Whatever the case, I can safely say that anyone missing Eskelin and his band of real modernists is missing quite a lot.","""Post modernism"" is already a maligned enough generalization that critics hate using it as much as musicians hate being labeled ...

I Blame the Scenery,Reuben's Accomplice,by: Kevin Adickes,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2659d034d5c69bf2bb2/1:1/w_160/df19b230.jpg,2002-03-19 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6769-i-blame-the-scenery/,Better Looking,"Pitchfork is now officially at Defcon 3. Over the years, our mailboxes have been perpetually packed with hundreds of virtually indistinguishable emo releases, leaving our synonyms for the word ""whiny"" all but exhausted. Therein lies the greater problem: the standard emo review has become just as formulaic and uninspired as the insipid genre which it criticizes. One can only invoke the American Music Club so many times before carpal tunnels claims and recasts his cramped hands as veritable claws, eternal tokens of his crusade against all that aches of unwieldy derivation. Luckily, we found someone to stand in for Brent, but it goes without saying that our once proud emo reviews are quickly losing their potency in light of the cancerous popularity our sworn enemy is enjoying. My first instinct upon hearing Reuben's Accomplice was to a create a review comprised solely of cut-and-pasted excerpts from our archive as a sort of social commentary on ""unabashed genre-bashing as critical synapse."" Instead, I've come to the, admittedly, self-serving conclusion that ""if Reuben's Accomplice don't contribute anything discernibly different from their peers, I shouldn't feel obligated to break from those traditions indigenous to my people."" I Blame the Scenery, at its best, is an unpretentious exercise in puerility that yearns for the days of jilted playground love. Unfortunately, whatever traumatic experiences culminated in the group's desire to make this kind of music seem to have stunted their musical and lyrical growth, which are firmly mired in the politics of junior high. Opting to approximate the callow self-centeredness of pubescence is not a crime in and of itself. Rather, it's the poor handling of the simple subject matter that damns Reuben's Accomplice as just another M2 flavor of the week and makes I Blame the Scenery an often grating listen. Opening shows for the similarly marketed Jimmy Eat World might have influenced the songwriting. Throughout the course of the album, the Accomplice shed any distinguishing structural deviations and reveal themselves as exact carbon-copies of their more commercially inclined emo counterparts. But what Jimmy Eat World haven't mastered is the art of cramming as many clich√©s as possible into the smallest given area, something Reuben's Accomplice accomplish with commanding authority on ""Fireworks."" In short, the song's a meditative, mid-tempo nostalgic trip about a ""brown-sweatered"" girl who singer Jeff Bufano saw ""smile under the fireworks"" one evening. She is urged by Bufano to come back and ""work it out."" There's a fine line between disarming simplicity and plain lack of talent. Though Reuben's Accomplice sound like capable musicians, I Blame the Scenery falls into far too many stylistic traps to achieve the emotional impact it intends. Maybe in the future, Bufano and company will overcome their drama and record something that doesn't send people through a painful series of winces. And who knows? If they wish upon a falling star, all their dreams might just come true! Anything is possible!","Pitchfork is now officially at Defcon 3.

Natural Born Chaos,Soilwork,by: Cory Byrom,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a4a313d1975652138d64/1:1/w_160/6d4ede9b.jpg,2002-03-19 06:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7317-natural-born-chaos/,Nuclear Blast,"Let's face it: Meshuggah are the kings of Scandinavian metal. They're better than At the Gates; they're better than the Haunted; lord knows they're better than Children of Bodom; and, you might not have the balls to say it, but fuck it, I do: they're better than Entombed (past and present). How can I make such a bold statement? Easy. One word: originality. Meshuggah doesn't sound like anyone else. Sure, there are influences, but, as Robert Urich's main man Emeril would say, they kick it up a notch. Now, Soilwork-- they're no Meshuggah. But they're close. Damn close. In fact, they even reinvent some of Meshuggah's greatest attributes just to drive that point home. Sure, the guitar solos echo Fredrik Thordendal's, and even Bjorn Strid's vocals have taken on a Jens Kidman-like affectation, but with enough quick stops and starts to put you in a neckbrace and a sonic assault as raw as a head of lettuce, Natural Born Chaos stands as their tightest and most pummeling record yet. The fact that it tops 2000's staggering The Chainheart Machine is only icing (but victorious icing, after last year's spotty A Predator's Portrait). The one thing Soilwork has working in their favor that Meshuggah don't, though, is a goddamned sense of melody. I know what you're thinking, but yes, there's plenty of room in metal for melody. Ask Steve Fucking Harris if you don't believe me. Soilwork switches back and forth between completely brutal thrash metal to melodic power metal without so much as battering an eyelash. All of the key elements to a good metal record are here: it's crunches and grinds with growling verses and anthemic choruses, and of course, there are those glorious fucking guttural, demonic invocations that, in some other genres, are referred as ""vocals."" There are even keyboards, for Christ's sake! I'm talking good atmospheric shit, too, not that overbearing, in-your-face classical crap Enchant forces on the Dream Theater pansies. (Think ""Separate Ways,"" not ""The Final Countdown."") In fact, the only real drawback to the record as a whole is that some of its songs just sound like the old Soilwork. Imagine if you were halfway through a listen to the Flaming Lips' The Soft Bulletin, and right in the middle they threw in some stuff from Hit to Death in the Future Head. Don't get me wrong, Hit to Death is a damn good album, but you know, you don't get that kind of contrast on records we in the business would call ""classics."" Natural Born Chaos peaks with the back-to-back shrapnel-spitting of ""As We Speak"" and ""The Flameout."" Both are incredibly dense and heavy, and somehow also maniacally catchy-- a combination that has evaded most of the strongest Swedish metal bands going. Also, it should be noted that ""Mindfields"" has one of the coolest pauses I've heard in a while (who doesn't like a good pause?). The only two songs that most readily come to mind as being misses are the title track (which could nearly make it onto MTV if it rode out its opening rhythm), and the closer, ""Song of the Damned,"" which anticlimactically loses some of the steam the rest of the album had built up. But I only name those two songs because I feel like I have to name something. They're not actually bad songs. They're just not quite as mind-altering as some of the others. And ""Song of the Damned"" is a kinda dorky name. Whatever.","Let's face it: Meshuggah are the kings of Scandinavian metal. They're better than At the Gates; they're ...

Stateless,Early Day MinersUnwed Sailor,by: Jason Nickey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bbe5abf31b7dc7155bca/1:1/w_160/c3ebc08d.gif,2002-03-19 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2655-stateless/,The Great Vitamin Mystery,"Musical collaborations are a risky business. Even if the artists involved are brilliant, there's a tendency for them to sink to the lowest common denominator during the recording process, resulting in albums that are either lifeless bores or cartoonish fiascoes. Just look at the Mick Jagger/David Bowie abomination ""Dancing in the Streets"" if you need proof of the latter. This, of course, is a worst-case scenario, but it just goes to show that you've gotta be careful when looking to collaborative albums for your musical fix. In the rare cases where they work, they offer something distinct. Combining to create a special chemistry, each extracts something from the other that otherwise affect the music-- for example, say, Waylon and Willie, or, uh, John Denver and the Muppets. Stateless is a three-way collaboration between the Seattle/Chicago-based instrumental trio Unwed Sailor, Indiana's mostly instrumental quartet Early Day Miners, and photographer Chris Bennett. Over the course of a weekend last spring, the two bands got together and dreamt up this score to Bennett's grainy and haunting Super 8 footage, which was filmed on various trips across the United States and Europe. The resulting music is something like Mark Hollis leading Tristeza, though it definitely leans more towards the Muppet end of the above spectrum. Unwed Sailor is still probably best-known because Pedro the Lion's David Bazan once drummed for them, and the driving force behind the band, Jonathan Ford, used to be a member of the storied band Roadside Monument. Likewise, Early Day Miners are still working at shedding the specter of the fabled band from which they sprang: the recently reformed but long-defunct Ativin. Stateless offers five songs, clocking in at a very digestible 30 minutes, a major concern when dealing with music that moves at such a glacier-pace. But, like a glacier, it can be incredibly powerful over time. The songs seem to have been mapped out on the large scale, allowing plenty of room for improvisation within the expanse. There is, however, one actual ""song,"" with vocals from EDM's Dan Burton, that's perfectly placed dead center on the album, creating a nice overall flow and bridging the longer ambient drones and mathy picking that bookend the album. Bennett's film is also included with the disc as a Quicktime file, and I highly recommend watching it along with the music. Although this presents a problem for people like me with horrible computer speakers; music this subtle loses a lot of its character when piped through tiny Koss amplifiers. Of course, you don't get the complete statement without the accompanying images, and to be totally honest, the music doesn't exactly provide a fully encompassing sonic experience on its own. If you've got the proper equipment to witness the A/V assault, Stateless at least offers a fine alternative to the dreck being sent through the digital wires of expanded cable these days. If not, there's always Denver & Henson. ","Musical collaborations are a risky business. Even if the artists involved are brilliant, there's a tendency for them to ...

Under Cold Blue Stars,Josh Rouse,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2b19d034d5c69bf2c6b/1:1/w_160/54e5d8d5.jpg,2002-03-19 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6841-under-cold-blue-stars/,RykoSlow River,"Sigh. The middle of the road. It seems like I find myself here a lot when writing reviews. Sometimes I'd rather get one of the pieces of trash from the gutter to review than yet another 5.0-7.0 disc. See, the thing is, listening to these albums over and over again isn't really a chore or anything, but it's the thought that I'm probably not coming back to them any time soon that makes it feel kind of futile. Plus, I just got an out-of-print Long Fin Killie album that I've been wanting to hear for ages in the mail, and this is keeping me from getting to it. Ah, but the show must go on. For without reviews of all albums great and terrible, and everything that falls in between, Pitchfork would not exist. And we couldn't have that now, could we? No, of course not. On with it then. Today's little slab of pavement comes courtesy of Josh Rouse, a young singer/songwriter with two albums and a collaborative EP with Lambchop's Kurt Wagner under his belt-- and, apparently, a lot more where that came from. Let me be forthright: Under Cold Blue Stars is a rather appropriately titled effort that some will delight in and many more will scarcely offer a second thought to. It's by no means a bad record, and there are even several things about it that make it outstanding, but there are just not enough of those things to make it a truly exceptional album. The biggest problem with this album for me is Rouse himself-- not his writing or his composition, but his voice. By and large, Rouse's vocals come off like a less tuneful, more crack-prone Ryan Adams, though, to be fair, it's the old, obviously sincere Ryan Adams he's being compared to here. The problem arises from the fact that Rouse's songs are essentially pop tunes, and they'd be a lot more immediate if someone with a stronger voice were singing them. His skillful lyrics are also frequently shrouded by his delivery, which is a damn shame because I get the feeling that these little vignettes could be quite affecting if properly read. Still, Rouse manages at least a couple strong candidates for a single, with opener ""Nothing Gives Me Pleasure"" and ""Miracle."" After a brief, orchestrated intro entitled ""Twilight,"" the drums kick in with a spirited rhythm and Rouse enters with only a spare keyboard line for support. The vocals aren't great, but the double-tracking on the chorus of ""And don't you know/ Nothing gives me pleasure like you do/ Nothing has the strength to pull me through"" helps considerably. The song is aided by its little sonic nuances, like the little looped guitar sounds in the background and the quietly placed keyboard chords that help contour the verses. ""Miracle"" follows with a breezy keyboard melody and a brisk beat that grabs the ear perhaps better than anything else on the album. Sadly, Rouse's expertly penned vocal melody is actually upstaged by the keyboards, which simply have a more commanding tone. Still, it's a fine song, with a good sense of dynamics in the bridge and an ultimately memorable melody. From there, ""Christmas with Jesus"" enters with some horrid fuzz bass and a less than spectacular melody, and it becomes clear what a mixed bag the rest of the album is going to be. The title track sounds great, with another good keyboard melody, a vague 70s soul feel and some nice vibes work from the Autumn Defense's Pat Sansone. But once again, the vocal melody is compromised by a weak performance. ""Feeling No Pain"" rises prosodically skyward for its chorus: ""Lately I've been feeling no pain/ My heart is wide open, but everything falls into place."" The rest of the song works well enough, but doesn't quite match up to the peak of the chorus. ""Ears to the Ground"" redeems things to some extent, flowing smoothly on a steady groove augmented by hand percussion. The subtle string flourishes and guitar parts in the background are what really make the song, though, as Rouse's voice is merely serviceable in the understated verses. ""Summer Kitchen Ballad"" leaves him alone with an acoustic guitar and some very subtle strings, which is inadvisable at best. As it is, the only reason a lot of this music works in the first place is that Rouse offers a strong rhythmic backing for his songs, and without it, his vocal limitations are all the more painfully noticeable. ""The Whole Night Through"" is a pleasant closer-- Rouse can actually handle the fine melody this time, partly because he sings in a higher register than usual, which sounds a lot more natural. But it's a pleasant cap to a pleasant album that never really rises much above pleasant. The whole record sounds good, and producer Roger Moutenot (Yo La Tengo, Freedy Johnston) should get a certain amount of credit for creating a unified atmosphere for Rouse's songs to live in. Under Cold Blue Stars ultimately ends up describing the sound of the album almost perfectly, and there's something to be said for that. But at the end of the day, Under Cold Blue Stars has me feeling pretty indifferent. The record company's claim that these songs are loosely based around the ""trials and tribulations of a small-town southern couple in the 1950s"" only holds up if you're really looking hard for it, and even then, it seems like a strange claim to make, as the album stands up much better when viewed as a simple collection of ruminations on relationships. This aside, Under Cold Blue Stars stands pretty firmly in the middle of that road I was talking about before, and it's up to you to decide if you want to bother.","Sigh. The middle of the road.

Axis and Alignment,Chicago Underground Duo,by: David M.

Well, there are two paths you can take from here. You can analyze that which made you successful, break it down to its barest parts, and see what makes it tick. But be careful; often, all this overanalysis yields is the painful knowledge that what made your music work was the spontaneity and unbridled creativity that all your careful nitpicking and study would render obsolete. Your other option is the road with the rusty old sign plunked in the ground labeled ""HARD WORK."" That's right: just because you've made it doesn't mean you can take it easy. If anything, you'll have to work even harder, because everything you'll do from this point on will be held up against that last amazing thing you did. Yup, it turns out you're your own worst competition. And worse yet, working hard doesn't even guarantee continued triumph. Take Rob Mazurek and Chad Taylor, for instance. In the mid-90s, these two started a weekly improv gathering at Chicago's infamous Green Mill jazz club, which led to various recorded incarnations as the Chicago Underground Duo, Trio, Quartet, and Orchestra. It's hard to pin down the moment when the Chicago Underground first achieved success. All of its members are all consummate performers, liable to amaze audiences whether they're playing in a hole-in-the-wall jazz venue, a college auditorium, or an oversized rock club. Every album released under the Chicago Underground banner has been undeniably solid as well. So, in a sense, they've been successful all along. But in my mind, the turning point came with 1999's Synesthesia. At times free jazz, and at others as carefully structured as a good book, Synesthesia was a revelation on first listen and it remains absolutely stunning to this day. Last year's Chicago Underground Quartet album saw Mazurek and Taylor supplementing their usual fervent free-jazz explorations with the dignified calm of 1950s bebop-style jazz. Now, the continually evolving duo heads for untraveled territory once more. Mazurek still plays cornet on Axis and Alignment, and Taylor still plays drums and vibraphones, but here they take new chances with different instruments and sounds, with mixed results. ""Average Assumptions and Misunderstandings"" finds cornetist Mazurek plunking away at a piano. First, he interjects quick and staccato, stabbing at the peaceful backdrop created by Taylor's vibraphones. But as he picks deeper notes and the piano begins to resonate, Taylor switches places with him, striking faster and faster at the piano's all-encompassing rumble. ""Memoirs of a Space Traveler"" opens by following the now-familiar Chicago Underground formula for free improvisation-- driving cornet skronks, rapid-fire drums, and a static electronic drones all fight for attention-- only everything collapses halfway through. Mazurek lingers on a note, Taylor strums an acoustic guitar, and a laptop fixates on the synthesized sound of glass breaking. Predictably, neither musician is anywhere near as talented with these new toys as they are with their usual instruments, but the new sounds are a refreshing change of pace after three albums of little more than cornet, vibes and drums. Most notable on Axis and Alignment are the electronics. While the Duo's previous two albums made use of found/manipulated sound and occasional Powerbook flourishes, this release sees them stepping into the forefront. Their role is still mostly minimal, but one can sense a certain confidence. No doubt, Mazurek's work on Orton Socket, his superb solo laptop project released last year on Jim O'Rourke's Moikai label, has made him more comfortable in front of a monitor. In many cases, like the short, introspective number ""Lem,"" the electronic elements are so minimal and atmospheric that they may easily go unnoticed. But later, on ""Noon,"" Mazurek plays with this subtlety, allowing the minimal rumbling in the background to all but conquer the other elements of the song by the time the song ends. The electronics take on a much more structured form on ""Exponent Red"" and ""Two Concepts for the Storage of Light,"" both built around synthesized basslines that seem lifted directly off Isotope 217's Who Stole the I-Walkman?. ""Exponent"" serves as a necessary reprieve from some of the less structured numbers. ""Two Concepts,"" however, is a long track that starts off structured, gets crazy, then calms again over the course of eight or nine minutes. Though a fine piece of music on its own, it seems little more than a failed attempt to replicate the greatness of ""Blue Sparks Form Her, and the Scent of Lightning,"" the stunning opening track from Synesthesia. Where that song took listeners on a literary-style journey, complete with foreshadowing and false climaxes, ""Two Concepts"" seems a bit more content just to stay in one place. For all its great moments, extra flourishes and new explorations, Axis and Alignment never quite matches the gripping nature or the emotional resonance of its predecessor. But Mazurek and Taylor should be commended for branching out, for insisting on trying something new when churning out a replica of past successes might well have seemed easier. It's a tough decision for any artist to make. But then, no one ever said success would be easy.","So, you've achieved success as an artist or musician.

Sleeping on Roads,Neil Halstead,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0495e6ef9596932351c/1:1/w_160/42342ad6.jpg,2002-03-18 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3721-sleeping-on-roads/,4AD,"The limitations of pop terminology being what they are, my use of the word ""dreamy"" may be clouded with unfortunate associations. And what a shame, because if Neil Halstead's career-- from Slowdive to Mojave 3-- were, say, the hint in a ""Super Password"" bonus round, ""dreamy"" would be the $500 answer hiding behind that plastic blue slipcard. (Burt Convy confirmed this late last night when I ran into him at the supermarket. Then he gave me my change and sighed wistfully.) Apparently not content with being the dominant creative force in Mojave 3, Halstead has now launched a solo career. And his first strictly-Neil outing, Sleeping on Roads, is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a pretty dreamy affair. It's the sort of disc you'd want to have on hand for scenic twilight drives (provided you're not the one driving), what with its deft arrangements and mild vocals. It's an easy listen. I took a long, gratifying nap yesterday while this album played on repeat. And if that makes you cringe, you're probably better off spending your money on something a little more upbeat. Like Ida. To be fair, ""See You on Rooftops"" is, by extremely liberal standards, something of a rocker-- a muted, southern-fried electric guitar line seers over sudden bursts of jungle-like breakbeats while warped keyboard tones echo Boards of Canada's signature style. Here, Halstead builds, with the assistance of friends (including fellow Mojave 3/Slowdive bandmate Ian McCutcheon), an expansive sound-- heavy on ambient drones, electronic strings, and celestial sound effects. But ""See You on Rooftops"" and the record's opener, ""Seasons,"" are atypical on an album primarily comprised of the slow and sad (think Nick Drake with a synth), even if some of the more maudlin tracks do integrate off-beat instrumentation. The title song features both banjo and dobro, yet narrowly avoids sounding country. There's also a half-cover of Damien Jurado's ""Ohio"" (Halstead acknowledges borrowing the melody, though he's written a new set of lyrics for it), and a considerable amount of material that sounds just a hell of a lot like Belle and Sebastian, albeit without the lyrical smirk. Sleeping on Roads concludes with the spare, acoustic ""High Hopes,"" one of its most affecting, and depressing, moments. Halstead does tack a happy ending of sorts onto the record, though. After several moments of silence, the listener is treated to a quick taste of some of Neil's trademark dream-pop as the album fades out. The literal closing lullaby-- perfect for a short, sleepy, clever comment before moving onto greener pastures where sheep always jump placidly over flowered hedges. But I'll be direct here: this is a far cry from Neil's artistic apex. Of course, it's comforting to realize he clearly isn't saving his best work for his solo records and thus, holding out on Mojave 3. Which isn't to say Sleeping on Roads is without its charms. But taking into account the sometimes spotty songwriting and its overtly dreamy similarities to Mojave 3 (like if they'd had a back massage and 1200mg's of Valium), there isn't much to save it from solo slump status. I mean, sure, it sounds nice and all, but the guy has records out there like Souvlaki and Ask Me Tomorrow. Trust me when I say you'd rather be listening to those instead.","The limitations of pop terminology being what they are, my use of the word ""dreamy"" may be clouded with unfortunate ...

Surfing on Sine Waves,Polygon Window,by: Mark Richardson,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0dbea9e61561daa4669/1:1/w_160/5f281507.jpg,2002-03-18 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6393-surfing-on-sine-waves/,WarpWarp,"America first caught a whiff of what Richard James had to offer in early 1993, when Warp released the Surfing on Sine Waves album under his Polygon Window alias. Though a few imports had already made a ripple stateside, Surfing on Sine Waves, distributed by TVT, marked the first time a James record could be found at domestic prices. The album was originally one in a line of Warp's ""Artificial Intelligence"" releases, a series that later birthed the much-maligned genre designation ""Intelligent Dance Music."" As part of the label's recent retooling of its catalog for a larger U.S. audience, Surfing on Sine Waves has now been remastered and re-released in the States with the addition of two unreleased tracks from the period. In the wake of 2001's Drukqs, an album most Aphex Twin enthusiasts consider among the man's worst (I'm still waiting for a used copy to show up), it's fun to get reacquainted with the old material, if only to get an idea of what made James such an electronic music icon. Surfing on Sine Waves is rarely rated with the Selected Ambient Works albums or the early singles collected on Classics, but it's still a key record from the era that put James on the map and began the myth-making that would mushroom to Howard Hughes proportions around the time of the ""Windowlicker"" single. Listening to Surfing on Sine Waves in the context of electronic music circa 2002, I get an idea what it must have been like to listen to Buddy Holly in 1970. Naturally, there are both positive and negative aspects to re-experiencing artifacts from an earlier time. While this album is a crude template for what post-rave electronic music would eventually become, there is a charm in its technological na√Øvet√©, and the record's devotion to puritan virtues like chords and tunes is appealing in a post-Autechre world packed with overachieving signal processors. Catchy, melodic and memorable tracks are what made the Aphex Twin so wonderful at his best; Surfing on Sine Waves has a handful of these, albeit in rough, embryonic form. There are basically three kinds of tracks on this record: the hard dancefloor bang, the edgy mid-tempo bounce, and the melodic ambient drift. Bangers like ""Quoth"" and ""Quixote"" are the weakest of the lot to my ears, and they wind up being where the lack of technology is felt most. Though they surely sounded revolutionary on the '93 dance floor, the thin beats have since lost authority and lack the drum programming audacity that James would develop as the 90s wore on. Check ""Isopropophlex"" and ""AFX2"" from the Analog Bubblebath EP and ""AFX114"" from Caustic Window Compilation for far more commanding examples of this sound. The propulsive mid-tempo numbers are what sound most interesting to me now. The sour acid squelch of the Roland TB-303 is the lead instrument on both ""Ut1-Dot"" and the untitled seventh track, with the latter inflating the signature sound to almost comic proportions. Working against the harsh machinations of the 303 are soft layers of keyboards and tinny but gently insistent beats. Sometimes these three components seem to be navigating entirely different but complimentary paths, giving the music an endless, drifting quality. Turns toward the kind of melody that made James famous include the jittery, piano-driven ""If It Really Is Me,"" which sounds like Kraftwerk covering the theme from ""The Young and the Restless"" (that's ""Nadia's Theme"" for those of you without access to Mary J. Blige liner notes). The two unreleased tracks are solid and fit nicely with the original record. ""Portreath Harbour"" is electro with a Middle Eastern tinge, as robotic handclaps compete for space with a melody right out of Lawrence of Arabia. ""Redruth School"" is filled with repeating patterns of percussion, with a faux-xylophone sequence providing counterpoint to the mournful synths.

Big Tobacco,Joe Pernice,by: Brad Haywood,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a03e5e6ef9596931feda/1:1/w_160/894fca78.jpg,2002-03-17 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6242-big-tobacco/,GlitterhouseGlitterhouse,"It seems like Joe Pernice has been around forever. Fact is, though, Pernice first moseyed onto the scene in 1995 as a member of the Scud Mountain Boys, a moderately acclaimed alt-country troupe on Sub Pop famous for their break-up-sex anthem ""Grudgefuck."" After three LPs with the Boys, Joe took an artistic side-step into the world of classic pop (think the Beach Boys and the Byrds meet Elvis Costello), founding the Pernice Brothers. Their first LP, Overcome by Happiness, was met by mixed reviews, most somewhat critical of the album's inconsistency. Last year's superb The World Won't End silenced the earlier criticism, cutting out most of the flat spots from the debut, while retaining and multiplying its highs. Between the two Pernice Brothers releases, however, Joe recorded a couple of side projects: Chappaquiddick Skyline and Big Tobacco. Big Tobacco, reissued by his Ashmont label in 2001, stands apart from the majority of side projects, mostly because it sounds nothing like one. The tunes, although originally slated to comprise the fourth Scud Mountain Boys LP, are all instantly reminiscent of the Pernice Brothers, except with a little less grandeur (i.e. no string arrangements), and an even more apparent moodiness. One of the most welcome similarities is the production quality. Pernice's bandmate, Thom Monahan, produced Big Tobacco (with Joe's assistance), and shows a keen ear for classic pop, directing firm, clear rhythm lines and complementary guitar accompaniment. The simplicity in the background places all of the focus on Joe's voice (a great one), melodies and lyrics. This is also where the album either rises or falls. The opener, ""Prince Valium,"" is one of the stronger tracks on the disc, employing a very familiar four-chord progression and a song-structure a bit more dynamic than most on the album (like the tasteful bridge where the band cuts out, leaving only drums and six-string acoustic). The chorus is also a winner, both the peppy melody and Pernice's typically somber lyrics (""Because the cure is long in coming, and it never lasts so long/ Guess a little was just a little too much to ask you for/ Always knew you'd be going, but I did not know just when/ So help me, Lord, get me stoned again""). ""Bum Leg"" is another good one, spinning a convincing story of violence and despair (""Got a rattle in my chest, the way it sounds, like a barrel full of broken bottles rolling the through the night, hitting every fucking pothole in this town"") over western-flavored orchestration that somehow avoids sounding clich√©d. The opening to ""Undertow"" replaces the kit with kettle drums, which, with a Beatles-esque guitar progression, forms an odd but successful rhythm track. The strength of the song, as usual, comes with the lyrics: ""Stuck in the undertow/ Stuck in a rut you dug all your own/ Too high to make it home and you fall/ Anywhere you're standing/ It's never going to be that easy again/ From now they always go down screaming/ Once you could hide it well, now it shows/ Everybody knows the bloom is off the rose."" Even when nothing else goes right, Pernice's lyrics almost bail him out on their own. The man has a way with words. If you've heard Joe Pernice, you know what you're getting with Big Tobacco-- lyrics-focused classic pop, delivered by a talented songwriter and wordsmith. The collection of tunes here may not be quite as punchy or seamless as those on The World Won't End, but they're still a solid, palatable bunch.","It seems like Joe Pernice has been around forever.

Headless Heroes of the Apocalypse,Eugene McDaniels,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c3fec0084474cd0c35c5/1:1/w_160/dd0bef61.jpg,2002-03-17 06:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5180-headless-heroes-of-the-apocalypse/,AtlanticAtlantic,"The screaming face on the cover suggests that this will be some kind of crazy music, cranked up with anger against the Man. Eugene McDaniels-- ""The Left Rev. Mc D""-- has religion in his soul, and you know how wild those guys get. Just dig the Book of Revelations references in ""The Lord Is Back"": ""The lord is mad/ His disposition's mean/ He's travelin' the road of mass destruction."" And this is from 1971, so you can bet that racists, hawks and Richard Nixon are at the top of His shit list. Any thought that this album is a novelty relic wears off, though, when you realize how sincere and frequently great it is. Headless Heroes of the Apocalypse has been a lost vinyl classic since it came out thirty years ago, and this reissue has been trickling into record stores since sometime last year. The record is an eclectic mix of soul, funk, and even folk, with a crack jazz band backing McDaniels-- a jazz singer himself in the 60s, and a hit songwriter and producer in the 70s. It's attracted less attention and support than the reissue of Shuggie Otis' Inspiration Information, but it has its own legend: allegedly, it went out of print because Spiro Agnew himself called Atlantic Records to complain about the content, and Atlantic stopped promoting the album. This is hard to believe-- Agnew should have had bigger problems than bullying artists, but more importantly, McDaniels' lyrics actually sound more concerned than angry. He rages against injustice but he's more interested in hope: even as God prepares for Judgment Day, McDaniels reminds us, ""His smile is warm and soothing/ As the morning light."" Rather than targeting anyone to hate, McDaniels tries to protect us and warn us, as on the title track: he pleads with warring sides-- ""Jews and the Arabs,"" ""Left wing and right wing,"" ""Niggahs and crackers""-- to get them to see that they're pawns: ""We are the cannon fodder."" The earnest cry of the chorus, ""Better get it together and see what's happening,"" emerges from a real love. On the gorgeous ballad ""Freedom Death Dance"" he chides us for looking away: ""Everyone wants piece of mind/ Everybody says we should ignore/ The graves we dance upon."" McDaniels' smooth tenor, while technically not one of the best, is direct and empathetic-- he's a preacher, a favorite uncle and the off-the-wall guy sitting next to you at the bar. Which is why McDaniels comes across not as an extremist or as some kind of character, but as a pretty reasonable guy. He sings about war, but he also sings an acoustic folk song, ""Susan Jane,"" about getting it on with a rich, crazy hippie girl; and there's ""Supermarket Blues,"" which recounts how he got in a racially motivated fight over a can of peas. The late-60s/early-70s era also informs ""Lovin' Man,"" a song about an extremely mortal Jesus-- a ""sensuality seeker"" whose message of spiritual and physical love could get him in trouble with ""the pigs."" Yet the album doesn't really sound dated until the last track, ""The Parasite (for Buffy)"" (Sainte-Marie?), a ten-minute tribute to the Native Americans that ends abruptly in a freak-out: McDaniels starts to scream with horror at their plight and the band jumps to frantic noise. The clamor may be abrupt to modern ears, but as always, his heart is in it. As great as the lyrics are, Headless Heroes of the Apocalypse's resurgence can be credited to the terrific music. The album has been prized and sampled by the hip-hop community for years: that ""get it together"" line should be familiar to most of you (from the Beastie Boys' Ill Communication, if nothing else) and ""Freedom Death Dance"" shows up on the first A Tribe Called Quest album. McDaniels taps some great musicians: the rhythm section includes Gary King (Idris Muhammad, George Benson) on electric bass, plus Weather Report members Miroslav Vitous on upright and Alphonse Mouzon on drums. Mouzon particularly stands out, with crisp drumwork that's seamlessly integrated but breaks out all over the place. The band can play it smooth on the slower ""Jagger the Dagger"" or ""Freedom Death Dance,"" or lift ""Headless Heroes"" on Richie Resnikoff's guitar and Harry Dhitaker's electric piano. The album sounds so ebullient, you almost forget that McDaniels' message of love comes wrapped around the evils of racism, ethnic conflict and the bomb-- and it's that shout at the end of ""The Parasite"" that knocks you awake again, and summons up that wrath he was warning about earlier. All the problems McDaniels sings about are still going on, and what was that about Judgment Day coming soon? Is Spiro Agnew dead yet? Maybe it's not too late to save him.","The screaming face on the cover suggests that this will be some kind of crazy music, cranked up with anger ...

Album: * Pimps Don't Pay Taxes * __ I feel so weird doing this! I usually have no problems meeting people in bars, but my friend dared me to try Pitchfork Personals, so here I am. But please, ladies, if you don't have a picture, don't bother replying. Beats are the number one priority in my life. If you like creative beats, you'll like me. Besides for beats, I also like Red Lobster, Lucy Liu and unprotected sex. Rhymes and lyrics are important, but I don't mind sharing-- I do it all the time with my friends Huggy and Al-Shid. But regardless of who's on the mic, the rhymes are raw (sex, underage sex, unprotected sex, and other variations on the theme), tight as shit, and damn funny (""You make as much noise as En Vogue without Dawn""). I don't care about being a hip-hop purist. I don't care what hip-hop is ""all about."" I am about starting a fucking party. Maybe even a ""fucking party,"" if you give up some of that ass. Like I was saying before, beats mean so much to me. I need someone who can handle beats being number one in my life. They truly are my passion. The ladies tell me I have kind of an Automator thing going. Fuck that. I don't do that grandiosity and sophistication bullshit-- I'm about the ghetto and, if you're nice, I can be real playful. See, name-dropping don't cut it with me. I'm unique. Check the blundering samples on ""Q&A;"" and ""Live from Pimp Palace East""-- the carnival quality of something lifted from an episode of ""The Three Stooges"" or ""Keystone Cops."" Girl, who does this? All I'm saying, the shit is dope. And I got more where that came from. Check ""The Bum Bitch Ballad."" I'm all sampling strings and accordions, almost to where it brings up visions of a pastoral French landscape. But I don't wanna get too romantic about it, so I play it cool. We wanna have ourselves a good time, not a picnic lunch. So instead of a blanket and an amour, I litter the landscape with the world record for consecutive spoken-word ""bitch"" samples. Take that, France! Even if the beat wasn't so good, the humor of the irony itself is a thing to behold. Later on the album, I get back to strings, but with a spin this time-- ""Fuckin' Up the Money"" (featuring Huggy) combines strings with a howling vocal background. Sounds stark, right, but primed for the dancefloor. Enjoy! Well, maybe I've gained a reputation, but it's not as bad as it sounds: ""I went out on a date with that asshole [J-Zone] once. He took me to Red Lobster, and when the waiter came, he stuck me with the fucking check. He's just mad cuz I never gave him any play. Then he tried to talk to my sister a week later-- yeah, fuck J-Zone."" (from ""J-Zone Fan Club"") I battle my talking dick (a.k.a. Thug Penis, played by Huggy on the ingenious ""The Trojan War""). Last weekend, he got a little pissed that I insisted on unprotected sex: ""You better put a hat on my head, before I play dead/ Like I did the last time to get us both thrown out of bed."" The prick went so far as to threaten me and my nuts with non-performance: ""Even though we're the same age/ I'll cum premature and blame it on the balls."" Y'all are looking for someone with an underground sound and serious street credibility (i.e. if they ever heard me, I would appeal to all motherfuckers). You're sick of MCs pontificating; you know that not every brother has a project-sized political chip on his shoulder, and not every one who doesn't is named Will Smith. So if you fine, baby, and you want a master player, write me back. For real. Im'a get up in that.","Name: J-Zone

Wanna Buy a Monkey?,Dan the Automator,by: Rob Mitchum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a15613d19756521385da/1:1/w_160/3fa9e52c.jpg,2002-03-17 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/374-wanna-buy-a-monkey/,Sequence,"Rock Critic Standby Statement #842: we're now living in the Age of the Producer. It's true. A close look at the pop charts from the last couple of years reveals that today's biggest hitmakers aren't Britney or J-Lo or Madonna, but EQ wizards Timbaland and the Neptunes. Not since the heydays of Motown and Phil Spector have the men behind the board carried such bankability in the industry. Now, more and more, we're seeing these √ºber-producers cutting out the middlemen, releasing albums under their own name or a slight variation thereof (N.E.R.D.). It's no surprise, then, that Dan Nakamura, aka Dan the Automator, aka Nathaniel Merriweather, aka ""dude, that Asian guy from the Gorillaz,"" wants to get in on the action. For the past half-dozen years, the Automator has been the Timbaland/Neptunes correlate for the underground, a knob-twiddling ambassador between the worlds of alternative hip-hop and indie rock. Collaborating with everyone from Kool Keith to Jon Spencer, Nakamura pulls off the seemingly impossible task of retaining his street cred while appealing to the less rap-inclined (pronounced ""white"") crowd whose rap collection doesn't run beyond Ill Communication. I don't hold myself above the latter group: the Deltron 3030 project was one of the few hip-hop albums to penetrate my guitar-loyal musical sensibilities, though that was at least half because I'm a sci-fi geek who enjoys hearing Neuromancer and Gamera name-dropped. I'll even admit to enjoying the Gorillaz album, the singles from which have provided the first digestible MTV fare in years. And frankly, anyone who collaborates with Mike Patton earns a spot on my good list. No matter what the project, the Automator consistently has brought a sound just organic enough, just diversely influenced enough, just ""safe"" enough to catch my ear. So the idea of an Automator-chosen mixtape session, billed as ""a look into my head"" by the man himself, appealed to me. Featuring the likes of Tortoise and Air rubbing up against Brand Nubian and Dilated Peoples, I expected a gonzo display of effortless genre-hopping and style-blending, despite Nakamura not being well-known for his DJ scratching skills. All right, yeah, you know from the rating where this is heading: Wanna Buy a Monkey? didn't live up. Containing a number of selections from the Automator's own projects alongside some of his hand-picked favorites from other artists, Monkey comes off resembling either a padded greatest-hits comp or an ""inspired by"" soundtrack for a non-existent movie. What it certainly isn't is a DJ mix where previously hidden links between seemingly unrelated songs are unearthed through the ancient art of juxtaposition. Part of the problem lies in the musically segregated organization of the album, as the Automator's hip-hop selections are clumped into the front and back, while the indie-friendly picks comprise the creamy center. This allows Nakamura to splice tracks together with minimal segue ingenuity, mostly using the Radio 101 technique of slowly fading in the beat from the on-deck song. Meanwhile, the one opportunity to flaunt high-flying mixing ability, Deltron 3030's ""Positive Contact"" into Air's ""Le Soleil Est Pres de Moi,"" is handled with all the dexterity of a one-armed drummer (Rick Allen notwithstanding). Sadly, these short between-song mixtures, as inventive as they ain't, are the most compelling manipulations of the album. The Automator's additions to the members of his all-star team fall under the categories of near-invisible (the vocal sample added to a portion of Tortoise's ""Seneca"") or distracting (the generic beat and ""one, two"" vocals clumsily added to Air's ethereal ""Le Soleil""). Even Nakamura's own productions (Lovage, X-Ecutioners, an early Black Rob track) are left alone, with only the ""original version"" of Gorillaz' ""Latin Simone"" deviating significantly from the album version. To Dan's credit, Wanna Buy a Monkey? confirms what was already apparent from his own work-- namely, that he has classy and diverse musical taste. There's hardly a disagreeable pick among the sixteen present, and most reflect the same sensibilities Nakamura adds to his own music: live instruments, Latin flavoring, positive lyrical messages. But something tells me I would be more sold on the liner notes' claim that he has ""something very personal to say on this record"" if the artists presented were early influences rather than contemporaries. It's hard to imagine who would want to pick up this disc, as most Automator fans would likely own a majority of the cuts appearing with minuscule changes here. Perhaps Wanna Buy a Monkey? could be justified as a listening guide to point fans towards artists with the Automator stamp of approval, but this goal could have been just as easily accomplished by reading an online interview and booting up your Audiogalaxy satellite. And with almost nothing in the way of imaginative mixing, never mind a $16.99 price tag; Wanna Buy a Monkey? seems nothing more than an early contender for The Onion's ""Least Essential Albums of 2002"" list.","Rock Critic Standby Statement #842: we're now living in the Age of the Producer.\n\ It's true.

All Girl Summer Fun Band,All Girl Summer Fun Band,by: Alison Fields,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a04cc0084474cd0bfb2e/1:1/w_160/9e738792.jpg,2002-03-14 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/113-all-girl-summer-fun-band/,K,"In the early-to-mid 1980s, Mattel released a series of Barbie dolls dressed up in Madonna-esque accessories to capture the imaginations of the MTV generation. The Rockers were an all-female proposition (though, if memory serves, Rocker Ken had some vague role-- drummer, perhaps?), and each doll came with a plastic instrument and an EP-length cassette tape featuring mass-produced, semi-new wave songs about loving to rock. The fortunate girl could get the entire set-up (all the band members, the stage, the backdrop, etc.), play the tape, and live out rock and roll fantasies. Me, I only had two rockers: Barbie and the brunette bassist, whatever her name was. My best friend and I would gather all our rocker paraphernalia and stage elaborate concerts for her brother's action figures. In retrospect, these events had a decidedly Woodstock flair, as He-Man, G.I. Joe, Boba Fett, and the stray Transformer put aside their differences and came together to enjoy Barbie's Greatest Hits. I don't know if the All Girl Summer Fun Band has quite the same unifying effect, though one might imagine their shows as places where ex-riot grrls, giggly teenage hipsters, closet pedophiles, sensitive indie rock boys, and misogynists inclined toward muttering, ""I told you so."" And it wouldn't be much of a stretch to suggest that these Portland girls resemble a lo-fi Barbie and the Rockers: four girls of slightly differing appearances playing cute, G-rated songs about cute boys in cute little girl voices. And it's all informed by 60s Brill Building Girl-Group pop, replete with nods to Brian Wilson. Their music pushes the outside parameters of twee, and ushers the listener into a fantastic world where all the girls giggle and blush at attention, wear polka-dot bikinis and sparkly barrettes, and never kiss and tell. I'm 99% sure the members of the Summer Fun Band are cognizant of the image they're sending out, and I'm positive they expect the listener to enjoy the implicit ironies and delight in the retro-pop sensibilities while imagining the simpler, pre-Riot Grrl days. It's not exactly campy (that would entail maintenance of the beehive hairdos suggested by the salon hairdryer cover art), nor particularly original. Fans of bare-bones pop music might love this-- it's innocuous enough and, as the name suggests, summery and fun. All Girl Summer Fun Band offers thirteen short songs (reminiscent of Cub without the crunch), featuring a minimal three-chord, mid-tempo song structure that varies only on the album's two slow numbers, ""Somehow Angels"" and ""Girl #3."" Beyond that, there's not much to say. ""Theme Song,"" admittedly, features one of the best unanticipated screams I've heard following a bubble-gum chorus of, ""We're the All Girl Summer Fun Band/ La la la la la la."" And ""It's There"" provides a slight variation on the album's continually recycled song structure by tossing in a nice jazzy chorus over which the girls intone, ""Shooby-doo, I've got a crush on you."" No point in getting into the lyrics beyond that, though-- you get the point. For the record, I don't have a problem with this kind of √ºber-simplistic music. In fact, I'm a long time defender of rock and pop music in its purest, three-chord forms. But the girls' overt reliance on self-conscious cuteness really rubs me wrong-- the faux-prepubescent vocals and the coy, deliberately off-key harmonies grate like the Swiss cheese sentiments inherent in the banal lyrics. And maybe my problem is a bit political, too. Women in rock (and particularly women within the male-dominated indie rock sect) are already faced with enough patronizing bullshit, and the All Girl Summer Fun Band not only feeds this mentality, but knowingly plays up to it. Of course, it could be I'm just too old for the kind of all-girl summer fun this band claims to deliver. But the truth is, if I want to listen to shameless pop with an estrogen twist, I'm much more inclined to reach for Destiny's Child. Their music may be equally insipid, but at least you can dance to it.","In the early-to-mid 1980s, Mattel released a series of Barbie dolls dressed up in\n\ Madonna-esque accessories to capture the ...

Spend the Night,The Donnas,by: Kyle Reiter,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9f713d197565213af96/1:1/w_160/d80c0e95.jpg,2003-01-26 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2420-spend-the-night/,Atlantic,"Reviewing music by all-female groups can be a bit of a tightrope walk, especially for male writers. Criticism is often misconstrued, and the mere mention that a group is comprised solely of women can generate an insatiable barrage of hateful e-mails-- ask any writer who's ever tackled a Sleater-Kinney album. I wanted to approach The Donnas without making the obvious ""[70s metal group] fronted by [80s pop diva]"" comparison, and more importantly, I didn't want to objectify the four Donnas as sexual and musical creatures prowling what some mysogynistic critics would refer to as ""a man's jungle."" But after spinning Spend the Night several times, it's clear The Donnas could objectify themselves more in 40 minutes than I could in 900 words. There's a scene in This Is Spinal Tap that I think appropriately relates to The Donnas. It's perhaps a clich√©d reference, but recalling the moment Tap's manager Ian Faith explains that Duke Fame's recent album art isn't sexist because Duke's the one being victimized, there's that famous David St. Hubbins realization: ""There's such a fine line between clever and stupid."" Foolish artistic license overshadows any moral or sexual responsibility, regardless of gender, and while The Donnas may play the role of commanding women in a men's world, their music is too lifeless to sow any inspirational seeds. Make no mistake, Spend the Night defies any post-liberation role reversal debate: The album, both musically and lyrically, is so one-dimensional, it would be equally vapid at the hands of either sex. Sure, The Donnas have chops; Tommy Lee is a pretty fucking good drummer, but that's no reason to buy a M√∂tley Cr√ºe record. The simple fact is, ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" would be just as pointless if it were called ""Boys, Boys, Boys"" and released at the height of schlock-rock's 21st century comeback. The real problem is how The Donnas limit themselves by being ""fun."" No one expects or wants every modern rock album to be a broody, isolated masterpiece, but the songs on Spend the Night revolve (or devolve) around three main themes: 1) Getting liquored up and makin' it with some guy; 2) Getting liquored up and running into some guy that had his chance to make it with The Donnas, but didn't; or 3) Talking trash about some girl that The Donnas don't like, usually because she keeps them from getting liquored up. All of this may sound ridiculous, but that must be the lyrical price you pay for having every couplet on the album rhyme. The ""drinkin' it and makin' it"" image portrayed by The Donnas may be apt due to the career they've made of constant touring, but that doesn't mean anyone wants to hear it sung over every pentatonic riff ever written, thirteen times in a row. As a result of this insipid subject matter, the only thing that came to mind while listening to Spend the Night was Dudley ""Booger"" Dawson's prophetic Revenge of the Nerds exclamation: ""You Mu's sure can party!"" The Donnas regurgitate a plethora of metal riffs, and for some that may be charming, but the music falls flat because the girls take more than just musical cues from the 70s metal-heads-- they embrace their overt use of sexual conquest (or frustration) as subject matter. Without injecting any sort of originality or voice (other than simply being women), The Donnas transform forgettable cock-rock into forgettable tit-rock. If you consider name-checking Boy Scouts, Miss Cleo, and Z. Cavaricci's entertaining, buckle up: You're in for the ride of your life. But there's an aspect of Spend the Night that's even sadder than the music on it: This is The Donnas' fifth album, and they've just now begun to receive airplay on modern rock radio and MTV, without ever changing their sound. Why? Warner Brothers. I guess if you have nowhere else to go musically, and your sound is suddenly ""marketable,"" the only thing left to do is sign to a major label. I'm not one to cry sellout here, though, because for one, they certainly haven't changed their original sound in the name of commercialism, and two, they deserve to be soaked up by the masses. If nothing else, they've paid their dues. I honestly can't figure out if The Donnas have tapped the pure heart and soul of rock 'n' roll and it's just not poignant anymore, or if Spend the Night is one of the worst rock 'n' roll albums I've ever heard. But The Donnas know, and whether rock's dead or not, they're gonna cash a few checks, laughing (at me) all the way to the bank.","Reviewing music by all-female groups can be a bit of a tightrope walk, especially for male writers.\n\ Criticism is ...

Under and In,Glifted,by: Isaiah Violante,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bf3513d197565213b863/1:1/w_160/4ca0f03e.jpg,2003-01-26 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3465-under-and-in/,Martians Go Home,"In the upper echelon of independent noise pop there exists an unassailable group of artists whose albums have essentially paved the way for any and all future experimentation within a pop/rock format. By exploding the typical guitar rock structure with a cataclysm of prepared guitar and computer enhancements, bands like My Bloody Valentine, Lush, and Swervedriver found a means of juxtaposing avant-garde rock with minimalist drone. Finding themselves mislabeled as ""shoegazers,"" these musicians melded the most salient elements of both genres-- a concatenation of tape motifs and the natural timbre of acoustic instruments-- with mesmerizing results. While contemporary acts like Sigur R√≥s and Mogwai have co-opted an ethereal framework (the latter even for a Levi's commercial), these shards of a hypnotic landscape have never quite captured the emotive might of its antecedents. Enter Glifted, a two-piece out of Urbana-Champaign, Illinois, composed of former Hum guitarist Tim Lash and former Lovecup bassist T.J. Harrison. While Lash was relegated primarily to a background figure in Hum, providing skilled guitar ambience and blistering leads behind singer/guitarist/√ºbermensch Matt Talbott, Glifted's Under and In not only establishes Lash's creative brilliance, but kicks the dust off a genre that had lay dormant since Loveless. Indeed, Under and In is so teemed with technical fluency and power that it essentially modernizes and revitalizes the entire shoegazer sensibility. With experimental rock/minimalism stalled under the weight of over-production, theatrical missteps, and lyrical gibberish, Glifted's debut offering manages to inject some excitement into a genre that's found itself on auto-pilot for most of the past decade. Instead of attempting the standard dreamy space-rock aesthetic of comparable modern day acts, Lash and Harrison move in a wholly unique direction. Utilizing a pointedly more minimalist approach to song composition, grouping ample numbers of segmented tape loops a la Terry Riley with a wall of guitar (and effects processors) in tight precision; Under and In sounds like an epiphany. Beginning with the Steve Reich-influenced vocal drone of ""Is There Any Always"", Glifted weaves a creative patchwork of limitless textures and hypnoses built upon an otherwise tenuous foundation of noise and sonic abstraction. With Lash's incoherent vocals sounding like George Harrison on Thorazine, a staccato guitar riff swirls on at perpetuity as Tubeway Army keyboards work their way up the listener's spinal column and into his cortex. T.J. Harrison's searing basslines complement the brutal beat-- the audience is caressed by Lash's ambient drone while simultaneously battered by ferocious percussion. On ""Baby's Blue"", Glifted presents an obvious homage to the likes of Can and Cluster, annealing Harrison's grooving bass with a synthetic wash of ride cymbals, jazzy guitar, and digital manipulation. ""Baby's Blue"" evolves slowly and subtly from a repetitive funk drum pattern, gradually expanding its orchestration before culminating in a flare of synthesizer that nearly drowns the accompanying rhythm. With the Moog finally on the verge of engulfing the song, ""Baby's Blue"" promptly fades out and leads into ""Heavy Ion"", a sub-two-minute instrumental built on a heavily distorted version of the very same bassline. The pairing of these two tracks illustrates Glifted's ability to flesh out thematics by cycling them rapidly through numerous incarnations and styles, one of their strongest attributes. Under and In is an album devoid of wasted notes, self-indulgence, and contrived atmosphere. Every hallucinogenic element seems to flow unconsciously from the ether, titillate, and vanish without a trace. ""Every Single Second"" bears a distinct resemblance to material from Hum's final album, Downward Is Heavenward, but where the 1998 release often stumbled from protracted noodling, ""Every Single Second"" is a concise statement adding The Byrds' psych-rock haze to a sparse Matt Talbott riff. ""Last in Line"" also recalls Lash's work with Hum, but adds levels of subsonic depth and impressionistic harmonic tendencies invisible in the Hum catalog. ""The Ground"" is a throbbing mass of impending hysteria-- a nightmarish maelstrom of seething pink noise, super-colliding vocals and guitars, granulation and reverb. At once beautiful and horrific, ""The Ground"" is both a howling ode to the innovation of Kevin Shields, and a shrieking reproval of his limitations. Parallels will inevitably be drawn between Glifted and Matt Talbott's new band Centaur, who also released their debut album in late 2002. It must be noted, however, that the only case for comparison is the band that put them both on the map. Artistically and dynamically, Talbott and Tim Lash have moved in entirely different directions with ostensibly different objectives. Centaur's In Streams is an excellent rock album demonstrating Talbott's talents as a songwriter, but it suggests no real upward mobility. Tim Lash's Under and In exhibits an understanding of musical plasticity that eludes the former Hum frontman. In taking the anachronism of ""shoegazing"" and fusing it with the ambient plurality of people like Ekkehard Ehlers and Rafael Toral, Glifted have unveiled one of the most compelling noise-pop records I've ever encountered.","In the upper echelon of independent noise pop there exists an unassailable group of artists whose albums have\n\ essentially ...

Cocadisco,The Parallax Corporation,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/59299fed5e6ef9596931fe39/1:1/w_160/408e685c.jpg,2003-01-23 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6164-cocadisco/,Disko B,"If you're all caught up on the Nas vs. Jay-Z beef, perhaps you'd be amused to hear about one in the lovely and dying new-electro scene? I mean, obviously nothing can quite rival the erratic rants and intensities of Nas, but this is a fun one, I swear. Ready? It involves a guy called I/F, or Interr-Ference. We're going to give him a break on the name, half because he's Dutch, and half because that extra R seems trivial in contrast to the name of his partner in The Parallax Corporation, who's called, umm, Intergalactic Gary. I/F is sort of the nominal godfather of the new-electro scene, for two reasons. The first reason is his terrific late-90s cut ""Space Invaders Are Smoking Grass"", which spiked pretty utilitarian techno with the big, dark early-electro and Italo-disco sound that wound up sweeping the nation (assuming that nation is the Netherlands and a big chunk of Germany). The second reason is his great and equally significant Mixed Up in the Hague disc, a set of seminal first-wave electro pieces including the likes of Giorgio Moroder and Kraftwerk. He is, by any estimation, a major source of the Dutch electro scene's current agenda, which is Big, Dark, Epic, and Pounding: the deep noir-disco of fellow traveler Legowelt, for instance, sometimes seems like it might unexpectedly cross over into hard trance. The weird beef starts in because I/F is pretty vocal in his disdain for, from what I can tell, pretty much everything, from the Dutch public to all of the electro he's credited for having spawned. In fact, the press-ready hook for Cocadisco is a big sneering swipe of a track called ""Your Image"", which goes on and on about ""electrocash."" (Sample lyrics: ""Exploiting music for the sake of your fame! Your fashion vision completely misses the point! No respect for music at all!"") It's easy to assume this swipe is directed as much at people like DJ Hell and the International DJ Gigolos-- who've injected star personas and cocaine/limousine antics into the whole electro project-- as it is at technical ""electroclash"" term-coiner Larry Tee, whose Brooklyn scene one Vice reader recently described as having turned into ""a homosexual Star Search."" (The problem with this criticism is that a homosexual Star Search sounds fantastic to me, whereas the bulk of Brooklyn electro does not.) So what exactly, one might ask, is I/F's alternative proposal? In the case of The Parallax Corporation, it's to keep electro strictly pounding and strictly aimed at the dancefloor massive: Cocadisco, as the name sort of implies, is a big utilitarian techno set that stomps along with great dedication to traditional club tropes. Within that milieu it's mostly quite effective: it starts off with the obligatory ""taking you on a journey""-type dialog sample, then kicks immediately into the pretty daunting ""Lift Off"", whose revolving bass grind is like a rollercoaster that keeps climbing until you're a little scared of the upcoming drop-- FC/Kahuna's ""Glitterball"" suddenly seems a bit weak to me now. No deep-dark synth-building here, just upfront, enjoy-the-ride banging. And plenty of the tracks on Cocadisco continue to deliver on that front, though nothing really strives for the energy level of ""Lift Off""-- ""Crocodiles in the Sky"", with vocals from usual I/F collaborator Nancy Fortune, immediately drops the tone back to the types of gridlike grooves Felix da Housecat might drop toward the beginning of a set. Vocalists appear on a lot of tracks, actually: Fortune, Kaori Kuwabara, Helga la Blaque, and, on the hard-disco pop detour, ""Fear"", Guy Tavares. In the end, I/F wanders the slightest bit into more classic-electro territory: ""Slowflight Runner"" verges into Legowelt's realm, its smooth electro stride underpinning a number of synth workouts, and the organic percussion breaks on the closing ""Theme from Pack (Remix)"" are actually half of why it wouldn't sound so out-of-place among the vintage selections on the next Mixed Up in the Hague volume. But forgive me: The whole ""electrocash"" rant raises the standards on this sort of thing. Would I rather dance to the tracks on Cocadisco than I would to half of the electroclash coming out of the U.S.? Without question. Would I rather dance to them than the stuff coming from International DJ Gigolos? Sometimes, though I don't think the gulf between the two is quite as wide as I/F would like to think it is. Nevertheless, there's something deeply offputting about I/F's sort of prudish traditionalism here: he's delivered a very solid collection of utilitarian, floor-oriented techno-electro-disco, but holding that up as some sort of ""about the music"" victory seems as pointless as rock fans getting upset about pop stars and drum machines. So, decent work, I/F-- only next time, mouth shut!","If you're all caught up on the Nas vs. Jay-Z beef, perhaps you'd be amused to hear about ...

Live at Convocation Hall,Hayden,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929c0805e6ef95969323568/1:1/w_160/2e9f6b98.jpg,2003-01-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3773-live-at-convocation-hall/,Badman,"Celebrate freedom, freedom-style!

If you had an iffy voice, wrote really simple songs, and were fresh from a stunning full-band effort, would you hurl a 'stripped-down,' 22-track concert recording at the world? Would it seem logical that folks would clamor for a stunning showcase of performance and sound, with Hayden reducing his favorites to an ""unplugged"" acoustic guitar or solo piano format? Well, it's the equivalent of Achilles showing off his new stirrup pants, as... 2. Yawn. O Canada, where is thy sting? Bowling for Columbine might have made a skewed argument for your level-headedness, and Destroyer and Hot Hot Heat may be recent proof that you have a musical pulse, but damn if Hayden's live-in-Toronto double-disc doesn't further the U.S. view of our northern neighbor as an MOR wasteland. This concert teems with kinda-okayness, betraying the extra-special cloud-folk of Hayden's last studio release. The merely passable pre-Skyscraper National Park lyrics, when combined with this show's cute live banter and cute photos, result in an album too precious to soundtrack a rightfully complicated relationship, but too humble and likable to accuse Hayden of being a self-serving document of snowed fans' worship..."" 3. Dear Diary: Lookin' good! Hey, I have questions tonight. Does a world charged with the confident riffage of Liars or the hurry-up-and-do-me bounce of ""electroclash""-- among a zillion other pyrotechnic would-be revolutions-- still have a place for authors of imploding ballads about holding hands? What did Schoenberg mean when he said, ""If it is art it is not for all, and if it is for all it is not art?"" What did Sibelius mean when he said, ""No one ever put up a statue of a critic..."" 4. Hayden's been successfully scraping off his silly baby fat over the course of his recording career. The early records were immaturely earnest and ""sensitive,"" with bizarre outbursts of death-howls: the instant we heard his crazy, screaming song, sung from the vantage point of murderous South Carolina mom Susan Smith's drowning children, some friends and I spent an evening blasting it from a convertible pickup, then sat down to record a spoof. The Closer I Get boasted a pretty good hit-to-sap ratio, and then, like whoa, Hayden's Skyscraper National Park was revelatory-- an ideal album for anyone not yet bored with the sound of an act tiptoeing around alt-country's pit of despair. No kidding, Skyscraper came in at sweet 16 on my personal Top 20 of 2002, an important list which hangs framed in the room where my stuffed animals and I convene as the United Nations of Rock, trying to embargo that wily Cobra Commander into disarmament... 5. ""Until Skyscraper National Park, Hayden's work had been comparable to a blah veggie: not unhealthy, kind of beautiful in its lumpiness, hard to love, and hard to hate. The monotonous stretches of this concert package make it difficult to feel anything about him at all. The proceedings lack a transporting element; if this disc is playing while one is stuck in traffic, one will feel very much stuck in traffic... 6. A guy installed a heater at my house today. His skin was pachyderm-wrinkled. He told me stories about gas explosions. His assistant told me about working in paper mills, about people getting dismembered by steam leaks, about a lancer whose back melted because he worked without an asbestos suit. An acquaintance that works as a corrections officer told me about a riot he had to help suppress. Reviewing CDs is wimp's work, yo, especially if I'm supposed to be summarizing a puss like Hayden... 7. Stay on the scene like a stats machine: Number of songs from Skyscraper National Park: 8
Because these are the best songs Hayden has written, these are the best songs here, though they're robbed of their warm drums and rich tones. ""Bass Song"" is a tense charmer, a well-told tale of being broken in on and beaten. Number of songs from The Closer I Get: 3
Watch out for that dreadful part about teaching the girl to play guitar (""Between Us to Hold""): it's more about the speaker than the girl. Opening line: ""I taught you to play guitar last night."" Last lines: ""I held your arm as you hit the strings/ I pressed your fingers down and started to siii-hiiiing/ Siii-hiii-hiiing."" The listener can picture Hayden's arms around this girl like those of a randy tennis instructor from an 80s movie. The crowd eats this one up. Number of songs from Moving Careful: 2
Decent genre soundalikes. Number of songs from Everything I Long For: 4
""Bad as They Seem"" is the one about the sixteen-year-old, y'all. Let whosoever is without sin, etc. Number of Neil Young covers: 1
The high voice that frequents Skyscraper tipped me off that Neil's dogs had treed Hayden, but good. Julie Doiron and Howie Beck join the junior shakey on a frumpy ""Tell Me Why"". Number of songs featured in films: 1
Trees Lounge was a nice fit for Hayden's penchant for blending sloth and heart. I mean, the guy sings like Cat Stevens abusing muscle relaxants. Number of new songs: 3
""Holster"" (about a duel) and ""Woody"" (even though it's about Hayden's cat) rule the show, along with the dark stuff from Skyscraper. These unstoppably catchy tunes will yank your beltloop, promise. 8. Hayden has his uses. Everybody gets crippled by nostalgia or romantic curiosity, I reckon. Everybody needs some music for those moments when they can't muster the energy to poke a straw into a Capri-Sun. And most males have been guilty of mythologizing their obsessive behavior in their apartment building, as Hayden does. He's just so bald about it, so self-explanatory.

Touching Down,Roni Size,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a43fea9e61561daa4e71/1:1/w_160/8e2af734.gif,2003-01-23 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/7218-touching-down/,Full Cycle,"God, I don't even know where to begin. And it's not even that there's a lot to talk about, because there isn't: Roni Size's new album is vapid, boring and uniform. He's ditched Reprazent and all of his other various hangers-on and decided to go solo, just him, his mixing board and some sequencers, and cranked out a drum 'n' bass album, just in time for the drum 'n' bass revolution that ended half a decade ago. ""Oh, be nice,"" you say. To which I say, ""No."" Size used to make interesting music, or at least music you could sit in your house and listen to without heavy sedatives. New Forms, anyone? That's a cool record. Absent sweaty masses grinding and gyrating on a dancefloor and freaky light shows, there's no substance to Touching Down; parts of it are even hard to dance to, and there's never any intellectual injection to compensate for the lack of kinetic energy. The album actually starts off almost promisingly with ""Sound Advice"", where staticky radio surfing and muffled vocal interjections course over a thin, programmed beat. This quickly moves into a second section with a fake harp and swooshy background, conjuring phrases like, ""You are getting sleepy,"" and, ""Next time, on Nova."" Still, the bass is live-- played by Richie Glover-- and the beat is solid, instilling some hope for an interesting ride. Then, out of nowhere, Size calls to you: ""You are all very welcome to join me for the next hour of killer drums and bass. It is official: we are now in the mix."" Thanks, Roni, but I'm way ahead of you. Save it for the DVD. From that point forward, Size dishes up the cheese like there's no fucking tomorrow (and in a world where a record like this gets international distribution, there might as well not be) with, as promised, a full hour of numbing breakbeats and something I guess you could call bass, even if it's never very deep-- each track is indistinguishable from the next. He's got that ""bass"" noise that goes ""bweh bweh bweh,"" the one that goes ""wonk wonk wonk,"" and a few others the Chemical Brothers bled dry in '98, along with a precious few characterless synth presets. Texturally, it's barely half a cut above the generic Best of Bass compilations they can't give away at Circuit City. The beats are pushed way up front for the most part, and the fundamental backbeat changes maybe two, three times over the whole course of the album. Twittering synth sounds and bubbly squiggles crop up around the edges for window dressing, but there's never a genuine melodic contour that might imply some direction. It's kind of funny, in that I've come full circle with Roni Size at this point. My first exposure to him came during college, when I found his Breakbeat Era project's Ultra Obscene album discarded on the mailroom floor. Like any good scavenger, I scooped it up and gave it a listen, and found it so interesting that I didn't listen to it again for three years, until I had to write this review and became curious. It still does nothing for me. In between, I gained a good deal of respect for a lot of his other material (specifically New Forms and his tracks on Full Cycle's 1995 comp Music Box), but Touching Down just doesn't cut it. Curiously, Size ends the album by thanking DJs for ""all their support,"" almost as if it were a gesture of farewell. I won't speculate on the future of his career, but Mr. Size certainly won't be getting any thanks from me until he a) makes another good album, or b) hands me an Advil. In the meantime, if you want to hear Touching Down, just check the mailroom floor of your local college. I'm sure it'll turn up eventually.","God, I don't even know where to begin.

Extra Yard: The Bouncement Revolution,Various Artists,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a7bdea9e61561daa5661/1:1/w_160/8e845c2e.gif,2003-01-23 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1948-extra-yard-the-bouncement-revolution/,Ninja TuneBig Dada,"Whether you hate him or love him, file him in hip-hop or two-step/UK garage, or bump his record from your basement-party tweeters or the surround sound in your HumVee, no one denies that the guy from The Streets raps with zero flow. Seeing how he's the first British rapper popularized on such a massive scale in America, the most common excuse critics and fans have made for him is that it's the language difference; that perhaps, due to the clipped cadence of their accents, ""British people just don't have flow?"" Maybe. But in eight months, Original Pirate Material is gonna be more embarrassing than the memory of you rocking the Stereo MCs record and the Z.Cavaricci pleated dungarees. Furthermore, disproving the ""gee, maybe the Limeys just don't know how to rhyme?"" theory is Extra Yard, the most recent in Big Dada's series of innovative hip-hop comps. Mixed by DJ Excalibah (host of the excellent radio show, Tales from the Legend, on 1Xtra-- which is like the BBC's version of BET, but with way better music), it's a 17-track mixtape of UK party hip-hop whose flow drips like Britain's primary exports are honey and street cred. Extra Yard is strong out of the gate. It opens with ""A'La Fu Gives It to You""-- a tight intro in which deejay A'La Fu's impeccable scratches and cuts spell out the line, ""Steppin' outta place with an extra yard""-- and flows straight into Gamma's ball-busting single, ""Killer Apps"", which drops a mushroom cloud of dubby sub-bass under a flurry of Jamaican-flavored raps ""for your undercover attack."" Gamma's virile chorus of, ""Yo, Rude Boy/ Huh/ Killer Apps/ We got what you need right now,"" is a wonderfully boastful pop lyric, and worth a thousand ""propas"" from a certain Izod-sporting two-step artist. The comp maintains its energetic, high-quality party vibe throughout; however, with a couple of exceptions, it never quite reaches the standard set with the first couple of club knockouts. Ty's looming anthem, ""We Don't Care"", drops a hooky chorus over a bragging, cocksure bass synth, while calling out those who ""claim to represent the church/ With no research of what the rest of rap is actually/ You fail factually."" A track midway through the mix, Part 2 & LSK's ""Life Without You"", adds some refreshingly corn-syrupy two-step flavor, lightly braised with butter-smooth vocals, like El DeBarge on some futuristic R&B; tip. While the British accent can certainly inject angles and unfamiliar staccato breaks into a unique cadence, Extra Yard dispels the myth that all Brits rapping sound like Neneh Cherry with a ball-gag stuffed in her mouth. Most interestingly, the comp exemplifies the aggressive style of UK bouncement, which blends hip-hop and dancehall bashing with the bounce of maximum bass. It's a puree of two-step, dub, dancehall, R&B;, and garage-- or, in the case of Roots Manuva and Wildflower's clean, synth-heavy ""Born Again"", bouncement is where dancehall meets Tchaikovsky, with a sparkling sample from the ""Nutcracker Suite"". By pairing the forward-thinking beats of the UK club scene with a cache of impenetrably solid artists and producers, these Brits are taking the American art of hip-hop into unexplored, artful territories.","Whether you hate him or love him, file him in hip-hop or two-step/UK garage, or bump his record from ...

A Giant Alien Force More Violent & Sick Than Anything You Can Imagine EP,Venetian Snares,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a93aea9e61561daa59d9/1:1/w_160/5b2ea695.gif,2003-01-22 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8439-a-giant-alien-force-more-violent-sick-than-anything-you-can-imagine-ep/,Hymen,"If there's a word for Aaron Funk-- the Canadian avenger and breakcore-mash-up vigilante also known as Venetian Snares-- that word is undoubtedly prolific. Since the millennium went down with a whimper, Funk has released no less than six full-lengths on labels like Hymen, Isolate, and Planet \xB5, not to mention a plethora of EPs, singles and remixes. That each release (the Brit-IDM of 2370804, the ragga madness of his Snares Man! work, the speed-metal gore of Making Orange Things) succeeded in adding new bruises and scars to the Venetian Snares sound-- while never falling short of brilliant-- makes those figures all the more impressive. With a new album already on deck for Mike Paradinas' Planet \xB5 label (not to mention his forthcoming sexperimental collaboration with Hecate, under their Nymphomatriarchs guise), is it any wonder that an intriguing, inventive, oddly formatted Venetian Snares disc should be available from Hymen at almost the same time? At first glance, A Giant Alien Force More Violent & Sick Than Anything You Can Imagine may seem like a gimmick: a three-inch disc containing one fifteen-minute, thirty-three second track is housed in a snug red box with a miniature TV viewfinder. Through it, you can observe the gargantuan album title emblazoned on everything from a grain silo to the abdomen of a deceased grasshopper. To be sure, many electronic labels have dabbled in ""special packaging"" with mixed results: if you've seen a purple Universal Indicator record or a limited SKAM release going for $200 on eBay, you know what I'm talking about. But what does this say about the music on such releases? Is a gimmick all it takes to move units? The overuse of ""special"" covers and multiple editions nearly killed the comic book industry in the early 90s, before everyone realized that, if you wrap shit in silk, you wind up with silk that smells like shit. Or: content has to live up to its packaging. Incredibly, A Giant Alien Force does just that, proving not only that Venetian Snares continues to revolutionize the genre with his mind-bending, brutal take on noise and breaks, but that any special packaging included with his music is accessory, not the other way 'round. Which leaves you asking: What has Funk done on this one track that sets it apart from the rest of the Venetian Snares catalog? Truth be told, his approach on ""A Giant Alien Force"" doesn't stray too much from the violated drill 'n' bass of the Shitfuckers EP or the Venetian jungle bass and breaks on tracks like ""Fuck Toronto Jungle"" and ""Aqap"". Beginning with a menacing ambient fog that settles over the ears like gauze, Funk moves into sonic territory echoing Melodies from Mars-- cosmic, almost cartoonish synths straight out of an Ed Wood flick are backed by manic, fractured breakbeats that become increasingly cutthroat, eventually swallowing the melody like a python gorging itself on a terrified squirrel. And that's when things get really fucked up. Air raid sirens scream, a shuffling beat emerges from behind layers of blurred static, and the bassline slides its way down the rave rabbit hole, emerging on the other side stained with background drones, almost trance-like in their ethereality. Those, in turn, are pushed aside by an octave crushing, sub-sonic bass meltdown, which decays into a culminating torrent of ass-rupturing drum loops that ride a wave of white noise to the dark at the end of the tunnel. It's almost as punishing as Atari Teenage Riot's Live at Brixton Academy, and it brings the track full circle, making it a hot air balloon ride around Planet Snares; no sonic stone in Funk's bag of tricks goes unturned. By merging all of his personalities into one epic track, Venetian Snares guarantees an experience in aural violation as devastating and rewarding as anything in his catalog. In the end, the point of this release becomes crystal clear: even on a format best suited for Mario Party 4, it's not the size of your packaging that counts, but how ruthlessly you beat the shit out of the listener that really matters. Venetian Snares shows up to this party like a rabid dwarf with brass knuckles, and leaves you with a bloody, toothless grin.","If there's a word for Aaron Funk-- the Canadian avenger and breakcore-mash-up\n\ vigilante also known as Venetian Snares-- ...

Will they start to sound like The Doors? I mean, I like The Doors and all (Jim Morrison's, um, ""poetry"" aside), but we don't need another Doors. These are the questions that shot through my head when I heard that Q and Not U had decided not to replace Matthew Bourlique on four-string when he left the band after their debut full-length, 2000's No Kill No Beep Beep. On that album, Q and Not U sounded like they were on their way; there were some great songs at the front end of the album, even if the rest was somewhat less inspired. Ideas were in abundance, but the sinew to hold them together was lacking, which made it more of a fun and promising release than a full-blown success. I fretted that their losing a member might kill the potential completely, so it was with a cautious ear that I put on Different Damage, their first album without Bourlique. And I'll tell you, I have got to stop worrying about stuff like this. Q and Not U aren't on their way anywhere anymore-- they've arrived. There are subtle changes here; the band's fundamental D.C.-ness is still firmly intact, all post-punk rhythms and obtuse politicking with the occasional riotous post-hardcore shout, though some electronics have found their way into the depths Bourlique used to inhabit. And the big shocker: guitarist/vocalist Chris Richards makes a mean bassist. The songwriting has tightened up considerably since No Kill No Beep Beep. If most of the songs on their debut were shotgun blasts, these are laser beams: no less destructive, and far more precise. ""Soft Pyramids"" opens with the band spelling out the song title and several randomly chosen words from the lyrics over dissonant guitars and gauze-wrapped synths. John Davis, already a great drummer on No Kill No, has improved here, pushing everything along octopus-style, with frenetic percussion and rock-steady beats. Each of these songs nicely highlight his sharp command of rhythm. ""So Many Animal Calls"" and closer ""Recreation Myth"" ride along on slamming beats, while Richards and Harris Klahr carefully match guitar parts, each playing in the space left by the other guitarist for an interesting series of interlockings. The distortion pedals stay in storage for the most part, too, and the new clean tones that have filled their shoes open up the sound beautifully, without sacrificing precious kinetic energy. Even when dirtier tones do come out, like on the righteously tweaked ""Black Plastic Bag"", they make a serious impact, turning a charge into a dense, thunderous stampede. And, as if the band's skill and improvement weren't enough, Ian MacKaye and Don Zientara capture their sound perfectly, revealing subtle details while preserving the music's intensity. So it looks like big things loom on the horizon for Q and Not U-- and I don't just mean the Washington Monument. They may only be three now, but rather than weaken with the loss, they've risen to the challenge, doing more with less in admirable style. Their next should absolutely fucking kill.","Maybe it's because I play bass, but whenever I hear about a band losing their bassist and moving on ...

And remember how, after the Kennedy raves and MTV Beach House success of that song, Nada Surf did the graceful thing by fading quietly into obscurity and K-Tel royalties? That was really cool of them. Uh... they did fade quietly into obscurity, right? Hells no! Like the equally mystifying continued existence of their pan-flash peers Superdrag (sigh, WhosuckedouttheFEEEELAAAAAANNNNN!!), Nada Surf insists upon fading away rather than burning out. So now, they're dropping down to the minor leagues and trying to ignore showgoers' wiseass heckles as they tour America's low-overhead venues. If you're anything like me, there's a little voice inside of you saying, ""Dude, weird, they're still around? Shouldn't they be headlining the John Deere Alternative Rock Stage at the State Fair by now? Could it be there's something worthwhile about this band to have so long outlived their original fifteen minutes?"" Well, that's why I get paid the big bucks, folks-- to tell all y'all not to listen to that bastardly little voice, who never did you no good anyhow. Let Go's only plausible use is to forcibly expose us to mid-90s alt-rock in the context of today so that we might come to grips with just how damn crappy it sounds. Of course, the very same effect can be achieved by simply dusting off that Buffalo Tom CD the record store's passed on sixty or seventy times and tossing it into the old six-disc-- a rather sad fact for the boys of Nada Surf, and proof positive of this album's dollar-bin destiny. Somewhat like a defrosted wooly mammoth from 1995, Nada Surf embodies all the itinerant influences of the day, drawing their jangle-pop inspiration from, let's say  the DB's and  The Replacements-- that'll suffice. All well and good, but the band also carries with it the era's failings like a parasite, crimes that might've been forgivable back when we were sorta excited about 'Mats disciples popping up on the radio, but which come off as JUST SAD nowadays. Said crimes include: Building a chorus around the phrase, ""I wanna know what it's like/ On the inside of love,"" in the at-least-aptly-titled ""Inside of Love"". Hijacking a classic album's mystique in lieu of creating one's own poetic imagery, as with the protagonist listening to Blonde on Blonde in the again-credibly-titled ""Blonde on Blonde"". Just the simple presence of a song called ""Neither Heaven Nor Space"" (and guess what it's about?). Singing a song entirely in French (""Le Pour Ca""); although, it's entirely possible that inhabitants of France make up a large part of Nada Surf's current fanbase, somehow finding the time to squeeze the trio into their omnipresent all-Destiny's Child and Shaggy radio formats. But it would take an entirely hapless band to go an entire album without stumbling into a few sparks, and Nada Surf find limited success in the purty harmonies of ""Blizzard of 77"" and the in-the-continent-of-raucous ""Treading Water"". Too bad these, and the other ten mid-tempo tunes on Let Go, are gleefully shined into harmless linoleum by the mixing board of Bryce ""SuperSheen"" Goggin, the only man who can lay claim to ruining albums by both Pavement and Phish. Perhaps the only thing I can't give Nada Surf the old kick-while-down for is the rather unfortunate sharing of album titles with teen-of-the-moment Avril Lavigne-- and that's only 'cause I haven't got it in me to waste further time smacking down these clearly well-meaning saps. I'll admit, though: If forced to defend one of the two LPs to save my life, I'd pick Little Miss Wifebeater without a second thought. No, I'm afraid Nada Surf won't be regaining any of their past (hyuck, hyuck) Popularity on these shores with Let Go, and their fellow forgotten (Dig, anyone?) might want to heed their warning and stay retired.","Alright, let's just get this out of the way right up front, real fast:

Relayer,Youngsbower,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a23d5e6ef9596932038b/1:1/w_160/3383fd08.jpeg,2003-01-22 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/8838-relayer/,VHF,"Unless you can get yourself killed in time (be you Nick Drake or Hendrix), someone is going to try and collaborate with you. There are times when it's a symbiotic and sympathetic endeavor, empowering both parties (something on the Erstwhile label comes to mind, or maybe Max Roach and Clifford Brown). But more often the results are heinous, as each tethers themselves to the other's sinking ship (Dylan and the Dead, anyone?) and drown together. I was certain things were going to work out between Richard Youngs and Matthew Bower, though. The former had released a near-classic in his solo Advent, and he followed it up pretty well with Festival a few years later, in addition to his wistful folk whisperings on Sapphie. He'd also done pretty well in combination with other like-minded outr√© individuals in the UK noise-scrape underground, particularly with Simon-Wickham Smith (and his LP with Acid Mothers' Makoto Kawabata wasn't bad, either). Matthew Bower had been similarly successful with his group Skullflower, which stomped the world into submission with its amplified tractor pulls, before devoting his powers to Sunroof! and Total. And the two had even collaborated before, on Site/Realm, which was pure scorched-earth policy, as the two stuck to their guitars and made a nasty slab of string spatter and feedback Zen, at once messy and kept. But that was eight years back, and magic just don't happen so accidentally these days. Ditching the guitar screes of yore and the live-to-tape approach, ""Eagle Like a Fly"" shows that this is more of a studio effort, as the two pour on the sonic fluid like something out of Yamatsuka Eye's Rebore project, slowly coagulating acoustic strummed flurries, organ tones, electric blurps, and hand drums into a dizzying brew that positively shimmers. Just as it's beginning to take effect, though, it curiously snips its own cord. And from here on out, Relayer begins the unfortunate pattern of repetition for the remainder of the disc, with tracks ending pretty close to where they began, in three-to-seven-minute increments. ""Pink Sky Blossom"" fades up some preset drum machines, with the layers a bit more phased, dogpiling all the sounds again, but before long they sink under this sonic detritus, lethargic and scarcely able to stay afloat before a quick fade-out. Sometimes the succinctness works to their advantage. Sticking to John Carpenter-like simplicity, ""Moonlight Loe Pink"" is constructed from crystalline swirls graciously held aloft, while laser-sensitized alarms keen on and off. ""New Martian Sun Tunnel"" tries for Harmonia by setting the drum machine's cha-cha to the max and bending some strings before the celeste-powered comedown. These moments, however, are all too brief when having to plow through the red-light frequencies encountered in the middle of a big-huff of AC coolant on ""Helicopter Kachina"". And while these two gents were surely trying to transport themselves midstream the primal gurgle of Terry Riley, ""Opaline Retrieval"" unfortunately finds them wedged inside ""Tubular Bells"" instead. Content more to meander about and tape some keys down, and then fiddle with ring-modulators, FX boxes and settings, fading the tapes in and out as it becomes either somewhat of interest or else too tedious to bear any longer, Relayer drops into a saturated sameness that dilutes any possibility of psychedelic build-up or expansive sustenance, opting for empty-handed snatches by way of editing-room brevity.","Unless you can get yourself killed in time (be you Nick Drake or Hendrix), someone is going to try and ...

Xanaconversex,Dino Felipe,by: Mark Martelli,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd76eb335119a49ecea6/1:1/w_160/76c3b592.jpg,2003-01-22 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3028-xanaconversex/,Schematic,"New to the Schematic neighborhood, Dino Felipe's Xanaconversex is a melodious battle between malfunctioning pizzeria arcade games and electro-influenced beats, wandering through sonic terrain explored previously by Oval, Team Doyobi, and labelmate Richard Devine. Felipe injects hooks into his usual soup of processed noise and static, creating a sound that's at once caustic and endearing, like a nine-year old computer nerd popping balloons and kicking your slow, sorry ass at Space Invaders. To be sure, there's nothing new going on here-- you've heard much of Xanaconversex before, on tons of other records-- but that doesn't preclude Felipe putting a fresh twist on things. ""Slutt Petal (2 Crunch)"" leads off bouncing, the beat resting on a bed of static punctuated by the pleasured moans of an analog harlot. It's DAT Politics without fear of shamelessly rockin' the dance-floor, a sound that's repeated on ""Strictly Generic"", which comes out swinging its Aphex acid moves like there's no tomorrow; despite its title, it sounds refreshingly inventive, and undeniably infectious, though perhaps the 1:45 runtime has something to do with that. Felipe has taken his time with each composition, distorting, cut 'n' pasting, and decaying every kick, snare and bleep until it crunches like a baby frog underfoot. From this static mess emerges a tender streak in Felipe's sonic recipe: the slow, ponderous undulation of the album's closer, ""Sexual Boats (Guitars Float)"". Nothing if not romantic, the sparkling synth keys and muted conversations of various members of the fairer sex drift by like clouds; the feeling is not unlike awakening high and contented on a spring Sunday morning. In Felipe's case, the bedroom is stuffed floor to ceiling with floppy disc drives, and you're more than likely laying next to a gutted dot matrix printer than any stunning seductress. ""Pinky"", the fifth cut on Xanaconversex, showcases all of Felipe's strengths: opening with the rhythmic moans of another central computer siren, it rides a lounging, dubby bassline before breaking out into clean, traditional cut 'n' paste shenanigans. ""Pinky"" is a perfect balance of standard, sure-shot IDM and Felipe's unique Activision sensibility. While the rest of Xanaconversex is far from groundbreaking, there's enough enthusiasm and granulated beats to keep your ass parked in front of the 2600 a long while. Consider it one to grow on.","New to the Schematic neighborhood, Dino Felipe's Xanaconversex is a melodious battle between malfunctioning pizzeria arcade games and electro-influenced ...

Homemade Drugs,The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b9fceb335119a49ec912/1:1/w_160/57d425fb.gif,2003-01-21 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4257-homemade-drugs/,Absolutely Kosher,"According to Illinois' ""Rules of the Road"" booklet-- the supplemental material you're supposed to study before taking the driving test-- not only are other drivers supposed to yield for funeral processions, but members of funeral processions are allowed to run red lights. Does this seem counterintuitive to anyone else? As accidents I occasionally see on my way to work will attest, running red lights can be dangerous stuff, often leading to, um, more funerals. I'm pretty sure the only way to darken the mood at a funeral is to have something more tragic happen during one. The Jim Yoshii Pile-Up might have something to say about that; these five guys make music to slaughter all emotions brighter than morose. They could run all the red lights in Illinois if they wanted to, which is not to say their music sounds haphazard in any way; in fact, it's just the opposite, igniting pyres with well-placed shards of dissonance and agitated percussion, highlighting a tragedy you might otherwise submissively endure. The Pile-Up-- and no, there's nobody named Jim Yoshii, not in the band anyway-- take their time coping with sadness, stretching Homemade Drugs' nine songs over 44 minutes and 44 seconds, pacing meditative instrumental passages with steady build-ups. Their three guitars stay clean and out of each other's way for the most part, resulting in a clear, piercing sound with plenty of breathing room for Paul Gonzenbach's affecting tenor. His voice is a warm spot in the band's somewhat chilly arrangements, both comforting and depressing, like a good friend helping you through a rough day. Of course, good friends wouldn't normally hit you with stuff as bleak as: ""Cold and wet in a ditch by the side of the road somewhere/ Lie all of my dreams for you and me."" Or worse: ""This isn't life/ This isn't okay/ This isn't much more than survival/ I know the kids next door bother you/ I've seen you flinch at the screams and the abuse/ I know the cars at night honk at you/ I've seen the rings around your eyes in the morning/ They're selling guns on the corner."" Gonzenbach's in a hell of a rut: the rent's due, his girlfriend's grown cold and plans to leave him, his friends are abused, his city is menacing, and he's tired of life. In fact, he's so tired of life that he winds up repeating himself. So, it's not a party, but as funerals go, it's interesting and graciously understated. Even Homemade Drugs' most upbeat track-- ""A Deep Deep Lake""-- is draped in black velvet, hinting at both abuse and alcoholism. The guitars take on a harder edge, joining the rhythm section for a five-pronged, rhythmic attack that gives way to quieter verses, full of intricately interlocking melodies. The song's structure reverses the typical crescendo so overused these days, becoming sparser as it carries on, ending in a whisper. And whispering is ultimately where the Jim Yoshii Pile-Up excels. Extended meditations on sadness and loss can be trying, but the band's skill at once draws you into their misery and makes it palatable. It's hardly every day listening, but hung-over, insecure, anxious and lonely, you'll be reaching for Homemade Drugs.","According to Illinois' ""Rules of the Road"" booklet-- the supplemental material you're supposed to study before taking the driving ...
