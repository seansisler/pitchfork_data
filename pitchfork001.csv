The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford,Nick Cave and Warren Ellis,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b469c0084474cd0c228d/1:1/w_160/6d2e0333.jpg,2008-02-01 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11121-the-assassination-of-jesse-james-by-the-coward-robert-ford/,Mute,"Nick Cave's a ridiculously consistent songwriter, but there's one gift he possesses that eludes even his most prolific and talented peers: An incomparable sense of discipline. Factor in work with the Bad Seeds, solo albums, Grinderman, novels, scores, collaborations, and 2005's The Proposition-- the brutal, fly-specked Australian western that Cave wrote and (with the help of Warren Ellis) also scored-- and the man appears a veritable cottage industry. The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (directed by Cave's fellow Aussie indie iconoclast Andrew Dominik and beautifully lit and shot by cinematographer Roger Deakins) is, like The Proposition, an eccentric western. But unlike most eccentric westerns, in Jesse James the dread is balanced by a hypnotic, elegiac quality, and the plot's inevitability (see: the title) is tempered by Brad Pitt's and Casey Affleck's haunting and enigmatic performances (the latter has earned an Oscar nod and a ton of critics prizes for his turn as a would-be stalker, as did Deakins for his lensing). If The Proposition is heavily indebted to the sadistic violence of spaghetti westerns, The Assassination of Jesse James owes much to the impressionistic work of Terrence Malick, and for that it paid a price: The average moviegoer had to work overtime just to find the artful film playing anywhere on the big screen, and even then likely missed it-- which of course meant missing yet another evocative, doom-draped Cave/Ellis score. With long stretches of no dialogue and a focus on landscapes as much as characters, there's a lot of room in the movie for the cues devised by Cave and Ellis to take center stage. ""Rather Lovely Thing"" (later reprised as ""Another Rather Lovely Thing"", naturally) sets the tone of the film with its melodramatic droning, melancholy piano, and folky fiddle. Meanwhile, ""Song for Jesse"" is the cue that seems to crop up the most in the film, its eerie bells and keys are thoughtful, menacing, pretty, and ghostly all at once. A few other passages feature more traditional orchestration; among them, the dark, dreamlike ""The Money Train"", the strings and percussion of ""What Happens Next"", and the bittersweet eulogy ""Song for Bob"". Others are more abstract, like the harmonium-lead ""Last Ride Back to KC"". ""Cowgirl"" and ""Carnival"" provide a tiny hint of relief from the oppressive moodiness of scene-setters such as ""Falling"" and ""Destined for Great Things""-- the latter's foreboding vibe magnified when you think back to the film's early moments, where the movie's central tragedy is set in motion. In fact, when Cave makes a brief appearance in the film's waning minutes-- playing a grungy troubadour, of course, strolling the length of a bar as he growls the oft-sung folk tribute to Jesse James-- you almost get the feeling that in some ways it's been Cave, by way of his score, telling the story all along. At the very least, he and Ellis are providing some much needed punctuation when Dominik chooses to, for example, linger on a pained Pitt as he plays James in one of his inscrutable manic-depressive funks. Of course, minus those unforgettable images, the Cave/Ellis score loses much of its vital context, but that's what DVDs are for.","Nick Cave and Bad Seed Warren Ellis, who last paired together to score the gritty 2005 western The Proposition, re-team to score another western.

Songs From Purgatory: Cassette Recordings 1991-1996,June Panic,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b42c13d197565213aa7b/1:1/w_160/30254b20.jpg,2008-01-31 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11071-songs-from-purgatory-cassette-recordings-1991-1996/,Secretly Canadian,"Now that just about any schmuck with a guitar can make a reasonably professional-sounding recording of himself and slap it on a MySpace page for all the world to hear, the days of four-track bedroom recording seem like ancient history, even though the medium still exists and its heyday only ended about ten years ago. Home four-track recording began life as a crude means to an end, a way to make that record no one would pay you to make, but by the early 1990s, it had become its own ethos, essentially a different medium from professional recording studios. It had limitations but also possibilities, and an entire indie rock subculture grew up around lo-fi aesthetics. June Panic recorded about a dozen cassette releases on his four-track in the first six years of the 90s, distributed mostly by hand to local record stores, friends, and friends of friends. He was adventurous in his use of the medium, recording himself and occasional friends on a band's worth of instruments and working on a vast array of ways to layer his voice and complete a mix. His output ranged from pensive folk to indie rock with the occasional spike of feedback, ultra-distortion, or screaming punk fury. Here, Secretly Canadian has shown its commitment to its artists by allowing Panic to compile three whole discs worth of his cassette recordings, which had been rescued from flood waters in North Dakota and meticulously restored in his kitchen. They also let him narrate the compilation with a set of liner notes that build up to a theory that purgatory is where souls can most easily be themselves (interesting stuff in light of his spiritually-themed recent output). Theological concerns aside, the 53 tracks compiled here form a scrapbook of Panic's early artistic life that will be interesting for his fans and hardcore 90s lo-fi buffs but really no one else. There's frankly not much that transcends the medium or begs to be listened to out of context. It's a record that really needs to be listened to on a moment-to-moment basis rather than a track-by-track one, because the interesting bits are often right up alongside tiresome, ponderous, and obnoxious bits within the same song. For a quick example, ""Fountain of Youth"" has a nice Spanish-tinged acoustic guitar part moving in tandem with a totally forgettable vocal that's undersung to a fault (it's rather slurred, actually), and then sticks a lovely, crystal-clear acoustic guitar solo in the middle. Panic had a strange penchant for making his already nasal vocals even more pinched by speeding them up. He also liked recording loud, driving indie rock songs with the guitar pushed all the way into the red-- there are quite a few of them scattered across the set, and none of them is particularly satisfying. He was much more suited to quiet, tense songs like ""There Is a Tool"", which backs up his voice with sparse guitar, mandolin, bass, and organ for a floating effect-- it still doesn't have a grabbing melody or much else to hang your hat on, but it's at least an intriguing sonic environment. The tracks with exceptionally clear sound and a few comments in the liners make it clear that Panic was one of the first to view lack of fidelity as a stylistic choice rather than an economic necessity (for him, it was really both). It's hard to recommend this to anyone but devotees of the lo-fi ethos and extremely dedicated June Panic fans. For everyone else, subjecting yourself to the excesses of the set is probably not worth it-- you'll find your mind wandering quickly, and the sheer volume of material makes it unlikely you'll ever get to know it well without really working at it.","Three-disc overview culled from a dozen cassette releases recorded in the first six years of the 1990s is of interest to committed fans and hardcore lo-fi buffs but few others.

Terrific Seasons,These Are Powers,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b433c0084474cd0c223d/1:1/w_160/629f7af4.jpg,2008-01-31 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11076-terrific-seasons/,HOSS,"One should be rightly suspicious of any band that names its own genre. These Are Powers' dubbed their sound ""ghost-punk,"" and more than a few rock chroniclers have eaten it right up. But to be fair, there's something to the name. These Are Powers' late 2007 debut Terrific Seasons is propelled by the energy and anarchy of punk, to be sure, but there's something more mysterious lurking beneath the surface. Guitars emulate warping sheets of metal, and drums and vocals alike sound like they're bouncing off the walls of a cavernous abandoned warehouse. Couple these opposite poles of aggression and elusiveness, and sure, why not? ""Ghost-punk"" it is. Yet as evocative and original a name as that may be, These Are Powers aren't exactly blazing a new path in modern music, and not just because the group recalls some of the tribal chaos of member Pat Noecker's former band Liars. While Liars casts a slight shadow over Terrific Seasons, the disc is most reminiscent of early Sonic Youth, when the skronky noise of No Wave, proto industrial music, musique concrète, ugly scum rock and avant garde experimentation collided and exploded like an underground Big Bang. Sonic Youth, Swans, PiL, Mars, even the Birthday Party-- it's all churning around in here. That's hardly bad company, and it helps that These Are Powers largely make good on their borrowed legacy. ""You Come With Nothing"" kicks off the album in rousing fashion, with frenetic drums, throbbing bass, and caterwauling vocals coalescing into a condensed, ruthlessly efficient two-minute epic. ""Makes Visible"" is spookier and more hypnotic, while ""Cracks in the Lifeline"" makes good use of still more mysteriously sick sounds pulsing against the percussion. The bursts of noise, screaming, skronk, and rhythmic terror are often as exhausting as they are exciting, which may or may not prepare you for the penultimate ""Pizza Master Ice Cream Palace"", a 20-minute monster that at times makes what came before it feel like a warm up. Heck, the ten-minutes of vertigo-inducing racket that conclude the track make the 10 minutes that came before that sound like a warm up, too, which is what happens when improv becomes such a key compositional asset. Once you get going there's no stopping the groove, and in fact even at their most discordant and disjointed, These Are Powers do groove. By the time the twisted-metal (most likely) guitar of ""Nubians on Franklin Avenue"" kicks in to end the disc, it's clear that for all its familiar elements, These Are Powers has over the course of the album managed to scramble out from under the burden of comparison and establish an identity of its own. Yes, you can still hear all those other acts, but you can also hear the core trio of Noecker, Anna Barie and Bill Salas working hard to recombine those strands of post-punk DNA into a wonderfully ugly mutation, the kind you don't necessarily want to bump into in some dead end back alley but one which sounds more than satisfying ringing, clanging and resonating in the comfort of home.","Ex-Liars Pat Noecker and pals make a spooky noise they've gone ahead and dubbed ""ghost-punk.""

I love them so much that I cling to my belief that they're simply miniature, catastrophically insane humans, not evil geniuses from space, despite all evidence to the contrary. Nevertheless, it's no secret to anyone that the little tykes are getting crazier and crazier all the time. Some blame reality television, or MySpace, or violent video games, but I have a pet theory-- their teachers are all too busy recording indie rock into their four-tracks, trying to nail that perfect balance of mono guitar lines and tape hiss, to properly socialize the brood. Seriously, can you imagine Bob Pollard being one of your formative models for responsible adulthood? Like the prolific GBV frontman, Duncan Sumpner is a teacher whose bedroom dabbling snuck into our earbuds via a side door marked ""outsider artist."" Unlike Pollard, Sumpner's debut album didn't convey the impression that catchy indie rock nuggets effortlessly sifted off of him like dead skin cells. His hazy, lugubrious folk songs were carefully tended moods, not Pollard's weird-pop epiphanies, and while the album was garlanded by the crown prince of new folk, Devendra Banhart, I found the title highly ironic-- where, in fact, were the songs? On his debut, Sumpner was a whiz with tone and color, but to hear one of his sepia-toned dirges was to have heard them all. Pitchfork enthused over the album, but even we admitted that it ""lacked enough swirling builds and surprises to sustain its initial birr over 10 tracks."" The same cannot be said of Gyllyng Street, which trades early Pheasant's lo-fi folk for expansive, psychedelic shoegaze, with improved results. What Sumpner's voice actually adds to the music remains questionable-- for the most part, it's an unintelligible moan that seems dwarfed by the clear-cutting percussion and long arcs of eldritch guitar. But the music is buoyed up by a newfound flair for drama, unfurling with magisterial simplicity, and while it retains that homespun feel, it sounds larger by several orders of magnitude. ""Boats"" starts off drizzly, but instead of petering out, it limps toward a glistering guitar lead crescendo, while the cascading reverb of ""King Friday"" eventually, through a maze of growling distortion and capering piano keys, hits on an honest-to-god groove. Gyllyng Street also makes Sumpner seem more team-player than lone-gunman-in-the-bell-tower. It has a feeling of collaborative spontaneity that you just can't access when multi-tracking yourself, and even loosely arranged songs that resemble those from the debut, like ""The Ballad of Century Paul"", sound livelier. And trumpeter Clive Scott proves to be Songs of Green Pheasant's most valuable player: He scores the record's best moment on ""Alex Drifting Alone"", when his mournful theme returns with ragged emphasis for a weary yet triumphal climax. It's a warm, welcome contrast to the glassy hymns, ""West Coast Profiling"" and ""Fires P.G.R."", that bookend it. If our teachers keep cranking out music like this, little Johnny may never learn to read properly, but at least he'll have some enchanting tunes to succor him through his illiteracy.","The latest from singer-songwriter Duncan Sumpner's project trades lo-fi folk for expansive, psychedelic shoegaze, with improved results.

Hammer of the Gods,Bottomless Pit,by: David Raposa,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b43f13d197565213aa9b/1:1/w_160/febdf3df.jpg,2008-01-31 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11086-hammer-of-the-gods/,Comedy Minus One,"""I can't believe my heart"": Tim Midgett offers that thought in the middle of ""Human Out of Me"", the sixth track from Bottomless Pit's debut album, Hammer of the Gods. Ideally, this album wouldn't even exist. If anything, some of these songs, or the seeds of these songs, would have ended up on another Silkworm record-- what would be their 10th full-length. It would be an album full of Andy Cohen's Neil-Young-as-post-punk guitar heroics, and Midgett's thick but nimble bass plucking, with Michael Dahlquist flailing away at what sounded like the biggest drum kit in the universe. Instead, the woman whose vehicular suicide attempt claimed the life of Dahlquist and two others has been sentenced to 10 years in prison, and while Silkworm's abrupt ending is obviously inconsequential in light of these events, it doesn't make the band's demise any less disappointing. Thankfully for fans, Cohen and Midgett are still making music together, and Hammer of the Gods is as fine a debut as folks could hope for. Hammer of the Gods is a solemn affair, both in sound and spirit. It's arguably the prettiest record either Midgett or Cohen has been associated with, but it's a prettiness that comes with a mournful pallor. New drummer Chris Manfrin, who had a tenure in Seam, may have fashioned a link between that group's shimmering torpor and the angles Bottomless Pit chooses to measure out over the course of eight songs. Just as likely, the distance the songwriting duo attempts to establish between their new endeavor and previous works extends beyond just picking a new band name and some new bandmates (Manfrin, bassist Brian Orchard). Cohen's three contributions aren't dissimilar from what he offered in Silkworm. But where his lyrical fondness for hard luck and harder knocks was usually abetted by furious and frequent cone-shredding guitar solos (both on his and Midgett's songs), Cohen shows restraint on this record. He only cuts loose on his tracks, and only in brief spurts, making those moments of distortion (especially on the war-torn ""Greenery"") all the more bracing. Midgett, on the other hand, forgoes any sort of storytelling pretense in his songs, choosing instead to simply come clean with what he's feeling. The lyric quoted at the start of this review is a fitting summary of what drives his five tracks-- trying to come to grips with a powerful and terrible event, and how such a thing can change you. It's there in the album's lead-off track (fittingly called ""The Cardinal Movements""), when he wonders about ""[getting] it in your mind to live again."" It's there in the few lyrics found in ""Leave the Light On""-- ""someday you'll wake up."" It's especially present on ""Human Out of Me"", an awkward yet proud tribute to an unnamed person that honors without succumbing to treacly sentiment (""you were a king when you knew what you were worth""; ""you helped teach me how to talk/ Showed me how to work a room""). I won't attempt to assert that Midgett means the song to be explicitly about what Michael Dahlquist meant to him, but it would be a fitting tribute if it were the case. In fact, the entire album could be seen as a tribute to both Dahlquist's memory and Silkworm's legacy-- a bittersweet yet hopeful remembrance of fond memories, and the hope of more such moments in the future.","Ideally this album wouldn't exist: Bottomless Pit were formed following the tragic death of Silkworm's Michael Dahlquist, with his two former bandmates setting out instead to make this-- arguably their prettiest album to date.

Field Manual,Chris Walla,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0dc5e6ef9596932005a/1:1/w_160/42582372.jpg,2008-01-31 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11112-field-manual/,Barsuk,"Death Cab for Cutie might have made it to a point where they'd be fine without the assistance of utility player/producer Chris Walla, but the band wouldn't likely be what it is today without his help. Not that some other producer couldn't help shape Ben Gibbard's songs and the band's performances into their just-mysterious-enough but still easy-on-the-ears albums. But Walla seems to be the perfect fit. No question, the guy knows how to make an album. One of Walla's greatest talents is his ability to step out of the way, allowing the attributes of whomever he's working with to shine through while still putting his sonic stamp on things. Maybe that's why Walla doesn't seem like the type to stew on the sidelines, or complain that his voice isn't being heard, and why anyone expecting Walla's solo album, Field Manual, to unleash some kind of pent-up ego is bound to be disappointed. Beyond the opening track ""Two Fifty""-- an arty wisp that suggests the disc could have been the showy (though not flashy) producer's album some expected-- the most remarkable thing about Field Manual is how generally unremarkable the long-simmering project turns out to be. Freed from his work-for-hire commitments, Walla has made an album in line with... all his previous endeavors. In fact, with a new Death Cab album already in the pipes, it's hard to know what might have prompted Walla to push this impeccably crafted but insignificant detour through to completion. And why now? Just about every track on Field Manual would fit comfortably somewhere in Death Cab for Cutie's catalog, and Walla's singing voice even turns out to be cut from the same cloth as Ben Gibbard's. If anything, Walla's a little easier to take than Gibbard, free of some of his bandmate's more twee affectations. What hurts Walla, though, is that on Field Manual, he's hardly whispering sweet poetic nothings. Instead, as promised, there's an explicitly political undercurrent to the disc, and on paper Walla is pissed. As he sings in ""Sing Again"": ""No, this is not a test/ Let's sing again/ Sing together without disguise/ Let's raise up a song in unrest."" But the track sends a milder message, as its unconvincing mid-tempo pace, bittersweet melody, and Walla's gentle delivery hardly adds up to an anthemic rallying cry. The same holds true for the vaguely Big Star-esque (or Matthew Sweet-esque, or Pernice Brothers-esque) ""Everybody On"", a ballad that could be about the immigration debate. Elsewhere, he addresses the Hurricane Katrina aftermath with typically soft-spoken emo earnestness-- an oddly dissonant approach. The sensitive act is a better fit for songs like ""Geometry &C"", a pretty conventional alt-rocker, and the romantic ruminations of ""Our Plans, Collapsing"", whose pessimism is subversively paired with some of the album's most grown-up hooks. Sure, there's some muscle backing up ""Archer V. Light"" and ""The Score""-- where finally some actual big riffing supports a bring-home-the-troops missive. Too often, though, Walla takes the easy way out. Obviously, a host of issues-- from downtime to headlines-- compelled Walla to make this record, and his effort shows. What's missing is a compelling reason to listen.",,5.9,
Dystopia,Midnight Juggernauts,by: Mark Pytlik,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b415c0084474cd0c2214/1:1/w_160/d8a5e0db.jpg,2008-01-30 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11050-dystopia/,Siberia,"As hundreds-- if not thousands-- of blog-house DJs have spent the past few years illustrating, some aspects of rock'n'roll can be imported pretty readily into dance. From the Fender-aping crunch of Justice's hyper-compressed chords to the noodly, scale-running arpeggios that have fast become Daft Punk's stock-in-trade, the traditional, most populist idea of rock has enjoyed a keening resurgence courtesy the unlikeliest source: the DJ. The ultimate answer to the question of whether that synergy works in both directions-- which is to say, whether dance music functions as well as a seasoning within a predominantly rock sensibility-- is still up for grabs, but as albums like this remind us, the truth is: uh, probably not. Midnight Juggernauts are a three-piece from Melbourne, who, like the New Deal before them, are all about merging the musicianship and bombast of arena rock with the textures and physicality of dance. And while, after Justice and Kanye and T.I., it makes a strange kind of logic that the next iteration of French house in the mainstream should be by the hand of some dilettantish rock band, Dystopia inadvertently points to the practical hurdles to such a union. These are mostly producerly concerns: since French house is powered by massive sonic shifts like EQ sweeps and filters, it commands, by definition, a pretty massive chunk of the frequency spectrum on its own; and so, any attempts to harness that sound into functioning like just another instrument in a rock band are going to leave you with something that either sounds comically overstuffed or sadly tokenish. It's a problem you can hear the trio grappling with over the course of the record. One of their favorite workarounds is to use instruments for the verses and have their burlier electronic arrangements take over for the choruses, but this constant baton-passing quickly starts to wear. The irony is that when they're not worrying so much about how or where to fit all their instruments into the mix, they sound more comfortable; between the juddering chorus to ""Ending of an Era"", the Gallic throwback of ""Road to Recovery"", and the rolling synth bassline in album highlight ""Shadows"", there's enough here to suggest they'd actually be better served by ditching their stubborn insistence on live material outright. The kicker is that, without their live/electronic shtick to distinguish them, Midnight Juggernauts don't seem to be anything other than gifted mimics. As great as it is, ""Road to Recovery"" is de Homem-Christo & Bangalter with proggy lyrics, the awful ""Tombstone"" is a completely shameless Ratatat rip, and the title track, with its dreamy acoustic guitars, synth clouds, and hairpinning major chords, might as well have been lifted straight off one of the lesser Air albums. If you like all that stuff and you're forgiving enough that you're willing to put up with a band that does slightly inferior versions of same while simultaneously somehow sounding uncannily like the Moody Blues, well, these are the dudes for you. Everyone else: to the Roulé back catalogues you go.","Melbourne outfit struggles to merge the musicianship and bombast of arena rock with the textures and physicality of dance.

Live at Low End Theory,Daedelus,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b43413d197565213aa8a/1:1/w_160/b3e84174.jpg,2008-01-30 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11077-live-at-low-end-theory/,Alpha Pup,"L.A.-based producer Daedelus's live show is a lot like Daft Punk's recent epic set, except, well...not. Instead of a giant pyramid, the L.A. producer performs on top of whatever rickety table the club has on hand. His lightshow is a custom-made Monome, a minimalist sample trigger box connected to his Powerbook which represents his Showtunes-era samples as lights whizzing across the unit's wood-paneled display. But on Live at Low End Theory, recorded in June at the well-known L.A. club night, his gauzy re-interpretations of his own work take on a whole new life as dance music just as critics and fans were writing him off as a niche commodity. After The Weather, a successful collaboration with Busdriver and Radioinactive, Daedelus was criticized for turning his old-timey samples into a schtick rather than exploring his compositional prowess. Subsequent releases Of Snowdonia and A Gent Agent-- as well as his side-project Adventure Time-- had the feel of an artist not quite commanding his source material, like a flea-market collector content to hang a record's quaint, dated album art on his walls rather than spin the disc. But in 2005, he staged a virtual hip-hop punch-out with Exquisite Corpse, delivering on his promise as a producer and featuring rappers like MF Doom, Prefuse 73, Mike Ladd, Cyne, and TTC. And 2006's Denies the Day's Demise was one of his best releases since his Invention five years earlier. It might not have done so well in the market, even given its high-profile release on Ninja Tune, but his dreamy hip-hop/samba time capsules was at no time better parceled. Daedelus' shows have for a long time employed a breakbeat-friendly ethos, but Denies was perhaps the first record to actively sell his affinity. Low End Theory may be essential to proving to larger audiences that Daedelus can break out of the rubric of aged source material and home-made fuzz without seeming a novelty or getting walked on by underground rappers. The Low End Theory club night at the Airliner in L.A. is a perfect place for Daedelus to throw down. Hip-hop and assorted electronic performers knock elbows to an audience of urbane and avant-garde types. Daedelus himself has always trodden this line by mixing his readily parsible concept (old records with glitch laid all-up-ons) with varied production stints in the underground hip-hop community. He even places himself outside of easy identifiers by performing in Edwardian coats, tails and ascots. There's no better way to identify yourself as a hyperbolic, rap-obsessed white man than to chill with Busdriver and Madlib while dressing like a dandy, right? But it's the added punch of heavy breakbeats on ""Press Snooze"" (using the sample from ""Like Clockwork Springs"" off Demise) that really shy away from his duality of old-time sample-monger and poor man's Prefuse. Daedelus' live show shares elements of Prefuse 73's Preparations: this relentless stream of off-white noise, a dense heap of familiar, pleasing sounds with beguiling dance appeal. Even a Daedelus fan has to delve deep into this disc to get to points of familiarity, since none of the track names match the studio works that feature the old samples or compositions. Instead of the pristine ""Something Bells"" off 2004's Of Snowdonia, we have to deal with the shark-toothed dance beats of ""Now's the Time"", with the addition of a tinkly synth line from Denies dipping in and out of coherence. Come to think of it: Lucidity is a key to Daedelus's work, which at its low points seems like he's planning his next move with a bit of uncertainty and at its high points can't be forgotten without pointed effort. Daedelus' heaped-upon layers of samples sometimes lack the direct impact he seems to strive for. His live show is a relentless assault of sampled and constructed melodies which evolve with toe-tapping, but not body-moving, spontaneity. His timeless eccentricity, his penchant for the coats-and-tails, certainly takes listeners out of the contemporary, incestuous interplay between electronic and hip-hop music. It's not that he can't host a damn good party or re-examine and brilliantly re-combine his work. Daedelus just seems more at home in the herky-jerky company of clockwork, steam-powered robots whose interstella exploits have as of yet only aspired to the levels of Jules Verne and Little Nemo. If you're an electro-romantic, you'll feel right at home.","L.A.-based producer issues a live album recorded at his hometown's well-known club night; here his gauzy re-interpretations of his own work take on a whole new life as dance music just as critics and fans were writing him off as a niche commodity.

Their retrospective of that label was fantastic, unearthing 17 mostly forgotten tracks that added up to a formidable body of work. While Deep City was the main operation of its founders Willie Clarke and Johnny Pearsall, though, there was a small constellation of other labels they and their associates were involved in between 1963 and 1971 that also helped shape the character of Miami soul, including five that only released one 45. This compilation focuses on those peripheral activities, with a few additional Deep City cuts included as well. A few of the names are new, even if most of the players are essentially the same collective documented on the first Deep City volume. Frank Williams & the Rocketeers and other alumni of Florida A&M University's Incomparable Marching 100 man many of the instruments, Clarence Reid, in his pre-Blowfly days, has two tracks and lends his writing and production skills to many others, and Helene Smith and Betty Wright duke it out for the title of Miami Soul Queen. Some of the tracks are previously unreleased, pulled from a beat-up box of reels Clarke retrieved from his ex-wife's house. According to the amusing liners, the Numero guys badgered him for years to go and get them. Those same liners, which include a Miami soul glossary, track notes, photos, and a multi-label 45 discography, also mention that there were originally no plans for a follow-up volume, but I'm glad they made one, because most of these tracks simply didn't deserve to stay in a musty old box decaying in a closet or locked on obscure singles. Helene Smith's four tracks are real finds-- her crushing deep soul ballad ""True Love Don't Grow on Trees"", with its towering, symphonic horn arrangement and brooding rhythm section, is simply brilliant and makes me sad that she gave up music after the demise of Deep City (a demise she was partly responsible for). Smith's (somewhat unwitting) rival, Betty Wright, counters with two tracks of equal power. Her ""Mr. Lucky"", cut through with gunshot sound effects and an organ hook that borrows from Chopin's funeral march, is a gutsy soul stomper right on the border of funk-- her gritty, badass performance on the song makes it hard to believe she was only 14 years old when she recorded it. Unbelievable. As the years wore on, funk became a much heavier influence on the Miami sound. Perk Badger's ""Do Your Stuff"", from 1970, is built on a thick rhythm and even features Badger's James Brown-ish instructions to the band members, while Frank Williams & the Rocketeers cut a heavy JB groove on 1966's ""Show Me What You Got"", clearly building on the innovations of ""Out of Sight"" and ""Papa's Got a Brand New Bag"". Deep City's Criteria Studios actually hosted recording sessions by James Brown, and it's clear from these cuts that Clarke would have had no trouble getting a sound that was right for him. But whether it was hard, raw funk or lushly arranged deep soul, the Deep City crew didn't really seem to have trouble making anything sound good. This volume is almost as strong as its predecessor, a superb document of the early evolution of the Miami sound that anyone into old soul or funk should hear.","The Numero Group returns to the vaults of the Miami label Deep City to unearth obscure tracks of soul and hard funk from the likes of Betty Wright and a pre-Blowfly Clarence Reid.

Most of the Remixes...,Soulwax,by: Tom Ewing,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b45913d197565213aacb/1:1/w_160/fc422a2c.jpg,2008-01-30 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11107-most-of-the-remixes/,Phantom Sound & Vision,"The key to making any remix worthwhile is respect-- judging when to grant it and when to discard it. Soulwax were a rock band who realized how liberating, delightful, and profitable a lack of respect for music could be as their 2 Many DJs alias became mash-up figureheads. That early-decade boom was a fad that managed to be a nexus point for other key developments-- critical appreciation of pop; indie's rediscovery of dancing; the rise of web creativity and distribution networks. This compilation of Soulwax's remixes for other people suggests these trends still drive their work. The acts whose music hatched the mixes are a snapshot of omnivorous 00s Eurotaste-- Gorillaz, Klaxons, Kylie Minogue, LCD Soundsystem, the Gossip, Muse. Nothing too self-serious, nothing too tacky either, and mostly the kind of songs that already do brisk trade on indie dancefloors. Soulwax's handling of these tracks works best when they continue to think like bootleggers, approaching each with the spirit of forced collaboration and surprise. Minogue's iconic ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"", for instance, gets spliced with a scuzzy Kyuss guitar line. Kylie...Kyuss...Kyluss...geddit? But the desert rock backing somehow brings out a hidden hunger in Kylie's teasing vocal line, and there's a need in the song which wasn't there before. Another standout simply blends two old rave-era favorites, Human Resource's ""Dominator"" and 808 State's ""Cubik"": The former's brutalism might feel as dated as the latter's abstraction, but they refresh one another wonderfully. More often Soulwax use their remixes as a way of expanding a track. They came of listening age in the 1980s, when every single had a sumptuously extended 12"" mix, and that's the spirit behind their reworkings of Gorillaz's ""Dare"" or the Gossip's ""Standing in the Way of Control"". These aren't always so successful. Soulwax are fond of the cruder, more visceral end of dance music-- lots of rough acid squealing and hollow drum sounds-- which ought to play well with guitar rock but doesn't always: The transition in the Gossip mix feels especially forced. Also, Soulwax are better at build-ups and releases than in structuring an extended groove within a track-- most of the longer mixes here bring the euphoria upfront but run out of steam a few minutes in. Luckily, they've brought their alter egos along, and the second disc, a 2 Many DJs mix of all these tracks and more, brushes this problem aside by focusing on the one or two good ideas in each tune. Some of these ideas are obvious-- ""Daft Punk Is Playing at My House"" with added Daft Punk, the Klaxons remix mashing old-rave and nu-- but they're marvelously effective when they don't hang around. This disc also lets Soulwax show more range-- a highlight is a joyful re-edit of Ladytron's ""Seventeen"" where the group dial back the beats and embrace their indie rock heritage. And by only working with their own remixes, there's a consistency to the mix disc that compares well to the slightly exhausting eclecticism of most 2 Many DJs projects. Soulwax are part of a generation of remixers who've come to prominence alongside mp3 blogs, whose hunger for new and exclusive material has transformed and grown the remix market. Mixes now don't necessarily have to do more than divert-- the aim is to extend a band's shelf life and keep them or their remixer front-of-mind for a fickle audience. Individually, almost everything here would be a highlight of an idle afternoon roaming the blogosphere-- no surprise that they're rather indigestible en masse. In the end it's Soulwax's gifts as mixers, not remixers, which provide the best reason to listen.","The Belgian duo (aka 2 Many DJs) collect their best remix work-- songs that reconfigure tracks from LCD Soundsystem, Kylie Minogue, Gorillaz, Klaxons, Muse, and more-- and add a second disc that mixes them together.

Women as Lovers,Xiu Xiu,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4459d034d5c69bf4e2e/1:1/w_160/62ebeb96.jpg,2008-01-30 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11091-women-as-lovers/,Kill Rock Stars,"Art-making involves getting what's inside on the outside, but usually it passes through a sterilizing filter first. But with Xiu Xiu's Jamie Stewart everything spills out unmediated and mucky. To put a fine point on it, on Women as Lovers' ""Black Keyboard"", over a serpentine acoustic guitar and synth dirge, Stewart sings, ""Why would a mother say such things/ Why add tongue to a kiss goodnight?"" That line is an attack against commonly held virtues of understatement and discretion, and Stewart's willingness to revolt audiences with squeamish personal details that make him seem more scarily fucked-up than sensitive or emotionally open is what makes his music unique. His art seems to be more about who he is than who he'd like to be, and it's the tension between the mores of taste and Stewart's honesty that brings us back, despite ourselves, time and again. And, of course, the music itself, a nebulous but forceful concoction of sopping wet harpsichords, detonating percussion, submerged rock, atonal scaffolding, and unhinged electro-pop. Recent Xiu Xiu albums have been less likely to make me feel nauseous than Fabulous Muscles and its forebears, and I figured I'd just gotten acclimated to their approach. But the rawness of Women as Lovers indicates that maybe, for awhile, they'd gotten acclimated to it themselves. The Air Force found Xiu Xiu in full-bore confessional mode, yet it was so mannered that the confessionals lost their seamy edge and verged on pure aesthetics. ""Buzz Saw"" and ""Boy Soprano"", great songs both, were uncommonly buttoned-down for Xiu Xiu, and ""Hello from Eau Claire"" was almost a Moldy Peaches song. But where Air Force made venting seem rather academic, Women as Lovers is frantic and wild, with swatches of noise skidding around and Stewart's voice quivering on the edge of a panic attack-- even in the whispery sections. In this light, ""Under Pressure"" is an apt cover choice, as the whole album conveys the sense of something about to boil over. With homely, impassioned vocals by Michael Gira, and the song's slick iconic bassline contrasted by a ragged interpretation of its arrangement, it takes on an air of desperation. Xiu Xiu's music is all about discomfort, but Stewart and co. have become quite comfortable in this conceptual space, and are able to inhabit it like painters making wild, broad smears that intuitively cohere into a look that is distinctly theirs. On ""I Do What I Want, When I Want"", a pummeling post-punk groove dressed up with strident synth peals and pitched percussion, Stewart sounds direly imperiled, especially when the free-jazz horns start ripping through the already-claustrophobic mix. ""In Lust You Can Hear the Axe Fall"" is an apocalyptic atonal composition with a driving backbeat, and Stewart commands it masterfully, his voice sometimes climbing the slope of the wreckage, sometimes punching in abruptly at its screaming peaks. ""No Friend Oh!"" thrums like an engine, with anxious flurries of touch-tone synth and manic brass. The quieter compositions offer no relief from the mounting sense of impending catastrophe. ""Guantanamo Canto"" smears bending chimes, headachy percussion, loony-bin whistles, and allegorical sirens across a disorienting blankness, as Stewart says it plain: ""My country needs its freedom/ To contradict your humanness."" The Air Force gave us Xiu Xiu as a crystallized concept, but Women as Lovers sounds no more conceptual than a spurting artery. On ""F.T.W."", a clicky acoustic ballad that eventually erupts into a squeaking-helium hell of noise, Stewart whimpers, ""Am I all right? Do I look all right?"" He doesn't, and one feels for him, although maybe there's some small solace in that fact that as a musician, not-all-right is his best look.","After the relatively buttoned-down Air Force, the latest from Xiu Xiu is frantic and wild, with swatches of noise and Jamie Stewart's voice often quivering on the edge of a panic attack.

Auditorium,Radar Bros.,by: Ben Westhoff,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4369d034d5c69bf4e17/1:1/w_160/67600864.jpg,2008-01-29 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11078-auditorium/,Merge,"Whenever any hack musician puts out a new record, his publicist will inevitably trumpets it as more personal. Radar Bros. leader Jim Putnam, however, has actually sought to make his band's fifth CD, Auditorium, less personal. ""I kind of wanted to write more obvious, literal type stuff,"" he told me recently. ""A lot of times people will say, 'What the hell is that song about?' And I'll say, 'It's obvious,' and they'll say, 'No it isn't.'"" Radar Bros. songs were never about the lyrics, anyway. Putnam doesn't do a whole lot of singing in the first place, and when he does he has a way of making simple words difficult to understand. Instead, the band focuses on its huge sonic landscapes, which permit the listener to burrow into-- or, at worst, fall asleep inside of-- whichever little part they feel most comfortable. But this time around Putnam wants a stronger musician/listener connection, so Auditorium gives us songs like ""Brother Rabbit"", which memorializes a boring day hanging out in the yard with the dog. ""I'm going to sit here/ I'm going to whittle away on an old green chair/ You're going to sit there/ And you're going to watch the paint gently flake away,"" he sings. Perhaps this is a political statement of sorts, but he gets more overt on ""Happy Spirits"", which concerns George Bush and slain soldiers: ""These things you say make it all right/ But happy spirits make to the sky."" ""A Dog Named Ohio"" alludes-- duh-- to election fraud. This type of lyricism is at best preaching to the choir and at worst completely irrelevant, making you wish you still had no idea what the hell he was talking about. Which leaves us with those signature Radar Bros. horizontal melodies, which consist mainly of echoing, inoffensive electric guitar and metronomic drums, and add up to bong-hitting mood music that makes Putnam's side project, Mt. Wilson Repeater, sound absolutely giddy by comparison. Though recorded at Putnam's L.A.-area home, Auditorium would have made a great soundtrack for the Oregon-set, quasi-mystical, earth-worshipping movie Old Joy. Like that film, the band's measured, washing melodies always feel like they're heading somewhere but rarely seem to arrive. In a way, Putnam is the anti-Ben Bridwell, trying his damndest to avoid cliché and displays of emotion, to the detriment of any real tension. It's a bit of an affectation, one suspects, because from time to time Putnam betrays himself by actually getting excited, such as on ""Watching Cows"" which-- despite its innocuous subject matter-- climaxes nicely, both musically and lyrically. Suffice it to say, he really envies those fucking cows.","Radar Bros. leader Jim Putnam and his band deliver their fifth album, which is full of horizontal melodies and political statements of sorts.

Take to the Skies,Enter Shikari,by: Joshua Love,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b40ab1335d7bf169a6b9/1:1/w_160/f7b8edd5.jpg,2008-01-29 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11040-take-to-the-skies/,Ambush RealityTiny Evil,"Let's face it-- when it comes to pairing two genres, sounds, or ideologies to create a new musical hybrid, rock long ago ran out of all its natural ""you got chocolate in my peanut butter"" combinations. For better or worse, this is how we end up with stuff like the Advantage, A Hillbilly Tribute to AC/DC and ""Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa"". And now, joining the mayonnaise-on-french-fries sweepstakes with an unholy union of post-hardcore and hi-NRG keyboards, is Enter Shikari. While it doesn't match Switched-On Bach for instant illogical strangeness, this upstart quartet's inspired decision to laminate energetic synthesizer blasts onto their cacophonous thrash does sound like a recipe for disaster on first blush. Surely one component of the combo will be made to suffer, either by the peppy keys rendering the metallic clatter toothless or the head-banging stuff turning the dance touches into brittle irony. Fortunately, the synth treatments on Take to the Skies are sufficiently superficial that there's no real threat of obtrusiveness on either side. The trance and rave elements-- almost invariably shimmery, galloping little things-- are just pronounced enough to lend a happy novelty to the proceedings, occasionally buoying the likes of ""No Sssweat"" and ""Labyrinth"" but rarely dictating the real pulse or tenor of a song. What we're left with then is a schizophrenic post-hardcore outfit, oscillating at expected junctures between unmitigated thrash and conventional rock passages. Lead singer Roughton ""Rou"" Reynolds transitions ably between larynx-shredding sandpaper yelps (plus occasional Cookie Monster growl) and cleanly plaintive emoting, with bassist Chris Batten also adding pristine pipes to fulfill the Daron Malakian role for a band that quite often evokes System of a Down (particularly on the anthemic ""Mothership""). As it is with many debuts, Take to the Skies reveals a band working to pin down what it does well, trying on several hats and seeing which ones fit. Surprisingly, many do-- songs like ""Sorry, You're Not a Winner"" and the single ""Anything Can Happen in the Next Half Hour..."" showcase a facility with riffage, while ""Jonny Sniper"" and ""OK, Time For Plan B"" nicely proffer tuneful, searching pop-rock, the latter sounding downright New Romantic in spots. At the same time, however, many of the conventional rock moments sound, well, blandly conventional, and the utterly inconsequential comedown ""Today Won't Go Down in History"" suggests it'll be some time before Enter Shikari masters quieter, more ruminative fare. In order to make sure they get that time, the band will likely need to either refine or ditch altogether the synthesized window dressing-- in its current incarnation it's the kind of semi-clever gimmick that's practically guaranteed to grow stale if overused. Surely it'll take a little more than a simple formula of ""sonic blitzkrieg + cheesy keys"" to keep the majority of Shikari's 183,900-odd MySpace buddies compelled for the long haul.","English band's unholy union of post-hardcore thrash, Cookie Monster vocals, and ravey keyboards has surprising moments of effectiveness.

The Evening Descends,Evangelicals,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b449ea9e61561daa6c15/1:1/w_160/b0b7d3eb.jpg,2008-01-29 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11095-the-evening-descends/,Dead Oceans,"In an interview with Pitchfork shortly after the release of Evangelicals' 2006 debut, So Gone, Josh Jones revealed that he was already plotting album no. 2: ""I think it's going to be like Marvin Gaye meets the Rocky Horror Picture Show."" He wasn't too far off the mark. OK, so maybe Jones' frantic falsetto isn't quite let's-get-it-on smooth, but his mention of the glam-rock musical was no gross overstatement: The Evening Descends is bursting with balcony-pitched histrionics, molten Brian May leads, and standing-ovation-worthy crashes. But what really makes this album special is the ways in which the Evangelicals pull off big-stage spectacle on what still sounds like a public-access cable-show budget. More than their shared zip code and mutual affinity for lysergic pop songs, it's this thrifty ideology that most closely relates Evangelicals to the Flaming Lips-- specifically the anarchic mid-80s incarnation that proved a few well-utilized Christmas lights and fog machines can make a bar band look like Pink Floyd. But where So Gone deployed the kitchen-sink aesthetic in a more chaotic fashion-- with recording levels and synth squelches dropping in and out of the mix without warning-- on The Evening Descends, the production quirks and strange background noises mostly serve the songs' momentum rather than subvert them. Mind you, that's not a conclusion you'd immediately draw from the opening title track, a deconstructed lullaby that takes all of the Evangelicals' signature devices-- ghostly hums, glammy guitar swirls, video-game synth effects, subliminal conversations and Jones' fragile croon-- breaks them down and pieces them back together at random. But after this curious opener-- perhaps their fucked-up idea of a storybook-like introduction to set the album's nocturnal mood-- Evangelicals don't look back. Like So Gone, the songs on The Evening Descends find Jones toeing the blurry lines separating ennui, intoxication and insanity. But the more patient, assertive performances (unlike So Gone, Jones recorded the new album with bassist Kyle Davis and drummer Austin Stephens) lends Jones' peculiar musings a greater degree of sincerity. When he sings ""please don't tell my mother/ She wouldn't want to know/ I've been goin' crazy"" (on ""Midnight Vignette""), it sounds less like paranoid stoner-speak than a portrait of a very real domestic drama. The triumphant ""Skeleton Man"" presents an even more poignant portrait of an outcast in search of acceptance, his pleas for understanding set to a resolute, bouncing-ball march-- in step with Arcade Fire's ""Rebellion (Lies)""-- that retains its composure even as the strangulated voices and mad-cap laughter inside his head threaten to overcome him. But it's a tentative peace: ""How Do You Sleep""-- The Evening Descends' most over-the-top gesture-- gushes forth with a multi-tracked miasma of arpeggiated guitars and operatic shrieks; however, unlike the John Lennon classic of the same name, the song is not a scathing indictment but rather a genuine inquiry into overcoming recurring nightmares. The Evening Descends' more considered depiction of Jones' psychosis does not come at the complete expense of Evangelicals' more playful whims: ""Snowflakes"" is a charming winter-wonderland ballad that's a close companion to So Gone's standout serenade ""My Heartache"", and the bad-trip breakdown of ""Party Crashin'"" is framed by cheeky faux hospital-drama dialogue between a doctor and an amputee, Jones' cries undercut by a chipper acoustic riff and wailing sirens. Evangelicals are mostly careful to not let their found-sound chicanery overwhelm their songs, however, ""Bellawood""-- The Evening Descends' one out-and-out misstep-- is guilty of over-selling the drama, its story of institutionalization delivered with an uncharacteristically contrived performance by Jones and bogged down by B-movie shtickiness (Hitchcockian strings, Theremin effects). Perhaps it's an instant self-correcting measure that the song is immediately followed by ""Paperback Suicide"", a simple, glockenspieled power-pop number whose breezy, blissful demeanor craftily belies its tale of a frustrated writer who kills himself just to hear his own obituary-- a requiem for every struggling artist who's pondered infamy through the afterlife. And so The Evening Descends' storybook structure yields an important lesson: There's no need to fake the weird when you live in the real world.","Oklahoma psych-pop band follows its excellent debut with a record bursting with balcony-pitched histrionics, molten Brian May leads, and standing-ovation-worthy crashes.

Odelay: Deluxe Edition,Beck,by: Ryan Dombal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Features Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4565e6ef959693225ca/1:1/w_160/f3640c8a.jpg,2008-01-29 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11104-odelay-deluxe-edition/,Geffen,"In Spin's 20 Years of Alternative Music, Beck is called ""a generation's consolation prize after the death of Kurt Cobain."" Chronologically, it's an apt assessment: Cobain killed himself on April 5, 1994; ""Loser"" peaked at #10 on the Billboard charts three weeks later. But back in the mid-90s, Beck was practically Cobain's polar opposite. Whereas Kurt exuded raw power with every phlegm-spewing roar, Beck rapped in monotone (when he wasn't crooning like a sleep-deprived folkie). Kurt hunched and staggered; Beck pranced, did splits, and mimicked robots. Kurt raged against a doomed world with a vitriolic mix of anger and sincerity; Beck took the piss out of a doomed world with a mix of irony and showmanship. Admittedly, they were both known to wear flannel shirts from time to time. Beck's popularity can not only be read as a consolation prize to Cobain's legend, but as a reaction to it-- the weirdo L.A. huckster who could sing ""I'm a loser, baby, so why don't you kill me"" as a t-shirt-ready slacker joke rather than a seething slacker lament. So, after getting their hearts busted by an unlikely savior, Alternative America turned to a cheese-whiz rhyming folk-hop clown who treated death as just another convention to flout. With ""Loser"", Beck was the rebound boyfriend, the one who'll make you laugh for the time being. And then came Odelay-- a thoroughly carefree-sounding affair that made everyone take this boyish imp very seriously. It's the album where he managed to combine the disparate noise, blues, and subverted hippie-isms of his early work into a showy post-modern marvel. In hindsight, the record sounds like the world's most accomplished demo reel-- an introductory smorgasbord pumped-up on its own premeditated randomness. The origins of Mutations' shambling acoustic blues can be found within come-down closer ""Ramshackle"". And Odelay's funkiest, most scatterbrained tracks like ""Where It's At"" and ""High 5 (Rock the Catskills)"" were later pushed to their logical extreme on Midnite Vultures' ingenious Prince-isms. Add some sweeping strings and ""Jack-Ass"" easily becomes a Sea Change highlight. So while Beck has spent the last 12 years largely sampling and expounding upon the ideas he presented on his most popular album, Odelay's most distinguishing feature is its effortless summation of decades of popular music by-way-of the Dust Brothers' still-fresh production. From the nervy opening chords of ""Devil's Haircut"" (based on the garage-rock classic ""I Can Only Give You Everything"") to the signature sax riff of ""The New Pollution"" (lovingly pilfered from forgotten tenor player Joe Thomas's ""Venus""), Odelay is the album every record-diving MPC-phile wants to make. Though the LP was a huge commercial success, its sound was never successfully equaled by savvy opportunists. Chalk it up to the increasingly complicated legalities of sampling, as Beck explained in a 2005 interview: ""Back [on Odelay] it was basically me writing chord changes and melodies, and then endless records being scratched and little sounds coming off the turntable. Now it's prohibitively difficult and expensive to justify your one weird little horn blare that happens for half of a second one time in a song and makes you give away 70% of the song and $50,000."" And, of course, it's the little lifts-- the sex-ed dialogue on ""Where It's At"", the snippet of Schubert's ""Unfinished Symphony #8 in B Minor"" on ""High 5"", the dozens (hundreds?) of unique drum hits and perfectly placed sonic scribbles-- that makes Odelay such a deep and engaging listen even after all the headphone sessions and Best Album of the 90s accolades. Tellingly, when Beck and the Dust Brothers tried to recreate their signature style on 2005's Guero they couldn't pull it off, inadvertently reinforcing Odelay's lasting appeal in the process. To some, it may seem a bit premature for this 12-year-old LP to get the deluxe treatment, but in this age of shameless instant-reissues put forth by disintegrating major labels, it's a relatively classy (if not exactly indispensable) barrel scrape. Along with a playfully drawn-over cover and liner note contributions from Thurston Moore and Dave Eggers, the reissue is padded with an entire disc of era-appropriate B-sides along with two previously unreleased tracks. While sometimes intriguing and ecstatic, the bonus tracks rarely live up to anything from the proper album. Of the unearthed songs, the schizophrenic dial-flip pastiche ""Inferno"" contains many genre-hopping ideas across its seven minutes but none are fully realized. And ""Gold Chains"" is a decidedly less funky version of ""Sissyneck"" with lyrical hip-hop symbolizers in place of country tropes. Unwisely, the extra disc begins with U.N.K.L.E.'s never ending ""Where It's At"" redo, which at 12 minutes is easily nine minutes too long. Elsewhere, semi-songs, stepping-stones, and studio wankery abound, revealing Beck's growth post-Mellow Gold in real time-- they're interesting in theory, at least. The most enduring tracks-- ""Feather in Your Cap"" and ""Brother""-- are somber ballads Beck recorded before he hooked up with the Dust Brothers. With lines like, ""Disappointment is a feather in your cap/ You want the truth so you can crush it in your hand,"" these songs suggest the straightforward emotionalism of Sea Change-- an approach Beck would need a few more years to feel comfortable bringing to the fore. For all of their differences, both Kurt Cobain and Beck had overarching obsessions with death and decay. Kurt took his preoccupation with the ultimate end to its ultimate end, but Beck chose to gussy it up on Odelay, going on cryptically about Gods and devils while hip-hop-tinged party music juxtaposed the existential angst. On ""Novocane"", he screams through a bullhorn: ""Got so numb, longhorn drums/ Detonate with the suicide gate."" Later on, he's ""more dead than alive"" over a distinctly lively old-school jam. ""Put a song in your throat/ Let the dead beats pound all around,"" he hums on ""Ramshackle"". Through ingenious technical savvy and an ear for hooks that span generations, Beck and the Dust Brothers managed to turn many dead beats into signs of life on Odelay. Twelve years on, it's still a prize-- no consolation necessary.","Beck's Odelay-- the album on which this former folk-hop singer combined the disparate noise, blues, and subverted hippie-isms of his early work into a showy post-modern marvel-- is reissued with a disc of era-appropriate B-sides and two previously unreleased tracks.

The Voice of Lightness / Bel Canto,Tabu Ley RochereauMbilia Bel,by: Mike Powell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b413ea9e61561daa6bc7/1:1/w_160/3377d698.jpg,2008-01-29 06:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11650-the-voice-of-lightness-bel-canto/,Sterns Africa,"Besides Franco, Tabu Ley Rochereau is probably the most well-known Congolese musician of the 20th century-- a distinction that likely means as much to Western listeners as ""preeminent Montenegrin fullback."" That of course, isn't their fault, or anybody else's. But rather than theatrically bemoan the nature and economics of cross-cultural exchange, let's focus on what we do have, namely The Voice of Lightness, collecting 29 of the omnivorous tenor's sides spanning 1961-1977 (admittedly, only about half his career). Rochereau was, primarily, a showman and politician. Groomed to be a preacher-- a happy irony and no coincidence, I don't think-- he started writing songs for Joseph Kabasele's African Jazz (then Congo's most popular band) when he was about 16, eventually joining as a backing vocalist. Fame came early and thick, in part because Rochereau wanted it: When he took a lead vocal on ""Succès African Jazz"", he bragged about their popularity in Cuba when Cuba didn't even carry their records; in his own career, he occasionally sang in a made-up language resembling Spanish (a tactical move, a move for the vote); he sang from a woman's perspective on ""Mongali""; on ""Mokolo Nakokufa"", he assumes a series of characters musing on mortality, including a man wondering about who will weep for him when he dies, and, curiously, a woman who moans, ""I'll miss African Fiesta."" He recorded a song about how remarkably clean Omo laundry soap kept his shirts. But Rochereau's impulse to boast and pander in his lyrics, however sweetly, didn't make him a philistine. When he left African Jazz to form African Fiesta, he took some of their best musicians with him (hooking the brilliant Nico, then one of three guitarists behind African Jazz, with the opportunity of a more central role). And with them-- and in his later 1960s and 70s bands, African Fiesta 66 and Afrisa-- he created an incredibly diverse catalog of pop music. The same impulse that made him make up a language probably inspired him to mix Congolese musics other than rumba into his style; his cautious interest in James Brown-- whom Franco once called a ""monkey""-- half-inspired the evolution of soukous, where songs broke down partway into a frenzied dance; and ""Aon Aon"", named onomatopoetically for the wah-wah guitar, is the sound of African funk before Fela. There's almost never a limp moment or dull melody; the songs are as accommodating to dancing as they are to whistling; and when Rochereau makes radical little plays at genre-bending and stylistic experimentation, he does what few innovators bother to do-- puts the people first. Mbilia Bel's story, like half the stories in the history of Congolese pop in the 20th century, involves Tabu Ley Rochereau (the other half, of course, involve Franco). Rochereau saw her on TV one day in 1981, performing as a backing vocalist for Abeti Masikini, and, in the way I imagine only famous pop musicians and royalty and law enforcement can do, sent for her presence. Within a couple years, she'd reached the front the stage with Afrisa International; she and Tabu Ley got married, and he started writing songs for her. Bel Canto is as much a retrospective of her as it is of Afrisa in the 80s, when soukous had fully flourished, when nary a guitar wound its way into a record without passing through a chorus pedal first, when increased production quality showed rhythms to bubble and crisp where before they'd only gently percolated. Lingala, the Congolese language Bel sang in, has a naturally percussive inflection, but the traces of French and Portuguese make it sound fluid; as for Bel, she sings in it beautifully-- a smooth voice that flutters in upper ranges and croaks in lower, embodying its natural tensions. The grooves are somewhere between Rochereau's and Fela's in length-- usually between eight and 12 minutes, just enough time to cook, but not enough time to truly bore (as, I hold out heretically, Fela always ends up doing to me). With the 80s came better access to synthesizers, which explore the mix with charming clumsiness, sometimes trying to imitate guitars, sometimes horns, sometimes just squelching around just for the heck. Having the lyrics help, too: Though written by Rochereau and probably not given the most attentive English translation, they're gems of self-conscious femininity that, if not exactly liberated, sound as compromised and intimate as couplets from Slits or Raincoats records. Mbilia talks about the beauty of her husband's mistress without envy and being in a bloodless marriage to a rich man, sure-- but then turns her nose up at a jealous lover with a dignity that probably makes him frustrated enough to scream and shamed enough to cry: ""You act as though an insect has bitten you. Where did it bite you?"" she chirps, gliding away. Rochereau's the man here, of course, and for however much she was beloved, Bel was first and foremost his protégé. He gave her lyrics and a band, but there was one thing she found on her own (though he had plenty of it in reserve): charm.",,8.3,
The Message Uni Versa,G&D,by: Ryan Dombal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Features Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b42eb1335d7bf169a6f7/1:1/w_160/cd6b20cd.jpg,2008-01-28 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11073-the-message-uni-versa/,Look,"There's a fine line between crazy-stupid and crazy-genius. In the 1970s George Clinton and his P-Funk crew typified the latter concept; They devised album covers inspired by both Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey and Shaft, freaked out like the universe's most flamboyant muppets, and concocted grooves with a warped funkiness that has yet to be topped. Whacked-R&B purveyors Georgia Anne Muldrow and Dudley Perkins most likely have multiple copies of almost every LP George Clinton ever had a hand in. Everything about The Message Uni Versa-- from its trippy illustrated cover to its outer space-inspired title to its bulbous beats and Utopian lyrics-- feels like a well-meaning tribute to the P-Funk aura. But the love letter often sounds like a parody thanks to its overwhelming sense of half-assed-ness. While the loping, bass-heavy genre was born with a satisfied casualness, this is just ridiculous-- of the album's 20 tracks, only about half are true-to-life songs and the central hippiefied messages are afterthoughts at best. And instead of Clinton's bracing LCD-laced absurdity, Uni Versa finds Perkins and Muldrow huffing and puffing their way to becoming babbling peaceniks too high to think clearly but not high enough to enter another realm of thought all together. There's no doubt this couple are soul mates-- Perkins is the eternally smoked-out, goofy-voiced Stones Throw rebel too unfocused to ever achieve greatness, Muldrow is the eternally smoked-out, second rate-Badu-style Stones Throw rebel too spacey to ever make some genuine earth-shaking funk. They're the bumbling duo who would sneak into the trees behind the high school come lunch time. Encouraging each other's most flighty tendencies, the record is peppered with three stupendously dumb and unfunny skits in which the duo converse in faux-medieval accents while the MIDI soundtrack to King's Quest VI diddles away (sample exchange: ""Hark, who goes there?"" ""It is I, fair lady!""). The skit trilogy makes Martin Lawrence's King Arthur farce Black Knight seem like a haughty slice of period piece Oscar bait. And the filler doesn't stop there: lazy, abbreviated beats, new reverb plug-in tests, and five full minutes of ambient party noise waste time in-between the duo's more legitimate attempts at modern hip-hop funk. Even on the few odd tracks that could pass for P-Funk C-sides including ""One"" and ""Godunit"", Perkins manages to tank them with his wearisome ODB-meets-Chappelle flow and sub-""Sesame Street"" motivational gobbledygook (""We came here to light your way/ 'Til you see a brighter day""). Funkadelic's sometimes brutal commentary and harsh realities are diluted into the sound byte nostalgia of an over-the-bend Deadhead. This album couldn't get the most funk-starved nation under its groove. No asses will follow it. It will not lead to anyone having sex. It's perfunctory funk for desperate neo-soulsters. ""Wake up and don't sleep -- don't be so lazy,"" advises Perkins on the numbingly vague anti-Bush diatribe ""War Drums"". Message, meet mirror.","Everything about Georgia Anne Muldrow and Dudley Perkins' latest-- from its trippy illustrated cover to its outer space-inspired title to its bulbous beats and Utopian lyrics-- feels like a well-meaning tribute to the P-Funk aura.

Little Eyes,Ed Askew,by: Andrew Gaerig,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b41db1335d7bf169a6d9/1:1/w_160/241c69ef.JPG,2008-01-28 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11057-little-eyes/,De StijlDe Stijl,"Ed Askew's ""Little Eyes"" should've launched a career. At the very least it should've launched a massive cult following and astronomical eBay bidding wars, maybe a passing mention in one of those old San Francisco Rolling Stones. ""Little Eyes"" sounds like Bob Dylan, and not Blood on the Tracks Dylan, but blush-faced Freewheelin' Dylan*.* Which can't be, of course, but it's a nice thought to have during the opening moments of an album. All that minor fame couldn't have been either, as Little Eyes languished unissued after Askew put it to tape in 1970 up until De Stijl drug it up. This is not entirely surprising: Askew's debut, re-released in 2005 as Ask the Unicorn, was an obscure record on the obscure (now revered) ESP-Disk label. It is difficult even to confirm if Askew was Ed's given name or a cute label befitting his appearance and sound. Still, with his ESP-Disk flailing, Askew sat down to ""capture his live sound,"" a hilarious put-on given that Unicorn didn't exactly sound like a Phil Spector joint. The Dylan parallels are superficial and obvious; Askew's high-tenor sounds like yarn looks and he works on the trebly tiple-- ten-stringed (sometimes twelve) national instrument of Colombia-- that sounds a lot like a poorly recorded acoustic guitar bleating knotty rhythms. There is a harmonica. Unlike many artists to whom the tag is applied, Askew's sound actually fits in pretty well with the ""freak folk"" sound and aesthetic, or at least he looks better there than in ""next Dylan"" fatigues. Little Eyes accrues a vaguely psychedelic sheen both through Askew's lyrical fascinations-- cosmos, nature, things phantasmagorical-- as well as through tonal slurring: remember the last time you listened to an album with no bass tones of substance, how the whinnies and pitters suck and distort. Surprisingly, Askew's best when he forces this issue, partly because his attempts at standard folk/blues constructs-- ""Waiting in the Station"", ""My Love is a Red, Red Rose""-- make him sound either unnecessary or amateurish. So it's the narrow, strangulated sounds of ""The Face of Fire"" or ""Oh, All the Gold and Green Eyes"" where Askew excels. On ""Old Mother Moon"", the only track to noticeably feature any instrument other than a tiple or a harmonica (Askew plays a piano), Askew sputters his words with weird accents and in unconnected patterns, such that it sort of sounds like someone trying valiantly to turn the Velvet Underground's ""The Murder Mystery"" into music for a doctor's office. The title track, as smitten as Askew ever seems, alternates simple harp with prim romantic verse: ""Ohhhhhh what have I/ I see you/ In the sun/ But the sun never sets and the moon never shines/ Little eyes."" The six live tracks added to the end of Little Eyes-- only ""Red Rose"" is repeated-- are a nice bonus and mostly indistinguishable from the ""studio"" material, much of which was reportedly recorded in one take anyway. Sixteen tracks, though, of a folksinger who neither frightens nor soothes, who's never angry and only a little in love, chafes. Askew plays a tiple and sounds a little bit like Bob Dylan, and for three in a half decades people all but forgot he existed; ""Little Eyes"" is the loveliest of songs, its creator a fanciful what-if.","Second album from obscure singer-songwriter, who at times sounds remarkably like Bob Dylan, was recorded in 1970 but not issued until recently; the songs accrue a vaguely psychedelic sheen both through Askew's lyrical fascinations-- cosmos, nature, things phantasmagorical-- as well as through tonal slurring.

Superman Was a Rocker,Robert Pollard,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b453ea9e61561daa6c23/1:1/w_160/563195a7.jpg,2008-01-28 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11102-superman-was-a-rocker/,Happy Jack Rock,"Superman Was a Rocker is best described by its origin story: Former Guided by Voices frontman Robert Pollard rummages through a bunch of old cassettes, happens upon a handful of unreleased instrumental songs, overdubs some vocals, and releases a half-hour long album. Superman could be touted as a thrilling return to Pollard's four-track glory days, but the record is more accurately an update of largely subpar pre-recorded material. Though Pollard is often thought of as something of a savant, his best records have been products of intensive craft and focus. As a collection of reworked outtakes, Superman is innately handicapped and limited; not one song on the album is host to the inspired energy that characterizes Pollard's best work. There is little to be gained from harping on the differences Pollard's lo-fi and hi-fi material. Pollard is capable of turning out a versatile array of extremely strong songs regardless of recording quality, and Bee Thousand's greatest strength is most certainly not its veil of tape hiss. Perhaps the most exciting facet of Guided by Voices' ""classic"" albums is their variety; Pollard has always been a fan of crediting his music to imaginary bands and conceptualizing his records as fictitious radio programs. Several of the songs on Superman Was a Rocker would work fine as stopgaps between undeniable jams on a proper Guided by Voices record, but fail to constitute an enjoyable album on their own. That said, Superman is not without a handful of decent-to-good tracks. ""Love Your Spaceman"" is a solid Pollard outtake, on par with some of the better tracks on the Suitcase box sets. The instrumental on ""Back to the Farm"" is wisely left vocal-free, and makes for far and away the best moment here. The radio interview excerpt that precedes it is hilarious but, like many of the goofs on Superman, doesn't warrant repeat listens, and takes up an awful lot of space on an already-thin record. Some of the most promising tracks on Superman seem thoroughly compromised by the album's approach; in ""Peacock"", some good vocal ideas are stifled by the instrumental's rigid and predetermined structure. Superman Was a Rocker is host to its share of entertaining gags and solidly musical moments, but even at a scant thirty minutes it feels stretched and slight. While it's impressive that there's still halfway-decent archival material for Pollard to dress up and put out, it's hard to recommend Superman Was a Rocker to anyone who hasn't already exhausted the three or four hundred better songs Pollard has already released.","The first of almost certainly many Robert Pollard releases this year finds the former Guided by Voices star overdubbing vocals over instrumentals discovered on old cassettes.

DJ-Kicks,Booka Shade,by: Tim Finney,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0abb1335d7bf1698088/1:1/w_160/2ea3c160.jpg,2008-01-28 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11059-dj-kicks/,!K7,"One of the assumptions underlying the concept of ""artistry"" is a certain critical distance from the notion of timeliness: ""people will be listening to this album in 20 years' time,"" fans hedge, but what they mean is, ""it doesn't matter how you think it sounds now."" Timeliness is the attribute of the artisan, cannily anticipating and servicing customer demand; artists must either be tragically ahead of their time or blissfully oblivious to it. One senses Booka Shade are keenly aware of this distinction: Their early work as in-house production team for German house label Get Physical was thrilling in its superlative, undemonstrative timeliness, while few dancefloor anthems have felt more ""right now"" than their mid-decade anthems ""Mandarine Girl"" and ""In White Rooms"". But herein lies the rub: Having carved out a sound that was increasingly identifiable, the duo risk being left behind by European dance music's relentless march toward the new, the next thing. If Booka Shade were feeling exhausted by the prospect of keeping pace, a contribution to !K7's DJ-Kicks series offers the perfect escape route: Dominated by performers with a tenuous foothold perch on the dancefloor (Annie, Erlend Øye, Hot Chip), its best efforts have been from dance producers (Playgroup, Henrik Schwarz) stretching to paint on a broader canvas, using polystylistic, multi-era selections to precariously walk the artist-artisan tightrope, suggesting that they, too, were more than just a passing fad. Booka Shade dutifully follow suit, but their leap towards artistic eclecticism can fall short of its destination. For the most part, the tried-and-true insertion of ostentatiously individual and antiquarian favourites into their first DJ mix is a strategic error: the use of John Carpenter instrumentals works well, and I'll allow the inclusion of Yazoo and Heaven 17's jerky synth-pop, but tracks by Aphex Twin and the Streets in particular stand out as great pieces of music whose sore thumb status here does them no favors-- the painful slow-down and speed-up in and out of Aphex's ""Alberto Balsam"" is probably the album's most forced-sounding, artificial moment. Ironically, the most captivating moments on this mix are the string of spectral and dazzlingly unpredictable recent house tunes: Amir Ad Fontes' Amazonian ""Virtual Nature"", Quarion's rippling and rhapsodic ""Play Your Part"", Noze's darkly romantic ""Slum Girl"", or the duo's own glittering ""Estoril"". Were they too quick to abandon up-to-date production as a reigning principle? It's hard to say: it would be a shame to lose Carl Craig's glittering classic ""Landcruising"". Perhaps the issue is that Booka Shade are sound-designers and collaborators more than they are DJs: Their true talent is not for creating links between disparate sounds, but rather for swelling up one sound to suit a variety of purposes, and DJ-Kicks is strongest when it remains within the duo's own vein of highly polished sci-fi romanticism. This isn't a limitation: The mix's most impressive quality is how vast and all-encompassing this niche can feel. And when the sonics fit, Booka Shade's aesthetic expands effortlessly to embrace songfulness: the Wahoo remix of Ben Westbeech's ""Hang Around"" is gorgeously dramatic house-pop (and marvellously buffed up in this mix with atmospherics from Cerrone's ""In the Smoke""-- the album's most impressive mixing feat), but I particularly like the winsome vibe of Hot Chip's sighing remix of Matthew Dear's ""Don & Sherri"" and Booka Shade's own, achingly perfect ""Numbers"". Both circulate around plaintive refrains: ""How can I let you forget me/ If you don't even know me already?"", and ""What's your number?/ I really want you…"" What the latter lacks in lyrical clarity it makes up with sweeping grandeur, decomposing synth chimes and lachrymose strings somehow conveying perfectly that implausible (but nonetheless real) coincidence of dancefloor seduction with metaphysical redemption. It's one of the duo's great and inscrutable production tricks that their descents into outright tearfulness always come as a slight surprise, even on the umpteenth listen-- but then, it's precisely at these moments that the relationship between art and craft in their music becomes mysterious and indecipherable. The ultimate timeliness and sonic precision of DJ-Kicks' best moments shouldn't come as a disappointment: if Booka Shade remain ""mere"" craftsmen, their capacity to unexpectedly tug so hard on the heartstrings is a skill more artists in dance music should strive for.",,7.4,
Vampire Weekend,Vampire Weekend,by: Nitsuh Abebe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b41e13d197565213aa5f/1:1/w_160/8212e6dc.jpeg,2008-01-28 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11058-vampire-weekend/,XL,"If there's anything the happy New York kids in this band have learned from listening to African music, it's the difference between ""pop"" and ""rock"": Vampire Weekend's debut album announces straight off that it's the former. The first sound on the first song, ""Mansard Roof"", comes from Rostam Batmanglij's keyboard, set to a perky, almost piping tone-- the kind of sunny sound you'd hear in old west-African pop. Same goes for Ezra Koenig's guitar, which never takes up too much space; it's that clean, natural tone you'd get on a record from Senegal or South Africa. Chris Baio's bass pulses and slides and steps with light feet, and most of all there's Chris Tomson, who plays like a percussionist as often as he does a rock drummer, tapping out rhythms and counter-accents on a couple of drums in the back of the room. And yet they play it all like indie kids on a college lawn, because they're not hung up on Africa in the least-- a lot of these songs work more like those on the Strokes' debut, Is This It?, if you scraped off all the scuzzy rock'n'roll signifiers, leaving behind nothing but clean-cut pop and preppy new wave, tucked-in shirts and English-lit courses. This Afro/preppy/new-wave combination has a history-- Brits like Orange Juice, Americans like Talking Heads. For now, though, it's one of the most deservedly buzzed-about things around: People have been chattering over Vampire Weekend ever since a CD-R demo of three of these songs started circulating last year. (Full disclosure: One of the sound engineers of that CD-R now does freelance audio work for Pitchfork.) The excitement isn't hard to fathom. People spend a lot of time poking around for the edgy new underground thing, convinced that plain old pop songs have been done to death. But Vampire Weekend come along like Belle & Sebastian and the Strokes each did, sounding refreshingly laidback and uncomplicated, and with simple set-ups that make good songs sound exceedingly easy. (The result being not ""this is mind-blowing,"" or ""this is catchy,"" but ""I have listened to this, straight through, four times a day for the past month"".) No surprise, then, that their first hit mp3 would be a song called ""Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa"", which is sly, quiet, and casual in a way that blows away so many other bands who actively try to get your attention. Their label seems to have understood this effect, and so they've left these demos sounding as natural as they were: This release just fiddles with the mastering, switches out a few takes in ways you wouldn't much notice, plays with the sequencing, relegates one song to a B-side, and adds a couple of great ones that you can nonetheless understand being omitted the first time. Most of the credit will wind up going to Koenig, who's the star presence here. By the second song, ""Oxford Comma"", the band is ticking along on little touches of keyboard and the tap of a snare drum, and he's still keeping the empty space captivating: There's a little indie yelp to his voice, but mostly he's relaxed, conversational, and wry. (Not unlike another guy who's tried on an Afro-suave sound-- though Paul Simon never sounded this exuberant.) The person who'll probably never get enough credit turns out to be Batmanglij, whose pat, classicist keyboard arpeggios lead the way through tempo shifts and transitions, occasionally locking in with some sprightly violin parts. It all comes off as simple, jaunty, and homespun, but there's a lot of precision lurking beneath-- exactly what happens when you combine a music major and indie-pop. Koenig is smart and lucky, in that he gets to play the preppy angle both ways: Like a guy who's read a lot of Cheever, he can summon up the atmosphere of kids whose parents use ""summer"" as a verb and give it all the hairy eyeball at the same time. ""Oxford Comma"" is spent picking on someone who brags too much about money: ""Why would you lie about how much coal you have?/ Why would you lie about something dumb like that?"" (Then again, there's nothing more moneyed than having the luxury to find money tacky, and when Koenig adds that Lil Jon ""always tells the truth,"" you kind of suspect Lil Jon wouldn't find how much ""coal"" someone has to be all that irrelevant.) Later, walking across the Columbia University campus, Koenig drops a detail whose delivery always gets a smile from me, even if its thrust is hard to gauge: ""You spilled kefir on your keffiyeh."" Koenig is a detail guy, a happy observer who never much bores you with how he feels; mostly, as befits a recent college grad, he's singing about location, about where people will go and whether they'll come back with new faces. In non-album B-side ""Ladies of Cambridge"", he can't decide whether to move there with the girl or mourn letting her go alone; ""Walcott"" whirls you through Cape Cod and then suggests getting the hell out (""Bottleneck is a shit show/ Hyannisport is a ghetto""); the twitchy ""A-Punk"" sees one person off to New Mexico while another stays near college and finds a place in Washington Heights. And while the faux-African backing vocals on ""One"" might be the album's only real misstep, the final line sums up where its concerns are: ""All your collegiate grief has left you/ Dowdy in sweatshirts/ Absolute horror!"" Of course, while Vampire Weekend have certainly benefited from our new music world of internet buzz, plenty of people have found reasons to hate Vampire Weekend from the first note, many of them having to do with their prep aesthetic and Ivy League educations-- Oxford shirts, boat shoes, Columbia University. But it just so happens that we're in a moment where such things matter to people: As interest grows in clean-cut, clever indie-pop, plenty of folks would like to hear things get dirtier, riskier, less collegiate-- and in a lot of corners of the indie landscape, they thankfully are. But here's another odd parallel with that first Strokes record: Vampire Weekend have the same knack for grabbing those haters and winning them over. Bring any baggage you want to this record, and it still returns nothing but warm, airy, low-gimmick pop, peppy, clever, and yes, unpretentious-- four guys who listened to some Afro-pop records, picked up a few nice ideas, and then set about making one of the most refreshing and replayable indie records in recent years.","Already one of the most talked-about and divisive records of the year, Vampire Weekend's Afro-pop- and preppy-inflected debut is simple, jaunty, homespun, and-- like the early albums from fellow fast-risers Belle & Sebastian and the Strokes were on their release-- one of the most refreshing and replayable indie records in recent years.

Frontman Sam ""Mother"" Smith mumbles something about a stormy night in his best Mark E. Smith mutter, while his band kicks into a gritty, repetitive groove that sounds like it's being broadcast live from the floor of BBC Radio's Maida Vale studios. ""We're moving north, we're going native,"" the Mother goes on to say, presenting us with a fitting mission statement for a band that dutifully follows the lead of every important north-country indie export-- from the Fall and Orange Juice to Happy Mondays and Pulp-- of the past three decades. Science Fiction Illustrated rarely ventures beyond well-established student-disco parameters, but Mother and the Addicts at least seem particularly attuned to crafting smart, snappy songs that will keep both 20-year-old white-jeaned scenesters and their 40-year-old aging-punk art-school professors on the dancefloor. Smith's lyrics hew closely to the wry, observational commentary that is Jarvis Cocker's stock in trade, pointing out other people's flaws and foibles, but in a manner that's as sympathetic as it is critical. (As he's fond of pointing out, our perceived problems are often ""all in the mind."") As such, Mother sounds conflicted over whether to maintain his vantage on the sidelines or just join the party, a quandary reflected in his songs' linear but ramshackle presentation -- as he admits on ""Going Native"": ""we tried to sell our souls, but our songs wouldn't let us."" So Mother and the Addicts split the difference between cynicism and populism, alternating regularly between urgently strummed locomotive rockers (the best of which, ""Yeah Next"", underpins its nervous energy with piercing piano stabs) and some hot shots of white funk that show the band's secret weapon is its rhythm section: ""Watch the Lines"" is a Madchester flashback given a few extra inches of bounce by a synth line that's just waiting to be mashed up with Yazoo's ""Don't Go""; and the glam-disco centerpiece ""Are Others"" provides formidable evidence that Orange Juice's Glasgow School is still producing skilled graduates some 25 years on. But even when Mother and the Addicts are dealing in de-concentrated OJ, there's still no harm in succumbing to the urge to-- as Mother commands us elsewhere-- ""sip it up."" And start again.","This Chemikal Underground release comes from a band that dutifully follows the lead of every important north-country UK indie export-- from the Fall and Orange Juice to Happy Mondays and Pulp-- of the past three decades.

Depending on taste, the defiant strains of ""Burning"" either hang in the air like a big ball of exhilaration or a knot of frustration. Complicating matters (for those on the fence, at least) is the tauntingly spare drumming of Ian Antonio, who supports the staccato playing with only the most reserved sort of aggression, letting a feigned backbeat or an oddly-placed tom flutter suggest an entire dimension to the song that only half-exists. Sure, for a few blissful seconds, Zs are a rock band. But anyone aching for 60 minutes of that stuff, or hoping to find out where those backbeats and tom flutters might, you know, go, oughta look elsewhere. After all, Zs offer no illusions of conventional rockness. They stare through reams and reams of sheet music when they play live, and, taken as a whole, Arms is a lot more ephedrine Earle Brown or Mark Feldman than, say, Mick Barr or Don Cab. Remember: This is the kind of band that takes the buckshot vocal melody of ""Nobody Wants to be Had"" and commands its instruments to follow, tit for tat. In choral music, unison voicing spreads a single melody wide, creating a singular, massive voice. Here, Zs use unison to achieve the opposite effect, hammering identical (or rigidly contrapuntal) melodies out on strings, reeds, and skins, all delivered with a fervor that splinters and sharpens the phrases into razor-y points. Tracks like the 11-minute ""I Can't Concentrate"" aren't one massive voice-- they're a scary-sharp mouth of fangs. But, counterintuitively, it's when the band reins things in that its at its most compelling. In the last minute of ""Concentrate"", Zs-as-rock-band hit their stride when the collection of stair-step sax passes suddenly turn into a squealing, skronking Luttenbacher jam, complemented by the album's only conventional drum beat. Then Antonio's rolling tom figures extend Charlie Looker's guitar part underneath the hissing brass, and usher in the record's quietly rewarding homestretch. There, the bubbling brass micro-rhythms of ""Except When You Don't Because Sometimes You Won't"" resemble the lassoed moments of Storm and Stress, before uneventfully disappearing into the wind chimes of ""Z Is for Zone"". It's this smartly placed reserve, a beautifully smooth valley after a harsh peek, that makes a decent case for Arms.","This Brooklyn avant-chamber crew hammers melodies out on strings, reeds, and skins, all delivered with a fervor that splinters and sharpens the phrases into razor-y points.

Though the group generated at least 20 releases, only one-- 1993's Loud Sounds Dopa-- was ever widely available in the U.S. So Early Works is an excellent opportunity for noise-geeks to fully immerse themselves in this group's enveloping sound-world. C.C.C.C. were a four-piece centered around Hiroshi Hasegawa and Mayuko Hino. The former started the group to try his hand at guitar, but soon moved to electronics and synth; the latter, previously an actress in ""pink movies"" (Japanese soft-core porn), joined to add voice and homemade electronics. Rounded out by the drum programming of Fumio Kosakai and the bass of Ryuchi Nagakubo, C.C.C.C.'s sound was sometimes called ""psychedelic noise,"" and it certainly had a hallucinatory quality-- even their most abrasive pieces are so dense with ideas it can be hard to process them all in one sitting. Such a detailed style encouraged long durations. Early Works' four discs offer only eight tracks, most hovering near the half-hour mark. (The first six tracks are previously-unreleased live cuts recorded between 1990 and 1992, while the final two are taken from rare, out-of-print releases.) Given the time and attention they require, pieces this long can be daunting even for noise aficionados. But none of these tracks are unvaried or forbidding. C.C.C.C.'s work can be harsh and aggressive, but it's always busy, never content to sit in one place for long. If you're even slightly inclined toward the hypnotic powers of noise, you're bound to get hooked by at least some of Early Works. The tracks most likely to snare ears are those whose noise is in constant motion, traversing so much sonic ground that it finishes miles from where it began. On ""Live at Donzoko House #1"", thick drones recall the dense layers of Double Leopards, while on ""Live at Dozonko House #2"", naturalistic noises evoke a campsite, synths whir like spaceships, voice-like whines conjure nightmares, and guitar achieves Metal Machine Music-worthy dissonance. All this bubbling activity can be dizzying, but C.C.C.C. could be starkly minimal too: check out ""Live at Gospel #2"", whose clanging Kosakai percussion feels like the score to a documentary on the beauty of construction sites. Since C.C.C.C. disbanded in the mid-90s, Kosakai joined Incapacitants, who played last year's No Fun Fest, while Hasegawa has pursued a solo project called Astro, which will play this May's installment, the first to be held at the Knitting Factory. In his liner notes, Kosakai suggests that a C.C.C.C. reunion is unlikely to occur. But in a better world, the achievement of Early Works would propel the group to reform, just in time to headline the Madison Square Garden edition of No Fun Fest that's surely on the horizon.","The first archival release by Carlos Giffoni's No Fun Productions label is a stunner, a beautifully-packaged, highly-detailed 4-CD set by 1990s Japanese juggernaut C.C.C.C., affording an excellent opportunity for noise-geeks to fully immerse themselves in this group's enveloping sound-world.

Light Works,Aloha,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4275e6ef95969322587/1:1/w_160/ff5107b4.jpg,2008-01-25 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11067-light-works/,Polyvinyl,"Aloha's history is geographic distance (the members spread across the eastern half of the country) bridged by sporadic meet-ups to record-- best illustrated by __ this photo__: the four members sitting next to one another in an airport terminal, carry-on luggage at their feet. On the far right T.J. Lipple, with headphones on, taps away at a MacBook. When the members of Aloha get to the studio, they treat it like a hotel, as well; milking it for all its amenities, and possibly sleeping there while tweaking their music to ensure a sound that reflects the mutually loved labor of a group of session musicians. From their initial EPs through the two LPs that first gained them notice, Aloha's music has certainly always sounded good. Rich with dense textures and non-traditional arrangements and instrumentation (vibraphone, mellotron), their music rewards a good set of headphones and a preference for refined, at times pristine architecture. The mini-LP Light Works continues that tradition, but removes the quasi-prog ornamentation and offers a disrobed version of the essential stuff that's always been at the core of Aloha's compositions: heart-on-sleeve indie built from acoustic guitar and piano. In the past, with vibraphone, sustained organ tones, and staggered drumming poking at Tony Cavallario's eerily calm vocals, Aloha built their reputation on radiating breezy calmness amidst palpable disquiet. There's much less decor on Light Works, but still a palpable push-pull between composure and consternation, Cavallario's lyrics gaining weight via a cavernous mix and the subtle instrumental shadings of Lipple, the band's not-so-secret weapon. On ""Body Buzz"", Cavallario re-connects with a long-lost and apparently unstable acquaintance, and comes to terms with what's happened in the interim. ""Gold World"" is less fraught, but still colored by the anxiety that comes with anticipating some sort of companionship. Much of Light Works is influenced by faith, and at times, even piousness, with ""Passengers"" offering a delicate admonition that sums up the emotional as well as musical content of the record: ""too much of anything is wrong."" The two best songs here directly address the perceived work of an almighty, and the serenity in these moments comes across as an eerie sign of existential acquiescence. The quick, meticulous picking on ""Trick Spring"" evokes a time-lapse view of a seasonal flower blooming, and the song periodically opens up to ethereal chants and church organ, as Cavallario marvels at the perceived work of his creator. ""The End"", with its instantly appealing melody, is much more direct: ""The devil may deliver me an easy time/ There's riches I'll deny or oblige/ When I'm leaving."" Perhaps to those who share Cavallario's epistemological framework, this might offer comfort. Personally, I find it yet another form of disquiet from a band known for eliciting unease-- gentle compliance with unseen forces shakes out for me as unnerving-- but one I thus find hard to fully engage. I don't feel Cavallario is critical enough here, and while it warms his own heart, it leaves me a bit cold. While Ben Gibbard doesn't typically trade in songs about metaphysical destinations, the most ready comparison for Light Works is Death Cab for Cutie's Transatlanticism-- another pretty and precious record about the emotions that arise between arrivals, real and imagined. Yet despite the music's residual elegance, there's not a lot else to recommend returning to it. Similar to the songs about higher powers, Aloha seems to work better if they work more on the musical edge instead of in the middle. Given this context, the record title seems appropriate, though: With a couple of exceptions, much of Light Works simply wants to float away.","Like Death Cab for Cutie's Transatlantacism, the latest from this Polyvinyl band is a pretty and precious record about the emotions that arise between arrivals and departures.

Brighter Than Creation's Dark,Drive-By Truckers,by: Joshua Love,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b438ea9e61561daa6bf8/1:1/w_160/39af934a.jpg,2008-01-25 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11080-brighter-than-creations-dark/,New West,"As guys wrestle with the encroaching responsibilities of work and family, they still often romanticize or cling to their shit-kicking youth; the Drive-By Truckers' principal songwriters, Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley, represent each side of this coin. Using the broadest strokes imaginable, gravelly and grizzly Hood is the endlessly vigilant, fiercely protective papa bear, while laconic slick-talker Cooley the hell-raising, yarn-spinning fuck-up. There's always been plenty of wiggle room on either side, of course (Cooley's tensely domestic ""Loaded Gun in the Closet"", Hood's ball-busting ""Aftermath USA""), but with the departure of talented third songwriter Jason Isbell, DBT's two founding members solidify their positions within the group on its seventh studio album, Brighter Than Creation's Dark. What at first blush might sound like unhealthy entrenchment turns out to be a brilliant study in duality, as Cooley and Hood-- seemingly in conversation with one another-- weigh the respective pulls of decadence and dependability. The more conventional, traditional Cooley may not win as many critical plaudits as the idiosyncratic Hood, but he's outclassed his comrade over the group's last two, uneven records, contributing gems like ""Where the Devil Don't Stay"" and ""Space City"" while Hood was busy handing out self-help bromides. A tougher, smarter, funnier version of the prototypical alt-country gunslinger, Cooley's in rare wise-cracking form this time around, unspooling quick-witted, sin-soaked vignettes of colorful loners and losers that hearken back to DBT's pre-Southern Rock Opera incarnation as supreme underground redneck jokesters. ""Bob"" and ""Lisa's Birthday"" are both superbly funny character sketches (sorry, no Leon Kompowski cameo on the latter), while ""Self Destructive Zones"" offers a head-spinning, sardonically knowing tour of the past 20 years of angst-rock. But Cooley's most welcome contribution might be the blistering ""3 Dimes Down"", a loose-limbed groover from a story-centric band that's too often a lumbering musical beast. While brother-in-arms Cooley tosses off seemingly effortless odes to fast cars and booze-fueled loving, Hood is still busy being the Tony Soprano of southern rock, an imposing man's man who nonetheless opens up his rawest emotional wounds for inspection. Bathos may have burdened much of his songwriting post-SRO, but Hood sounds reborn here thanks to a newly crystallized focus-- fatherhood. In a less emotionally seasoned songwriter's hands such frequent invocations of dads and kids might seem like a gimmick, but Hood has long been amused, compelled, and inspired by the family, going back to ""Zoloft"", ""Sink Hole"", and the immortal ""The Southern Thing"". Here though, Hood's hearth-honed eye is specifically trained on children, the ones we try to support and protect (""The Righteous Path"", ""Goode's Field Road""), and the ones we sometimes tragically leave behind. Such is the self-excoriating scenario that drives the war-themed ""That Man I Shot"", wherein our protagonist kills an enemy combatant and can't help wondering about the little ones he may have rendered fatherless. That emotional crescendo is followed closely by the similarly pained ""The Home Front"", which tautly conveys the worry of a wife and mother waiting for her man to come back from battle. It's a mostly harrowing cycle that Hood has woven in the midst of Cooley's debauched ditties (with first-time frontwoman Shonna Tucker striking an equitable balance with her three appropriately gritty but generically sung contributions), but it's not all fatherly hand-wringing, thanks at least to the succinctly-phrased ode to decompression, ""Daddy Needs a Drink"". Irresponsible rabble-rouser or put-upon parent, that's a sentiment every grown-ass man can appreciate.","Following the departure of Jason Isbell, Drive-By Truckers' remaining primary songwriters, Patterson Hood and Mike Cooley, offer a brilliant study in duality, as-- seemingly in conversation with one another-- they weigh the respective pulls of decadence and dependability.

Sabotage Gigante,Rob Sonic,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b407c0084474cd0c21ff/1:1/w_160/107ef56a.jpg,2008-01-24 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11037-sabotage-gigante/,Definitive Jux,"The Original Hip-Hop Lyrics Archive is the internet's biggest dedicated site for transcriptions of rap verses, featuring everything from an exhaustive rundown of every Notorious B.I.G. appearance to the lyrics of Fantasy Three's 1984 B-side ""The Buck Stops Here"". Yet despite the fact that Rob Sonic released his second album, Sabotage Gigante, back in September, ohhla.com doesn't even have an entry for him. It's probably not because he's too obscure or not well-established enough; he's been an integral part of the Definitive Jux roster for years. A more likely explanation is that, when faced with a Rob Sonic album, most potential transcribers would probably wind up furrowing their brows, wearing out the rewind button and eventually giving up in total defeat. The thing about Sabotage Gigante, like 2004's Telicatessen, is that it's got an approachable incoherence-- listening to it, you feel like you know English but somehow you don't really know English. Sonic's got a sharp, punchy voice, sort of like labelmate Aesop Rock only with a little less sneer in his inflection. And, much like Aes, he strings together perfectly clear and often catchy fragments of phrasing in a way that turns a full verse into a long string of question marks. Some critics have made the smarmy assertion/joke that Bob Dylan invented rap with ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"", but Rob Sonic actually gives you an idea of what it'd be like if that was actually true. Sabotage Gigante has been said to be Sonic's political album, at least in a more wide-ranging and universal way than Telicatessen's the-personal-is-political themes, but there are so many generalities, abstractions, reappropriated slogans, moments of quadruplespeak, and pseudo-non-sequitur asides that much of the listener's time between headphones is spent trying to untangle it all. ""Dead as Disco"" seems to be a diatribe concerned with the need for escapism during times of national upheaval (""I'll hit the nail on the head tonight/ And no I won't believe another thing that's said tonight/ 'Cause that tiny little radiating engine light/ Means that they wanna make us party like we're dead tonight""), but it's expanded past the usual backpacker/punk rock ""stupid happy music distracts you from What's Really Going On"" didacticism into a fractured anti-narrative that curses out oil barons and the mayor's mansion in the same verse he expresses an urge to ""fuck Mona Lisa 'til her smile is gone."" ""Rock the Convoy"" launches into a CB-jargon-filled bit of trucker references before gradually turning its pill-riddled road-fatigue paranoia in on itself and metaphors start collapsing into each other like an Escher room. And when it's all tossed at you in fast-rap mode, like in the confounding ""Ready Aim Shoot"", it's probably better to hang back and wait for some insight to jump out from between all the verbiage. The only guest rappers, Busdriver and the aforementioned Aesop Rock, seem to be taken along for the ride largely for their ability to keep pace with the kind of baffling, elusively-deep lyrics Rob Sonic specializes in. All this lyrical density does discourage passive listening, though, and it's a good thing that the repeat listens that are positively essential for getting to the bottom of this record are made easier with an immediate catchiness. Sometimes it helps to just wait for the chorus, which is often where Rob hangs the clearest declaration of the lyrics' real meaning. ""Felt kinda strange when I woke up this morning/ Like thousands of weapons were aimin' at me,"" he spits sing-song in the early moments of ""Teeth Eat Her"", while the hook for ""The Over Under"" makes like a hectoring take on A Tribe Called Quest's Low End Theory quickie ""What?"": ""You can't do the dirt and then use a bath towel/ No milk and honey if you kill your cash cow/ Can't make the moves if you throw your back out/ You can't get your rocks off in a glass house."" (That's half the hook; the other half consists of the phrase ""I wanna do the bump, but there's bombs in the way."") And even if the production eventually starts to congeal into a soupy glop of mid-uptempo stoner-rock-- dude sure likes that synthesized, fuzzed-out bass/guitar sound, putting his Sabotage closer to Sabbath than the Beasties-- at least it's a soupy glop with some bump to it, a simple and straightforward counter to the lyrical barrage that he flows over with a more-than-competent authority. It's not the most involved album of 2007's decent-enough indie-rap contingent, but once you get through your 10th listen-- or at least get your hands on a lyric sheet-- it'll sound a lot deeper. Assuming it doesn't get even more confusing, which to be honest is probably just as good an outcome.","Containing more wide-ranging and universal thoughts than 2004's the-personal-is-political Telicatessen, the Def Jux MC's latest is being touted as his political album.

The Street Lights Have Been Turned Down,Zillionaire,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b420b1335d7bf169a6e0/1:1/w_160/02bfaf5b.jpg,2008-01-24 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11061-the-street-lights-have-been-turned-down/,New Granada,"My knowledge of the Tampa metro area is limited to historically inept professional sports teams and a prevalence of the elderly, so I won't be so foolish to suggest that there's such thing as a ""Tampa sound."" But judging from the sort of bands that catch on with the New Granada imprint, one could argue that it's almost like an indie Houston where bands name themselves like rappers and prefer absorbing Codeine to downing drank. As was the case with Candy Bars on their fantastic 2006 record, Zillionaire debuts with a brazenly 1990s slow flow appropriate for the coldest stretch of the year, or at least people who were into ""indie"" before the palefaces all got into that beat-driven stuff. The uncluttered arrangements are easy enough to pick apart: unhurried tempos, wallflower vocals, and the sort of clean octave/third chords favored by early Smashing Pumpkins or current Silversun Pickups. And at this point, it's difficult not to associate Zillionaire with slowcore-ish superheroes. ""I Won't Let You Down (This Time)"" swishes between two queasy chords like the first five seconds of ""Ten Years Gone"" stretched to infinity, while Heath Dupras intones ""Get your shotgun...make sure it's loaded"" as if each repetition multiplies the intended portent. Things get genuinely discomforting as the overdubs chime in, but it makes for a curious first step, particularly in relief of its follow-up, ""Loose Leaf"". That the album title includes ""Turn"", ""The"", and ""Lights"", brings to mind a pretty obvious touchstone, and Zillionaire does a decent job of reenacting some of Interpol's more zippy moments, albeit without the cavernous reverb or the urbanite sexual malaise that eventually were revealed as load-bearing. It's a far better fit than ""Tonight Will Be Alright"", which tries to cop a feel in that sweetly awkward record-nerd way (see: And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside Out) but with strangely unbalanced harmonies and placeholder rhymes (""tonight""/ ""alright,"" ""song,""/ ""singalong""), it's legitimately awkward...like having someone ask you to dance at a Yo La Tengo show. What Zillionaire is far more adept at during this go-through is their ability to suggest mood with the comfort of being sad, often when they split the difference between clock-stoppers and foot-tappers. ""The Occasion of the Water Heater"" provides the record's most gorgeous moments, flickering with sad delay and atypically demure invocation of loss-- ""You won't ever know what it feels like when you try/ It's a scam but it gets you every time."" Over its seven minutes of dour New Year's Eve recollections, ""Jesus Told Me So"" builds to a noisy climax obvious from two towns over from a near free-time pulse, but its tundric space leaves enough to the imagination to avoid becoming ponderous. And while The Street Lights technically ends up with a friends-and-family-only 20-minute drone, ""New Cymbal"" is a more fitting endpoint, with Dupras at his most vulnerable, falling apart over the band's most bittersweet arrangement. If it sounds like I'm selling these guys short, it comes with the caveat of playing another black-and-white game: easy to learn, hard to master. Had Zillionaire traded in their feathery guitar willows for acoustic strums, we'd probably be talking about their ""hushed intimacy"" or some such, but as it is, The Street Lights Have Been Turned Down is the sort of thing where it will be tough to block out imagined concertgoer talk poking into the moments of silence. If this results in a pushier, more forceful Zillionaire, the next time around could be something special.","This Tampa band is sometimes reminiscent of 1990s slowcore; at their best, they suggest mood with the comfort of being sad, often when they split the difference between clock-stoppers and foot-tappers.

Parallel Suns,Samara Lubelski,by: Marc Masters,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b40513d197565213aa35/1:1/w_160/66bcb207.jpg,2008-01-24 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11035-parallel-suns/,Social Registry,"There are a lot of interesting contradictions going on with Brooklyn singer-songwriter Samara Lubelski. She's recorded a diverse range of bands at the Rare Book Room (Fiery Furnaces, Deerhunter, Sightings, Magik Markers, etc.), yet her own music sticks to a pretty small sonic range. She often uses multiple guests on her albums-- Parallel Suns includes Metabolismus, P.G. Six, the Clean's Hamish Kilgour, and more-- yet her orchestrated tunes have an intimate, private feel. Most interestingly, her musical approach seems like a recipe for banality, offering slight variations on the same stylistic theme. Yet her songs are rarely boring, and often rich and nuanced. Like many musical minimalists, Lubelski finds variety in consistency, coaxing a rainbow from a few sonic shades. Lubelski does this better than ever on Parallel Suns, her third solo album. The key is the way she straddles moods, creating an emotional depth that fascinates regardless of how much each song sounds like the last. Here, she mixes sweetness with melancholy so tightly that the two sentiments sound like sides of a twirling coin. That effect is strongest in her hypnotic voice, whose soft semi-whisper evokes the muted hush of Vashti Bunyan, but is even more transfixing. Check out how her thick breaths lift the lullaby-like ""Snowy Meadows II"", or how her cool hum rises to meet the swells in ""Greener Grass"". Her voice has a knack for shaping each song without ever outrunning it. Still, Lubelski's singing has always been this good, as have her songs. What makes Parallel Suns her best record is its sequencing, as it moves smoothly through subtle ebbs and flows. The first three tracks set this pattern: the slow awakening of ""Have You Seen the Colors"" melts gradually into the insistent pulse of ""Taste the Candy"", which rides into the reflective, organ-driven instrumental ""Meeting of the Sun"". Eventually things peak with ""The Cloistered Palace"", whose irresistible hooks seem to climb higher with each verse. The final three tracks offer an extended denouement, like a descent back down from an eye-opening mountain climb. It would be easy to fault Lubleski for lack of sonic variety, and admittedly her appeals aren't universal. If her style doesn't grab you on first listen, all the small shifts and slight curves probably won't register on subsequent attempts. But for anyone inclined toward her brand of gentle magic-- and really, it's pretty hard not to like-- Parallel Suns is the musical equivalent of a hypnotist's swinging timepiece, blissfully entrancing in its steady beauty.","On her third solo album, the Rare Book Room engineer and Brooklyn-based singer-songwriter straddles moods, creating an emotional depth and tightly mixing sweetness with melancholy.

30,Buzzcocks,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b43713d197565213aa8e/1:1/w_160/9321a249.jpg,2008-01-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11079-30/,Cooking Vinyl,"The 30th anniversary of UK punk was celebrated with a reunion or two here, a few talking head TV specials there, but in true punk fashion, the arrival of the milestone was mostly met with a shrug. And perhaps rightly so: Anniversaries are by their very nature round-number arbitrary, and punk was always about rejecting that kind of fanfare, not embracing it. 1976? 1977? 1978? Another year, another anniversary. But considering the Buzzcocks are one of the few class of 76 acts still in action, maybe it's less a surprise that the venerable Manchester band decided not to sit out the celebration, playing a gig last year at London's forum in honor of their own specific anniversary (the group's Spiral Scratch EP was released in 1977) as much as punk's anniversary in general. Of course, the Buzzcocks have more to celebrate than most of their peers, given how well their catalog of melodic and smart slash-and-burn punk has held up over the years. No simple-minded 1-2-3-4 primitive, Pete Shelley (and, to a lesser extent, Steve Diggle) wrote songs built to last: short, sharp and clever rather than bombastic or abrasive. While the Buzzcocks' post-prime output has been respectable, the vast majority of the songs on 30, a live album (the group's third) drawn from that London date, remain the same songs that drew people to the band in the first place. Of the 28 (why not 30?) songs, about three-quarters date to the group's essential first run of singles, EPs, and albums. It's a testament to Shelley's and Diggle's enthusiasm that the remaining seven songs-- tracks of a more recent vintage such as ""Isolation"", ""Reconciliation"", and ""Speed of Life""-- fit in pretty well with their tried-and-true predecessors. As for those immortal predecessors, songs like ""I Don't Mind"", ""You Say You Don't Love Me"", ""What Do I Get?"", ""Autonomy"", ""Promises"", and ""Ever Fallen In Love?""-- just the tip of the iceberg, really-- have sounded both better and worse, capturing an honest but pointless warts-and-all performance from a band not quite at its peak, yet still far from anyone's idea of a nadir. In this context, Shelley and Diggle are reduced to shouting over their own rumble, with the former's incisive sneer losing some of its edge and the latter's bark no match for the buzzsaw guitars. In other words, it's basically an official bootleg, a you-were-there document no doubt recorded in front of an audience that largely wasn't. At least, not originally. After all, the thrill of 1976-77 was that no one had any idea if the music exploding out of England was built to last or, as its critics claimed, was merely the latest flash-in-the-pan manifestation of youthful rebellion. In this sense, 30 is nothing more than another nostalgia-driven fete of what once was, featuring all the hits fans new and old have come to love. But there is something here beyond its face value. The Buzzcocks have spent the past 30 years saddled with the reputation as a singles band, but between the hits and scattered new songs, 30 makes a case for many of the group's album tracks, too. No best-of collection would toss in less ubiquitous songs like ""Moving Away From the Pulse Beat"", ""Running Free"", or ""Why She's a Girl From the Chainstore""-- all of which are pleasant surprises for any sucker convinced that ""Orgasm Addict"" and its more familiar ilk are all you need from the Buzzcocks. No, from a band this great you need it all, and if the proficient but perfunctory 30 helps send you back down that three-decade path, then so be it.","A 2007 30th anniversary show captures the Buzzcocks in their element, showing off a collection of songs that would trump the best of nearly all their erstwhile punk peers.

Mixed Up,Love Is All,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b425ea9e61561daa6be1/1:1/w_160/9d800989.jpg,2008-01-24 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11065-mixed-up/,Parlophone,"What's that old saying-- friends don't let friends release remix albums? And yet even Love Is All-- a band whose songs sound like an air-raid attack on the mindless consumerism and unnecessary noise that drowns out more substantial cultural and emotional discourse-- is not immune to cobbling together a stopgap release of recyclables. And in their case, the gap being filled is particularly wide. It's been three years since the signature tracks from their Nine Times That Same Song debut were first hyperlinked across the blogosphere, and it wouldn't be unreasonable to say that the window to give them a remixed afterlife on the dancefloor has long since closed. But it appears Love Is All Mixed Up was not inspired by dreams of a clubland crossover. As the band admits on its MySpace blog, the source material comprises songs ""that we honestly were beginning to grow a little tired of,"" and so the act of re-imagning (or in some cases, savaging) their repertoire would seemingly endear them more to the idea of having to perform ""the hits"" for the rest of their career. Besides, it's not as if Love Is All required any more dancefloor traction: The strobe-lit sensory assault of ""Busy Doing Nothing"" and ""Talk Talk Talk Talk"" get that job done just fine. But for a band that so often sings about music itself, as both a liberating (""Spinning and Scratching"") and distracting (""Turn the Radio Off"") force, the remix album presents an opportunity to reposition Love Is All's songwriting into the pop realm they seem so conflicted about. Mixed Up makes guinea pigs out of five Love Is All tracks, so maybe a better title would be Two Times That Same Song: Four of those songs (""Felt Tip"", ""Make Out Fall Out Make Up"", ""Busy Doing Nothing"", and ""Turn the Radio Off"") receive the twice-over treatment, with an alternate ""Spinning and Scratching"" thrown in if just to keep the band's nine-song theme running. Not surprisingly, the band's more melancholy material produces this record's most inspired reworkings. London-based Ben Garrett (aka frYars) outfits the humbly triumphant lullaby ""Felt Tip"" with a laptop-pop transformation, coloring in the original's grayscale backdrop with kaleidoscopic synth loops. Garrett also downplays Love Is All's most distinctive characteristic-- Josephine Olausson's glass-shattering voice-- in order to claim the lead vocal for himself, playing out the fantasy of every bedroom-bound recluse who's wanted to live inside their record collection. (Interestingly, frYars effectively shows up marquee remixers Hot Chip, who take a similarly futurist if ultimately less affecting approach to the same tune.) That feeling of euphoric escapism carries over to Maps' overhaul of ""Turn the Radio Off"", where a swelling intro that recalls Underworld's massive 1995 techno hit ""Born Slippy"" explodes into an orgiastic tech-house rush, recasting the song's centerpiece lyric (""hey world, I've had enough"") from a statement of resignation to one of resolve. But these hardly constitute the disc's most radical reinventions: Metronomic completely discards the maniacal ska-punk blitzkrieg of ""Spinning and Scratching"" to reclaim the song as the early-80s B-boy rap its title demands, with the song's ""clap your hands"" refrain turned into a Kurtis Blow directive. Love Is All's more danceable songs result in more typical remixes: Scottish DJ titans Optimo give ""Busy Doing Nothing"" a decidedly LCD-like build-up, gradually layering a sinister bass pulse with triggered tambourine rattles, handclaps, and samples of the song's staccato riffs and chanted chorus, but it's hardly a bold revision. Tapedeck subjects the same song to a more extreme electro/disco deconstruction, although the off-beat vocal samples give the impression of random mixing-board level tweaking. Of course, even this seems more considered than the Bees' prankster version of ""Make Out Fall Out Make Up"", which simply sets a loop of Olausson yelping the chorus line to a slack Hammond-organ Afro-funk jam, if only to contrast her screaming petulance against the band's nonchalant groove. It's amusing at first, but with the joke having run its course 90 seconds in, the Bees have nothing left to do but to accelerate the track into an anticlimactic, brass-slathered breakdown. Coincidentally, British acid-house dons Chicken Lips use the exact same vocal sample as the basis for their own ""malfunction"" of ""Make Out Fall Out"", but instead of a running gag, here it works as a suitably disorienting entry point to a masterful eight-minute Italo-disco workout that repositions the song's tale of morning-after regret back onto the crowded peak-hour dancefloor where its fateful one-stand likely originated. And though remix albums are subject to random sequencing by nature, the Chicken Lips track is smartly followed by the Studio's 10-minute comedown take on ""Turn the Radio Off"", which stretches the core melody out into a trippy, tropical odyssey redolent of mid-70s Can. On their own, these two extended plays are enough to tilt Mixed Up's hit-to-useless ratio toward the favorable side. But the collection's success will truly be measured in a few months, when Love Is All release their second studio album-- because then we'll know for sure if Mixed Up's rhythmic reinventions have inspired the band to rethink their defiantly lo-fi aesthetic, or if it all just amounts to another nine times with the same songs.","This between-album stopgap features re-fittings of Nine Times That Same Song tracks from Hot Chip, Optimo, the Studio, and the Bees.

The Alchemist,Witchcraft,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b408b1335d7bf169a6b2/1:1/w_160/3672e70b.jpg,2008-01-23 06:00:05,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11038-the-alchemist/,Candlelight,"Since forming in 2000, Witchcraft's made no bones about their adoration of Roky Erickson and Pentagram's Bobby Liebling. However, despite both figures receiving nearly equal shine in Witchcraft interviews, the latter's left a disproportionately large mark on these Swedes' doom metal assault. Like equally cartoonish countrymen the Hives, Witchcraft doesn't flinch when copping their beloved retro bands, refusing to update even the most garish traits of classic metal, most notably Black Sabbath and Pentagram. The Alchemist, Witchcraft's third LP, sticks to many of these traits-- the compulsive riffing, Renaissance Faire charade, dramatic builds upon dramatic builds-- though it's also Witchcraft's first overt display of a Roky Erickson influence, and a better album for it. On part one of the epic three-part, 14-minute title track, singer Magnus Pelander declares he ""can blow your mind,"" and most of The Alchemist seeks to do just that in the old school stoner rock style. This is music for blazing in your parent's basement, the band no longer posturing as Satan's messiah but rather hedging their apocalyptic metal with a psychedelic euphoria. Of course, overall there's still a self-serious tone, with lots of phrases suitable to hear only at Comic-Con (e.g. ""Constitution of murder!...Institution of sadness!"" or ""In our darkest hour/ When the dragon releases its power""). Regardless of what yarn he's spinning, though, Pelander's vocals really pop from the mix, a welcome change from most of the band's previous work recorded on vintage 1970s studio equipment. Opener ""Walking the Line"" will cause many double-takes, the song's bouncy melody taking a cue from Josh Homme's catchy brand of stoner rock. You can even feel the 13th Floor Elevators love on ""Remembered"", its death march verse contrasted by a trippy chorus and wah-wah guitar solo too loopy by metal standards. With all the Arthurian lore and story-telling zeal, The Alchemist could actually be a fun record with a little tongue-in-cheekiness thrown in. But despite the looser psych vibe, the album follows the well-trod path to Mordor (or something like it). Along the way Sabbath riffs and scene-stealing howls cue us in when the stakes get particularly high, but the music often sounds as hyperbolic as the tale its soundtracking. That said, Witchcraft's made leaps and bounds since their debut, back when they'd be confused for the kind of macabre Scandinavian metal act that'd murder its bassist for inspiration. If these guys could just quit letting their Tolkien complex overwhelm the music, they might someday do their touchstones justice and escape their current snicker-inducing status.","Despite its self-serious tone, the third album by this Swedish doom outfit is old-school stoner rock, the band no longer posturing as Satan's messiah but rather hedging their apocalyptic metal with a psychedelic euphoria.

Quantum Fucking,Fatal Flying Guilloteens,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4095e6ef9596932254e/1:1/w_160/f472a10b.jpg,2008-01-23 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11039-quantum-fucking/,Frenchkiss,"When Fatal Flying Guilloteens first oozed out of the Houston underground back at the turn of the decade, they were but one of a new breed of American indie rock bands taking on a simple but noble mission: to make the records that the Jesus Lizard, Butthole Surfers, and Drive Like Jehu had ceased to. But now with their contemporaries having gone prog (...And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead), broken up (the Blood Brothers), become more huggable (Les Savy Fav), or withered on the major-label vine (Rye Coalition), the Fatal Flying Guilloteens must feel a lot like Will Smith in I Am Legend: The last of the post-millennial pig-fuckers. In this sense, the mock cowboy get-ups that marked the band's early performances seem less a cheeky nod to their Texan roots and more a prescient signifier of the band's outlaw status. But it's not as if this state of affairs has sullied their spirit. Quantum Fucking is the Guilloteens' first full-length in four years, but they've hardly spent this extended absence rethinking or refining their aesthetic. The Guilloteens still sound every bit as greasy and gruesome as they did back on 2001's Now Hustle for New Diaboliks, and, at this point in the game, it's safe to say this band is genetically incapable of writing a linear, palatable melody that'll pique A&R interest. But what makes them a band worth embracing is that they take a genre not exactly known for its crowd-pleasing approachability-- post-hardcore math-rock-- and make it feel like the most natural choice of party music. So between the bruising basslines, the bee-swarm guitar discord, epileptic drum spasms and bastardized blues riffs (you can take the boys out of Texas), you hear the sound of joy: the revved-up Rocket From the Crypt chorus of ""Hello, Boss!!!"", the excitable holler-and-response between vocalists Mike and Shawn Guilloteen (the former playing David Yow to the latter's Rick Froberg) on ""Chart"", the contorted Led Zep crunge-funk of ""Great Apes"", not to mention perhaps the best Yes joke (""Long Distance Reacharound"") since The Germs butchered the intro to ""Roundabout"" on No God. Quantum Fucking's 12 songs convulse through enough abrupt structural shifts and false stops to make the track designations seem almost arbitrary, the between-song gaps feeling more like necessary breathers than markers distinguishing two separate compositions. But it's all part of an ideology where brevity increases the severity-- by confining their missives to brief two-minute bursts, the Fatal Flying Guilloteens ensure that your ass is sufficiently kicked before their heads go too far up their own.","The Fatal Flying Guilloteens' first full-ength in four years finds them outlasting and/or staying truer to the original sound of their early 00s indie rock contemporaries, bands like Trail of the Dead, Blood Brothers, Rye Coalition, and Les Savy Fav.

Black Mirror: Reflections in Global Music (1918-1955),Various Artists,by: Mike McGonigal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3fc5e6ef9596932253d/1:1/w_160/f3d2b04b.jpg,2008-01-23 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11027-black-mirror-reflections-in-global-music-1918-1955/,Dust-to-Digital,"Black Mirror: Reflections in Global Music (1918-1955) is an enthused, superbly-curated collection of rare 78s. The set was compiled by Ian Nagoski, who runs the respected True Vine record shop in Baltimore, Md. Nagoski-- a righteous bliss-drone musician whose own recorded output is worth hearing-- was once an intern for La Monte Young's long-running ""Dream House"" installation in New York. He's written about music for The Wire, and in the 1990s he was a contributing editor for the exceptional and sorely-missed 'zine Halana. Nagoski's been collecting 78s since he was in high school, intrepidly and often blindly looking for stuff that sounds cool, even if the labels were all in Russian and he had no idea what it was going to sound like. As you can guess from the title, this assemblage of material comes from long ago and far away, all over the globe: Syria, Thailand, Laos, Yugoslavia, Scotland, Cameroon, China, Vietnam, England, Turkey, and a dozen more. It's always a treat to be reminded of how much amazing music there is in the world that you've never heard. Seventy-five percent of this material has never been issued on CD, so both bushy-eyed world music newcomers and intrepid crate-combers will find an awful lot to dig in these 24 songs. In fact, only one track's ever been released on a CD in the States before. Black Mirror stacks performers of great renown (at the time) next to uncredited musicians performing folk musics that stretch back for centuries. All of them are obscure today, of course. Most people associate 78s with inferior sound quality. The word ""scratchy"" seems quite nearly wedded to the numbers ""78,"" in fact. However, nary a scratch, pop, or crackle is to be heard here. Great care has gone into transferring and mastering these tracks. And unlike a lot of digital processing done in the 90s (when this kind of technology first became affordable), it hasn't heavy-handedly lopped off entire frequencies in the process. Sure, there's a little background hiss in the back of Nino de Priego's gorgeous, flamenco-y ""Envidia Yo No Tengo A Nadie"", but whatever. There's far more hiss on a Sebadoh record. It's tough to say what unites these recordings, aside from the fact that they weren't made for export and most represent a tradition in danger of extinction. Highly mannered female vocals flutter on top of string orchestras on a few tracks, while there's a delightful Cameroonian rumba and ""Songs in Grief"" from Japan (which lives up to its name). A monk rhythmically and effortlessly recites a prayer for what might be the millionth time; he's devoted his life to this particular chant. But some other kind of glue holds all these pieces together: the sequencing, the way the songs unfold, is a large part of the pleasure here. A woozy, melted-sounding ""horizontal monochord"" recording from Vietnam in 1930 segues perfectly into a passionate recording of Handel performed on a piano in Germany in 1931. When a thing is done with absolute love, it tends to show. I'm not a huge fan of CDs myself; I have a lot of vinyl and more mp3s than I can count. But it's awfully hard to imagine these songs without the lovely 24-page booklet that comes with the set. The liner notes are lush with information about each track, as much as Nagoski could find anyway. He also brings the listener back to the very dawn of recorded sound by reproducing some of the earliest reactions to Edison's great invention, the phonograph. Nagoski writes with awe himself about finding a special, strange record in a dusty corner, and about how amazing it is that these round, brittle discs can transfer such absolute magic from one generation to another. There are indeed magical possibilities when it comes to assembling and editing a collection such as this; it's no accident that alchemical symbols dot Harry Smith's liner notes to his celebrated urtext, the three-volume Anthology of American Folk Music. Nagoski also quotes from his own translation of the spiritual-minded, avant-garde poet Roger Gilbert-Lecomte, even borrowing the album's title from one of his works. All that places the material in a different context than one usually finds in globetrotting collections of ye olde records, which often suffer the post-colonial hangover of exoticism. Here's to hoping that Nagoski compiles at least a dozen more records like it. Black Mirror just might be the most remarkable collection of its sort since Pat Conte ceased his CD reissue series Secret Museum of Mankind in 1998.","An enthused, superbly-curated collection of rare 78s gathers folk songs, religious chants, classical pieces, and more from places including Syria, Thailand, Laos, Yugoslavia, Scotland, Cameroon, China, Vietnam, England, and Turkey.

The Portrait Is Finished and I Have Failed to Capture Your Beauty...,"Hello, Blue Roses",by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b432b1335d7bf169a701/1:1/w_160/32dad0af.jpg,2008-01-23 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11075-the-portrait-is-finished-and-i-have-failed-to-capture-your-beauty/,Locust,"Unless you dye them or genetically modify them, roses aren't ever supposed to be blue. That fact has made the blue rose a plant rich in metaphor, from the Victorian language of flowers to Tennessee Williams play The Glass Menagerie. In the latter, one character tells another she has the illness pleurosis, and he thinks she says ""blue roses."" Vancouver-based Hello, Blue Roses are the romantically entangled duo of Dan Bejar (Destroyer, New Pornographers, Swan Lake) and visual artist Sydney Vermont, and the title of their debut full-length, The Portrait Is Finished and I Have Failed to Capture Your Beauty..., may suggest an attempt to achieve something as impossible as blue roses-- express the inexpressible. These flowers are of a more common variety. Bejar's blogger-friendly presence may be Hello, Blue Roses' sharpest hook, but the album is mainly a vehicle for Vermont's lilting folk lullabies-- she writes every song except the finale, a boy-girl cover of UK psych-folkie Kevin Ayers' ""Hymn""-- and most are relatively indistinguishable. The couple of times the tracks cohere into something more solid than sleepy acoustic-guitar strums, drippy vintage synths, and Vermont's frilly, ambling soprano vocal lines, they do hit upon something fairly pleasant. Too often, though, they don't really work, nor do they give much reason for repeat spins. Hello, Blue Roses? Behold, the lilies of the field. When the duo's ""Shadow Falls"" hit the internet last fall, it sounded like a reasonably auspicious beginning. Turns out it's atypical in both style and quality, its tuneful romanticism a rare moment of warmth and clarity on a record that otherwise easily fades into the background. Bejar and Vermont's voices ably complement each other, blanketed by Prefab Sprout-minded synths, restrained electric guitar, and a pulsing kick drum on an album otherwise pretty short on beats. There's a throwaway rhyme about ""the mange"", but at least you can hum along. Well-placed wordless vocals by Bejar make the shambling, almost Softies-like ""Scarecrow"" one more standout. Another exception to the album's overall drabness is ""St. Angela"", the only track featuring a full band. A rollicking ""Maggie May"" guitar solo, organ, and, yes, drums, all help to support Vermont's staid, Christine McVie-like lead vocal. Fuzztone guitar and the occasional woodwinds dress up the many slow-paced songs, but repetitive, fragmentary compositions such as ""Paquita Reads by Candlelight"", Vancouver-repping ""Skeleton Aim"", and the typically moribund ""Come Darkness"" sound more concerned with melisma than memorable melodies or vibrant production. The piano-based ""Sunny Star"" has plinking, rudimentary piano reminiscent of underrated Cat Power and Yoko Ono collaboration ""Revelations"", but in contrast to that song's poignant directness, we get more vocal flights and vague imagery. On ""Coming Through Imposture"", Bejar repeats the phrase ""coming through imposture,"" a chorus not so much ""cryptic""-- Bejar's own songwriting rep-- as turgid. Not long into opening track ""Hello Blue Roses"" (no comma), Vermont sings, ""The time has come."" That's also the title of a beautiful, long-overlooked 1971 album by English folkie Anne Briggs. While Vermont is a fine singer, she doesn't have Briggs' effortlessness, and there's a shaky, naturalistic imperfection to her vocals on songs like ""Golden Fruit""-- in which she blandly asks, ""When will the world change?""-- that would be better suited to a less flowery vocalist. All happy couples aren't alike, but they each live in their own world, full of shared confidences, intimate moments, and stupid inside jokes. If we're to take The Portrait Is Finished and I Have Failed to Capture Your Beauty... as a document of Bejar and Vermont's love, the album's shortcoming might not be so much that Hello, Blue Roses have failed to capture their love's beauty-- nor that expressing love is, like blue roses, fundamentally impossible. Instead, the problem might be that as much as everybody likes to gossip about unhappy couples, happy couples are only interesting to themselves.","Dan Bejar (Destroyer, New Pornographers, Swan Lake) and visual artist Sydney Vermont combine to create an album that is mainly a vehicle for Vermont's lilting folk lullabies.

In the Future,Black Mountain,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b41cea9e61561daa6bd1/1:1/w_160/01c6c2dc.jpg,2008-01-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11056-in-the-future/,Jagjaguwar,"Black Mountain's accomplished self-titled debut found frontman Steve McBean synergizing numerous local Vancouver talents along with his own grab bag of music sensibilities. To further up the ante, the band made little effort to shroud their classic rock fanaticism. Whatever you wanna call them-- revivalists, re-interpreters, or even rock fundamentalists-- that first record provided an engaging snapshot of late 1960s/early 70s AOR. With that in mind, sophomore effort In the Future faces the challenge of holding our attention amidst all these Guitar Hero games and Led Zeppelin reunions without puffing itself up to the ridiculous levels of more mainstream retro-stoners like Wolfmother and the Mars Volta. Thanks to the emergence of side projects Blood Meridian and Lightning Dust, the curtain's been lifted, and suddenly Black Mountain sounds more complicated and conflicted than the bleary-eyed grin their debut flashed. The Debbie Downer pathos of Amber Webber, who until now had sounded like an afterthought on the band's recordings, spills over from her sobering Lightning Dust material, recorded with fellow Mountaineer Joshua Wells. Coupled with Blood Meridian exposing the bluesy id of bassist Matt Camirand, Black Mountain had no choice but to make room for these burgeoning personalities. While the debut grooved on a countercultural us v. them moral trip, Future raises the stakes considerably, leaving the band's musical talents to play catchup with their new material's epic-sized dimensions. Simply juxtaposing Future opener ""Stormy High"" with the debut's first track ""Modern Music"" suggests that the band's more profound than playing Nintendo while high, but not entirely immune to ""J.R. Tokin'"" jokes. Starting with a lugubrious, ""Hell's Bells""-style arpeggio before launching into stoner-metal chanty, McBean repeatedly belts the song's title as Wells's banshee howls in the background, foretelling McBean's lyric about ""witches on your trail."" A fitting way to kick off the album, ""Stormy High"" gently eases the listener into Black Mountain's increasingly fantastical world. The eight-minute ""Tyrants,"" on the other hand, sounds like a Middle Earth baptism by fire. With its sprawling sections and gauntlet of brain-numbing riffs, ""Tyrants""'s best analog would probably be ""Don't Run Our Hearts Around."" However, where the latter dims for hushed verses of traditional blues bellyaching, the former's eerie, calmer moments wrench the soul just as violently as the louder ax assaults. Future provides a wide spotlight, and McBean's much more willing here to pass the shine to Wells when she's better suited for the part. ""Queens Will Play"" essentially beefs up Lightning Dust's threadbare palette of organ and guitar, changing a simple church house hymn into a menacing cathedral dirge. She even gets to carry the torch to the finish line with closer ""Night Walks"", a dreamy ballad that offers spiritual replenishment after a mystically taxing hour of dense music. That's right, Future's hardly a smooth ride. Whether verified or not, drug use has always gone hand-in-hand with these guys, but here they either smoked too much and lost focus on some of these winding mini-sagas or remained painfully sober and sacrificed much of their debut's mind-freeing vibe. Black Mountain's strategic sequencing of long-track/short-track managed to keep listeners locked on, particularly for its dazzling first half. Future's valleys sag slightly lower, giving the listener less incentive to motor through this psych jungle. The sappy Spider-Man 3 soundtrack ballad ""Stay Free"" comes off the heels of the ho-hum ""Wucan"", a six-minute piece of all-too-canonized psychedelic sounds, and the nearly 17-minute (!) ""Bright Lights"" finds the band's creativity running on fumes by its midway point. Fortunately, buried in this massive time capsule you find some succinct nuggets, particularly the Tom Petty-esque swagger of ""Angels"" and crying-into-beer lurch of ""Wild Wind"". Ultimately, Future can't compete with the classic rock divinity that's been worshipped in countless high school parking lots and shag carpeted basements for the last 40 years, but you gotta love them for trying. After all, in a time when four rock gods reuniting for a one-off concert becomes the music story of the year, what can any of us mortals do?","Black Mountain mainman Steve McBean here finds more room for the rest of the band's burgeoning personalities, and the resulting record raises the stakes of the debut considerably, leaving the band's musical talents to play catchup with their new material's epic-sized dimensions.

I'm Like a Virgin Losing a Child,Manchester Orchestra,by: Liz Colville,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3fac0084474cd0c21f2/1:1/w_160/0a1f350d.jpg,2008-01-22 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11025-im-like-a-virgin-losing-a-child/,Favorite GentlemenFavorite Gentlemen,"On the opening track of this Atlanta quintet's first full-length, the acidic washes of the Verve's less commercial songs meld with the whiney inflections of, say, Placebo's Brian Molko. The guitars eventually move toward the falsely epic Edge of reason (the lick is virtually lifted from U2's ""New Year's Day"") before mechanical strums change tack again, pulling the potential of all this inattentive variety into a heap of head-tossing joy, more hapless crux of overwritten Dandy Warhol song than prologue track of festival-gracing rock newcomer. Andy Hull, the singer, lends the dullest songs an attitude; sometimes that attitude is simply warmth, other times it's an ornery kind of emotional outpouring. But when the better songs succeed, they leave the singer in the dust, his vocal twists and turns a cacophony among the seamless, inventive components of guitar, keyboard, drum, and bass, particularly noticeable on ""Now That You're Home"". Much of the album has a road-bound, breezy, wistful tone, well-produced on the band's own label by Dan Hannon. On ""I Can Barely Breathe"", the sea-like gurgles of the guitar meld with car window-gazing plucks, and the torrid yelps of the chorus take us back to another moment of the 1990s, the almost furry thickness of guitars in songs by bands like Weezer and Toadies. The song's devolution is welcome; it's an impenetrably sad loop of descending chords mimicked in every instrument, and while there's nothing complex or entirely innovative about it, it's moving all the same. The effect is similar to that of the candid lyrics of ""Sleeper 1972"", which recounts the most biological and vapid parts of death and their repercussions on the living. Accompanied only by an organ, Hull's voice takes on a sweet, hushed quality, and on this track the comparison to Ben Gibbard starts to make sense. Who else is able to discuss the morbid with such sugar in his voice? The subjects here, musically grungy and convincingly adolescent, are, verbally speaking, full of references to childhood, family, relationships, desire, and sympathy. In ""I Can Feel Your Pain"", Hull sings into the microphone like it's a voicemail we're not really supposed to hear. But we become stand-ins for a distant addressee who might have never heard the message. While this personal bit of memorabilia, acoustic and nicely undercooked, is lovely, like many of the other tracks, it achieves this via atmosphere, with nebulous ideas rather than a riveting melody or story. And ""Pain"" is so different from the rest that it feels like a mere interlude. By contrast, the vocal synths on ""Where Have You Been"" help make the song sound majestic, so perhaps it's commendable that Hull can direct songs that are both miniscule and mountainous in volume, and can achieve the same emotive weight in either case.","Atlanta group's full-length debut explores grunge, folk, and straight-up indie rock with a breezy, wistful tone.

Cadenza Contemporary 01/Classics,Various Artists,by: Mike Powell,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a24dea9e61561daa49e3/1:1/w_160/d3f6b135.jpg,2008-01-22 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11642-cadenza-contemporary-01classics/,Cadenza,"The Berlin-based label Cadenza, a luminary name in the minimal techno world, makes music for the patient. It's rare for their singles to run shorter than nine minutes. Their only guiding hand is the thunk-thunk-thunk of the bass drum-- techno's definition and essence. After that, though, Cadenza's tracks are definitively unruly: sound effects jut into the mix for a half-second and never come back; songs swell and deflate without ever erupting; synth patterns emerge, but fester, slipping out of synch for a bar or two, or suddenly sprouting a few extra notes. ""Minimal"" only seems to address their casual relationship with a sense of climax; everything else about the music is busy, funky, and disorienting. Even patterns in the tracks-- thick enough to hypnotize Reich and Reilly devotees-- wind up kinky and restless. Contemporary 01/Classics, a 2xCD compilation featuring Cadenza's first six singles and an hourlong mix of some of its recent output by label head Luciano, is like a musical cold war, where everything clashes but nothing ever explodes. Getting hung up on the tensions in Cadenza's music, though, is to miss its strongest suit: Its sense of space. Many dance records are slathered in reverb so vast the textures of the track vanish, or echoes so infinite that they flatten the sonic field more than deepen it. Cadenza tracks are sharp and discrete: Sounds ricochet like bullets in an airshaft or leap from the bass drum's bedrock on the spring of a quick echo. Signals rarely fade away; instead, they're abducted. If some dance music suggests the sky or the ocean, Cadenza tracks function like sonar in a living maze. Contemporary 01/Classics is also the label's first CD issue, so it's tempting to give it a free pass where it fails. The mix is more demonstrative of the label's sound than Luciano's abilities as a DJ, but I'd be remiss to not mention that in squeezing 10 tracks into 67 minutes, he doesn't give some of the songs room to work their full tantric weirdness. And by limiting the collection to the earliest and latest singles, some of Cadenza's best material gets lost: Loco Dice's Harissa, Ricardo Villalobos' Achso, and Luciano's own remix of Selif Keita's ""Yamoré"". But I'll leave hairsplitting to the handwringers. It's got Luciano's ""Bomberos"", his and Quenum's ""Orange Mistake"", and the queasy piano runs of NSI's ""Max Binski"" on its second disc; on the first, tracks like Alejandro Vivanco's ""Madre Tierra"" prove that the most innovative dance music last year wasn't by Justice or the Field, but the same stable of batty Europeans and South Americans who've been putting it out for the past four years.","This 2xCD set from Berlin's ultra-minimal (and ultra-compelling) Cadenza label includes the imprint's first six singles and an hourlong mix of some of their recent output by label head Luciano.

Gram Parsons Archives Volume 1: Gram Parsons with the Flying Burrito Brothers Live at the Avalon Ballroom 1969,Gram Parsons,by: Stephen M.

These recordings of the Flying Burrito Brothers' two shows in San Francisco in April 1969 were long buried in the Grateful Dead vaults (which many listeners speak of in the same terms explorers once used for El Dorado) until Dave Prinz, the co-founder of Amoeba Records, tracked them down and worked for more than a year to secure permissions from the Dead's soundman, Owsley ""Bear"" Stanley. Prinz compiled the recordings into a 2xCD set (one for each show) and released them on the newly launched Amoeba Records label-- its second release, in fact. The title, Archives Volume 1: Live at the Avalon Ballroom 1969, teases with the tacit promise of a second volume-- more buried treasure. For Parsons fans, this constitutes a major event-- perhaps more anticipated than even Rhino's long-awaited reissue of his two solo albums in 2006-- not only because it contains numerous unheard covers, but primarily because Parsons didn't leave a whole lot of live material behind when he died in 1973. Even the supposedly ""live"" medley from Grievous Angel was just a studio re-creation, and the real live recordings that survive are marred by poor sound quality or, in some cases, poor performances. Live documents of Parsons' short tenure with the original Flying Burrito Brothers line-up are even scarcer. What makes Live at the Avalon Ballroom so special is that the performance is just as good as the sound quality. As professional hanger-on Pamela ""Burrito Sister"" Des Barres writes in the liners, ""I have literally been waiting for this album for decades."" As promising as that title is, the artist credit-- Gram Parsons with the Flying Burrito Brothers-- is misleading. Parsons may have stood center stage in 1969, but this was truly a Burrito Brothers show. The band sounds tremendous on the first disc, with a superlatively tight rhythm section carrying each song and Sneaky Pete Kleinow adding flourishes of pedal steel. Striking the right balance of tight C&W showmanship and loose hippie slack, they plow into Little Richard's ""Lucille"" and the Buck Owens hit ""Close Up the Honky Tonks"", which opens the show on a raucous note. But the Burrito Brothers prove just as adept and controlled on slower songs like the down-hearted ""Dark End of the Street"" and ""Hot Burrito #1"", one of the band's best compositions. ""Hot Burrito #2"" breaks down into a short jam lead by Parsons' organ licks, and ""Sin City"", the band's contribution to country music moralism, sounds sturdy and steadfast as it closes the first night with apocalyptic images of ""the Lord's burnin' rain"" falling on Los Angeles. Of course, they all flub their cues on the later performance of Delaney and Bonnie's ""We've Got to Get Ourselves Together"", but there's a certain charm to their stoner haze, especially on their nearly a cappella reading of the Everly Brothers' ""When Will I Be Loved"" (a bonus track on what might be considered a bonus release), which emphasizes their homey harmonies. But it's Parsons who remains squarely in the spotlight, then as now. The late musician has become such a legend that it's nice to hear him sound so human on Live at the Avalon Ballroom, haphazardly addressing the audience or even simply introducing the songs. It's all so mundane that it makes him much more compelling than the myths that surround him. Furthermore, these two concerts showcase his effortless vocals; Parsons may not have had the most commanding voice, but he used it well, intuitively interpreting songs like ""Undo the Right"" and ""Dark End of the Street"" so that they fit perfectly and naturally among the Burrito originals. George Jones may still have the definitive take on ""She Once Lived Here"", but Parsons makes the song newly devastating, affecting a precarious quaver in his voice on the verses and keening more boldly on the chorus. And his solo piano performance of ""Thousand Dollar Wedding""-- not part of the concert, but a demo dug up by Parsons' road manager Jimmi Seiter-- completely reinvents the song, slowing it even more from its familiar country gait and reveling in its left-at-the-altar heartbreak. Ultimately, Live at the Avalon Ballroom shows these songs in continual flux, as the band constantly reinvent and reinterpret them via the circumstances of the performance and the whims of the individuals. Even though the tracklists for these discs are nearly identical, the shows themselves aren't redundant. Instead, they reveal the Burrito Brothers' considerable musical chemistry while providing a useful historical document of the nights they turned the Avalon into a rowdy roadhouse.","Unearthed and arranged by Dave Prinz, the co-founder of Amoeba Records, these long-lost tapes are a major event for Gram Parsons fans, who will love not only the sound quality here but the performances and the tracklisting.

Rip It Off,Times New Viking,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b426ea9e61561daa6be3/1:1/w_160/992cdcef.jpg,2008-01-22 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11066-rip-it-off/,Matador,"So much for cleaning up their sound for Matador. After two releases on the recently returned Siltbreeze label, Times New Viking have become better songwriters, but thankfully don't change much of anything from their humble home-recorded beginnings. An effusive press release for Rip It Off draws a line from the Sex Pistols through Slanted and Enchanted and Alien Lanes to end at these guys and girls, and while those claims are a bit too bold to take at face value, they make a certain kind of sense: The Pistols ended up holding the banner for all the bands who realized they could do it themselves, and the songs written by Pavement and especially Guided By Voices swelled with the pride that their basement tapes could stand ably next to their heroes' carefully constructed classics. That DIY spirit is key to Times New Viking, but there's a different sort of reclamation going on here. Yes, the instruments sound like off-brand department store toys, the speaker cones are blown-out, and the recording equipment is rudimentary. They're noisy enough to put off even fans of the 90s ""lo-fi"" generation. But every chord, every note, every yelped vocal, every grizzled and treble-tearing tone is one of sheer exuberance-- they may act aloof, but TNV get off on the privilege of just making a sound. In a time when technology makes professional-sounding recordings accessible to even the smallest bands, that exuberance is refreshing and becoming rarer. TNV continue to straddle a sort of middle ground that might be too melodic and structured for real noise fans and too sludgy for indie-pop shut-ins, but by honing the hooks a little more, Rip It Off leans ever so slightly towards the latter. It doesn't rock as hard as the band's debut, nor does it have anything quite as instantly memorable as ""Teenage Lust!"", but it's their most satisfying front-to-back listen. On the surface, this is simply another batch of lo-fi indie-pop songs, but the band refines the lessons of earlier records and improves on them, all congealing into a capital-A album. The clumsy thwack of ""Come Together"" recalls the swagger of their debut, while the irrepressibly cheerful ""Rip Allegory"" and ""The Early 80s"" are unabashed pop hewn from lazy arpeggios, bubbling one-finger organ riffs, and desperately shouted boy/girl vocals. ""The Wait"", with its deliberate tempo and sing-along chorus, is TNV's most discernible anthem yet, but they mostly stand their scuzzy ground-- the slow echoing notes of ""Relevant: Now"", and all their attendant feedback, cements the group as self-lacerating rockstars; too seasoned to avoid writing pop songs, but still too smart to take them seriously. The layer of fuzz works like a security blanket-- a way of creating not just a distinctive sound, but of putting up an awning of safety over them and their listeners. Only the slightest bit of straining brings you to the pop virtues of these songs, on the band's own terms. Sure, it's an affectation, but its just another way of using the studio as an instrument in a way that makes these songs more intimate by design-- for better or worse, you can't sell a Volkswagen with a Times New Viking song. If cleaner production means truckloads of new bands who can summon their influences with little effort, and even less enthusiasm or creativity, then I'll stick with my tinnitus, thanks.","After two releases on the recently returned Siltbreeze label, Times New Viking have become better songwriters, but thankfully don't change much of anything from their humble home-recorded beginnings on Rip It Off, their Matador debut.

Lullaby for Liquid Pig,Lisa Germano,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a18ab1335d7bf16982ad/1:1/w_160/8cd12b84.jpg,2008-01-22 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11033-lullaby-for-liquid-pig/,IneffableIneffable,"Lisa Germano may be among the most watched and heard musicians most people would never recognize. Millions raised on MTV saw her playing fiddle in John Mellencamp's videos-- there she is, dancing in the ""Paper and Fire"" clip-- and millions more saw her perform with him on stage. But it's a given that only a fraction of a fraction of those audiences have followed Germano's career since striking out as a solo artist, as she's plumbed the depths of depression. Her music is tempered by only the barest glimmer of wry humor, much of it self-effacing. Geek the Girl and Excerpts From a Love Circus remain lost classics of the mid-1990s, but since then she's been hopping between gigs and labels, hoping for the best while knowing full well that few will ever listen to her music. Germano's Lullaby for Liquid Pig was released back in 2003 on a fly-by-night label fueled by the fast-fading promise of the internet boom. Needless to say, it's been out of print for years, and as per the rules, its elusiveness has in turn perhaps over-inflated its stature. Regardless, the disc has now found a sympathetic ear in Michael Gira, who released Germano's most recent solo disc, the ghostly In the Maybe World, on his Young God label, and last year re-released Lullaby for Liquid Pig as well. In the Maybe World hardly lit the planet on fire, so good for Gira for helping Germano get Lullaby for Liquid Pig (her sixth album) back in circulation, even if its resurrection doesn't reveal the disc to be some sort of forgotten masterpiece so much as yet another strong, spooky, deceptively lush record from a niche songwriter who seemingly makes nothing but. As with most Germano albums, the album's fleshed out by such friends and regular collaborators as bassist Sebastian Steinberg, drummer Joey Waronker, Wendy Melvoin, Johnny Marr, and Crowded House's Neil Finn, but as usual no one gets in Germano's way. It's not that she's forceful so much as a force of personality, her plain whisper the kind of delivery that gets you to lean in and focus. What you hear isn't terribly fun, but it is frequently beautiful, even as Germano sings of faded dreams and the perils of alcohol on woozy, headphone-friendly dream-state songs such as ""Paper Doll"", ""Liquid Pig"", ""Candy"", and ""It's Party Time"". Added value aside, Lullaby for Liquid Pig doesn't benefit dramatically from a neither here nor there bonus disc of demos and rarities. However, the spare home recordings of several Lullaby tracks (as well as songs like ""It's a Rainbow"", from Germano's Giant Sand collaboration OP8) show Germano could probably get away with a totally DIY effort. The uptempo demo of ""Dream Glasses Off"" may even be a bit better than its murky, molasses-slow album version, though it's understandable why she might want some extra input to keep from totally insular indulgence. And indulgent she is, but only in the most noble record-sales-be-damned sense. The scattered live tracks, recorded in Lisbon as well as at L.A.'s hangout showcase Largo, serve a more important purpose than the demos, emphasizing the fact that as glum as Germano can come across on record, she's still an entertainer, with actual applauding fans who aren't all slumped over in their seats overdosing on painkillers. In a lot of ways the modest and totally down-to-earth live tracks work as a sort of pull-away-the-curtain, anti-Tori Amos device, demonstrating that one needn't pose as a magician to make magic.",,7.8,
The Best of Lisa Gerrard,Lisa Gerrard,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4025e6ef95969322547/1:1/w_160/07d8999a.jpg,2008-01-21 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11032-the-best-of-lisa-gerrard/,4AD,"Like labelmates the Cocteau Twins, Dead Can Dance blurred genres like few acts before them. Goth, rock, medieval, world, ambient, new age, classical-- any and all of these descriptors were fair game, their various hyphenate combinations more often than not reflecting the tastes and preferences of the listener rather than accurately capturing the group's slippery, essentially unclassifiable collision of exotic sounds. Yet just as with the Cocteau's enigmatic chanteuse Elizabeth Fraser, Dead Can Dance singer Lisa Gerrard was something of a genre unto herself. No disrespect intended her longtime Dead Can Dance collaborator and fellow singer Brendan Perry, but it's Gerrard's voice that remains the band's most identifiable component, which also explains Gerrard's relatively high profile outside of Dead Can Dance. She's continually tapped to lend a certain atmospheric imprimatur to movies from such mood masters as Michael Mann and Ridley Scott, and over the course of the last ten years she's recorded a handful of solo albums and collaborative projects that have kept the Dead Can Dance thread going (especially given former partner Perry's less-than-prolific nature). The totally unnecessary The Best of Lisa Gerrard, however, is as one might presume not really part of that ongoing thread. Instead, the disc attempts to encapsulate Gerrard's career-- both with Dead Can Dance and beyond-- over the course of a scant 13 tracks. In its defense, the impeccably designed (but of course) disc was compiled and sequenced by Gerrard herself, but squeezing a voice so expansive down to a space this small remains a Pyrrhic victory, really, no matter who's doing the heavy lifting. The results mostly serve as a reminder that's there's so much more out there beyond this modest collection. The disc starts out with ""Sacrifice"", a collaboration with Pieter Bourke that trainspotters may recognize from Mann's The Insider (among other places it's been used), then segues back a few years into the Dead Can Dance catalog for ""Ariadne"" before offering a live version of that band's ""Sanvean"". From there on out it smoothly glides back and forth through these two major settings-- solo and Dead Can Dance-- hitting such predictable, ethereal highlights as DCD's ""The Host of Seraphim"" and scattered tracks from her solo career. And therein lies the rub. It's probably safe to assume that fans of Gerrard's solo work are already fans of her Dead Can Dance work, or vice versa, and have already heard or bought everything included on this best-of. It's probably also safe to assume that this disc was instead intended for those who may have only encountered Gerrard's voice in passing, were intrigued by what they heard and wanted a simple one-stop-shopping place to start. That's fair enough, except that Gerrard's not much of an iPod-age track-by-track sort of artist, and best-of or no best-of, searching for a simple place to start simply isn't as easy as it seems. She's more an all or nothing proposition, and if you like something from her you'll likely like almost everything, which would of course then render something like this set moot. Which boils down to this caveat: if you're at all curious, just grab a Dead Can Dance album, pretty much any of them. And if you like what you hear, buy more. Time will determine a best-of for you.","Former Dead Can Dance singer boasts an expansive, enigmatic voice. So why boil it down to a banal best-of?

Epic Fits,PRE,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3ff9d034d5c69bf4dc5/1:1/w_160/ed540f86.jpg,2008-01-21 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11029-epic-fits/,Skin Graft,"After a certain recent indie rock domestic violence dispute, bruise-covered limbs will probably seem ominous, or worse, for a while. Black-and-blue-- badge of bands too far gone onstage to feel pain, of fans in the front no matter how unforgiving the barricades, kids who could never call it a night without some solid contact from 10 or 20 of their best friends-- will have to go into hiding, or at least off your Flickr account. Shots of Pre singer Exceedingly Good Keex, alias Akiko Matsuura, will now have to be regarded with dread, not awe. Still, I doubt Matsuura will clean up her act, or even cover up her act with anything beyond the green bikini top and gold lamé bottom ensemble she sported when last in New York. There, her band showed up a crowded field of CMJ noise-rock comers-- HEALTH, Ruins, Sightings-- by enjoying herself. Epic Fits is more fun than any number of last year's punk releases, too, if nowhere near as accomplished. ""No shirt, no shoes…ACE COCK!"" Keex shrieks on ""Ace Cock."" Uh, exactly? Pre aren't total naïfs. Underneath their ultra-distorted, shrill merry-go-round grind (see all 47 seconds of ""Slash in the Snakepit"") are a lot of perfectly wound-up, hand-me-down Devo riffs and Monorchid rips (""Nope Fun"", ""Dude Fuk"", ""Popping Showers"")-- the type of outbursts that might allow Matsuura to acquire her bruises in a pattern, rather than just here or there. But it probably goes without saying that London's new heirs to Melt Banana, who recorded Epic Fits as quickly as they possibly could in a frozen pizza storage facility, won't be seeing a lot of imitators. Unless you count hanging from the rafters live, which though she sometimes acts like it, Keex did not invent. Or even perfect-- though lurching around gracelessly is not an insignificant chunk of their charm. By way of salute to X-Ray Spex, whose Poly Styrene Keex can sometimes sound a lot like, someone blows a saxophone on ""Popping Showers"". Then she blows it some more, and then some more. If Pre have a trademark it's that they'll derail anything moving. Pile-up's the point. Two bassists knock each other's riffs off course. Matsuura yells until her microphone distorts. No wonder they live for their live show, where no one has to pretend to savor any given track. Why bother, when another one is already on the way?","London punk band adds elements of fun and the X-Ray Spex to the ultra-distorted, merry-go-round grind of contemporaries like HEALTH and Sightings.

Ragged Rubble,Double Dagger,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3fbea9e61561daa6ba2/1:1/w_160/03169444.gif,2008-01-21 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11026-ragged-rubble/,Stationary Heart,"Give Double Dagger credit for doing it the hard way-- when you're a two-piece band and your third man is a vocalist, there's not much margin for error. So their sparse take on punk rock is either minimal by design or necessity, and, given their background as graphic designers and their thoughtful lyrics, it's probably the former. They've progressed as players between records: I can't imagine the band on their debut pulling off the swelling-tide riff of ""The Psychic"" or its artful guitar squiggles in the outro, let alone the skipping groove of ""Empty Dictionary"". They've gotten a bit cleverer as well, building tension with simple but crucial harmonies in ""Form + Function"" and ""Rearranging Digital Deck Chairs"", or with curveballs like the fake applause in ""Stripes"". Many of the songs on Ragged Rubble are brittle, impassioned screeds like standout ""Luxury Condos for the Poor"", but in other tracks, like ""ITCFGDIY"", the grooves become more sophisticated and elastic, the notes of the riffs ring out a little longer, and the pendulum subtly swings from flailing punk into an anemic version of two-man metal. Here, Double Dagger seem a little less comfortable. But don't underestimate the man with the mic, whose desperate delivery give these fiery anthems their spark. Singer Nolan Strals sounds like either a disgusted scenester or a frustrated art student in the lyrics to ""Form + Function"": ""It's something called context... and without it, you're just fucking around."" Insightful commentary either way, and words I wish more bands would take to heart as Double Dagger have. ""Luxury Condos"" insists that developers are ""building a ghost town"" from ""waterfront gravesites 30 stories high,"" and while ""Army vs. Navy"" is a little heavy-handed (""Is this the Super Bowl, or a Holy War?"" is either awesome or moronic), it's at least trying to get a point across. His twisting of the phrase ""hearts and minds"" shows concern for the mangling of language and rhetoric, both here and where he insists ""language is dead"" on ""Empty Dictionary"". When Strals opens his throat to squall, he has an idea of what should be at stake. The more minimal, melodic tracks sound like strident, heartfelt political punk, while the heavier ones sound like half-hearted sludge-- but there's less of them then there are home runs like ""Form + Function"" and ""Luxury Condos for the Poor"", both of which are plenty cogent arguments for agit-punk in 2007 (er, 2008). Closing track ""Rearranging Digital Deck Chairs"" splits the difference, interrupting slow-motion headbang-worthy riffery with nervous, pleading verses and finding a happy medium, promising more territory unexplored in the band's austere framework. Despite paring down to the bare essentials, Double Dagger's sound is only as limited as their imaginations-- and frustrations.","Baltimore trio's sparse punk rock is minimal by design and bolstered by trenchant commentary.

Liferz,Blood on the Wall,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b42bb1335d7bf169a6f1/1:1/w_160/41520fee.jpg,2008-01-21 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11070-liferz/,Social Registry,"Originally hailing from Kansas, Brooklyn's Blood on the Wall and their 2005 breakthrough album Awesomer are the stuff Horatio Alger dime novels are made on. The band grew up on the hallowed early-90s American indie/alternative/college rock boom, and a decade or two later, they pulled themselves up by the bootstraps to throw the Pixies, Pavement, Sebadoh, Sonic Youth, and all the rest into one messy blender. Fearing accusations of cheap mimicry, many bands with an equal admiration for this period over-think their music, becoming paralyzed by a tendency to tip-toe around the aesthetic. In contrast, Blood on the Wall don't try to hide the fact that they're trying to write another ""Gigantic"", so they often succeed. They do forget, though, to wipe away the elbow grease: Awesomer, while impressive, never sounded anything close to effortless. If Blood on the Wall are considered some sort of indie revivalists, they're rebuilding the genre Jason Bourne-style, mostly with fractured bits of nostalgia, and the frustration from this less-than-total recall is apparent in every chorus where a scream takes the place of a catchy hook. On Liferz, they use even less finesse. Here, the blender setting's switched from ""medium"" to ""high,"" making the constituents harder to pick out. Whereas Awesomer made some effort to match up the puzzle pieces, Liferz readily uses force to make the pieces fit. The opening one-two punch of ""Hibernation"" and ""The Ditch"" brutally lays down this law. In a tale of the tape, Liferz's brutish introductory salvo may not measure up to Awesomer's craftier ""Stoner Jam""/""Reunite on Ice"" combo, but these newer songs wield far greater muscle. Siblings Courtney and Brad Shanks continue to rank as one of the best male/female vocal tag teams in the business, unselfishly spreading the wealth and appropriating songs best suited to their tics. While both can spew bile at the drop of a power chord, Courtney grows into a more mature big sister role on the hazy ballad ""Lightning Song"", and even on the grimy power pop number ""Rize"" she holds back her screams to do her surprisingly expressive, coherent lyrics justice. Of course, brother Brad pokes holes in any lingering sentimentality, using his indoor voice sparingly and hamming it up like a class clown. Whether pining for the next heroine hit in ""Junkee... Julieee..."" or playing the slapstick victim of blooper anthem ""Acid Fight"" (""There's something in my face!""), Brad never shies away from sacrificing tonality for character acting. Though it lacks some of Awesomer's scintillating highlights, Liferz unequivocally proves that Blood on the Wall may slice and dice the holy scripture of 90s indie rock, but in a way that's more orthodox than heresy. Instead of, say, adding a keyboardist or lavishing their music with effects pedals or studio tricks, Blood on the Wall stick to their guns, laughing in the faces of the indie gods by blasting another faux-Pixies song dangerously into the red. Excuse them for being irreverent: They're just punking their touchstones the same way those bands did to their own 20 years ago.","Steeped in classic indie rock, this muscular trio makes no bones about blasting faux-Pixies or Sonic Youth songs well into the red.

Jukebox,Cat Power,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b42413d197565213aa6c/1:1/w_160/b718ad60.jpg,2008-01-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11064-jukebox/,Matador,"A lot of water has gone under the bridge since Cat Power's last covers record in 2000. In the intervening eight years, she has undergone a musical and characteristic evolution that's as surprising as it may have been necessary. Following her 2004 album You Are Free, which perfected her music's transformation to scrawled blues folk, she appeared on Handsome Boy Modeling School's otherwise vanilla White People. Her track, ""I've Been Thinking"", was a risky gambit that moved beyond the introverted waif persona of previous albums and revealed a new facet of Cat Power: credible soul singer. The point of ""I've Been Thinking"", which still holds up, is its sultriness; it's a striptease on a dare, complete with smoky ambience, a halting chorus, and an unbelievable spoken-word passage. Speed it up, add a flashier beat, and the song could be a Beyoncé hit. That track signaled a newly emboldened Marshall, as she began to refine her emotionally precarious live shows. For her next album, The Greatest, she would return to Memphis, the birthplace of her 1996 Matador debut What Would the Community Think, to fully embrace soul music, recording with members of Al Green's Hi Records band. Her trajectory is familiar, but the unspectacular Jukebox, a sort of sequel to The Covers Record, reaffirms what she's gained during this musical growth spurt, and what she's lost. Marshall has become a confident and charismatic vocalist, with subtle nuances and deft combinations of phrasing styles. She's no powerhouse like Aretha Franklin or Irma Thomas, but she sings well in a low, smoky croon, just a notch above conversational. I would have loved to see Marshall wander a few blocks south of Hi and end up at Stax, either recording with the MGs (how natural she would sound with Steve Cropper) or maybe with Isaac Hayes circa Hot Buttered Soul (who could do orchestral wonders with her songs). Instead, Marshall has moved a few decades forward, assembling a band of 1990s contemporaries for Jukebox. Jim White, the Dirty Three drummer who backed her on Moon Pix, and Judah Bauer, late of the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, pound out dramatic accompaniment, but are never quite as smooth, as supple, or as inventive as her Greatest band. Marshall uses these covers albums not so much as a personal mixtape but as a state-of-the-career address. Like The Covers Record, a more self-critical work that traced her own influences through rock and folk, Jukebox exposes the roots of her newfound soulfulness. At a time when genres seem discouragingly fragmented and crossovers few and far between, Jukebox is admirably diverse, straddling country, blues, R&B, folk, and showtunes. Few other albums, at least in the indie realm, will skip so effortlessly from Hank Williams to James Brown, from Billie Holiday to Janis Joplin, from Jessie Mae Hemphill to the Highwaymen. Marshall sounds most comfortable with the country songs. Changing the pronouns in Williams' ""Ramblin' (Wo)Man"", she instills the song with a bluesy drama that's all grit and wanderlust. Similarly, she plays up the erotic twang in the Highwaymen's ""Silver Stallion"", stripping the song it to its barest acoustic accompaniment. I doubt Merle Haggard or Johnny Cash considered the sexual implications of a line like, ""Just a touch of sadness in his fingers/ Thunder and lightning in his thighs""; they were talking about a horse, but Marshall gamely emphasizes the entendre*.* Marshall even covers herself again, as she did on The Covers Record: Her new band generates some bluster on the Jukebox reworking of ""Metal Heart"", originally a standout track on 1998's Moon Pix, but never exhibits the dynamic and control of the original. Aside from the supremely awkward reinterpretation of ""New York New York"", the soul covers are the least impressive here. Marshall's pleading doesn't sound credible or committed on James Brown's ""Lost Someone"" or George Jackson's ""Aretha, Sing One for Me"". She doesn't savor these songs the way she savored ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction"" and ""Sea of Love"" on The Covers Record. The woman who got such an obvious kick out of doing her best Bob Dylan on ""Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again"" on the I'm Not There soundtrack is largely absent here, even on the sluggish cover of Bob's Christian-era ""I Believe in You"". It's worth noting that Jukebox's best moment comes not with a cover, but with a Cat Power original-- and fitting, too, that it's a mash note to Dylan. On the epistolary ""Song for Bobby"" she recounts in conversational lyrics her youthful infatuation with Dylan and how her professional love for him blurred into something like romantic affection. The song is funny, endearing, and even revealing. Still, a covers album like Jukebox should reveal new facets of a performer in its selection and interpretation of favorite songs. That's how (and why) The Covers Record worked. But eight years later, only ""Song for Bobby"" tells us anything new about Chan Marshall. The rest of Jukebox doesn't even say much about Cat Power.","A sort of sequel to 2000's The Covers Record, Cat Power's Jukebox reaffirms what Chan Marshall has gained during her 21st century musical growth spurt, and what she's lost.

The abstract, atmospheric sonics were undeniably intriguing, pushing rap's parameters to their utmost edge, but then there was the rapping. More specifically, the nerd rapping. The lack of flow was never an issue for me (ahem, Kanye); instead, it was hard to understand the motivation. If these guys were trying to be comical, then you could conceivably spin the pocket protector rhymesaying as being part of the shtick, but no one was really cracking wise. Instead, the rapping undermined the project's potential power and made it seem like a bunch of stoned-ass self-indulgence. While I've subsequently failed to be stirred by anything Doseone or Why? have undertaken aside from 2005's pretty good 13 & God experiment (and those kudos overwhelmingly belong to the Notwist), Odd Nosdam, the collective's primary producer (and occasional rapper), has fashioned an impressive run as an experimental, chiefly instrumental artist, perceptibly maturing over the course of his brief career. Born David Madson, his first widely-released record, 2003's No More Wig For Ohio, was an occasionally inspired but overwhelmingly scattered collection; it consisted mostly of miniature pieces that were little more than a single languid melody looped over predictable drum breaks and augmented with random spoken word samples. Burner, from 2005, was a marked improvement and a welcome move towards long-form composition, though it may have played things a little too loosely, hitting a number of staticky dead patches in its longer tracks and mostly failing to cohere. Madson finally strikes an equitable balance with Level Live Wires, a tightly constructed soundscape that hangs together more cogently than anything he's conceived to date. Following the swirling, woozy opening track, ""On"", Madson introduces the record's theme on ""Kill Tone"", a snippet built from damaged harp that he revisits throughout the record. Here, the harp rests beneath piano runs and atop drums, tortured vocal blips, and generous layers of static. We're not too far removed from Four Tet territory, but Madson is far too restless to settle for long in one folktronic pocket. ""Freakout 3"" throws swelling strings and atmospheric guitar squalls over fat, lugubrious bass before earning its title with a second-long detonation at the piece's end. ""Fat Hooks"" is even more of a revelation, full of gently rising and falling tones that perform Moby's once-great trick of flirting with new age without slipping into mawkishness. Regrettably, Madson does get wordier as Level Live Wires unfolds, rapping with predictably negligible effect (though thankfully little distraction) on ""The Kill Tone Two"", though he nicely layers in a female voice in the lovingly-built ""Up in Flames"". The latter is probably the record's highlight, with its plump and subtly manipulated bass, ample sounds of mechanical malfunction, and ghostly hints of steel drums. Madson makes a slightly gratuitous farewell with the stretched-out closer, ""Off"", but the busily flitting bliss of the preceding 37 minutes earns him a respite.

Melodii Tuvi: Throat Songs and Folk Tunes from Tuva,Various Artists,by: Mike McGonigal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3b75e6ef959693224c6/1:1/w_160/a1cd5bfb.jpg,2008-01-18 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10963-melodii-tuvi-throat-songs-and-folk-tunes-from-tuva/,Dust-to-Digital,"Among the world's many musical what the fuck was THAT?! moments, few are quite so what the fuck as one's first exposure to Tuvan music. This stuff not only incorporates ""bent"" notes outside the Western scale, is sung in a foreign tongue, and includes creaky, arcane folk instrumentation, but also happens to actually sound like some sort of alien is singing it, a creature with at least two sets of vocal cords, maybe like the blue lady from The Fifth Element. The Tuvan throat-singing method-- which is scientifically explained in the accompanying CD booklet but I still don't really understand how they do it-- allows the singer to produce at least two distinct sounds at once. Take opener ""Reka Alash [Alash River]"", sung by Oorjak Hunashtaar-ool in the Sygyt style. The song is a cappella, and in the lyrics it compares the beauty of a woman to that of a mountain stream. The tune starts out in a low, Captain Beefheart-ish register, but then it goes simultaneously up and down, as if it were then sent through a sort of filter: First the voice sounds like synthesized oscillations, like an old school Pauline Oliveros electronic contraption, or a very broken theremin. Then the sounds separate clearly, into a rumbling drone at one end and this gorgeous, circular whistling type noise in the upper register. The whistling bit reminds me a lot of those elongated tubes I played with as a kid, the ones that are made of plastic and formed like a huge bend-y straw, that make a high-pitched whirl as you swing them satisfyingly about your head. (I can't for the life of me find the actual name for those things.) Other songs-- those sung in the Borbannaryr and Kargyraa methods-- achieve even deeper sounds, often registering comparisons to the croaking of bullfrogs. This is ""true folk music"" in that it was never intended to be performed, or recorded. Tuva, a tiny Russian republic located along the northwestern border of Mongolia, remains a very remote region. For centuries, the Tuvans, who descended from both Turkish and Mongol peoples, were nomadic. These songs were meant to herd cattle. Functionally similar to the ""hollerin'"" tradition of the American South and Midwest, the farmers created a sound that would carry as far as possible, rounding up any stray animals for feedtime (the Tuvans mostly herded goats, as I understand). It is a centuries' old tradition, and many of the lyrics tell of the gentle beauty of the landscape, the rivers and lakes and mountains. Melodii Tuvi consists of recordings made in the USSR in 1969 for a state-run folk-life label. There are various styles of throat singing, all of which are included here, along with some excellent little instrumental folk tunes played on homemade stringed instruments that recall a simple guitar and a violin. There's also one mouth's harp song which again reminds the listener of a synthesizer, and an example of Tuvan folk song without the throat singing. These all help to give the disc a bit of lightness, to temper the intensity a bit, making it far easier to listen to the thing all the way through. As of this writing, Dust-to-Digital is one of those very rare labels that adventurous listeners should own everything on, without hesitation. As they've until recently focused on American folk idioms, I was a little surprised DtD had released a recording of this stuff, until I really examined it. Great care has gone to cleaning up the sound without erasing any of it. And the mastering is exceptional, the package beautifully designed and informative-- they make it all look so easy! In the past few years it has become easier to be exposed to throat singing, due in no small part to the Genghis Blues film. That movie follows Paul Pena, a blind American contemporary blues singer who became adept at the art of throat-singing just by listening to recordings, and (spoiler alert) in the film he travels to Tuva and wins a singing competition there. But this would seem to be ""the one to get,"" should you only want one recording of Tuvan music. It's a little melancholy and eerily beautiful, often sparse and meditative. You're probably not going to listen to it all day, but it's doubtful that when you do listen you'll be able to do much else. After all, music like this refuses to just sink into the background.","Continuing to expand its focus beyond American folk idioms, the outstanding Dust-to-Digital label here collects Tuvan throat songs and instrumentals originally made in the USSR in 1969 for a state-run company.

"The Brit Box: U.K. Indie, Shoegaze and Brit-Pop Gems of the Last Millennium",Various Artists,by: Scott Plagenhoef,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b41f5e6ef9596932257d/1:1/w_160/0bdbd4ba.jpg,2008-01-18 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11060-the-brit-box-uk-indie-shoegaze-and-brit-pop-gems-of-the-last-millennium/,Rhino,"Starting with the British Invasion, and through the next roughly 20 years, it would be difficult to argue that-- although the roots of rock are 100% American-- they weren't perfected, prodded, and pushed along by the Brits. From the Beatles, Stones, and Who in the early 1960s, through the the hard rock of Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, Pink Floyd and psych and prog, the art-pop of Bowie and Roxy Music, the glammy stomp of T. Rex, the fertile, fast-moving worlds of UK punk and post-punk, its cousins such as electronic and industrial music, New Pop, and synth-pop, the gothic gloom of the Cure and Echo & the Bunnymen, through the roots of indie in Orange Juice and the Smiths. Rhino's new box set, The Brit Box: U.K. Indie, Shoegaze and Brit-Pop Gems of the Last Millennium, picks up at almost the exact moment that incredible run of pioneering, template-crushing music finished. By 1986, a few years of run-of-the-mill guitar rock had left the UK music press scrambling for new ideas. As a result, writers at publications such as Melody Maker fought a brief war over where to plant their flags, with camps divided between the ascendant hip-hop and the regressive, relatively handmade sounds of C-86. Before long, acid house would briefly leave each in the dust, shifting the UK pop landscape in ways not seen since punk. One result was that, in the UK in particular, in the years covered by The Brit Box, progressiveness would cease to be the domain of rock. Eventually, cultivating/strip-mining the past became the rule rather than the exception. It was still a massively creative time for the UK, and 1986 was roughly the time that the word indie began to take shape and take on meaning. (In the U.S., throughout the 80s, most of what we'd now call ""indie rock"" was still either punk or college rock.) Yet why the disc starts in 1986 is anyone's guess. Were a survey of UK indie to begin with the Smiths, one would think it would be a track from three years earlier-- the debut single ""Hand in Glove"" or ""This Charming Man"", the track whose seminal ""Top of the Pops"" performance helped launch the band. More likely, it kicks off here because this set has a bit of a touristic, removed feel to it, reading less like a history of UK indie and more like that world as seen through the eyes of an American Anglophile. To wit, the lengthy booklet includes an essay about a DJ whose work promoted the best of UK indie. The late John Peel? Hell, no: Rodney from L.A.'s KROQ. And after a catch-all beginning, the set then cherrypicks a few sounds-- shoegaze and Britpop, in particular-- that, largely through MTV's ""120 Minutes"" and the Anglophiliac radio of 80s college stations and KROQ, made inroads into the U.S. indie consciousness. Unlike most every Rhino box, then, this isn't a warts-and-all document of a scene as it happened, but a warts-and-all document of a scene as it was viewed from thousands of miles away, a nostalgia trip not for a large portion of kids but for the compiler himself. The first disc contains a ton of great music, but it's also a lot of great music you likely already own. The Smiths, Echo & the Bunnymen, the Cure, the Stone Roses, Jesus & Mary Chain, Cocteau Twins, and Happy Mondays have been staples for decades, as have singles like the La's ""There She Goes"" and the Primitves' ""Crash"". For UK indie novices, this is a good way to get to know Felt and Spacemen 3, while C-86ers the Shop Assistants and the pleasantly included Trash Can Sinatras are the closest things here to lost gems. Sadly, bands like the Field Mice, House of Love, Kitchens of Distinction, AR Kane, the Razorcuts, and Talulah Gosh are left out, but on the whole it's hard to quibble with the selections. Discs 2 and 3, then, focus on specific moments or movements-- shoegaze and Britpop-- with not enough thought given to quality control. Shoegaze was a guitar bands' way of interfacing with the sonic possibilities and experimentation opened by acid house, and while it provided a number of excellent to epochal groups, the quality here veers wildly, suggesting that an entire disc of the stuff wasn't needed. (One note: Slowdive must not have allowed themselves to be compiled-- it's the only explanation for their absence.) In the hands of the best shoegazers, however, guitar virtuosity and the exploration of sheer volume or noise was grafted onto the pop song, and crucial to it getting traction in indie circles, it wasn’t dance music-- it was the complete opposite, as its name suggested. Between shoegaze and Britpop, of course, came grunge, which facilitated the latter and, as much as it ""killed"" hair metal, also kept UK indie-dance on the fringe in the U.S. (If you recall, up to ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", Madchester and baggy groups were ""120 Minutes"" staples.) Disc 3, however, starts by playing a bit of catch-up with the UK indie bands competing with Nirvana and the like, including a belated appearance by New Order and a welcome ones by Swervedriver, the Boo Radleys, Stereolab, and Saint Etienne, who were among the first groups to restore the supposedly British qualities of wit, style, and artifice to pop music. The other groups first huddled under the banner of a Brit-centric revolution (Blur, Pulp, Denim, and the Auteurs-- neither of those last two are included here), as well as many of those in the initial rush of Britpop fever (Oasis, Elastica, Supergrass) comprised a diverse scene rooted in crisp, smart pop songs that emphasized UK art-school traditions. Within 18 months, however, Britpop devolved into just another version of the dour classic/arena rock retread it was meant to oppose in the first place. Cocaine didn't help, but Oasis' dominance was probably to blame most of all. Despite the presence of Kula Shaker and Ocean Colour Scene, most of the dregs of post-Oasis dadrock are thankfully left out of the set-- there are no places for Northern Uproar, 60 ft. Dolls, and the like, and Cast are represented by their most ""pop"" moment. Instead, kudos for the compilers for digging into Britpop and its antecedents; no matter what one thinks of the quality of Sleeper, Ash, Dodgy, the Bluetones, or Babybird, they at least fit the tone and tenor of the set. Disc 4 is also home to rewarding outliers such as Super Furry Animals, Mansun, the Divine Comedy, Spiritualized, the Verve, and Cornershop. The long-term damage that Britpop did to both UK indie and its press is on full display on Disc 4. The healthy alternative once provided by UK indie regrouped in the late 90s, but that ground-level reorganization is absent here. Rather than finding room for dead-ends such as Hurricane #1, Gay Dad, or Catatonia, it would have been nice to retreat from the chart-hopeful and the NME-loved to make room for artists such as Belle and Sebastian, the Beta Band, Mogwai, Gorky's Zygotic Mynci, Plone, or Broadcast-- groups that rejected the inward-looking London-centrism, English nationalism, and 60s humping of Britpop by exploring more traditional indie roots and asserting their own regional identities. Of course that would have been a bit of a lie-- these groups wound up being dead ends of their own after the NME reorganized this decade around the rise of the Strokes and a litter of baby Libertines and post-punkers, a scene that includes Franz Ferdinand, the Futureheads, Arctic Monkeys, and Klaxons, but too often is merely an exercise in self-parody. Perhaps the set ends at the turn of the century because so too does the once inexhaustible creative spirit of UK indie. From the Smiths to Gay Dad: That really says it all.","Rhino attempts to map almost a quarter-century of UK indie music, focusing on shoegaze, Britpop, and 1980s ""120 Minutes"" staples.

Soldier On EP,Andrew Bird,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4129d034d5c69bf4de0/1:1/w_160/dcefe9c1.jpg,2008-01-18 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11046-soldier-on-ep/,Fargo,"Over the past decade, Andrew Bird has released six albums that trace a remarkable artistic progression. His first two solo albums have their way with American jazz and blues, Caribbean melting-pot styles, and European cabaret music from the early 20th century, while his third album, The Swimming Hour, marked a leap into alchemy, tying together threads from across popular music. But his last three albums have sketched out what is essentially Bird's own genre, full of looping violins, otherwordly whistling, and wordplay that flips through a library's worth of science, pop psychology, politics, and mortal fear. Beneath all this, Bird has also produced a sort of shadow discography in the form of his limited-release Fingerlings volumes. They're full of experiments, sketches, things that got crowded off of albums, and remarkable live performances, and they illustrate parts of his development that we don't get to hear on his albums. Soldier On, a long, eight-track EP sold at shows on his European tour, doesn't bear the Fingerlings name, but it serves much the same purpose, gathering one demo, one remix and a trove of other artifacts from his past couple years of recording. Some come from various artist compilations, some are completely new, and at least one seems like it might be a glimpse of where he's headed. The remix of ""Plasticities"" is a nice example of how pulling apart the elements of Bird's tracks can create a sort of exploded diagram of the song, giving each little detail a new airing, while the early version of ""Heretics"" is a very basic acoustic guitar-and-voice demo. They're nice, but they're for fans, as is the almost ambient instrumental ""Sectionate City"". ""How You Gonna Keep 'Em Down on the Farm"" and ""The Water Jet Cilice"" are slow, sparse, and mournful tracks that hit on a very specific type of melancholy that Bird seems to be able to reach with minimal effort. Oddly, ""The Water Jet Cilice"" is not the same piece of music as the instrumental of the same title on Fingerlings 3-- this is a vocal song that shares nothing in common with the other song. The most remarkable track on the EP is the one that kicks it off, though. ""The Trees Were Mistaken"" is something new for Bird, and really quite good. It takes the looping technique he's perfected over the years to a new level, throwing blankets of sound over a programmed beat, with dabs of pizzicato violin and splashes of electric guitar splattered across the surface. Bird joins the layers of texture with his voice, riding the song's swelling pulse into a thorny den of oscillating violins and eerie whistling. It's a track that makes this compilation more notable than your average side release-in fact, Soldier On is exceptionally good for a quick collection of rarities, a must-have for fans and a genuine expansion of his range.","This lengthy EP compiled to coincide with his latest round of eco-friendly touring gathers a demo, a remix, and many other artifacts from Andrew Bird's past couple of years of recording.

Boscoe / Gently Down Your Stream / Appetizer – Soup’s On / Propinquity,BoscoeThe Four MintsJohnny LunchbreakPropinquity,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3ea9d034d5c69bf4da4/1:1/w_160/811decaf.jpg,2008-01-18 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11644-boscoegently-down-your-streamappetizer-soups-onpropinquity/,Asterisk,"Numero Group has spent the past four years building itself into one of the best reissue labels in the world, with a catalog stuffed full of compilations gathering outstanding soul obscurities, kick-ass power pop, Caribbean funk, gospel with a groove, and private-press folk, not to mention an occasional full-album reissue and a handful of great early rap 12""s. Having established a story-based format for delivering dusty old sounds to a new (perhaps even a first-ever) audience, the label has now established a subsidiary, Asterisk, to explore other avenues, resurrecting the full catalogs of never-was artists who could have been something big given the chance. The name of the label is appropriate-- these discs are delivered in a sort of ""oh, by the way... listen to this"" fashion, packaged in attractive cardboard gatefolds that mimic LP sleeves in miniature, each with its own set of extensive liners stuffed with primary source quotations and old photos. The spines all match up with each other, practically begging you to put them next to each other on your shelf, but the music ranges far and wide, from the harmony soul of Columbus, Ohio's Four Mints to post-hippy folk by Propinquity, complex but unheard rock from Connecticut's Johnny Lunchbreak, and mind-blowing art-funk from Chicago's Boscoe. Of the four volumes, the best and most vital is definitely Boscoe. Their 1973 self-titled album sank without a trace as the band toiled in the shadows of Chicago's South Side scene. They fit right in with the other challenging acts in the scene, including the Art Ensemble of Chicago, Sun Ra, Phil Cohran, the Pharaohs and Earth, Wind & Fire (in their pre-disco days), but in the end they just couldn't get themselves heard over their neighbors. Their album is a swirling near-masterpiece that pulls together smoking funk rhythms, strands of free jazz and deep soul, conscious lyrics, amazingly complex and harmonically sophisticated horn arrangements, and assorted other ingredients to make music that fell outside the lines of any particular genre. ""If I Had My Way"" is a stone-cold classic of socially aware funk that never got its chance to reach a wide audience, ""I'm What You Need"" is a surprisingly tender, harmony-drenched ballad that proves they could write a pop tune when they wanted to, and ""Writin' On the Wall"" is a tortured, lurching plea for people to wake the hell up and look at the problems of the world around them with an eye to solving them. While none of the other volumes hit with the same fresh immediacy of Boscoe, there's some great stuff on offer. The Four Mints first entered Numero's universe on the label's very first release, a retrospective of Bill Moss' Capsoul label on which they had a couple of great tracks. Their album, 1973's Gently Down Your Stream, was cobbled together from singles, and with the three studio outtakes appended by Asterisk, constitutes their entire body of recordings. It's great early-70s smooth soul, essentially from the Philadelphia school, with creamy harmonies and a lot of call-and-response. But it's also a great example of how the quirks of old small-label soul can make it so interesting to listen to: the drums on this thing, played by Bobby Allen and Dean Francis, are freaking loud, and the utter rawness of the backing tracks creates a tension between the silky vocals and the music that would be hard to achieve if you were trying. On the back of the CD sleeve, Propinquity member Jason Potter writes that his old band was, ""neither the most nor the least creative, but we had the joy of exploration and made some interesting stuff along the way,"" which is a decent review of their sole album, recorded in 1973. The album was barely heard on its release in their home state of Colorado, and wasn't heard at all anywhere else (the tiny label that released it, Owl, has a story worth telling itself), but it's a pleasant excursion into acoustic 70s folk by a talented quintet. With three male vocalists topped by the fragile soprano of 18-year-old Carla Sciaky, they had a rich harmony sound, best heard on the stunning album opener ""People Come"", where the group creates kaleidoscopic layers of melody. Their name connotes nearness and affinity, and the spirit in which they chose it is evident in the music. The final band resurrected here, Johnny Lunchbreak, never even released an album. The band had roots at King Philip Junior High in West Hartford, Conn., and their story is a prototype for thousands of groups-- start out playing because it's fun, get serious, find success elusive (complete with cool reception by the NYC press), call it quits in frustration when you realize that feeding your child is more important than gigging at bars in Vernon for chump change. But what most of those other bands didn't have was an album's worth of really good, unique songs that show a band tantalizingly close to a breakthrough. ""Tinsel Days"" has a colossal power pop hook and a great independent bassline, but the killer is ""Not a Dry Eye in America"", which shows off their harmonies and fakes you into believing it's a ballad before ramping up to a moody, blues-inflected climax. The recording quality is clean but not clear (these are demos in the true sense), but these guys had it, and it shows through the relatively murky sound. Asterisk is off to an intriguing start with these four discs, and the message sent by the early release schedule seems to be that anything goes as long as the story is worth telling and the music is worth hearing. The Four Mints, Propinquity, and Johnny Lunchbreak volumes are niche recordings to a degree-- rare soul, folk, and power-pop hounds seem to be the ones most likely to pursue each one, respectively. And then there's Boscoe, who should be heard by just about anyone who has ears and an appetite for something funky that will blow them off their head.","Four reissues from the Numero Group subsidiary Asterisk resurrects forgotten albums that range from avant-funk (Boscoe) to acoustic 1970s folk (Propiniquity), with the sharp packaging and liner notes the imprint is known for.

Blink of a Nihilist,BC Camplight,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3f813d197565213aa23/1:1/w_160/e8078ae2.jpg,2008-01-17 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11023-blink-of-a-nihilist/,One Little Indian,"No matter how heinous you consider the worst musical crimes of Elton John or Billy Joel, summery piano chords are nothing to be ashamed of. In the late 1990s, the first two Ben Folds Five albums made the world safe for piano men, at least until Folds' embrace of more sophisticated production techniques and alternately jokey/sappy subject matter had even some longtime fans battling to see who could care least. Folds' bittersweet piano-pop stylings are all over BC Camplight's sophomore album, Blink of a Nihilist, although they're incorporated into multi-part compositions with orchestral arrangements and honeyed harmonies that just as often invoke Brian Wilson. Guess which of the two names shows up in Camplight's press materials. BC Camplight is Philadelphia-based twentysomething songwriter Brian Christinzio, who sings and plays almost everything on Blink of the Nihilist. Camplight has toured the UK with English twee-pop ""country-disco"" band the Boy Least Likely To, and like that group's enchanting The Best Party Ever, his 2005 full-length debut Hide, Run Away uses cheerful pop melodies as a front for darker preoccupations. Where its predecessor might blithely think of murder, Blink of a Nihilist achieves subtler and occasionally more rewarding contrasts. However, despite some elegant production touches and a few shimmering hooks, Camplight's latest lacks both Wilson's childlike innocence and Folds' shit-talking realism. Instead we get bludgeoned with enough rote quirkiness for a big-budget Wes Anderson knockoff. Camplight's skill lies in the way he fills out his bright, twisting tunes and unusual, Burt Bacharach-esque chord progressions with arrangements that echo the grandeur of Pet Sounds. So Blink of a Nihilist's high point is finale ""Scare Me Sweetly"", even though its lyrics about being ""in love with you/ and your little sister, too"" compare unfavorably not just to Beck's Midnite Vultures sister act ""Debra"" but also Camplight's own mother-daughter variation on the theme, Hide, Run Away's ""Emily's Dead to Me""; the bouncy drums, theremin-like synths, and lush strings set up a soaring chorus that's so ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" it could be in a Sonic commercial. Feathery backing vocals from Stephanie Vernacchio are an asset here and on swaying, slower ""Officer Down""; she keeps both songs from getting lost in their own eccentricities. Jaunty first single ""Lord, I've Been on Fire"" is as catchy as it is inscrutable, like a weird outtake from Ben Folds' first solo album. Weird, yeah, but not as weird as its ending suggests. A maniacally cackling Christinzio declares, ""Reeeeediculous"", and this is where Blink of a Nihlist's quirks start to get cloying. There's also the one-minute sci-fi ""Peter and the Wolf"" waltz of ""Werewolf Waltz"", the brain-stabbing barbershop of ""I've Got a Bad Cold"", the Tropicália-style breeziness of ""Soy Tonto!"", and the meandering pipe-organ languor of ""Grey Young Amelia"". Turns out Christinzio has spent time in a mental institution, a fact that appears near the top in virtually every article about him. Of course, Wilson suffered from mental illness and became a ""perfect pop"" god, while the relatively sane Folds has slipped a bit out of critical favor lately. Blink of a Nihilist's high-gloss mania doesn't quite put Camplight in a league with either of them just yet.","Philadelphia-based twentysomething songwriter Brian Christinzio aims for Brian Wilson's childlike innocence and Ben Folds' shit-talking realism but winds up peddling the rote quirkiness of a big-budget Wes Anderson knockoff.

Juices!,The Cansecos,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3f99d034d5c69bf4dba/1:1/w_160/f1334329.jpg,2008-01-17 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11024-juices/,Upper Class,"With the Mitchell Report still warm and baseball players busy explaining that, no, what they actually took was B-12, there's probably never been a better time for a band called the Cansecos to release an album called Juices! (exclamation point theirs). The Cansecos, oddly enough, are a duo hailing from Toronto, the only Canadian city that still has a Major League Baseball franchise, and they know exactly what they're doing, playing off their name and the title of Jose Canseco's steroid memoir (they even released a couple of lengthy remixes under the title Juiced! to pave the way for the LP). It makes for amusing background noise as you take in their second full-length, highlighting the light touch the duo often brings to its analog synth-heavy electro-pop. The first time I listened to Juices!, I was disappointed-- it seemed like a letdown from their fantastic self-titled debut (2003). And in some ways it is a letdown, lacking much of the immediate appeal and memorability of its predecessor, but what it loses from the debut it mostly makes up for with interesting textures, complex beats, and slow-growing tunes that get to you on subsequent listens. Bill Halliday and Gareth Jones seem to have focused less on making a pop record and more on something you can just groove to whenever you feel like it. A good example is ""Raised By Wolves"", a song built around a scant handful of lyrics, most of which consist of the heavily processed vocals singing the line, ""I was raised by wolves."" The repetitive vocal is given a world of constantly shifting electronic soundscapes and modern r&b beats to roam through, and the result is hugely entertaining. The duo's more traditional vocals still have the same deadpan quality as on the debut, but they've gotten much deeper into manipulating the sound of their own voices, breaking out the vocoders and computers to create a range of different tweaked tones. ""Rise Up"" barely even has a verse melody-- the verse is more of an ethereal haze of voice and whirring, buzz-toned synth driven ahead by a jumpy bass line-but the chorus rises up from the ether to deliver the album's most anthemic moment, as the beat crystallizes into a shiny disco pulse. ""Nothing New to You"" has a sneaky hook sung by electric aliens, ""Clear Blue Sky"" mixes a crisp beat with dreamy, soft tones, and ""Lunar Landing"" sports a frenetic, clicking rhythm track that palpitates under a chord progression that takes its sweet time. Juices! is a different kind of Cansecos album, and though it will likely appeal to fans of their debut, those listeners shouldn't come expecting another ""This Small Disaster"" or ""Are You Lonesome Tonight?"", because that type of song isn't here. What you do get is an enjoyable album of electronic pop that reveals itself slowly, revering the beat and texture of the music above all else but still allowing the hooks to peak through.","Steroid puns intended, this Toronto band's second full-length is a less immediate approach to its analog synth-heavy electro-pop.

"Disco Not Disco: Post Punk, Electro & Leftfield Disco Classics 1974-1986",Various Artists,by: Andy Battaglia,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b41b5e6ef95969322573/1:1/w_160/9e8bd90d.jpg,2008-01-17 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11055-disco-not-disco-post-punk-electro-leftfield-disco-classics-1974-1986/,Strut,"What happens when the undisclosed past gets overwhelmed by the open-source present? Should we cheer or mourn? Is there a word, maybe in German, that accounts for both? When it came out in 2000, the first Disco Not Disco compilation begged no such questions. Other surveys had already started to recognize an alternative history of disco, but Disco Not Disco was the collection that made the pursuit into a movement. Part of that owed to timing: However much talk of old weird disco affected the weather in 2000, it would be another year or two before young upstarts turned that weather into a certifiable front. And it's worth remembering, now well into an age when fixation on genre plays as a vestige of an unenlightened past, just how new the notion of historical ""disco"" that was also ""not disco"" proved just a few years ago. The original impulse behind Disco Not Disco was monumental, so much so that the formulation ""X not X"" has become part of music's critical vocabulary. But that same monumentality eats away at the new third volume of the series, which arrives on the other side of a revolution whose most important battles have already been fought and won. Tangling with obsolescence is a great problem to have for an enterprise charged with rescuing the obscure, but still: James White's ""Contort Yourself""? Delta 5's ""Mind Your Own Business""? These are not songs that lack for anthology affirmation at this point, and their inclusion here marks a conspicuous absence of energy and purpose for a series that made its name on both. That's not to argue against their greatness. Both songs are quite good, as are many of the other Post Punk, Electro & Leftfield Disco Classics included here. Vivien Goldman's ""Launderette"" leads off with the kind of walloping dub bass that played an integral role in post-punk's warming up to rhythm as a top-of-mind priority. Using that as a metric, Disco Not Disco 3 skews more directly toward post-punk than either of the previous two volumes; it's given more to bottom-up wanderings toward discretionary disco than to top-down digressions of disco itself. Shriekback charts the journey in a skulking track called ""My Spine Is the Bassline"", which would have made a good survey title if Disco Not Disco had not been in play. The ghostly horns intimated by Shriekback go on to tip the scales in Konk's ""Your Life"", which mixes tendrils of rocky rhythm guitar with flares of dancey brass. The tenor changes with Yellow Magic Orchestra's ""Seoul Music"", a magisterial mood-piece in which the seeds of LCD Soundsystem can be heard rustling in the dirt of a planet starting to grow more futuristic in the early 80s. From there, more overtly electronic sounds figure into tracks by Kazino, Liasons Dangereuses, and A Number of Names. The last one comes with a caveat, though: Hats off to any compilation that makes room for A Number of Names' ""Sharevari"", but still: an ""instrumental"" version? The song in its full form figured into the story of disco turning into techno in Detroit, but the voided version here-- like Disco Not Disco 3 itself-- plays a bit too much like a hedged bet.","The third volume in this storied series of leftfield disco appears a few years after-- rather than, like the first two volumes, a year or two on the other side of-- a revolution whose most important battles have already been fought and won.

"Tank Tapes / ""'Burgers"" b/w ""The Punjab""",Excepter,by: Mike Powell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3c8b1335d7bf169a646/1:1/w_160/bbfcc308.gif,2008-01-17 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11638-tank-tapes-burgers-bw-the-punjab/,Fuck It Tapes,"During a recent set by the Brooklyn improv band Excepter, a friend turned to me and said, ""Okay, I think I get it now. They're a really scary white dub band."" This was the first review I'd heard of Excepter that didn't include a perfunctory insult, a reference to a drug experience the writer had probably not had, or the invocation of high-level principles in mathematics. It was also the first that seemed primarily interested in how the band sounded. Then again, their impact is often extramusical; their records and performances disquieting on a conceptual level because they're as mystically alluring as they are alienating. The lyrics are a mash of personal discomfort (bad roommates, shitty jobs) and religious moaning; the musicians sound not only indifferent to each other, but to themselves (and, sometimes, to the whole project of ""music""). Unfortunately, that's a hard quality to sum in words, so die-hard fans usually sound even more full of shit than detractors accuse the band of being. They'll never be easily digestible, but they have been increasingly succinct and organized. Alternation, from 2006, actually had a chorus or two; 2007's cassette-only (but readily e-pirated) Tank Tapes and the recent ""'Burgers"" b/w ""The Punjab"" 12"" show what they do best without forcing listeners through the murk so imprecisely revered by devotees. Talking about Excepter as ""unbound"" or ""free"" is flattering, kind of-- but in light of their last several releases, it's also wrong. Frontman John Fell Ryan once described his persona as ""like Jim Morrison waiting for a bus."" Which is unequivocally funny-- a quality more obvious in their recent music than ever. But the delivery's always deadpan and dark. After seven minutes of ""'Burgers"", the half-assed funk drumming and woozy bell tones that at first sounded silly become disorienting and weird; Fell's mechanical back-and-forth with female chorus of Clare Amory and Lala Ryan about flipping burgers (""Flip those Burgers"" / ""Turn the patty over"") is as ambiguously humorous and depressing as it scans. ""The Punjab"" works an irresistible and surprisingly determined Pakistani-sounding house loop, dressed only in some hand drumming and a robot voice. The robot sounds confused and vaguely angry. This is their banality at its best: a stoner's nightmare of being stuck slaving at a fast-food restaurant (and sounds just as nauseating), and the half-fascinated, half-xenophobic surreality of wandering into a bodega in the ethnic neighborhood across town. Tank Tapes displays Excepter's more inarticulable qualities. It's not nearly as immediate as ""'Burgers"" or ""The Punjab"", but it's stranger, looser, more beautiful. Their greatest ambition, I think-- and I've said this before-- is to try to hint at music rather than actually play it. True, self-aware incoherence is still incoherence, and Excepter's missteps are legitimately embarrassing. The gray area between is what's exciting-- the half-formed tracks of funk, ethno-bounce, reggae, and rudimentary techno; the moans, the Ouija that finally yields spirits, the hokum that starts to make sense. ""A really scary white dub band,"" true, but the scary-- and thrilling-- thing about Excepter's music is that dubs are an erasure of an original and Excepter, at their best, sound only half-there to begin with, no more, no less.","A cassette-only album and a 12"" single on Paw Tracks capture the band's most flattering tendencies without forcing listeners through the murk so imprecisely revered by devotees.

The Leak EP,Lil Wayne,by: Tom Breihan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b40cb1335d7bf169a6bb/1:1/w_160/35110027.jpg,2008-01-17 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11042-the-leak-ep/,InterscopeCash Money,"Lil Wayne is a tease. Even though he's spent the past couple of years flooding the market with mixtapes, he hasn't released a proper solo album since Tha Carter 2 in 2005. Tha Carter 3, his long-awaited follow-up, should've arrived months ago, but Wayne keeps pushing it back. He says he's keeping demand up by making us wait, while message-board gadflies speculate that he just isn't cut out to make a classic full-length album. Late in 2007, he said that he'd end the year with a compilation album called The Leak, clearing away all the best tracks that have trickled past the lax security at Cash Money's offices in preparation for the real thing. But The Leak never came; instead, we got a new solo album from Birdman, Wayne's shitty half-rapping father figure. And then, on Christmas, a new Lil Wayne EP hit online stores like iTunes and Amazon with zero fanfare, without even Wayne's face on the cover. The Leak EP is a meager offering: five songs, ranging in quality from absolute bangers to intriguing sketches, which tell us little about how The Carter 3 might eventually sound. One of the common critical complaints against Wayne is that he can rap but that he doesn't know how to make songs. His weeded-out free-associative signature doesn't need to conform to old ideas about song structure to do its work; on last year's double-mixtape bonanza Da Drought 3, he mostly just followed his muse over every half-decent recent beat he could find, letting the overblown boasts and batshit similes flow freely. He'd sacrifice none of his demonic magnetism if he just kept rapping at that level forever. But by the end of the year, he appeared to be losing steam; on the November mixtape The Drought Is Over, he busied himself playing around obnoxiously with T-Pain's autotuner effects, and the actual rapping was, by Wayne's high standards, exhausted and uninspired. So it's oddly reassuring to hear Wayne deign to finish a few actual songs, complete with verses and choruses and intros and everything. And even if every song on The Leak finds Wayne sticking to his usual talking points, finding even more clever and circuitous ways to let us know how fly he is, his voice has more urgency and determination than he's shown in recent months. And even at his laziest, he's still riveting. But first the great. Opener ""I'm Me"" starts with tinkling ominous piano and stray vocal samples from past Wayne hits (""Go DJ"", ""Fireman""). And when the titanically jittery drums kick in, the string of possessed one-liners that follows puts the song in the same league as those older ones. Some are perfectly succinct and elegantly constructed: ""I know the game is crazy, it's more crazy than it's ever been/ I'm married to that crazy bitch, call me Kevin Federline."" Some are borderline nonsensical: ""I'm a monster, I tell you, monster Wayne/ I have just swallowed the key to the house of pain."" But throughout, there's a strident sense of purpose in his gurgling croak of a voice, like he finally has something at stake. And the third track, ""Gossip"", brings that purpose into focus. The first time anyone heard it was when he did a fiery rendition of it at the BET Hip Hop Awards a few months ago, and it's rumored to be the response to 50 Cent's recent string of underhanded jabs against Wayne. Over the track's huge, epic chopped-up soul and heart-monitor beeps, Wayne sounds genuinely heated: ""Stop analyzing, criticizing/ You should realize what I am and start epitomizing."" The next three tracks never bring back that sense of breathless urgency, but all of them would've made for perfectly acceptable album-tracks on Tha Carter 2. ""Kush"" is a happy, stoned little dip into Wayne's immense supply of weed-based punchlines. ""Love Me or Hate Me"" starts Wayne breathing his nonsense over epic swelling strings, no drums in sight. When it kicks in, he brings a guttural sung chorus that works as a distant cousin to his immortal hook on Playaz Circle's ""Duffle Bag Boy"", but his boasts never cohere into anything concrete. And on ""Talkin' About It"", he brings an evilly assured singsong flow over a heavy organic bounce track. But those last three tracks are just practice. Or maybe they're victory laps after the apocalyptic openers. Either way, The Leak is an encouraging sign that Wayne's managed to keep himself sharp even after all the material he's already churned out in recent months. Now it's time for him to make good on its promise.","This EP-- ranging in quality from absolute bangers to intriguing sketches-- hit online stores like iTunes and Amazon on Christmas Day with zero fanfare, and it seems to tell us little about how Weezy's forthcoming Tha Carter 3 might eventually sound

First Steps Into...,Blue States,by: David Raposa,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3dd5e6ef95969322514/1:1/w_160/5715c757.jpg,2008-01-16 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10997-first-steps-into/,Memphis Industries,"There might me more than a little cheek behind Andy Dragazis' decision to title his group's fourth album First Steps Into..., as well as choosing to reuse the rounded sci-fi font from Blue States' debut, 1998's Nothing Changes Under the Sun. That album, featuring Dragazis as essentially a one-man band, was a gorgeous conglomeration of downtempo, cinematic instrumentals that melded the sumptuous swoon of Air's orchestral works with the film-noir sensibilities of trip-hop's finest proponents. The following two albums expanded on this template: 2002's Man Mountain (featuring future New Young Pony Club vocalist Tahita Bulmer making like Sarah McLachlan) was a more expansive and lush effort, while The Soundings found Dragazis and friends (with Bulmer replaced by a guy who sounds like an Oasis cover-band frontman) in an less-than-inspired UK indie mood. (If you're at all curious, Blue States' official site features a media player on its front page containing more than 25 tracks from all Blue States albums.) On the latest Blue States album, Dragazis is back where he started, going it alone (with a little help from a friendly drummer) and returning to a more instrumental state of mind. Unfortunately, whatever inspired Dragazis the first time around is nowhere to be found on this supposed return trip. Even at its most grating-- and there's not much more grating than making mid-tempo rock moves like Creation Records mogul Alan McGee is in the audience with a signing bonus and some free coke-- Blue States' music possessed an invigorating sense of grandeur and scope. On First Steps Into..., this larger-than-life aura is replaced by a stilting claustrophobic pallor. Most of the tracks sound like would-be 10-minute instrumental epics-- think Godspeed! You Black Emperor going Hollywood-- crammed into three-minute frames. As a result, the songs misfire on all cylinders. Opener ""Allies"" is sabotaged by an arrangement that seems to be written for real instruments, but ends up essayed by tinny replicas. Being fronted by a sampled and distorted voice (either Dragazis himself, or one of his exes) only adds to the mess. These voices pop up every so often, subsumed by a mass of misplaced music. The one time they do take center stage, it's on ""Down The Days""-- while Dragazis' voice seems as well and fine as can be expected through all the filters and chicanery, the woman's vocal track is seemingly sped up to Chipmunk-like speed, making an already-chirpy clatter that much more obnoxious. If the songs aren't drowning in sour sounds, then they're fronting on some tepid funk front (""First Steps...Last Stand""), or they're going for the unearned climactic string-swell thirty seconds in (""Holding Ground""), or they're mired in a mid-tempo morass (""Gaining Time""), or they're changing plans of attack mid-stream without any kind of reason. The worst offender on that final front is ""The Electric Complement"", which starts off with one of those premature climaxes, continues to build to a portentous crescendo, then for no apparent reason stops and becomes a shiny happy hand-clappy tune for the final 60 seconds. These descriptions might make First Steps Into... out to be some sort of ramshackle chaotic mish-mash-- if only. This album sounds like the work of Blue States past ground together into an indistinguishable and interminable mud. Only at the end of the album, with ""Last Of Old England"", does a successful synthesis emerge. Those looking for a more enjoyable attempt at a taking-stock exercise are urged to visit the band's site and give a listen to the media player I mentioned at the start of the review-- even those would-be champagne supernovas don't sound half bad in this context.","After making a lush folksy record with a pre-New Young Pony Club Tahita Bulmer and a rote UK indie record with a guy who sounds like an Oasis cover-band frontman, Andy Dragazis returns to the sound of his debut: A conglomeration of downtempo, cinematic instrumentals.

Ecstatic Eyes Glow Glossy,Mass Shivers,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3e2b1335d7bf169a671/1:1/w_160/39e07d8c.jpg,2008-01-16 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11004-ecstatic-eyes-glow-glossy/,Sick Room,"Two albums into their career, the Mass Shivers sound like a band that's either on the brink of an innovative discovery or haplessly toiling over a Sisyphean task. Ecstatic Eyes Glow Glossy, the Chicago group's second album, takes an ambitious stab at grafting a sweaty classic rock libido onto Krautrock rhythms-- rhythms that inherently kill the mood with their cold uniformity. The Shivers' 2005 debut established them as artists first, musicians second, though the album owed much of its cerebral post-punk to contemporaries like Q and Not U and 31 Knots. On Ecstatic, the Shivers attempt to expand their minds with a heavy dose of psychedelic rock-- the most common ground between their mathematical tendencies and new-found classic rock virility. Opening track ""Womanizing Metal Studs"" serves as a telling introduction, featuring a hefty blues riff that repeatedly straightens out into a drone as a motorik beat pulses underneath. Singer Brett Sova lets out several husky growls full of a whole lotta love, but rather than arriving at an ejaculatory chorus, they succumb with the guitar riff to the song's sturdy rhythmic backbone. The clash between Sova's animated vocals and the band's sober instrumentation rages on throughout most of Ecstatic. Although occasionally his gruff exclamations play off the band's mechanical precision, like on frenetic highlight ""Mossy Nethers"", Sova can also sound oddly out of synch with his backing music. On closer ""Wild Animals Club"", he spouts off hammed-up non sequiturs echoed by equally affected backing vocals, while on ""Downwind of Amour"" his melody mostly lags behind the much more interesting guitar part its mimicking. Ironically, the vocals shine brightest here when the spotlight's dimmed. Rather than shoving them into the foreground, ""Pacific Ash"" and ""Because the Sun"" allow their layered vocal parts to dissolve into the druggy haze of guitar drones and feedback, and noise collage ""Quinine Peninsula Pt. 2"" dives head-first into an acid trip, uninterrupted by coherent lyrics or macho croons. Ecstatic's brief duration is unfortunate considering its best tracks benefit from repetition and loose song structures. For all the sub-three-minute songs, there's a scarcity of snappy ideas here, making Sova's more dramatic vocal parts sound pretty forced without the aid of syncopation or hooks. Despite the eccentric nods to Captain Beefheart and Frank Zappa, the Shivers don't quite possess enough oddball charisma, and their freakouts sound much more comfortable over meticulous beats and prolonged jams anyways. Ecstatic is a commendable effort at trying to spice up the stoic elements of krautrock; it just doesn't seem to play to the Shivers' collective strengths.","The band's 2005 debut owed much of its cerebral post-punk to contemporaries like Q and Not U and 31 Knots; here, they attempt to expand their minds with a heavy dose of psychedelic rock.

Run From Safety,Octoberman,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3e8b1335d7bf169a67e/1:1/w_160/00cd1d08.jpg,2008-01-16 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11010-run-from-safety/,White Whale,"There are an infinite number of sounds. There's a virtually endless selection of words. There's an impossible to quantify number of ways in which the two can be combined. Yet most songwriters work with a relatively finite musical lexicon, so it's amazing the breadth and variety of songs they've come up with, crafted almost entirely from the familiar. Needless to say, there's something quite familiar about nearly everything on Vancouver-based Octoberman's second album Run From Safety, from the general-- the mournful sound of the lonesome trumpet, the rough buzz of the harmonica, the hum of an organ, the thrill of the rapidly strummed electric guitar, Marc Morrissette's affected, artificially wizened, and world-weary vocals-- to the specific (insert indie-rock mainstay here). Against all odds, however, the disc adds up to more than the sum of its relatively unadventurous indie-rock (North) Americana parts. You've heard it all before, but the disc feels right just the way it is. Indeed, the upside of Morrissette's combo of the conventional and the ambitious is that you're not always sure where each song is going even within such a relatively tried and true framework. Run From Safety also finds Morrissette stretching out from Octoberman's previous These Trails Are Old and New, finding room for many of the quirks that buoyed his previous band Kids These Days. ""By the Wayside"" begins a syncopated dirge, suddenly shifts into a spare blues pulse, then ends on a manic rock note. ""Once in a Blue"" features a similarly loopy arrangement, too edgy, agitated, and weird to count as folk, even if that's largely where Morrissette is coming from. The lovely ""Chasing Ambulances"" and the album's title track find Octoberman firmly in earnest Bright Eyes-land, the latter building in power despite its simplicity, culminating in an appropriately majestic organ fadeout. There are further pleasant surprises to be had in the woozy ballad ""Elbow Room"", whose twisting guitar and horn melodies perfectly complement Morrissette's down-to-earth vocal anchor. ""Breath of Sunshine"" and ""Impossible Way"" recall Calexico's wide open spaces balladry, but just when you think the album's taken a turn toward the campfire, the quirks return in force with the proggy twang of ""Cisco Kid"". ""Shit Just Falls Apart"" could be Stephen Malkmus at his loosest. But again, those similarities to likeminded peers and other inspirations rarely come off nearly as distracting as they could have. They're charming as much as anything else, giving the album a welcome well-worn quality, like an old wool sweater you pull right on to ward off a cold day, even though it itches around the collar and smells a little musty. Even better, there's a promising hint of greatness simmering beneath Morrissette's more modest surface. So if the sleeper Run From Safety isn't exactly must-hear, there's a sneaking sense that Morrissette may find a way to connect to a wider audience soon enough.","The second album from Vancouver's Octoberman finds Marc Morrissette stretching out a bit, if not quite to parts unknown then certainly to parts worth a few listens.

Four Songs by Arthur Russell,Various Artists,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b418b1335d7bf169a6cd/1:1/w_160/78d25118.jpg,2008-01-16 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11053-four-songs-by-arthur-russell/,Rough Trade,"Arthur Russell died of AIDS in 1992, but his legacy feels excitingly like a living, breathing thing. The Iowa-born producer and composer's music has enjoyed a much-deserved renaissance in recent years, helped by a handful of reissues and compilations. The closest to comprehensive was Soul Jazz's The World of Arthur Russell in 2004, though as Andy Beta noted in his Pitchfork review, the disc's title was basically a typo. Classically trained on cello, a student of North Indian music while living at a Buddhist commune, Russell may be best known for making eccentric, oceanic downtown disco singles in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but his incomparable discography reveals a man of many ""worlds"": Minimalist avant-garde composer, sensitive, low-key tunesmith, and androgynous, almost submarine vocalist. Russell's excursions into rock (with David Byrne and, as the Flying Hearts, with a former member of the Modern Lovers) and even hip-hop (with Vin Diesel) further block attempts at tidy career synopsis. A bunch of cover versions last year shed new light on Russell's legacy, as seen through the eyes of a younger generation of admirers. A bittersweet, intimately jangling rendition of 2004 unreleased-song compilation Calling Out of Context's ""You Can Make Me Feel Bad"" appeared on New Zealand-based Shocking Pinks' self-titled DFA debut, and former Everything But the Girl singer Tracey Thorn got saxophone help from the Rapture's Gabe Andruzzi for a slinky, squawking reading of the same compilation's ""Get Around to It"" (on her Ewan Pearson-produced solo album, Out of the Woods). Most striking of all was a video by La Blogotheque showing Swedish crooner and collage-maker Jens Lekman singing ""A Little Lost""-- originally from 1994 Russell posthumous release Another Thought-- accompanying himself only on kalimba, or thumb piano. The clip eventually appeared as one of Pitchfork's ""Top 50 Music Videos of 2007"". Lekman's loving rendition didn't just set a high bar for his then-forthcoming master stroke, Night Falls Over Kortedala; it also paved the way for a Lekman-compiled Russell covers EP, Four Songs by Arthur Russell. As its title suggests, Four Songs puts the focus on Russell in his world as a songwriter. Russell was notorious for never finishing anything, so it's no surprise his raw yet unmistakable tunes and lyrics could benefit from new arrangements and production styles. While Four Songs lacks a bit of the experimental spirit found across Russell's work, for that same reason it should serve as an excellent introduction to new Russell initiates, some of whom might've been initially turned off by the alien tone koans of 1986's spellbinding World of Echo or the dated drum programming and synths of much of Calling Out of Context. What's left are-- damn you, Lekman-- four songs, each a transcendent expression of shared humanity, each hauntingly performed by four distinctive present-day artists. A certain minimalism befitting Russell the composer is the defining attribute of the EP, right down to its brief running time; Lekman has called full-length tribute albums ""boring"". First, Verity Susman of sadly now-defunct Brighton, England band Electrelane steals the show under her Vera November pseudonym. She turns in a seven-minute version of ""Our Last Night Together"", originally a solo cello-and-voice fragment from the sessions for 1986's World of Echo that was included as a bonus track on that album's 2004 reissue. Susman's flitting, double-tracked vocals give the melancholy lyrics an emotional reality only heightened by her bare, evocative piano playing (Lekman name-checks Satie). The Concretes' former lead singer, Victoria Bergsman, in her current Taken By Trees guise, strips the upbeat post-disco of Calling Out of Context's ""Make 1, 2"" down to shambling acoustic guitar and a sighing clarinet, an approach predicting the Pink Moon-like starkness of her unjustly overlooked Taken By Trees debut, Open Field. ""Someone tried to call me up, but I don't even have a phone,"" she laments, wrapping herself in loneliness the way some women wear furs. Joel Gibb of acerbic Canadian indie-poppers the Hidden Cameras offers the EP's lushest, most optimistic moment, strumming Calling Out of Context highlight ""That's Us / Wild Combination"" on acoustic guitar, accompanied on backing vocals by El Perro Del Mar's Sarah Assbring and on piano by Lekman. Stripped of the original duet's echolalia and tinny beats, Gibb's earnest-sounding voice makes what's most fundamental about the song-- the glowing, jello-brained joy of ""this, our love to see/ by its own light""-- shine through. You know it would sound great with some cello, though. Lekman gives us his kalimba version of Russell's immaculate love song ""A Little Lost"", and it's nearly as affecting here as in the video. Most remarkable is the way Lekman manages to get the kalimba to roll in, like the waves of the lyrics, helped by some overdubs and reversed effects. Like Morrissey and Stephin Merritt, to whom he's often aptly compared, Lekman is a crooner in basically the indie context, sometimes missing the unassailable vocal grain of old-time crooners like Sinatra and Bing Crosby; still, his voice has rarely sounded better than it does here, pleasant Swedish accent and all. ""It's so unfinished,"" Russell sang in the original ""A Little Lost"", atop amplified cello and just the simplest of guitar strums. ""It's all so unfinished,"" Lekman sings now. In contrast to the ossified historical status of so many classic- and even punk-rock icons, set in stone for perpetuity by received media narratives and museums like the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Russell is a music legend whom most listeners still must discover for themselves-- a quasi-mythical figure whose significance his fans, musicians and non-musicians alike, are still helping to define. With a documentary about Russell's life set to premiere early next month at the Berlin International Film Festival, the process may only be beginning.","This Jens Lekman-compiled covers EP highlights the songwriting talents of the multi-faceted, late Arthur Russell.

Sound of Light EP,The Field,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b416c0084474cd0c2218/1:1/w_160/f577ae71.jpg,2008-01-16 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11051-sound-of-light-ep/,iTunes,"It'll set you back at least $150 to spend a night in Stockholm's Nordic Light Hotel, where, according to its website, the core design element is ""the light, and the inspiration is the northern lights."" Thriftier travelers might prefer the virtual tour-- for a mere four bucks, you can experience Nordic Light via Axel Willner's musical interpretation of his stay there, commissioned by the hotel and released via iTunes. Willner was a savvy choice for this project, as his minimal techno can evoke a broad array of natural incandescence while complementing the sterilized, hermetic ambiance for which upscale hotels strive. Fans of last year's transcendent From Here We Go Sublime will happily find more of the same here, and if Sound of Light is somewhat less satisfying, it's a matter of structure, not technique. As on Sublime, microscopic samples orbit each other in taut ellipses, making for music that's both kinetic and inert-- in the typical Field composition, gracefully synchronized mechanisms go through fluid motions without actually progressing. But Willner's greatest asset is his ability to realize one perfect idea per song, and to let it go precisely in the narrow range between making its point and wearing out its welcome. While Sublime's ""The Deal"" stretched out over 10 minutes, most of its tracks clocked in at a handy five or six. The four 15-minute tracks on Sound of Light present a special challenge for someone whose strength is white-hot brevity-- how to keep one perfect idea rolling for a quarter-hour? Instead of taking a more varied or narrative approach to composition, Willner chose to simply protract the static pulses that filled out Sublime, trusting his listeners to dig in their heels with him. It's a ballsy gambit that makes Sound of Light seem imposing and uncompromising, but occasionally stretches its ideas a bit thin. Nevertheless, there is a deep pleasure in following Willner past the point-making break and entering realms of pure hypnosis, and the album's conceit-- each composition meaningfully connects with a particular time of day-- is an extra breath of wind in its sails. The stutter-step of ""Morning"" is instantly familiar, with a toe-stubbing groove remindful of ""Over the Ice"" and dual-octave jackhammer synths à la ""A Paw in My Face"". Willner punches in little frequency quivers to imbue the relentless throb with a touch of hesitancy, before a choir of quivering ""ahs"" kicks in like an epiphany. From there it's simply a matter of reiteration and subtle ramification as the wave rolls on and on, even as a reversed rhythm track sucks backwards against its tide. There's something very caffeinated about the track; it conveys a distinct sense of Willner planning his day over coffee, with morning-bright clarity of purpose. In ""Day"", the sense of boundless optimism that enveloped ""Morning"" gives way to one of grinding monotony and hectic activity-- a feeling that anyone who's prone to making big plans upon waking, only to see them vanish into tedious routine, knows well. ""Day"" displays an emphasis on minutely graded progression uncommon to Field songs: Opening with a one-note synth lockstep and a two-note bassline, then sieving in extra hi-hat hisses, syncopated rimshots, and 16th-note synth flurries, it's like watching a juggler gradually adding more pins to his toss. But the climax of incantatory near-vocal figures arrives about when it would in a short Field composition-- a few minutes in-- and we're left with an exceptionally long final act that, while accomplished, can be enervating. ""Evening"" is a conceptual relief after ""Day"", palpably venting steam and currying a coolly engaged getting-ready-to-go-out vibe. Airy coos capped with hi-hat ticks pant amid more naturalistic vocal snippets, as tones both pinging and staticky swirl, eventually breaking into a soulful lope shot through with chattering comb-swept synths. And ""Night"" finds Willner venturing outside of his safety zone-- those ubiquitous pressurized cadences-- for a nearly beatless descent into dream, tiny vocal tremors and hi-hats flitting about the periphery. Sound of Light isn't a proper follow-up to Sublime, nor is it meant to be, and despite the album's minor drawbacks, it's to Willner's credit that his one-off project is as bold and euphoric as many musicians' canonical efforts.

Silver Storms,The A-Sides,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3e913d197565213aa08/1:1/w_160/87978c90.jpg,2008-01-15 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11011-silver-storms/,Vagrant,"The hook on ""Cinematic"" might be the strongest one on Silver Storms, and also one of the most lyrically problematic. To wit: ""Say something cinematic/ Or become a tragic figure/ Who never, never, never says nothing to remember."" It could very well be indicative of a ""go hard or go home"" ethos the A-Sides took into making their Vagrant debut. But taken in context, it's one of the moments that make too many assumptions based on ""epic"" signifiers. For bands like this, Explosions In the Sky have become a sworn enemy. Though films may have once leaned on the sort of fey and fussy orch-pop this Philly outfit traffics in here, why deal with the middlemen of tepid melodies and iffy lyrics when those twinkly, heart-tugging guitar peals will do just fine on their own? Silver Storms is the latest in a recurring recent phenomenon amongst landlocked American bands coming up on boutique-style labels; though preferable to the literary aspirations of White Whale or the hysterical Jeff Buckley corpse-fucking of As Tall as Lions, Silver Storms practices in a similar all-cart no-horses, vaguely UK-circa-2000 sonic sense, asking producer Brian McTear (Mazarin, Matt Pond PA) to super-size it every time without seeing if they have the stomachs. In politics, they call it ""throwing money at the problem."" After a short intro of canned strings, the phased guitars on ""Always In Trouble"" sparkle and fade like a Windows screensaver while the drums get a stately treatment of reverb, and it's all simultaneously pleasant and moderately ambitious like a Doves deep cut. It's also the most egregious example of what's wrong here: six minutes of a plateaued melody that hardly deserves three. If I wasn't looking at a hard copy of this record, I'd swear that Silver Storms was sequenced backwards; the first half is filled with deceptively long-winded snoozers (have they forgotten what their name means?) that tack on codas that don't feel so much unnatural as they do unearned or unnecessary. Ironically, side B contains the more instantly appealing moments, like the soaring chorus of ""Great American Novelist"". While never really being full-on genre experiments, Silver Storms is more relatively successful when the A-Sides diverge from their standard indulgences, as with the sock hop strum of ""A Florida Grove"" and the c&w leanings of ""My Heroes Have Always Been Crazy"". And yet, the golden slide-guitar outro rings far more true than the lyrical thrust. Singer Jon Barthmus wonders where he fits into a lineage of unnamed, self-destructive idols, but coming from someone who prefers to sound like he idolizes the Stills, it's akin to that ""Back Door Man""-to-""Back That Azz Up"" speech in Hustle & Flow-- certainly heartfelt but also patently ridiculous when you consider its source.","Second album from Philly-based guitar-pop band with orchestral inclinations is their first for Vagrant.

Hi-Teknology 3: Underground,Hi-Tek,by: Evan McGarvey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3f0ea9e61561daa6b90/1:1/w_160/8bb4fd4d.jpg,2008-01-15 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11016-hi-teknology-3-underground/,Babygrande,"It's a thermal world we live in. Nobody in hip-hop feels it more than the producers. Take the Hitmen. One year they're the in-house beat welders for the most ambitious, successful double album in rap history for the biggest rap star in the world (Life After Death). He dies. And then for ten years they toil on mostly frigid, third-tier, in-house projects, until the dead artist's biggest fan and emulator (currently the most famous rapper alive) tapped them out of their cottaged obscurity to compose the lion's share of his ""nostalgia"" album (American Gangster). These are the cycles of sonic fashion. It's fleeting, the overcooked, McDonald's-hot moment at the top (for his own sake, Lil Jon should start compiling scrap books from 2004). Alluring, too. Some never make it back: Scott Storch traded in his hard-earned conscious sheepskins (as a long time Roots affiliate) for a burped-up Miami estate, a few neon Aston Martins, and the chance to work with Hulk Hogan's progeny. Hi-Tek can't evaporate because he'll never boil. Having composed entire albums for Talib Kweli (2000's Reflection Eternal, a zenith for knit-cap hip-hop and literate boom-bap librarians), and chunks of ones for 50 Cent, Tek's not just assimilated a range of drums tones (from brushed tender to crashing digital hordes) and samples and song structures, he's the rare producer who can make liminal tracks; rarely will you ever hear a discrete ""club banger,"" ""street anthem,"" or ""for the ladies."" His best songs are fence-sitters, ones where one instrument is in direct emotional opposition to a track-mate. It's that blending that's made the Hi-Teknology series so consistent, refreshing and inclusive over three entries. Proof lies in the list of collaborators. 2001's Hi-Teknology was a sweet, Okayplayer field day, featuring a not-yet-Muslim, not-yet-borderline Mos Def, a confident, playful Talib Kweli, and (gasp!) a hit single (""Round & Round"") that made it onto the How High soundtrack (double gasp!). 2006's The Chip, for my money the series standout, took the blinders off. The Game, Devin The Dude, Nas, J Dilla, Jadakiss, and Ghostface all emoted under 'Tek's always on-point choices of strings, vocals, and his secret weapon: tender woodwinds. Yet Hi-Teknology 3, released in late December 2007, is filled with too many concessions, too much adipose, and too much sonic (and career) charity. Hi-Tek has brought a handful of regional artists (mostly from his native Ohio) to the relative big time and nary a one of them seems worth the plane fare. His impulses to be inclusive and helpful have sold him out. Oh, there's a song from Ghostface and Raekwon, ""My Piano"", and it's routinely fine with their Iceberg Slim narrative/Ginsberg wordplay: ""Brothers with swords/ Suede fronts, spray pumps, lobbies."" But beyond that, the bulk of the album and the especially doughy middle is a bland, flat training ground. Not a voice cuts loose or leans into the emotional matches of the melodies. Only Atlanta native Rem Dog on ""I'm Back"" has any developed sense of assonance or voice, something Cross, Showtime, Push Montana, and Lep. Count can't summon on their respective turns. Wading through the Hi-Teknology 3 desert ends in frustration too: the album's back end is actually good. As prescriptively good as a four song sequence can get. He revisits successful habits, planting Jonell (from the first Hi-Tek's ""Round & Round"") on first-class backpack romance, glockenspiels and swaddling guitars nesting around her whispers. Little Brother and Talib Kweli rap with home field advantage. ""Come Get It"" is a sleek instrumental antechamber. It's a dangerous game Hi-Tek is playing. Because the album's failures can be blamed on others, and because he's got a laudable excuse (Tryin' to save the game! The young'uns!) and because he's got enough innate production talent, 'Tek can swap in ""well-intentioned"" where the word ""tepid"" should go.","Third album in the producer's series is heavier on lesser-known rap talent from his native Ohio, though it also features Ghostface, Raekwon, Talib Kweli, and Young Buck.

Ancestral Swamp,Michael Hurley,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3feea9e61561daa6ba8/1:1/w_160/f9515193.jpg,2008-01-15 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11028-ancestral-swamp/,Gnomonsong,"In the liner notes to Ancestral Swamp, Michael Hurley's 20th full-length in more than 40 years, there's a photograph of the musician holding a cartoon mask-- green papier-mâché skin, red-yellow eyes, long trumpet snout, topped with a floppy beret-- to obscure his face and shocks of white hair. He's not hiding, necessarily, just changing form. While never quite as committed to anonymity as, say, Jandek, Hurley certainly cultivates a playful elusiveness, with a history that traces through a decades-long solo career and projects like Have Moicy to his early days as a Greenwich Village folkie. His unforthcoming demeanor gives his rustic folk music a certain rugged charm and his career rootlessness a certain romance. Known for bouncing pinball-like from one label to another, he finds a home, perhaps only briefly, on Devendra Banhart and Andy Cabic's Gnomonsong label for Ancestral Swamp, a collection of new and old tunes that all feature Hurley's backporch bluster and homey picking and fiddling. The album is a portrait of the artist as an old coot. Backed by long-time collaborators Dave Reisch and Lewi Longmire and relative newcomer Tara Jane O'Neil, Hurley has a high time playing up the gristle in his voice and the eccentric opacity of his lyrics. On opener ""Knockando"", he bends his lines upward until he's warbling in the attic of his register about serving up ""a glass of no-can-do,"" the junkyard logic of the words making complete sense even as the subtle and, yes, sophisticated music contradicts them. He certainly can do. Hurley harmonizes sweetly with O'Neil on ""El Dorado"" (based on an Edgar Allen Poe poem) and stand-out ""Light Green Fellow"", a gentle ode to nonconformity which was reportedly recorded without him knowing. These songs have the air of being tossed off-- things not created, but rooted out of the dirt. Even the album title, according to Hurley's blog (yes, he does have a blog), is a reference to the well of historic folk ditties from which he draws his inspiration. But make no mistake: Although it's difficult to think of the staccato guitar plucks on ""Streets of Laredo"" or the hounddog howls on ""1st Precinct Blues"" as anything other than musical serendipity, these are exceptionally crafted and thought-out tunes, the work of a master of the spontaneous and the shambolic. On the other hand, Hurley's devil-may-care approach means that for all its eccentric appeal, Ancestral Swamp rambles considerably, loses focus often, and ultimately feels pretty long-winded. Even so, it's hard not to discount these particular faults as part of the performer's charm. He may be folk's Boo Radley, but Hurley is also the sage of mountain: He'll tell you the secret of life, but you'll be puzzling over it for the rest of your days.","The elusive folk legend finds a home (at least temporarily) on Devendra Banhart and Andy Cabic's Gnomonsong label, offering here a collection of new and old tunes that all feature Hurley's backporch bluster and homey picking and fiddling.

Sea From Shore,School of Language,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b404c0084474cd0c21fc/1:1/w_160/63c8d491.jpg,2008-01-15 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11034-sea-from-shore/,Thrill Jockey,"Field Music's Tones of Town was a highlight of 2007, and the group's star seemed to be on the rise. But when the Sunderland, England band played the Empty Bottle in Chicago last spring, something didn't quite seem right. The music-- a herky-jerk mix reminiscent of XTC-- sounded perfectly fine, but the trio, flitting between instruments, didn't appear to be taking any real pleasure or satisfaction from it. At one point David Brewis even announced, apologetically, that the only way to get the ""real"" Field Music experience was via its meticulously composed recordings. Granted, the group preceded the tour by announcing it would be followed by an extended hiatus, during which Field Music's three members would explore other projects, so as far as the crowd (clearly enjoying what Brewis considered somehow substandard) knew, Tones of Town was the last they'd hear from Field Music. The faithful needn't fret, though, as Brewis' debut as School of Language, Sea From Shore (""a Field Music production,"" apparently; out on Feb. 5) should satisfy fans of Field Music's tightly wound pop. Recorded mostly solo, with some scattered help from a couple of fellow Sunderlanders in the Futureheads, Sea From Shore is a lot like taking a peek at a talented someone's sketch book. The disc begins with the intriguingly titled ""Rockist Part 1"" and ""Rockist Part 2"" (parts 3 and 4 bookend the disc), though neither overtly relates to any sort of loaded ""rockist"" (or anti-rockist) ideology. ""Part 1"" is built around a stereo loop of what sounds like Brewis enunciating a series of vowels, on top of which Brewis layers buoyant bass, simple drums and a charming little guitar pattern that both bolsters and plays against his wistful vocal melody. ""Part 2"" works almost like a dramatically discordant deconstruction of ""Part 1"". ""Disappointment '99"" features Futurehead David Craig on vocals, and were the track not so willfully dirty and distorted, all of Craig's and Brewis' new-wave affectations would be right at the fore. ""Poor Boy"" similarly benefits from a considered anti-perfectionist streak, with Brewis subverting the sharp arrangement and catchy melody with an almost devil may care casualness. After so much anxiousness, the initially acoustic rumination ""Keep Your Water"" finally downshifts a little until School of Language's pop-prog affectations again rear their head. ""Marine Life"" and ""Ships"" find some middle ground between XTC's Andy Partridge and a more pacific songwriter like Robert Wyatt, willfully weird but far from placid. Indeed, the twisted ""This Is No Fun"" belies its title with an utterly nuts arrangement, while the dueling pitter patter of percussion percolates as counterpart to the outer-reaches explorations of ""Extended Holiday"". ""Rockist Part 3 (Aposiopesis)""-- it means to break off mid-sentence-- brings back a variation of the pulsing vocal loop from ""Part 1"" and ""Part 2,"" here invoked as a more traditional underpinning to a just slightly left of traditional art-rock track. ""Rockist Part 4"", on the other hand, recognizes that the quirky hooks of ""Part 1"" were too good to fully part with, working as both reprise and conceptual closer, right down to the drawn out guitar freak-out that ends the track and album. Admittedly, for anyone wondering if School of Language rises above the level of side project, there's still the matter of that pesky ""Field Music production"" tag, which implies Brewis himself sees School of Language as somewhat peripheral. But the relatively quick turnaround between Tones of Town and Sea From Shore implies Brewis was serious about opening the creative tap wide and seeing what flows out. If everything he (or his once and future bandmates, for that matter) releases stays at this level, that enigmatic Field Music hiatus might just stretch on and on a little longer.","Field Music's David Brewis sets off on his own for a Thrill Jockey-released disc of down and dirty art-pop.

"Meet the Eels: Essential Eels Vol. I / Useless Trinkets: B-Sides, Soundtracks, Rarities and Unreleased",Eels,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b40f9d034d5c69bf4dde/1:1/w_160/8f6d7b53.jpg,2008-01-15 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11648-meet-the-eels-essential-eels-vol-iuseless-trinkets-b-sides-soundtracks-rarities-and-unreleased/,Geffen,"The big irony of the Eels career is that, while they hooked their biggest (and only U.S.) hit on the fading coattails of ""alternative rock"" (""Novacaine for the Soul"", from 1996) and would be forever remembered for that one-dimensional wonder, their highest achievement to many of their fans and critics is one album, meant to absorbed as a whole: Electro-Shock Blues, heading the pack of other decidedly album-rock triumphs like Daisies of the Galaxy and the double album Blinking Lights and Other Revelations. The Eels don't have miles of cred here in their home country, and that's probably down to timing as much as anything else-- on their debut album, Beautiful Freak, they treated grunge as another trendy accoutrement, but did the same with Pure Moods keyboards, novelty rock, hip-hop, cocktail jazz, and any style in arm's reach. Don't we usually praise acts with such omnivorous ears? The problem was that, despite a propensity for switching and layering instruments, the early songs never dug very deep. ""Novocaine"" and follow-ups like ""Susan's House"" threw every texture against the blank wall of frontman Mark Oliver Everett's deadpan delivery in the hopes that something would stick. ""Your Lucky Day in Hell"" goes for a simple juxtaposition-- Everett's Steven Wright-esque recounting of woe against a slinky spy-music backdrop-- and ages best because of it. This is not to say Everett can't write a hit (the band has scored quite a few in the UK), but maybe that he's pushed himself into contexts that belie his strengths. Before the Eels, he recorded two albums of precious one-man twee known as simply ""E"", often using toy-like instruments. After Beautiful Freak and some extremely difficult personal circumstances that followed, he returned to those instincts. His ""edgy"" observations were far from trenchant, evidenced by the supposedly-seedy suburbia of early single ""Susan's House"" or even the more layered ""Cancer for the Cure"" (a signature single that only appears on the DVD supplement, oddly). Even if the latter honed their mixed musical formula, the lyrics were leaden and the concept hardly novel to begin with. But there's nothing wrong with playing it straight, and the E who stared down personal tragedy on Electro-Shock Blues started writing songs that shone with a weary but genuine optimism in ""3 Speed"" and ""Last Stop: This Town"". The tracks selected from this much-loved and critically respected period of the Eels are, surprise surprise, arguably their most striking singles. Follow-up Daisies of the Galaxy marked a transitional and seemingly serene period for Everett and the band, and they released some of his most somber tracks like ""It's a Motherfucker"" alongside cheery, percussive pop like ""Flyswatter"" and the unflappable ""Mr. E's Beautiful Blues"", both among the catchiest singles they'd ever released. But the band's path forward almost immediately began to muddle: Supposedly, Everett found ""Beautiful Blues"" too commercial, therefore hiding it as an unlisted track on Daisies, but nonetheless releasing it as a single and allowing it to grace various film soundtracks. Moreover, the band quickly returned to playing up the quirk with Souljacker, including the title track, and returning to the same forced rocking and pseudo-shocking preoccupations of their early career. Still, as the tracks progress chronologically, the band's growth is evident. ""Saturday Morning"" returns to the topic of childhood nostalgia, certainly a comfort zone for Everett, (although the deeper voice he affects is somewhat awkward), and later songs with grab-bag instrumentation like ""Fresh Feeling"" and ""Trouble with Dreams"" progress in much more natural and occasionally surprising ways than the band's early singles. Among the previously unreleased additions to the set is a slightly fussier remix of the teary ""Climbing Up to The Moon"" by chronic collaborator Jon Brion (who contributed to Electro-Shock Blues), and a cover of ""Get Ur Freak on"" that's too horrid to recount-- recognizing a song's genius is not the same as translating it in an interesting or competent way. (If they'd included the band's more earnest take on ""Damn I Wish I Was Your Lover"" instead, I wouldn't be complaining, but what can you do.) As for Useless Trinkets, to say it's for fans only is an understatement; this isn't even the first B-sides compilation the band has put out. It's exhaustive, certainly, but it's a pretty good look at the minor treasures that the Eels faithful have been privileged to throughout the years. Among the two discs, there's several preciously-delivered downers like ""Fucker"", some remixes that should have stayed in the 90s (Michael Simpsons's remix of ""Your Lucky Day in Hell"" for starters, though the Moog Cookbook version of ""Novocaine"" is grade-A kitsch), and some playful live readings of songs like ""Hospital Food"", showing off their humorous side-- sort of corny, sure, but also breathing a lot of life into the group. This is often courtesy of now-departed drummer Jonathan ""Butch"" Norton, the man behind their sillier live digressions like ""Vice President Fruitley"", included on the first disc. The cover versions are plenty, from as current as Magnapop's lone hit ""Open the Door"" (from the Electro-Shock Blues era, when the band's humor could get none more black) to oldies like ""Dark End of the Street"" and ""Can't Help Falling in Love With You"", showing the band's surprising knack for standards-- not to mention the two Prince covers, the latter of which is a string-laden version ""I Could Never Take the Place of Your Man"" that segues into an orchestral take on ""Mr. E's Beautiful Blues"". The covers just reinforce that Everett-- or ""E,"" Mr. E, MC Honky, whomever-- is both more tasteful than he's often given credit for, and often unable to take those tastes anywhere original or unexpected. That's the frustrating duality that exists in even the Eels' best singles, and maybe why there's an air of undelivered potential on this, the portentously titled ""Vol. 1"" of their hits. You can glean the Eels' M.O. from these songs, but picking democratically from a career with some serious peaks and valleys makes for a set that sounds like a frustrated and failed novelty act. Until you listen to one of their records in full, you'd never understand how they've built the cult status that justifies these kinds of releases.","With an introductory best-of for newbies and a(nother) B-sides compilation for fans, Eels suggest reasons why they became a successful cult act and thank those who helped them gain that status.

The Captain's Table,Ham1,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3e75e6ef9596932251e/1:1/w_160/2ee3f1df.jpg,2008-01-14 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11009-the-captains-table/,Orange Twin,"It took a couple of years for their impact to be fully felt, but once the Velvet Underground connected there was simply no stopping the spread of the band's influence. By the early 1970s, the VU were an underground staple. By the early 80s, sounding like the Velvet Underground was a virtual cottage industry. Jonathan Richman. The Dream Syndicate. The Feelies. The Vulgar Boatmen. Galaxie 500. The Violent Femmes. All these acts and many, many more owe pretty much everything to the Velvet Underground. We can add Ham1 to the list, too. Ham1 was formed by Athens, Georgia schoolteacher Jim Willingham and a few buddies that happened to be around, including Chris Sugiuchi from Willingham's former band the Prince Rondavels. Maybe that explains why The Captain's Table seems such a casual yet eminently enjoyable affair. It's got no pretensions whatsoever, coming off a bit like a refreshing blast of an opening act when you get to the club a little too early for the headliner. It's this loose, almost unfinished quality that helps the disc stay afloat, despite the fact that Ham1 telegraphs pretty much all it's going to say, musically, in the first track ""Clown-Shoed Feet"", which runs well under a minute. Frenetic strumming and brushed (but still oddly forceful) drums are joined by a blurt of horns in a pop dronerific embrace before inevitably fuzzing out à la Eno (another early VU adherent). The rest of the disc is basically variations on the same. That's not to say there aren't some nice surprises and subtle change-ups to be found. If ""Hare Lipped Bust"" perfectly recalls prime college rock jangle, ""Saluki"" takes a successful turn toward surf-informed garage rock. ""How Can You Watch T.V. With A Dead Person?"" hails from the Lee Hazelwood school of atmospheric twang, with a touch of dreaming, drifting psychedelic listlessness. The concluding title track crunches together all these slightly different sides of the band into a good approximation of prime Elephant 6 lo-fi indulgence. What certainly helps Ham1 rise slightly above the pull of the anonymous VU-derived indie-rock black hole is that Willingham and Sugiuchi both sing with a tad more warmth than Lou Reed and his descendents. They also try just hard enough to tell that they care about their craft, but not too much that they actually think many people will care quite as much. It's as if they know the band won't change the world, recognizing in the end that their efforts are, in the best sense, a bit if a goof. So, yes, it's totally redundant music, adding absolutely nothing new to the lexicon and doing absolutely nothing that thousands of flash in the pan (or worse) bands haven't done before. What makes Ham1 better than a lot of them is their shambling modesty, which gives the impression these are the kind of guys for whom getting together to make a racket now and then constitutes the bulk of the fun, and getting people to listen is just gravy.","Indebted to the Velvet Underground, this Athens, Ga., band has no pretensions whatsoever, coming off a bit like a refreshing blast of an opening act when you get to the club a little too early for the headliner.

Most notable for contributing vitriolic vocals to post-apocalyptic fetishists the A-Frames, the multi-instrumentalist Finberg has quit his job as doomsday herald to devote undivided attention towards Intelligence, which had previously subsisted on scrappy home recordings and spotty touring. Recorded in an actual studio, Deuteronomy's easily Finberg's tidiest, most civilized work, and it even retains most of his signature post-punk bile. Whereas his previous catalog glorified a cinematic, Terminator-like take on the future, here he's channeling something more like Total Recall or ""Futurama""-- society's not succumbing to chaos, but it's rife with some pretty fucked up elements. Finberg's clearly earned his lambskin from the school of asshole rock, and recent tour dates with the Fall have only amplified his Mark E. Smith malaise. Deuteronomy's filled with uncharacteristically catchy songs for Finberg, many of them reminiscent of the Fall circa Grotesque (After the Gramme), the Cramps' mutant rockabilly, or Brainiac's surf cyborg wipeout. However, despite an array of ear-grabbing instrumentation and Finberg's frugal use of yelling and screaming, the vocals make a concerted effort not to touch upon any accessible melodies. The easy-going ditty ""Tubes"", for example, bops along an organ vamp copping ""96 Tears"", but instead of climaxing at a hummable chorus, the song peaks with Finberg shrieking a nasally ""Fuck!"" Oddly enough, Finberg cites the Zombies and Bee Gees as Deuteronomy's key influences, a statement that initially sounds ridiculous until you realize how loose and playful the album is in relation to earlier works. ""Secret Signals"" begins like so much garden variety post-punk getting exorcised these days-- the drums/bass/guitar arrangement sterile and predictable, the rhythm stubbornly four-on-the-floor-- but then Finberg unleashes a bluesy, chopped-up chorus that's probably his best approximation of a song like ""Care of Cell 44""'s complex chord changes. Some tracks here, when stripped of their strident noise rock exterior, even resemble some of rock's earliest and kookiest personalities. The eerie haunted house organ on ""Block of Ice"" and ""How to Improve Your Hearing Without Listening""-- coupled with Finberg's crazed howls-- channels Screamin' Jay Hawkins, while the cosmic surf riffs on ""Our Solar System"" and ""The Outer Echelon"" recall so many 60s sci-fi program themes. Despite the newfound color in his songwriting, Finberg's still pissed off as ever. Unlike previous releases, though, Deuteronomy doesn't feel like one homogeneous rant, but rather a newly reformed psychopath hesitantly giving society a second chance. His scowl's always been equal parts tongue-in-cheek and fury, but Finberg really sounds like he's having fun here and, when the rhythm moves him, sexy to boot. Rising from the ashes of Finberg's apocalyptic oeuvre, the revamped Intelligence has become the best display of the journeyman's talents to date, worthy of being elevated from pet project to full-time gig.","The A-Frames' Lars Finberg branches out and offers his tidiest, most civilized work-- even if it still (thankfully) retains most of his signature post-punk bile.

Strictly Leakage,Atmosphere,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b4179d034d5c69bf4dec/1:1/w_160/1c33dbc8.jpg,2008-01-14 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11052-strictly-leakage/,Rhymesayers,"We ain't having any of this ""emo rap"" business, all right? Sean Daley chases and/or is driven out of his mind by the ladies, but even when he gets unhinged and broken up he usually doesn't come across as that much more self-indulgent than the Pharcyde on ""Passin' Me By"". And when he does, it's a lot more Hi Records than Victory Records, the wounded late-night laments of a chain-smoking vet who's experienced enough to shoulder at least some of the blame in his bad situations. Whatever the case, that whole rep too often winds up overshadowing Slug's other strengths, ones less easily overshadowed on his actual records: His self-aware but celebratory party-rocking; his taste for battle-rap aggression; his reverence for hip-hop history, even if he's not always reverent about his potential place in it. Strictly Leakage is the ideal record to show all those qualities off, and the fact that Atmosphere put it up on their website for the bargain price of zero dollars and zero cents means that the cost-reward ratio alone is enough to recommend it. It's a great gift to fans and a fine complement to the three Sad Clown EPs (Bad Summer, Bad Fall and Bad Winter) he's dropped over the last six months-- not really a collection of cast-offs and B-side candidates, but a nice out-of-nowhere mini-album with its own continuous-mix backbone. And for those who're jaded enough by torrents and filesharing to not really care about the notion of a free full-length album and are unconvinced that Atmosphere's worth their bandwidth, they might want to know that Slug's rarely sounded more charismatically confident. As party/tour/live show stories go, Slug tends to keep things somewhere between familiar and specific, like the escapism and half-mocking camaraderie of the club scene that ""Full Moon"" references (""we all paid dues, we all workin' hard/some fools even had to pay a service charge""), or the brief but high-velocity gambling references in ""What They Sitting For?"" which could go either way as brags of prowess with poker or rocking stage. There's also a couple funny stress-free ladies' man jams, peaking with ""Domestic Dog"", where he realizes the bar scene is too problemati and he decides to get his mack on at the grocery store instead (""actually, I would like a free sample,"" he exclaims between verses). And it's always novel to hear his smart-assed cackling sneer put up against a handful of other MCs in a posse cut, which is where ""Crewed Up"" comes in: not only do Rhymesayers favorites Brother Ali and Blueprint get their shots at delivering their customary high-grade fuck-you-up battle verses, but a few of the Twin Cities' less nationally known MCs -- Stage One, St. Paul Slim, Muja Messiah and Toki Wright-- tear it up, and even YZ (as in the underappreciated, deep-cratedigger favorite, Sons of the Father YZ) shows up to bring a hot verse. Much of the force and appeal behind Slug's voice can be partially credited to the way it's augmented by Ant's production, which skews sample-heavy and, at least here, close to the funk-and-soul-originated tradition of
late 1980s and early 90s beats. There's a few nods to the golden age of hip hop: ""YGM"" rides the same Albert King loop as Big Daddy Kane's ""Young, Gifted and Black"" (or, as Slug spits, ""young, gifted and mixed""-- maybe now he'll stop showing up on all those ""favorite white MCs"" messageboard threads), and ""Road to Riches"" is a half-remixed take on the Kool G Rap classic. Ant's production, per usual, works by sticking to what he does best, taking classic sources-- the Meters, James Brown and his funky People, the Stax roster-- and making them bump so hard and so clean that '88-fetishizing stasis isn't even part of the equation. Even if Strictly Leakage is more party-centered than his regular releases, it's still a bit reflective and philosophical, though it doesn't get too moody about it. The closest Strictly Leakage gets to fatalism is the tongue-in-cheek addiction anthem ""The Things That Hate Us"", a rundown of hazardous indulgences from menthols, fast food and ""suicide Big Gulps"" to unprotected sex and hard drugs (""This is for the needles you shared/ 'Cause them after-school TV specials is too square""); it plays like a Denis Leary bit with all the self-righteous kids-these-days bile replaced by a somewhat embarrassed hindsight guilt: ""America the beautiful, that's how she played us/she wasn't that cute, it must've been her makeup"". Even when he gets booed from a voice the crowd in ""You Played Yourself"", he gets pissed off at the security for kicking the heckler out and later refunds him after the show with the no-hard-feelings admonishment ""I understand, dude, I was just like you when I was 15."" And the first verse of ""Little Math You"" is one of the bravest things any indie rapper's said about identity in a long time: it starts out like a typical rant against suburban white teens who listen to rap-- ""Oh, they don't know no nothin' about no hip-hop…look at 'em! Little suburban thugs!""-- pulls off a slick bait-and-switch by giving the kid credit for finding something he can express himself through, then rolls his eyes at the self-appointed enforcers of rap ""realness"": ""You tellin' me that this ain't for him, right/how many y'all motherfuckers get an invite?"" Shit, if Atmosphere is ""emo rap,"" it only stands to be pointed out that sticking up for those who don't quite have it all figured out yet is an emotional response, too.","This free internet download is a great gift to fans, a nice out-of-nowhere mini-album with its own continuous-mix backbone, and a fine complement to the three EPs (Bad Summer, Bad Fall and Bad Winter) Slug has dropped over the last six months.

Private Times in Public Places / Nor'easter,Slow Six,by: Mike Powell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3df13d197565213a9f7/1:1/w_160/f8863af4.jpeg,2008-01-14 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11640-private-times-in-public-places-noreaster/,Western Vinyl,"Brooklyn's Slow Six make the kind of glacial, pretty music that tends to drive people three places: to ecstasy, to sleep, or to the composition of indistinct poetry. It's also the kind of music often saddled with near-useless terms like ""ambient"" (not the same as ""has reverb, does not have drums"") or ""minimal"" (not the same as ""has violins, is repetitious, is not a symphony."") Most of the time, it's the opposite: Slow Six aren't indifferent, they're intentional; they're not minimalistic, they're just understated. And despite the self-imposed limitations-- I say that pejoratively-- of a lot of ""neo-classical"" or ""post-rock"" bands, Slow Six's two albums, the recently reissued Private Times in Public Places and 2007's Nor'easter, are actually different, which is more than you can say for plenty of their peers. Though passages of Private Times move-- particularly the violin ricochets on ""Evening Without Atonement"" and some scattered lapses into soft, Reilly-like patterns-- it's a record focused on texture and atmosphere. Bandleader and composer Chris Tignor would be nothing without the chamber orchestra surrounding him, but it's the computerized glaze, the puffs and trails with which he ornaments the sounds, that makes the album what it is. And it works best when he manages to meld with the acoustic instruments-- when it's unclear whether a sigh is coming from a violin or the synth processing of it, or, like on the first section of ""The Lines We Walked When We Walked Once Together"", his synth patterns hop on Rhodes drones like a smooth stone on lake water. Nor'easter, like the storm it's named after, is colder and more difficult than Private Times. It's not dark so much as it is colorless; strings aren't abrasive, but they feel caught out in something (everyone knows storms are brutal; fewer acknowledge their loneliness). It's also an album that doesn't feel quite as genre-nebulous and noncommittal as Private Times, trading in that album's sometimes-damning lack of inertia for more straightforwardly concert-hall-style composition, more dissonance, and more movement. It's telling that Nor'easter came out on legendary West Coast classical label New Albion, while the Private Times reissue was released by Western Vinyl-- one's clearly a classical record, one's clearly an indie record with a few classical leanings. Which is why it's hard to come down hard on saying one's better than another. Private Times isn't without its share of wonderful moments, and ""The Lines..."" actually makes a case for half-hour-long tracks, but it's almost damned by how safe it is. Nor'easter is a less appealing listen, in a lot of ways, and certainly won't strike a chord with listeners fond of creamy, compulsively beautiful ""indie composers"" like, say, Max Richter. But it also sounds a little more distinctive than Private Times, which, in a genre that provokes some desperately vague music, is worth a nod-- maybe even a floral lyric or two.",,7.3,
Distortion,The Magnetic Fields,by: Matt LeMay,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a212b1335d7bf16983e8/1:1/w_160/6d8f7a2f.jpg,2008-01-14 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11049-distortion/,Nonesuch,"With all of Stephin Merritt's cleverness and theatricality, it's easy to forget that the Magnetic Fields started out as an indie pop band. Merritt didn't really establish himself as a widely feted songwriter until 1999's 69 Love Songs, a far-flung compendium spanning acoustic ballads and skittery electro pop tracks. Merritt continued his conceptual unification streak with 2004's i, but that album's all-acoustic approach felt at odds with the songs themselves. (Compare the passable album version of ""I Don't Believe You"" with the vastly more fun single version.) While the overdone thematic focus of i generally seemed flat and frustrating, Distortion's aesthetic conceit-- conveyed by its title-- is worn well, and its blown-out sound breathes life into a collection of songs that brings together many of the best ideas from Merritt's back catalog. In the four years since i, Merritt has had plenty of opportunities to indulge his interest in all things theatrical, and that impulse is largely played down on Distortion. Instead, Merritt explores his 1960s pop fetish more directly than he has since the early 90s. Distortion is hardly a retread, though-- its fuzzy production substantially alters the focus and nature of Merritt's music. Opener ""Three Way"" serves as a straightforward statement of purpose; its simple, surf-y riff is almost unimaginable without a distorted guitar tone. Throughout Distortion, the squelching, tight-focus rhythmic interplay of Merritt's music is blown out into loud, distorted drum beats and smeared guitars, introducing a new level of messy, energizing depth to Merritt's characteristically stately and considered songwriting. These aesthetic changes resonate emotionally as well, often lending Merritt's music a previously unexplored shambolic melancholy. ""Old Fools"" plods along beautifully, Merritt's lugubrious voice offset beautifully by the loud, squealing guitars behind it. Indeed, while Merritt has gotten more technically adept at singing, Distortion's hazy and reverb-drenched arrangements consistently prevent him from slipping into fey preciousness. At its best, the effect is similar to that of Big Star's Third/Sister Lovers, a wall of disintegrating feedback bringing out the most rough and human tones of Merritt's well-honed voice. While the sonic treatment of Distortion flatters Merritt's singing, the album's greatest moments belong to Shirley Simms, the finest and most nuanced singer in Merritt's orbit. ""Drive On, Driver"" brings to mind The Charm of the Highway Strip with its serpentine melody and roadway imagery. ""The Nun's Litany"" is perhaps the best song on the record, cutting Jesus and Mary Chain guitar feedback and percussion with a striking, clean organ sound. And the audaciously titled ""California Girls"" is irresistible, bolstered by sly harmonies just peeking out from a sea of distorted guitar fuzz. For all its boldness, though, ""California Girls"" is a bit obvious and overstated in its approach. This hardly makes the song less enjoyable, though-- thankfully, cleverness isn't really the point of this record. In fact, the more laid-back and loose feel of Distortion casts its more ostensibly funny moments (see the sing-songy intro to ""Too Drunk to Dream"") as anomalous and weirdly charming like the goofier tracks on a Robyn Hitchcock record. For the first time since Get Lost, the conceptual conceit of Merritt's work sounds like a well-considered and-- dare I say-- fun, jumping off point for a thoroughly solid album. As such, Distortion isn't a return to form so much as a return to content.",,8.0,
Gangsta Grillz: The Album,DJ Drama,by: Evan McGarvey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3d813d197565213a9e5/1:1/w_160/70bef9ff.jpg,2008-01-11 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10992-gangsta-grillz-the-album/,Atlantic,"He calls himself ""Barack O'Drama"" more than once on wax, but DJ Drama's got a lot more in common with Mike Huckabee: Vaguely inoffensive, vaguely southern, affable, entrepreneurial; the kind of simple-minded dude who synchronizes everyone-gets-a-seat-at-the-table warmth with jaw-dropping blunders (denying the science behind evolution/befouling the video reunion of UGK). The political analogy continues. On the inside cover of Gangsta Grillz: The Album, Drama poses unnervingly close to the fish-eye close up, the plane of hands perpendicular to the ground, thumbs up, caught in some unclear gesticulation that could symbolize an awkward approximation of a booty, a square of china white, or just a square. He's supposed to look hard, serious, ""so focused."" Drama doesn't rap, sing, produce, or mix. So why are so many fizzy pop rappers and A-listeners flocking to him? Because behind all the stunted veneers and posing rests the most important person the modern economy: the middle man. All he does is shout over beats and bring people together. His series of Gangsta Grillz mixtapes have been both buzz-forming and buzz-maintaining for a few years now, aiding everyone from Little Brother to Lil' Boosie. For many, Lil' Wayne's Dedication 2, a Gangsta Grillz entry, has become the unofficial demarcation of his ascent to rap's top tier. Drama is a fixer. His in-house producers (Don Cannon, most readily) have benefited from the endless series of canvasses too, spring boarding onto 50 Cent and Young Jeezy production credits. Like a good agent, getting in bed with Drama gets you in bed with the right people, or, at the very least, the best people willing to work with you. Don't misunderstand, DJ Drama has made some fantastic mixtapes. He'll hopefully make more. But about 25% of Drama's overall skill set translates well to major label album-length hip-hop. Sadly, Gangsta Grillz: The Album has to exist for us to learn that. No single narrator or speaker to guide and anchor. No fixed regional style to diverge and return to. Just overstuffed tracks like loosely spooled nylon or hastily booked professional wrestling matches (Jeezy! Twista! Joc! T.I.! Diddy! Nelly!-- on one song). Skits red-line embarrassment; Katt Williams going on for three minutes too long about Kush, Diddy just smiling and shouting shit on that annoying DJ Clue self-echo. The singles are baubles, and Jazze Pha ones at that (""5000 Ones""). Sonically, not a producer on here ever met a Visigoth bell sequence or predictably ""explosive"" drum roll he didn't like. Two jewels get lost in the blather. Everyone already knows about Outkast's ""Art of Storytellin' Part 4""-- it's great, lovely to hear the pair together, and Andre 3000 is the only MC who can rap about the war (though I'd like to know how he'd capitalize it), and it's Drama's platform at its finest: Giving space to something instant right at this very second. Even though the collaborative ""187"" is a song very different from ""Storytellin'"", it's a satisfying enough shuffle of related yet previously uncombined parts. Project Pat gets to play Ford to 8Ball and MJG's collective Nixon. And B.G. should croon hooks more often; he pouts and flicks through this one. Sadly, and mostly, Gangsta Grillz also forces a lot of crow down the throat. Those who got behind the opaque, effortless Houston aesthetic are going to have to grit their teeth through ""Gettin' Money"", and it's frightening to hear Clipse sound like monotone MCs who just read a lot of Italian and Japanese Vogue (the album closing ""Cheers""). I'd chide Drama for not helping, not standing in front on his product, but when your Rolodex and your open door are the only tools you bring to the job, all there is to do is politic.","The maestro behind the Gangsta Grillz mixtapes gets a major-label shot to replicate his ear for the Now-- including fantastic tracks by Outkast and Project Pat.

Dark on Fire,Turin Brakes,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3a25e6ef959693224ab/1:1/w_160/54b351eb.jpg,2008-01-11 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10943-dark-on-fire/,SourceEMI,"Dance-punk. Freak-folk. Crack-rap. Blog-house. Those were some good times, right? As the first decade of the new millennium hurtles towards a closure, those movements may seem like indie milemarkers growing ever more distant in our rearview, but compared to those, a time when quiet was the new loud feels like ancient history. All the better for Turin Brakes-- if you're coming to Dark On Fire after dusting off their surprisingly enduring debut for nostalgia's sake, be forewarned: they're intent on proving they don't sound like that anymore. Not really, anyway. Though ""Last Chance"" spends its first 45 seconds staring at the obelisk, in that endearingly nasal voice of his, Olly Knights lunges for a note that scrapes the boundaries of his range and soon thereafter, Gale Paridjanian throws in a dousing harmony while moving open chord shapes up and down his fretboard. It's hard to mistake it for the work of another band, ""band"" being the key word. If Tony Hoffer's Wembley-courting production on Ether Song suggested the homespun arranging of The Optimist LP was out of financial necessity as opposed to aesthetic choice, Dark On Fire ditches all pretenses and confirms Turin Brakes as having completely moved on from their roots as an acoustic duo. The problem is, it's pointless to hire backing musicians if you're not going to let them do anything, and on their fourth album, Knight and Paridjanian struggle with a sense of egalitarian obligation. The more successful tracks merely toy with their signature sound; the languid slide guitar of the moonlit ""Other Side"" is more in their wheelhouse than ""Ghost"" or ""For The Fire"", which pinch ""Brown Sugar"" but ultimately reimagine ZZ Top as spending the 1980s being fronted by Brett Anderson. When it comes down to it, there's a very poorly kept secret about this band that will likely determine what you think of Dark On Fire: some of these lyrics are just borderline retarded, combining rhyme-first, ask-questions-never couplets with more arson imagery than a Thursday album. ""Stalker"" threatens with annoyance rather than menace, as in the span of two lines, Knight is a shark and a razor blade. That will destroy all of the friends you've made. Not that this is much of a surprise, seeing as how they introduced themselves with ""Cub Scouts are screaming/ Needing ice creaming"" and nearly ruined their biggest hit with ""My love giving me head/ Feeling very guilty breaking the bread"" (delivered in harmony, no less!). Within the context of those dog-eared melodies and scrappy acoustics, that was acceptable and, at times, downright adorable. But now that they're the most upfront element of their planetarium/coffeehouse hybrid, it comes off like the bloviating of someone taking themselves way too seriously for you to possibly return the favor. And that's a shame because even the most verbally awkward songs bloom with hooks that likely benefit from being limited in their word choice. Sounding like an In Rainbows outtake, the title track builds an elegiac chorale out of its unorthodox open-tuned strums and reverbed percussion before Knights recalls being almost ""drowned,"" before he was ""found"" on the ""ground."" To say nothing of the most anthemic track (""Something In My Eye""), which hopscotches around its twisting chord grid while dropping dewy-eyed pap about newborn kids. If nothing else, Dark On Fire at least triumphs in a ""last man standing"" sort of way. Turin Brakes are of a high enough quality to outlast the I Am Kloots of the world, but it's easy to understand why there's already a last man standing, since the best and most important album from the New Acoustic Movement all but refuted it completely (Erlend Øye's DJ Kicks). So when ""Last Chance"" begs ""don't ask too many questions,"" it's best seen as Turin Brakes' mission statement about Dark On Fire.","Fourth full-length confirms that this London outfit has completely moved on from their roots as an acoustic duo.

"You, Me & Everyone",Pedro,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3e3b1335d7bf169a674/1:1/w_160/b24c9d30.jpg,2008-01-11 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11006-you-me-everyone/,Mush,"Remember when the British press were trying to sell us on the genre tag ""folktronica?"" London's James Rutledge, aka Pedro, surely does, although with You, Me & Everyone, he's trying hard to forget, and to make sure we do, too. His self-titled 2003 debut marked him, along with instrumental glitchers like Four Tet and Manitoba, as a folktronica standard-bearer. But a good litmus test for the validity of a genre is whether musicians use it to self-identify or the press uses it to compartmentalize musicians they don't know where else to put. Terms like ""rock"" and ""punk"" stand up as viable cultural movements according to this standard; ""folktronica,"" like ""IDM,"" does not. So what's the reluctant avatar of a shaky genre to do? Simple: Make an album that eschews the sprightly minimalism associated with it. You could make up all kinds of ""tronicas"" to describe You, Me & Everyone (Miranda Julytronica?), but ""folk"" is not among them. It's not as if Pedro has started from scratch. His palette (jazz breaks, orchestral samples, carefully tooled synths, instrumental hip-hop drum programming) and his process (control-C, control-V, paint the loop, insert meticulously disordered sections, repeat as necessary) are the same as ever. What's changed is his tone-- he's traded in restraint for unchecked bombast. You can forget about breezy flute melodies and judicious glockenspiel sweeps; on You, Me & Everyone, Pedro is going for something more assertive and hyper. His compositions have dense, compact foundations with swarming upper tiers, and while the music is busy, the sound separation is crystal clear. Most of all, there's a sense of boundless reach: Each loop seems to barrel toward the next, and the intensity ramps up accordingly, at least until the inevitable moment when it all collapses into an unruly pile of free jazz drumming and intricately kinked sound effects. This sense of inevitability is the album's handicap-- it implies that, to an extent, Pedro is playing it safe. He relies a bit too heavily on other unimaginative tricks as well, most notably the reversed rhythm or melody loop. That always-cool but rather tired suction sound works best on the aptly titled ""Spools"", which winds around and around like an Irish reel, but elsewhere, it stands out as too glaring a reminder of the circumscribed nature of Pedro's tools. This really isn't his fault-- the advent of cheap and accessible digital editing software has made listening to this kind of music like going to a magic show where you know how to do all the tricks-- but it's a modern reality that electronic composers of the loop-based stripe have to work a bit harder than before to preserve a sense of mystery. Elsewhere, Pedro does a better job of keeping our interest focused on his compositions, not their seams, by injecting his templates with a compelling variety of colors and tones. ""I Am Keeping Up"" sends steel percussion, a thin-sliced synth skitter, blocky drums, lyrical horn passages, and a maniacally looping glissando skipping like stones across a pond, with an accelerating staccato momentum. ""Hallelujah"" sounds like a reconciliation of jazz-hop and G-funk, with little stutters and trills loosening up its taut creep, a lovely chiming breakdown in the middle (it's a nice change of pace from Pedro's usually-chaotic bridges), bonkers drumline programming near the end. ""There Will Always Be More"" also achieves a pleasing juxtaposition, as a squealing synth phrase tangos with a cool one around the splashy drums. ""Lung"" is gritty death-drive disco replete with forlorn horns, curly synth ribbons, clip-clopping drums, and mean bursts of high-desert guitar. If the album's structural homogeneity is its weakness, its sonic variety is its strength. Pedro could correct the former on his next album simply by not telegraphing his passes so blatantly, but even with this one, it's already like folktronica never hap-- oh, wait. It didn't.","London's James Rutledge abandons his folktronica roots by eschewing sprightly minimalism and trading restraint for unchecked bombast.

The Heavy Metal Box,Various Artists,by: Brandon Stosuy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b40bc0084474cd0c2207/1:1/w_160/3252be3b.jpg,2008-01-11 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11041-the-heavy-metal-box/,Rhino,"The Heavy Metal Box's biggest draw is its awesomely kitsch packaging: Going all-out on presentation, the four discs and full-color booklet (liner notes, interviews, photos) are packed vertically inside a recreation of an amp head (Marshall stack, please) with a loudness button that, of course, goes all the way to 11. (In case you were wondering: Yes, Spinal Tap's on Disc 3 with ""Big Bottom"".) As far as the music itself, mainstream metal diehards (and even some casual listeners) will likely have the bulk of the seventy songs. The biggest bands and their biggest hits are largely here-- ""Metal Health"" for Quiet Riot, ""Youth Gone Wild"" for Skid Row, ""Ace of Spades"" for Motörhead, ""Talk Dirty to Me"" for Poison, ""Round and Round"" for Ratt. No real surprises or B-sides or alternate takes. But then, that's really not what Rhino's pop culture-driven box sets are all about. (Full disclosure: A few years ago I wrote some album reviews for the Rhino website.) The comp's basically an unpretentious, straightforward gathering; and though all the tunes are familiar, it's interesting listening to them as one expansive playlist and finding weird or fun overlaps and sequencing oddities. The songs are arranged chronologically-- from 1968 to 91 (oh blasted Nirvana!)-- but the compilers definitely had some fun with how they pieced them together: Metal Church rips into Stryper's ""To Hell With the Devil"", which somehow I knew by heart, right before Helloween's ""A Little Time"". Right after that it's Overkill's ""Wrecking Crew"" alongside Anthrax's ""Caught in a Mosh"" and then ""Peace Sells"". Get it? Or, more simply, Whitesnake abuts Great White; ""I Wanna Rock,"" Hanoi Rocks. It's also cool to hear things that had grown kinda stale reinvigorated by their next context: Like the aforementioned Great White's ""Rock Me"" is kinda great, as is that weird vocal hiccup on Savatage's ""Hall of the Mountain King"". As with any of these collections, you also notice the gaps. It's largely mainstream genres (or mainstream representations of a genre) that are covered, so you don't get any really raw grindcore (no Napalm Death or Anal Cunt) or death metal (no Morbid Angel or, uh, Napalm Death). A friend I was just talking to lamented the lack of Possesed and Racer X. The historical arc in both the accompanying ""A Brief History of Metal"" essay and tracklist could also be nitpicked, if you felt like it. As far as formative crews the set is built around Iron Butterly (""In-q-Gadda-Da-Vida""), Dio-lead Sabbath (""Neon Knights"" ... and Dio's ""Holy Diver""), Blue Cheer, Hawkind (with Lemmy and ""Lost Johnny,"" which he later re-recorded with Motörhead), Kiss, Rush, Deep Purple, Uriah Heap, Alice Cooper, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden. None too shocking, none too shabby. In the liner notes Rhino mentions it couldn't get every song the compilers wanted, of course, but lacking a band like Saint Vitus or the pre-black metal of Bathory (though there is some Venom) or bleak symphonies of Celtic Frost seems like an oversight. But if it's darkness (or semi-darkness) you want, we do get Mercyful Fate (and King Diamond), Diamond Head (""Am I Evil?""), and Angel Witch (""White Witch""). You'll also hear (and see plenty great pictures of) awesome upsate New York heroes Manowar (""May your swords be wet/ Like the young girl in her prime!""), plus Slayer (""South of Heaven""), Metallica (""One"" and ""Whiplash""), Pantera, and Prong. The liner notes include an interview with Ronnie James Dio about ""inventing"" the devil hand salute, Lita Ford about being an axe-toting woman in rock (she answers the interviewers questions from the bathroom at her son's jijitsu school), and seminal metal disc jockey Eddie Trunk. There's also a ""track-by-track summary"" written by Canadian music journalist Martin Popoff (each song gets a decent-sized blurb to offer a bit of context), the ""Brief History of Metal"" by longtime, recently Mojo-related UK scribe Mick Wall (he makes sure to keep things up to date, noting what happened to some of the bands), and an essay on metal and black magic by another UK dude, Melody Maker's Chris Welch. And, fitting with the over-the-top packaging, any of the Rhino staffers with an ""o"" in their name get an ""ö"", and the producers make sure their opening note is 666 words long. The Heavy Metal Box could certainly work as a first-step into metal, and the fact that the songs play out chronologically is a helpful way to grasp trends, developments, and divergences. But if you find yourself more interested in the heavier or dirtier, less so the hair metal (L.A.'s well repped, as is Cinderalla) or hard rock, you might want to pair it with Earache's (so far) two-part series, Metal: A Headbanger's Companion, which, though definitely not spotless, will bring you you closer to the more extreme sounds of Deicide, Terrorizer, Carcass, Vader, and so on. The big question, really, is how much money you can spend. The thing's listed at $65, which isn't bad. Again, you're largely paying for the packaging. The essays and accompanying materials are fun, but the info isn't something you wouldn't find elsewhere, and the tunes could certainly be downloaded, even in this post OiNK world. As a conversation piece, though-- and hell, everyone who's seen me with it during this review process has picked it up and smiled-- it's pretty damn tr00. In my case, its main use was reminding me to pull out the Manowar records and play them loudly for the first time in ages.","Focusing primarily on crossover and pop metal, Rhino compiles a grindcore/death metal-less box tracing of hard rock.

Englabörn,Jóhann Jóhannsson,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1c3ea9e61561daa4896/1:1/w_160/abf84959.jpg,2008-01-11 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11001-englaborn/,TouchTouch,"John Cage once noted, with some disapproval, that no sooner was the theremin invented than people began trying to replicate 17th century chamber music with it. The Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson, whose debut album Englabörn has been reissued without alteration by 4AD, is well-acquainted with the urge to map classical music traditions onto untraditional technologies: See, for instance, his album IBM 1401 - A User's Manual, where Jóhannsson crafted a pageant with all the mystery and bluster of a Sibelius symphony from a collection of archaric computer hymns. But in fact, he probably would have escaped Cage's censure-- neither a reactionary conservationist nor a baby-and-bathwater-chucking iconoclast, Jóhannsson avails himself of tools both conventional and emergent to accentuate, not obscure, his agility as a traditional composer. When Jóhannsson recorded Englabörn, a score for a play of the same name by Hávar Sigurjónsson (the title means ""angels"") featuring a string quartet, piano, glockenspiel, percussion, and organ, IBM 1401 was still ahead of him, and the computer was still one color in his compositional palette, not the palette itself. The computerized embellishments on Englabörn are sparse: On ""Odi et Amo"" (roughly translated, ""I love and hate""), a digitized voice sings Latin lines from Catullus in operatically aching strains, reclining on a bed of lambent strings. And on ""Karen B´yr Til Engil"", clipped mechanical blips rise up in delicate counterpoint to a hauntingly bare glockenspiel melody. The bulk of the album is purely acoustic, albeit with some subtle atmospheric enhancement that gives the strings a little extra quiver, the pianos more simmer, the organs a deeper breath. Favoring neither classical music's expansive movements nor post-rock's bleary crescendos, Englabörn's short set pieces-- repetetive, minimal, emotionally charged, and deeply imagistic-- mark it particularly as a work of augmentation, a work that exists to complement another. Its reprises lend it internal continuity: The vocal melody from ""Odi et Amo"" reappears on ""Krókódíll"", transcribed for legato piano, and again on ""Odi et Amo - Bis"", couched somewhere between digital voice and bassoon. This fugal theme asserts a tone-- elegiac reverie-- if not an actual narrative, and shores up the album against undue contingency. In other words, no knowledge of Icelandic theater is necessary to reap the full measure of enjoyment from Englabörn, although its contrapuntal nature still resounds in its very structure. It's a work that exists in two separate dimensions. Jóhannsson has said that the play for which he composed this music was quite violent, so his beatific score bears few direct correlaries to the action. Instead, it evokes a variety of dramatic conventions, archetypal ones, with deep humanism and touches of magical realism. Each piece strikes a little scene, spinning by like a zoetrope: The child standing at the edge of the dark forest, perhaps (""Jói & Karen"", where apprehensive piano tentatively spans the distances between mystical surges of strings); the bitterly parting lovers (the title track, with its romantically swelling strings erupting in anxious trills) and their reunion under less-than-auspicious circumstances (the decomposing music-box minuet ""Bað""); the witches' midnight dance (the tripping percussion and gyring melody of ""Sálfræðingur""); boats on the snowy quay (the rolling swells and icicle drips of ""...Eins Og Venjulegt Fólk""); et cetera. Of course, you'll be free to discover your own dramatic composition for Jóhannsson's work: For starters, just look around. Music in theater has the capacity to reveal the sublime in the mundane, and the best thing about Englabörn, a consummate walkabout album, is its capacity to do the same thing in real life.",,8.0,
Anyway You Choose to Give It EP,The Black Ghosts,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3d913d197565213a9e7/1:1/w_160/1c496404.jpg,2008-01-10 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10993-anyway-you-choose-to-give-it-ep/,IAMSOUND,"You might suspect former Simian member Simon Lord's reeling from a nasty case of Fifth Beatle Syndrome right now. After leaving Simian, his former bandmates appended Mobile Disco to their name, becoming one of England's dance acts du jour in the process. However, Lord's played too big a posthumous hand in SMD's rise to prominence to be kicking himself too hard. You might recognize Lord's chirpy vocals from Simian's and SMD's two most respective successful singles-- the 2006 Justice remix ""We Are Your Friends"" and this year's ""I Believe"". Fittingly then that the Black Ghosts, comprised of Lord plus ex-Wiseguys DJ Theo Keating, sound like a sugarcoated SMD, aiming to craft pop songs using dance music only as foundation. The duo's had their nose to the grindstone since forming, releasing several singles and remixes after recording this EP, so these four songs can't be taken any more seriously than an introductory handshake. That said, the EP gives an intriguing first impression. With no songs here reaching the four-minute mark, the duo works exclusively within the confines of the radio-compatible single, organizing verses, choruses, and hooks in the least complicated manner possible. The title track is the de facto single here and on it Lord airs some nagging relationship laundry-- his high-pitched, almost rambling melody resembling a revved up send-off of Hot Chip's more cool and collected Alexis Taylor. For my money though, the shorter, subtler ""I Want Nothing"" provides a more palatable take on girl troubles, its doomsday-alarm bassline better suiting the dark lyrics than ""Anyway""'s happy-go-lucky Balearic tendencies. The second pair of tracks feel like exercises in broadening the duo's artistic palette. ""Full Moon"" test-drives some world music tropes, namely flamenco guitar and backing vocals doused in Grand Canyon-sized reverb, but as the least focused track on the EP it leaves a bland taste in the mouth. ""Something New"", on the other hand, takes a big risk copping the Steely Dan school of easy-listening 70s rock, but the track's ultimately a success. Replicating the jazzy-sounding-but-not-real-jazz pop of contemporaries like Phoenix and Air, the song's better layered than the EP's more melody-centric material, and best attests to the duo's potential. Of course, what on one level appears as experimentation can be interpreted as an identity crisis on another. Lord and Keating have a well-executed pop record here, but they don't find any exceptional strengths they feel comfortable exploiting. At least not yet. Not to cheat, but after listening to their impressive single ""Some Way Through This"" alongside these four songs, you can tell the Black Ghosts have already outgrown these first tentative baby steps-- and that better things lie over the horizon.","Former Simian vocalist Simon Lord teams with ex-Wiseguys DJ Theo Keating to create a sort of sugarcoated Simain Mobile Disco, aiming to craft pop songs using dance music only as foundation.

Nothing Is Free,Carolyn Mark,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3dc9d034d5c69bf4d91/1:1/w_160/e4a5d0e2.jpg,2008-01-10 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10996-nothing-is-free/,Mint,"Carolyn Mark has a smart mouth. On Nothing Is Free, her fourth album, the Canadian singer-songwriter cracks jokes at inappropriate moments, undercutting the gravity of the songs' dire situations with ill-timed levity. If you go by her songs, which don't have punchlines so much as wincing observations, this tendency usually turns out self-destructive, even if it conveys a certain hard-won wisdom. On stand-out ""Pictures at 5"", she can't help but do some unexpected reconnaissance on the woman taking her place: ""I gotta confess I was strangely impressed/ I thought 'mmm...lace panties' when I looked up her dress."" Elsewhere, she turns the malicious blacklist question ""Are you now or have you ever been..."" into an open-ended country chorus, lovely and even touching. Alt-country by default, Mark sings with a warm, subtle twang but differentiates herself from similar singers like Paula Frazer and frequent collaborator Neko Case with her cutting sense of humor, which on Nothing Is Free sounds like a defense mechanism against life's disappointments-- a smile hiding a profound frown. It doesn't keep her from sounding bitter, but at least makes her bitterness entertaining. Musically, Nothing Is Free is folksily stripped down, with just a few stringed instruments accompanying Mark's steely vocals. The spare arrangements corral guitar, upright bass, mandolin, and violin-- and, okay, a clarinet, the only non-stringed instrument-- and her small band proves surprisingly versatile as it gives Mark's songs a casual, almost impulsive feel, as if the singer has just thought of the perfect comeback hours after the confrontation. Only the closer ""Destination: You"" breaks this rootsy formula, translating this same mood via-- no kidding-- dark synths, trip-hop beats, and artsily reverbed vocals. The song is a huge risk, and not half bad, but it fades out too early, ending just as the live drums come in and the music starts gets really interesting. Even so, the songs on Nothing Is Free, even the hoedown ""Get Along"", are like bruises nursed for days, plumbing deep disillusionment with adult relationships. On ""Honest Woman"", Mark observes about the opposite sex: ""They want a whore in the kitchen and a wife in the bedroom/ And a saint to live on in their minds."" It takes a few seconds to realize she has switched the expected roles, by which times she's winding up the song: ""I'll tell you a secret if you pay me back/ Tops in real life are bottoms in the sack."" An unlikely sex symbol on what is ostensibly a break-up album, Mark plays the role of the scorned woman with such devilish brio you might think she's enjoying herself.","Canadian singer-songwriter Carolyn Mark is alt-country by default since she sings with a warm, subtle twang to go with her cutting sense of humor.

"Scottish Fiction: The Best of Idlewild, 1997-2007",Idlewild,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3c6ea9e61561daa6b52/1:1/w_160/cdad6cbe.jpg,2008-01-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10976-scottish-fiction-the-best-of-idlewild-1997-2007/,ParlophoneEMI,"Some bands are built for the ""best of"" compilation, and when I reviewed Idlewild's Make Another World album in early 2007, I suggested that the Scotland band was among them. Now we have Scottish Fiction-- highlights from the band's first decade. If you're a longtime fan of Idlewild it's not a necessary purchase-- there's no new material, nor even any of their rare early singles (the special edition comes with a bonus DVD that completists will undoubtedly want). But if you're new to them, this is a great introduction and a fantastic disc, drawing substantially from each of their albums. For others, this is a convenient one-stop for all the Idlewild you'll ever need. The song choices are mostly obvious, with just a few surprises, and by and large the selections make sense. I'd have taken ""I'm Happy to Be Here Tonight"" off their 1998 debut Hope Is Important rather than the mundane ""I'm a Message"", but otherwise this truly is their best stuff. It's sequenced for flow, but chronology isn't terribly important when you're compiling a band like Idlewild-- their sound varied a bit over the years, but not to the point where there are any jarring transitions. The biggest differences occur between their first and second albums. Hope Is Important captured a would-be punk band before it realized it was better suited to playing brainy pop-rock. Vocalist Roddy Woomble sounds nasal and thin on their earliest material, and ""When I Argue I See Shapes"" works mostly because of its tunefulness, a quality they'd soon go on to more fully embrace. By the time of their second album, 2000's 100 Broken Windows, Woomble had found his voice, building memorable songs out of references to Gertrude Stein and made-up words like ""Roseability"" or ""discourage"" used as a noun. Though the band abandoned thrashy three-chord punk, they became more muscular. ""Roseability"", in particular, has a very strong rhythm track, juxtaposed with a light vocal melody and some excellent harmonies. 2002's The Remote Part is justly the most represented album on the disc, with five tracks. I'm a little surprised by the inclusion of ""In Remote Part/Scottish Fiction"", but the keyboard-led ""You Held the World in Your Arms"" is undeniable, a punchy surge that still sounds vital. And then there's ""American English"", perhaps their most sublime track and an effortless anthem with drummer Colin Newton's strange march beat heightening the sense of upward motion. Woomble's assertion to whoever he's talking to, ""You've contracted American dreams,"" is an interesting and subtle assertion that perhaps the American Dream is more akin to a virus than something to aspire to. The band's two most recent albums haven't been quite as good as The Remote Part, but they've had their moments. ""Love Steals Us From Loneliness"", from 2005's Warnings/Promises, finds the band poking fun at their own poetic pretensions on the chorus: ""You said something stupid like 'love steals us from loneliness'/ Happy birthday/ Are you lonely yet?"" That album's ""I Understand It"" is among their most ambitious moments, with big choral vocals, a bit of an electronic hitch in the rhythm track and generally big production. Make a New World only gets a couple of representatives including ""No Emotion"", a great flirtation with dance-punk and that album's clear standout. Idlewild have yet to make an album without at least a bit of filler, and on these newer records there's more of it than ever before. As such, this compilation is a fine entry point to their catalog, and a good way to gage whether you want to go any deeper.","Fans of the Scottish band won't find anything new here, but this is a fantastic introduction to a quietly productive and underrated group.

Here Comes the Future,The Honeydrips,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3b3c0084474cd0c2182/1:1/w_160/a4393ed6.jpg,2008-01-10 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10958-here-comes-the-future/,Sincerely Yours,"Pop history is full of loners, rebels, and social misfits. As introverted adolescents, Elvis Presley and Kurt Cobain both got bullied. You could argue that rock'n'roll itself began with James Dean. No one can ever seem to agree on a better starting point, anyway-- Ike Turner's ""Rocket 88"" in 1951? T-Bone Walker's ""Rock Awhile"" in 1949? Uhh, Trixie Smith's ""My Man Rocks Me (With One Steady Roll)"" in 1922?-- so it might as well be a guy who lived fast, died at 24, and inspired everyone from Buddy Holly, Bob Dylan, and the Beatles to Morrissey and Ian Curtis. If most rock long ago ceased to seem rebellious, maybe it's because the macho cock-rockers of the 1970s and 80s ignored Dean's most revolutionary (possibly apocryphal) dictum: ""Only the gentle are ever really strong."" Dean shows up on Here Comes the Future, Swedish singer/songwriter Mikael Carlsson's full-length debut as the Honeydrips. So does plenty of other pop history-- Joy Division's Curtis included. Like the Knife, Jens Lekman, and Sincerely Yours label chiefs the Tough Alliance, Carlsson is based out of Gothenburg, Sweden, where he used to sing lead for Dorotea, a punk-spiked indie-pop group in the style of the Television Personalities, the Wedding Present, or the June Brides. A few years ago, Carlsson started releasing CD-Rs and a 7"" single under his current moniker, moving a bit toward the shimmery indie-dance of Saint Etienne. Embracing even more the Field Mice's starry-eyed earnestness, Carlsson has now built a staggering monument to gentle loners everywhere-- and one of the best twee-pop albums of 2007. ""Please, let's not talk about the past,"" Carlsson sings on Here Comes the Future's title track. It's hard not to, though. For one thing, Carlsson's reverb-bathed vocals have the aching imperfections of Lawrence, from too-often-overlooked 1980s UK pop act Felt. And he's constantly invoking the past, whether lyrically or musically. Acoustic-jangling ""I Wouldn't Know What to Do"" imagines the intimate scene from the Smiths' classic awkward-mixtape starter, ""Reel Around the Fountain"" (you know, ""15 minutes with you"") and admits that he'd spend it in... virginal confusion. The most Field Mice-like moment, ""Wait for the Grief to Come"", is as ""difficult"" as that band in the intensity of its romanticized frailty: ""I don't want to socialize, not tonight or tomorrow night,"" Carlsson whispers, as distant electric guitar doubles his winding acoustic guitar figures, joined by glockenspiel and, eventually, whistling. Good grief, eh? As much as Carlsson may remember the past, he never merely revisits it. ""It Was a Sunny Summer Day"" sets a lockstep New Order bass riff beneath sighing, autumnal synths, beating back Mancunian misery via fair-weather melody until the whole song suddenly veers off into a Brazilian Carnivale. Then there's the obvious Joy Division nod, ""(Lack of) Love Will Tear Us Apart"", a wistful falling-out-of-love song with crackling Euro-house drum programming, faraway multi-tracked vocals by Hanna Göranson of Gothenburg electro-pop duo Cat 5, and a faltering rap verse (!) from Carlsson. If this one never gets played at a middle-school dance, the industry is in worse shape than we thought. Here Comes the Future is packed with what the pros still call ""perfect pop"", but despite clocking in at just 34 minutes, it works as more than a collection of singles. ""The Strangest Dream"" starts off with a glance backward, then sets the emotional stakes dangerously high: ""Last night I had the strangest dream/ I met the boy who raped you,"" Carlsson sings over intricate acoustic guitar, emphatic bass, tambourine, and a ""Be My Baby"" beat that is thankfully understated. ""Trying Something New"" combines more early-New Order rhythmic drive with arena-sized guitars, gusting synths, and terse lyrics about ""a place where you and I can go."" On ""The Walk"", tambourine backs a traipsing tune about a visit from ever-present Death. Amid flutes and loungey chords, finale ""In Some Distant Future"" goes back to to the opening ""dream"" theme, again on a scale that's both epic and intimate. Carlsson dreams of post-apocalyptic archaelogists, digging for clues about our civilization. They find a list of his dream girl's lovers-- and on it, our narrator's name. Dean finally makes his appearance on ""Fall From a Height"", a hypnotic dance track that's based, as Saint Etienne have done before, on a couple of spoken-word samples. Appropriately, this is Here Comes the Future at its most existential and its most romantic alike. Carlsson sings about literally falling to his death, then turns sappily metaphorical: ""I think I'm falling for you."" Meanwhile, the kid version of Woody Allen's Annie Hall character won't do his homework because he just found out the universe is going to end someday so now he knows everything is pointless, and Dean's interjecting out of Rebel Without a Cause: ""If I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused, and I didn't have to feel that I was ashamed of everything. If I felt that I belonged someplace. You know?"" Please, let's not talk about the past. As with the Field Mice, the Honeydrips will be anathema to some, especially those who conflate bravery with balls, the avant-garde with equipment-measuring, or sex with conquest. It may be in humanity's animal nature to exploit every weakness and avenge every grievance, but our species' greatest hits have always suggested we were capable of something more. (Nietzsche might call that ""slave morality,"" but whatever, he got syphilis.) On the Honeydrips' MySpace page, Carlsson quotes a line from one of Felt's best songs: ""It's better to be lost than to be found."" Here comes the end of the universe.","Marrying the shimmery indie-dance of Saint Etienne and the Field Mice's starry-eyed earnestness, Swedish singer/songwriter Mikael Carlsson's full-length debut is a staggering monument to gentle loners everywhere.

...And All the Pieces Matter: Five Years of Music From The Wire / Beyond Hamsterdam: Baltimore Tracks from The Wire,Various Artists,by: Tom Breihan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b400b1335d7bf169a6a7/1:1/w_160/05a01d07.jpg,2008-01-10 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11646-and-all-the-pieces-matter-five-years-of-music-from-the-wire-beyond-hamsterdam-baltimore-tracks-from-the-wire/,Nonesuch,"In the past few months, it's been virtually impossible to open any mass-market magazine without seeing some scribe's rapturous doodles about ""The Wire"", HBO's Baltimore street opera, now revving up its fifth and final season. So allow Pitchfork to join the deafening hype-tsunami: ""The Wire"" is the best thing to happen to television since the remote control; it weaves a dizzying multiplicity of storylines together, never letting its edge-of-seat suspensefulness eclipse its all-consuming empathy, hardly ever presenting an altogether unsympathetic character on either side of the drug war or within the machinery of politics or education. It's a great show, and its greatness rarely, if ever, has anything to do with music. [Warning: Sone DVD viewers may find slight plot spoilers below.] That's by design. Creators David Simon and Ed Burns have opted to take a naturalistic approach to the show's soundtrack, and the only time you hear music is when it actually happens to be playing within the show, blaring over a bar's speakers or seeping from an open car-window. And so the music playing during the show often has nothing to do with the action taking place: A detective tails a drug-lord while jamming the oldies radio, say, or an assassin receives his grim orders while cheesily euphoric club-rap bangs on the boombox behind him. And many of the show's most memorable music-related moments come from characters talking about music, not listening to it: Pragmatic kingpin Stringer Bell voices a commonly held Baltimore belief when he tells a D.C. hitman how much he hates go-go, gunman Chris Partlow hunts down interloping New York drug-dealers by asking them trivia questions about Baltimore club. The show allows itself a few exceptions to its self-imposed restrictions. Every show starts with a version of Tom Waits' devil-chasing-me lament ""Way Down in the Hole"", a different take every season, and each season ends with a masterful montage set to a different song. And sometimes the show cheats a bit on those restrictions; when ex-gangster boxing coach Cutty goes for an election-day jog, his discman soundtrack, Curtis Mayfield's ""Move on Up"", suddenly becomes the soundtrack to a voting-booth montage. Sometimes it doesn't even have to cheat. One of my favorite scenes in the show's history is a barroom wake for a dead detective, where every cop in the room, black and white, drunkenly bellows along with the Pogues' ""The Body of an American"". Most of the great moments on ...And All the Pieces Matter, Nonesuch's new ""Wire"" soundtrack, come from the pavlovian joy that the show's fans already have. Solomon Burke's warmly elegiac cover of Van Morrison's ""Fast Train"", for instance, is great by any measure, but it gains added heft if you remember it as the song from the Season 3 montage, the one playing when Avon Barksdale turns around in his courthouse seat to see Marlo Stanfield, his blood rival, sitting behind him. The dialogue snippets from the show don't hurt either. But it's tough to recommend ...And All the Pieces Matter as a continuous piece of music for anyone who isn't already a devoted fan of the show. While something like Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction soundtrack works as a stand-alone object, all but a handful of the songs here depend heavily on the context of the show. The four versions of ""Way Down in the Hole"" included make for some serious repetitive overkill, and the politically charged backpack-rap of the show's first season mix uneasily with the local Baltimore thug-rap that the show's producers were making an effort to include by the fourth. And while it's great to have ""The Body of an American"" and all the montage-songs from the show's first season on CD, I'd have to imagine that anyone who cares about the show already had those songs downloaded months ago. The best reason to pony up money for ...And All the Pieces Matter is the packaging: A thick booklet full of photos from the show and insightful essays from Simon, novelist and show contributor George Pelecanos, and hip-hop writer Jeff Chang. Most of the tracks on Beyond Hamsterdam: Baltimore Tracks from The Wire show up on ...And All the Pieces Matter, though many of them come in abridged form there. But Beyond Hamsterdam still makes for a more compelling end-to-end listen than Pieces largely because it depends so little on the show for its context. During production of the show's fourth season, the show's creators noticed that ""The Wire"" had had a galvanizing effect on Baltimore's developing local rap scene; Darkroom Productions, an indie-label and production crew, had released a couple of mixtapes named after Hamsterdam, the drug-dealing free-zone from the show's third season, and virtually every local rap anthem was at least dropping the name of the show. And so Simon and Burns decided to repay the favor, including music from a whole lot of rappers and making a heartfelt show of local boosterism. So we have Beyond Hamsterdam, a compilation of local Baltimore rap from an honest-to-God major label. From anyone who's been paying attention to the scrappy local scene for the past few years, it's an inspiring development. Baltimore has never produced a major rapper, though a few, like Tupac and DMX, have roots in the city. Baltimore does have a distinct local sound, but it's not rap. It's club music, a frantic mutant strain of breakbeat house that developed in the city's black clubs for years before anyone outside the area code took notice. A couple of club tracks show up on Beyond Hamsterdam, and one of them, Rod Lee's urban-blues exhortation ""Dance My Pain Away"", bears the curious distinction of being the only Baltimore club track more fun to think about than it is to listen to. The collection is also bookended by a pair of non-rap songs: the season-four theme and jazz pianist Lafayette Gilchrist's terse but funky ""Assume the Position"". But the bulk of Hamsterdam showcases the city's rap scene the same way that, say, the Swisha House compilation The Day Hell Broke Loose 2 documented the rappers on Houston's north side. Baltimore sits right on the border between North and South, so most of the MCs included bring a curious combination of New York snarl and Southern bounce to their delivery. And the influence of Baltimore club makes itself felt in the preponderance of handclaps and tinny synths. But this is a scene still finding its voice, and some of the tracks here are flat-out bad: The Get 'Em Mamis' ""When You See Us"" is amateurish girl-rap, and Dirty Hartz' ""That's Da Sound"" obscures some hard, hungry rapping behind its unbelievably annoying hook. But most of the tracks here are hard and immediate, and it's interesting to see how many of the rappers echo the show's theme of systemic urban decay. Ogun's ""What You Know About Baltimore"" is a burnt-out ghetto lament, and Tyree Colion's ""Projects"" remembers the city's demolished developments with a curious mix of disenfranchised rage and happy nostalgia: ""This song going to the people in the hood/ On the worst side of things, but it's still all good."" And the best song on the album, Diablo's ""Jail Flick"", turns the act of positing for jail photos into a dance: ""We don't rockaway, we don't vogue/ We from Baltimore, we just pose."" There's a message there, but you have to pay attention to catch it.",,6.6,
Wedding Day EP,Marla Hansen,by: Stephen M.

Another collaborator is Sufjan Stevens, with whom she has toured and recorded repeatedly; he returns the favors by singing and playing piano on several tracks on her debut EP, Wedding Day. Perhaps more interesting than these indie gigs, however, is her recent work with two names that stick out on her résumé: In 2006, she performed with Jay-Z during his Reasonable Doubt anniversary show at Radio City Music Hall, and earlier this year, she was part of Kanye West's backing band for his ""Saturday Night Live"" appearance. Neither of these stars shows up on Wedding Day of course, but the hip-hop influence is subtly present on these songs, specifically in the way Hansen uses her violin to create rhythm rather than melody. When she bows, she bows for ambience, but on Wedding Day, she primarily plucks out simple staccato notes to form percussive themes that will define and drive the songs. All other instruments follow suit, whether it's tambourine and sleigh bells bolstering her rhythms on opener ""A Friend Indeed"", a full band and choir filling out ""All Clear"", or Stevens' plaintive piano intertwining with her ascending notes on the title track. The minimal and mostly subdued music on Wedding Day creates a unique space for her vocals, compensating for her limited range with unexpected filigrees that enlarge but never disrupt the record's genial ambience. Her voice is surprisingly malleable on ""Talk to Me"", where she sustains and slurs notes to draw out the title phrase to fit the melody. The downside to this approach is that these six songs all seem to convey the same mood, which makes this EP sound repetitive and as long as a full album. As Hansen transitions from a sidewoman to a frontwoman, she occasionally sounds more imitative than original, as passages sound overly similar to artists like Regina Spektor (especially on ""Talk to Me"", which mimics ""Fidelity"" down to the vocal breaks on the phrase ""break my heart""). She's not as flighty as Spektor, which means Hansen doesn't have as much personality. Nor does she have the ambition of Tin Cup Prophette, the Athens, Ga. violinist whose album Liar and the Thief was flawed but much more exotic and distinctive. Nevertheless, Hansen asserts herself fairly well on Wedding Day, mapping out her own songs and trying hard to determine her own sound-- a challenge for any debuting artist, but a necessity for one so strongly associated with other musicians.","Best known as a sidewoman for Jay-Z, Kanye West, Sufjan Stevens, the National, and My Brightest Diamond, this Wisconsin violinist finally steps out of the shadows on this Stevens-produced debut.

595,Karate,by: Aaron Leitko,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3c15e6ef959693224e0/1:1/w_160/6f97402d.jpg,2008-01-09 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10972-595/,Southern,"If there was ever a band that struggled to overcome sounding cold and mannered, Karate was it. Guitarist/singer Geoff Farina's deeply considered Donald Fagan-meets-D. Boon noodling, aching yet oblique lyrics, and clean, almost skeletal guitars hardly made for sexy listening-- unless you somehow associate aural-hotness with post-structuralism or wet shoes. So it's a surprise that 595-- Karate's first live album-- is so warm and energetic. In a sense a Karate live album is a strange proposition because, given the ideal circumstances, said live record should sound just like a regular Karate record. Some musicians use the studio as an instrument-- they alter sounds, toy with effects, and realize possibilities that don't exist in a live environment. But not Karate. The Boston band-- who disbanded in 2005-- may have been lead by a serious Tape-Op-contributing gear geek, but they tended to let their instruments be the instruments and to use the studio to simply record them. As a result, Karate's formal records sound like a solid recording of a trio of musicians playing jazzy, soft-rock influenced emo in a nice room-- which is ostensibly what they were. 595-- a recording of the band's 595th show, performed in Leuven, Belgium-- is also a solid recording of trio of musicians playing instruments in a nice room. The difference here is that that this time there's also an audience. But if it weren't for the presence of light applause and mild stage banter, 595 could easily be mistaken for a Karate studio record-- except that, more often than not, it's better. Every member of Karate had some sort of formal musical training, and developing deeper musicianship was obviously a priority for Farina and his cohorts. And they got a lot tighter in the years between that Death Kit/Nerve 7"" and Some Boots-- both individually and as an ensemble. 595's versions of earlier songs like The Bed Is in the Ocean's ""There Are Ghosts"" and Karate's ""Caffeine or Me?"" are superior to their studio counterparts. Farina has more control of his voice and ""Caffeine"" even ends with a five-minute improv that's sweatier than anything that the band ever put to tape in the studio. Later songs such as the Some Boots track ""In Hundreds"" also benefit from the energy of live performance-- coming off heavier with more frantic drumming and a slanted guitar solo worthy of any of Farina's idols. Karate's studio albums may have suffered some frigid moments, but 595 proves that Farina and his cohorts weren't wet noodles. Beyond the tube amp obsession and the couplets about refrigerator noise, Karate was actually a dynamic and exciting band. And they were even better when somebody was watching.","Karate's first official live album-- a recording of the band's 595th show, performed in Leuven, Belgium-- shows how far they evolved as musicians during their decade-long run.

Let's Talk About It EP,White Denim,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3f3ea9e61561daa6b97/1:1/w_160/6b37faa8.jpg,2008-01-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11019-lets-talk-about-it-ep/,self-released,"During the autumn of 1966, L.A. band the Music Machine had a Top 20 hit with ""Talk Talk,"" a manic, freakbeat ode to that standard emotion of the era's rock: angst at being misunderstood, compounded by the self-loathing that comes from the inability to sufficiently explain what's happening. Forty-two years later, the first EP from Texas trio White Denim-- appropriately titled Let's Talk About It-- sounds like the Music Machine's hip grandson, all grimy, convulsive rawk with a heavy dollop of Texas scuzz and cocksure spaz. Its title indicates singer James Petralli has a similar communicative problem as the Machine's Sean Bonniwell (or Roger Daltrey or Eric Burdon, for that matter), yet Petralli is more confrontational about it. On the title track, the band rides a hyperactive torn woofer riff like a mechanical bull, and Petralli not only forcibly engages with someone, but takes the next step and wants a reaction. The band's own reciprocation is sufficiently psychotic; the song goes on for about two minutes longer than it should, twisting that core riff into a squelched-out, hyper-stimulated barrage of sounds, echoing Petralli's own neologism describing his lyrics: ""trucklandish."" ""I Can Tell"" deals with verbosity as well, using ""your talkin'"" as an insight into understanding that the other person is ""not right."" It's not a question of wrongness as much as one of mental stability, though; the chorus ""did you forget to chew your medicine, honey?"" explains that much. ""Tell""'s sonic selling point is its periodic two-note organ-sonar ping, a heavily-echoed distant cousin of the ""96 Tears"" Farfisa, and the only sound of stability within the primal polyrythmic fury of drummer Josh Block. Rising above the lo-fi clatter, it fills the same function as the falsetto-soul breakdown that brings ""Darksided Computer Mouth"" to a temporary breath-catching halt. The same holds for the squawking guitar siren from ""Mess Your Hair Up"", which explores miscommunication at the familiar level of a troubled relationship. It appears from the hissy murk of Block's rumble as the first verse ends (""why cant you speak? let me know?""), and pushes its way to the front. ""Talk Talk"" may have made it onto Lenny Kaye's canon-establishing Nuggets collection six years after its release, but within the current environment, White Denim would do well to get in an iPhone commercial or something. You can't sell technology without style, as this scene-baiting couplet from ""Mouth"" confirms: ""You know you've got to read words hard/ If you're trying to learn the super cool talks.""  As for getting noticed in the crowded indie 2.0 field, the unsigned band (with a punk-as-fuck vinyl-only 7"" as its only release, from Austin) is making the right moves: They're ubiquitous on monster Dallas-based mp3 blog Gorilla vs. Bear, they killed at SXSW 2007, and they struck a deal with faddish Engadget/Downtown Records online blog/imprint RCRD LBL to release one new mp3 a month for 2008's first quarter. The music on Let's Talk About It, like others have done for over 50 years now, channels addled youthful frustration into a buzzing romp of the sort that, when done well (as with White Denim's closest chronological predecessors Jon Spencer and Royal Trux), doesn't ever seem to get old. The record title also conveys a sense of the clatter surrounding the band: Hype Machined buzz, after all, is likewise just a bunch of people talking about the same music at the same time, right?","The Meaty, Beaty, Bloggy, and Buzzy Austin trio's first EP.

Sandwiches & Cats,Michael Showalter,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3adea9e61561daa6b28/1:1/w_160/ab44dfa1.jpg,2008-01-09 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10954-sandwiches-cats/,JDub,"It's funny to think that Michael Showalter is roughly the same age as the thirty-somethings just recently garnering significant exposure on the stand-up circuit. In many ways, Showalter seems like he's from an entirely different generation of alternative comedy compared to current staples like Patton Oswalt or Demetri Martin. Rather than cutting his teeth opening for indie bands, Showalter is one of the last bastions of that glorious pre-YouTube age where TV networks actually produced tons of hilarious comedy shows with talented writers and performers. So, with a hefty résumé that includes beloved 1990s sketch show The State, cult classic Wet Hot American Summer, and the viral ""Stella"" short videos, Showalter doesn't have much to prove on the relaxed, almost effortless Sandwiches & Cats, his first comedy album. While Sandwiches doesn't strive to be a full-fledged magnum opus like Oswalt's Werewolves and Lollipops or Martin's These Are Jokes, Showalter's goofy sensibility, which come totally free of the explicit and/or implicit Bush-era angst so prevalent in today's comedy, feels like a breath of fresh air. The album's stand-up bits, recorded at Brooklyn's Union Hall, are not only a-topical, but a-political as well. Even Zach Galifianakis, an equally absurdist stand-up performer, occasionally throws in jabs at Middle America or the Iraq War alongside his oddball non-sequiturs. Showalter, on the other hand, feels completely isolated from current events or politics, instead blowing his lid over situations like the Starbucks customer who continually jiggles the bathroom door handle when he's trying to pee, or when, in an impromptu rant that's almost too cruel to be funny, Showalter humiliates and then kicks out an audience member for bringing two meowing cats to his show. Unlike most comedy albums, Showalter's stand-up tracks aren't cut and pasted from a huge selection of performances to create one immaculate string of jokes, each punchline followed by thunderous laughter and applause. As a result, energy is lacking at some points, though Showalter's too talented a performer to let the gig turn into amateur hour. Also injecting some spunk into the disc, Showalter throws in some short skits-- most notably an aggravating customer service call with Time Warner that any subscribing Brooklyn resident can relate to all too well-- as well as some musical humor with his band the Dollies. These songs fall somewhere between Tenacious D and Flight of the Conchords as Showalter carries out a running gag about a past part-time job writing outdoors lifestyle pieces with erotic themes, usually with little accompaniment aside from a simple acoustic guitar riff. However, the real highlights occur when Showalter utilizes his sketch acting abilities, rapidly shifting characters ranging from a teenage version of himself to a stilted Dickensian doctor diagnosing restless leg syndrome. Sandwiches & Cats may not measure up to the most memorable works in Showalter's accomplished career, but the comedian's loose smugness on these recordings suggests he doesn't aspire for the album to be anything more than a run-through of his talents-- talents that, at the very least, are good for a quick comedy fix.","Mixing stand-up, skits, and musical numbers, this veteran indie comedy writer-performer's first album ably demonstrates the range of his talent.

Death Is This Communion,High on Fire,by: Brandon Stosuy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3f513d197565213aa1d/1:1/w_160/624653ff.jpg,2008-01-09 06:00:01,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11021-death-is-this-communion/,Relapse,"Death Is This Communion, High on Fire's fourth album, was one of my 10 favorite albums in 2007, and I was far from alone. If you aren't already in the know, though, let this serve as some sort of wakeup call to the Oakland band's best collection to date. Don't worry about arriving late at the party: Despite the music's unrelenting roll, my entire experience with Death has been laid back...I listened to it a dozen times before bothering to check the song titles. After memorizing each track, the shifts in those torching guitar riffs, the names didn't come as much of a surprise. For instance, ""Fury Whip"" is the perfect way to describe the lashing opener. It starts with more than a minute of galloping guitar, drums (note Des Kensel's double bass thumping), and bass from new member Jeff Matz, before guitarist/vocalist Matt Pike tears in with his hoarse chipped-tooth snarl. More than ever before, Pike's singing, not just his guitar playing, is a power onto itself. We already knew from his Sleep days he could pick an axe like a motherfucker, but man...maybe it's the cleaner, bigger, ballsier Jack Endino production, or the proper combination of whiskey and cigarettes and time, but Pike's at the point where his vocal and guitar chords have grizzled and wizened perfectly. (Lemmy, sir, watch your back.) When discussing Death you need to focus on Pike, but also go back to Endino. To the collection (and Jack's) credit, it ends up a deflating experience listening to 2005's Blessed Black Wings in tandem. At the time of the earlier album's release, it seemed like Joe Preston's bass and Steve Albini's production had given High on Fire their most monumental, thunderous sound to date, but weirdly, it's pretty limp in comparison. Musically, Blessed Black was punkier, and in restrospect, the songwriting just isn't as good. Outside of production, Death is both streamlined and epic. There are a number of rollicking patterns and shifts to the usual hard-edged rock, like the Eastern-tinged instrumental ""Khanrad's Wall"", the rising clatter drum solo of ""Headhunter"", or the jangle that establishes itself behind the smokiness of ""Waste of Tiamat"". The shimmering acoustic intro jangle to ""Cyclopian Scape"" offers a whiff of pastoral Sabbathian doom before the riff explosion. High on Fire are getting uncanny at knowing when to insert these sorts of details, but for all the awesome adds to the music, it's the rawest moments that feel the best: From its opening Celtic Frost grunt onward, ""Rumors of War"" rollicks all bad-ass and overdriven like a mathier spin on Motörhead's ""Ace of Spades"". The fucking mighty ""Turk"" reels through War Metal until it slides into groovier (but just as heavy) bong waters and ""black psychology"": ""My cage's walls are closing in on me/ The rage that surfaces is not my soul/ It's like a devil taking control/ The violence lives in me and will not leave/ Like a magician with pain up his sleeve."" Pike has said he was inspired by conspiracy theories and H.P. Lovecraft on the album (what metal band isn't these days?), and a number of the songs have that enjoyable occult tinge to their lyrics, though maybe nothing as D&D as something like ""Surrounded By Thieves"" (OK, minus ""Cyclopian Scape""'s reptilian alien race, ""lemurian throne,"" and etc). In terms of Sleep-- because those terms refuse to go away-- this is High on Fire's Jerusalem. Outside of HoF's ascent, it's interesting to see Pike hit his peak just as his ex-Sleep bandmates in Om moved toward theirs with the appropriately titled Pilgrimage-- they continue chiseling into a sparer minimalist realm, while High on Fire inscribe additional accents into their crusty rock. It's rare to see such a cohesive trio split into two groups that both become so powerful, ascending at the same time with such distinct aesthetics. Here, actually, the title track's vocal lines are kinda Om-- that smearier stoner incantation slide-- but Pike and Co. otherwise continue moving deeper into their amphetamine-laced rock monster. Much less the old dope smoke. So, high on a different sort of fire. If you haven't already, make sure to inhale both.",,8.2,
Little Hours,Spokane,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3d7b1335d7bf169a660/1:1/w_160/9493b127.jpg,2008-01-08 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10991-little-hours/,Jagjaguwar,"The members of Spokane hand-built a house while recording Little Hours, which isn't to say that the album is about the house they built. If it were, the place would be virtually uninhabitable: sprawling, drafty, and sparsely furnished, with hallways leading nowhere, gaps in the flooring, staircases petering out in mid-flight. It's more accurate to say that the house and the album are about each other, parallel expressions of the spiritual temperament that attends the constructive urge: If the house is just a house, Little Hours is its reflection on the surface of a pond. To build with one's hands has always been a spiritual act, and now, when so many of us no longer need to do so to survive, it's perhaps more so than ever. Maybe the title of Spokane's album intentionally refers to the Roman Catholic Church's daytime prayer hours, or maybe they just thought it sounded neat. Accidental or no, it's an apt title-- there's a sense of consecration in Spokane's humble altars of piano, strings, and guitar, a quiet air of unrushed ritual in their contemplative movement. Album opener ""Singing"", which features the sampled birdsong ubiquitous to this sort of atmospheric slowcore amid a wispy piano ballad sung by Rick Alverson, sounds more like an idea for a song, recorded with a jaw full of anesthetics, than a finished song. This music doesn't assert itself, it kneels, reverent as a worshiper, inside its own austere architecture. Like a house, Spokane's songs are assembled in plain view, over time, piece by modest piece. On ""Minor Careers"", sunken vocal harmonies and weary percussion lay like mortar between sequentially mounted bricks of arpeggiated acoustic guitar, hovering strings, and flecks of piano. Like a house built by hand, practical exigencies take precedence over flights of fancy-- the materials are functional and unembellished, fitted together with an eye toward structural integrity more than style, combined not wantonly but with deliberate care. ""Building"" holds real piano and toy piano in delicate counterbalance, the former tracing out a submerged melody, the latter bubbling up through it. Little Hours' strength lies in its stubborn consistency: This is a band that makes notes seem like widely-spaced campfires on a dark plain, tracing an intermittent path of life through the barren night, and they don't ever pull back from this imposing blankness. Nothing on the album breaks its somber, lonesome mood. But its weakness lies in the equivocal aura of the band's chosen style-- neither minimal enough to achieve the hypnotic quality of fellow piano-droners Library Tapes nor fleshed out enough to engage the listener more viscerally, Spokane's music can settle frustratingly into the ambiguous mid-range of our attention. Rare sonic embellishments, like the echo effect on the creeping piano of ""Thankless Marriage"", are welcome, but simply protract the structures through time in a way that doesn't meaningfully diversify them. The result is an album that's thoroughly pleasant without having any truly memorable moments, like Galaxie 500 without the buried pop chops. It's a fine house that Spokane has built, functional and rich with decorative potential. Maybe next time, they'll throw some pictures on the walls.","Jagjaguwar band has a sense of consecration in their humble piano, strings, and guitar, and a quiet air of unrushed ritual in their contemplative movement.

Endless Coast,Jazkamer,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3dec0084474cd0c21c7/1:1/w_160/981c8096.jpg,2008-01-08 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10998-endless-coast/,No Fun,"Sometimes bands take their names from highbrow sources: Bauhaus from the architectural school, Art of Noise from the Futurist manifesto, Birthday Party from the Pinter play, the Fall from Camus, Scritti Politti from Gramsci, Genesis from Sega. Sadly the stories behind the juicy lowbrow names are mostly apocryphal. They must have dirty minds in Manchester, because no, 10cc weren't christened in honor of their superior ejaculation volume, nor were the Buzzcocks a sly reference to bus-driver erections. Smegma, however, can refer to only one thing. It was a perfectly grotesque match, the name and the band. When a cluster of (then) Los Angeles artistes banded together against the fascism we now call prog-rock, they needed something that captured their viscous, out-there brand of soundclash. They went for the Yes fan's jugular. Hence Smegma. Now considered one of the, well, seminal stars in noise rock, thanks to some hip revisionism, the band has also become one of the scene's most-wanted collaborators. Hence this record, Endless Coast, created with Norway's Jazkamer, alias John Hegre and Lasse Marhaug, who enlist here the bass-synth thuggery of No Fun's Carlos Giffoni. Offering sanctuary from the glossy concision of verse-chorus-verse-- from all of pop's commandments and borders-- noise music can easily tip over into concept art. Jazkamer and Smegma walk this line with studied gracelessness. Taking cues from free jazz, they roam and dart, instead of adopting the sublime brutality of noise. The title ""Heavy Fog"" captures the mood and texture of this expertly conceived opener. A quick listen reveals 12 minutes of amorphous, foreboding haze, though a deeper study begins to grab at something like structure. All-over clatter gives way to Giffoni's waves of low-end rumble, setting the stage for the messy, wedding-cake compositions to follow. Layer upon layer of instrumental and incidental noise seep together-- overheard clauses, cuckoo clocks, film-noir horn samples, the buzz and zap of synthesizers, a radio failing to find a frequency-- before everything settles down halfway into the track. This is the first purge. The next moment we hear a steady knock, then frenzies of drumming and wintry gales of noise as the song aggressively builds up again, before a second purge. The cacophony purifies nearly into white noise, inflected with a hum and screech of brass: off-white noise. The tiered squall of ""Heavy Fog"" vanishes into the halting, stop-start logic of ""White Witch"". Beginning with an identical atmosphere of distorted rattling, the song draws toward silence before rebooting into a second movement, where we catch flashes of a manipulated human voice, and an exhausting, exhausted final movement, suggesting both a sputtering engine and battering ram. The album sags only slightly after the midpoint. ""Portland Swamps"" adds up to little more than a simple sum of its parts: humming, a steady chug, whirls and whistles. A continuous tone unites the loose pieces, which after settling down, fade into a sewing-machine pulse and nature sounds that, poking into higher registers, recall seagulls or dolphins. Is ""Stone Eater"" about the Rockbiter from The Neverending Story? It's just frivolous enough. Heavy on distorted vocals, which slowly devolve into unpleasant, subhuman squirts-- like Jabba the Hutt talking in his sleep, or slowly choking to death-- there is certainly a monstrous presence here. The rest of the composition, a whiny synth twirling above rustling cymbals, stops short of resolving the question. Deeply satisfying and enigmatically misspelled, ""Carniviorous Bog"" plays with the listener. Could this really be a rustic piece? The curling flutes, the songbirds trick us into entertaining the possibility. Soon technology careens in, right on cue, the sound of a peeling-out muscle car and thunderous drums shattering the peace, while a lone high note hangs like a dust cloud over the chaos. Bits of sped-up, prelingual mumbling appear and disappear. Then a fiery blaze of distortion and eerie tones ramps up the drama again, before a human voice wanders back in, faintly ethnic ululating and then what sounds like recorded newscasts. A steady cymbal rush cuts off the jabber, clearing the space for a bittersweet surf-rock coda, a groove that the Ventures could have dashed off, that dissolves into whooshing radio static, like a man into the ocean. The psychedelic M.O. of Smegma-- the katana-sharp angles, acoustic whimsy, the Trout Mask replications, Dadaist sound-poetry-- never fades from visibility. But Endless Coast finds the laptop vandals Jazkamer and Giffoni brilliantly insinuated into the picture. To Smegma's surreal splotches and random gestures, they add a glacial, futuristic precision to the canvas, tracing and echoing the old band's manic gestures. It means that, amorphous as Endless Coast may be, the fury is always controlled and the chaos never fully surrenders its coherence.","L.A. noise stars combine with Norway's Jazkamer, alias John Hegre and Lasse Marhaug, who enlist here the bass-synth thuggery of No Fun's Carlos Giffoni, on this No Fun release.

Super Gangster (Extraordinary Gentleman),Styles P,by: Evan McGarvey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3b69d034d5c69bf4d60/1:1/w_160/c2283037.jpg,2008-01-08 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10962-super-gangster-extraordinary-gentleman/,Koch,"The release of Styles P's latest album, Super Gangster (Extraordinary Gentleman), was practically a holiday miracle. It was barely 12 months ago that his sophomore album, Time Is Money, thudded into record stores hungover on a three-year delay with nary a peep or stapled poster from Interscope. To absolutely no one's surprise, it came and went and faded. The difference between Time Is Money and the burly Super Gangster, the spiritual successor to 2002's underrated A Gangster and a Gentleman: Would you believe...Koch Records? Taking about twice as much money per CD (hook no. 1 of the Koch business model) and working in a famously speedy, hands-off label (no. 2), Styles not only puts out a better album than before, but in roughly one-third the time, and one that maximizes his strengths, drywalls up his holes, and keeps it moving through a one-stop front end, a soggy middle and (thankfully) a clubberin' final third. Sins first: Swizz Beatz convincing himself he's Pharrell on the otherwise blissy keyboard starbursts of ""Blow Your Mind"". Ray J trying to forge a career outside Kim Kardashian's genitals and ""Moeisha"". Using part of the budget to spring Dipset cabana boy Max B. from the clink. Composing ""Look at Her"" and ""Green Piece of Paper"" with the same love of foggy keyboard and schlock from the 80s teen film prom bands. Even with those messes it's hard to penalize Styles directly. The worst elements of the album are the hooks and rote guest appearances; Styles' verses are structurally sound, show durable movement, and are warm in his voice-- a sharp, baritone a quintessentially soft New York accent that's as much a part of the Dutch English legacy as Kool Moe Dee's. With the right combination of subject or guest, he takes off on the worn in gangster-as-Sufi-warrior-poet tropes. He goes toe-to-toe with Ghostface in the penalty box (""Star of the State"") and escapes with smiles and bruises. When he tries too hard on stoner ode ""Blow Your Mind"" he spins slop imagism-- ""I'm good, the sky couldn't be a deeper blue/ Sun lookin' like a tangerine""-- but listen midline and he gets in unconsciously smooth mini-sequences (""mind blown, time flies, time flown""). Styles P is one of the few guys who genuinely sounds comfortable in crossing over from specific, constant gun talk to genuine conscious rhetoric-- here trading 1960s Civil Rights Movement images with Black Thought on ""Cause I'm Black"". It's kind of a shame that Super Gangster doesn't have more of Styles feeling unwound and intellectual. The album's final quarter has both feet in that muddled territory, and the best possible Styles album would be another 30 minutes of this stuff. Super Gangster might be duller, too, because of just how delightfully common Styles P's recent career arc is becoming. The retracting rap market has produced a safe enough estuary of established national rappers-- at least half a decade of LPs, most cases more-- and the willingness to make their own album outside the golden handcuffs (Project Pat, Prodigy, Little Brother) or succeed under tempered label expectations, earned fan base, and a market vacuum (UGK, Beanie Siegel, Freeway). Don't look now hip-hop, the underground is getting overcrowded.","Just a year after his sophomore album came and went without fanfare, Styles regroups, signs with Koch, and issues the spiritual successor to 2002's underrated A Gangster and a Gentleman.

Frelen Mas: Be He Me B-Sides,Annuals,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3f05e6ef9596932252f/1:1/w_160/fdd012b9.jpg,2008-01-08 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11017-frelen-mas-be-he-me-b-sides/,Ace Fu,"In the wake of Be He Me, Annuals became marginally famous in a manner that had little to do with their actual music and lots to do with the current intersection of online music crit and fandom. As Bill Wasik's Oxford American essay explained it, the over-stimulated, barely-legal North Carolinians were the representative recepients of the Web-based meritocratic hype-churn, with those not enough in front of the curve resigned to making comments about their lateness to the party. The expansive, scattered praise Wasik documents echoes the sound of the Annuals' actual music, too (he writes: ""that autumn, Annuals sounded like the future""): Both were free-for-alls with penchants for hyperbolic swoops of emotion. Indeed, Be He Me was a document of the giddy thrills of unfettered youthful experimentataion-- in the studio and, er, the other kind. Songs that started pleasantly enough often spontaneously combusted like a meth lab, whether through too many volatile elements forming an indie-symphonic bomb or the sheer will of Adam Baker's maniacal, unhinged ranting. All of this-- the sonic immensity, the rural-prog classicism, the online buzz-- was enough for the hype-miners at Sony/Columbia to take notice, and before the band's bow this fall on the corporation's Canvasback boutique label, we get the B-side stopgap Frelen Mas EP. Frelen, like its predecessor, **is a flea market's worth of loud/soft dynamics, strings, glitches, overstimulation, hollerin', and nature, scattered like buckshot off a front porch. Aside from the colonialist brass fanfare opening of ""Nah Keseyi"", there's not much here that doesn't follow the same shaggy, druggy template as Be He Me: the dynamic shifts and fragile psyche of The Soft Bulletin, the occasionally sublime messiness of an Appalachian Broken Social Scene. The appropriately titled, occasionally pretty ""Misty Coy"" is suddenly interrupted by Baker's impudent screaming, and the equally descriptively named ""Such a Mess"" is an admixture of rusty junkyard electronics and dark chanting that never really leaves the shed. ""River Run"" is a busy saloon stomper with a shouted lyric that seems to sum up the band's M.O.: ""Don't you live in fear."" Emotionally, Baker still struggles with the poles of rural existence, and Frelen is shot through with the placidity/psychosis dichotomy that made Be He Me so appealing. On ""Sewn to Kites"" (Frelen's update of ""Brother""), this happens within a single song: Tenative folk suddenly gives way to towering panic as Baker's tether to reality abandons him: ""All my fishing lines/ Got cut and sewn to kites."" ""Ease My Mind"" sees Baker organizing his surroundings into a glimmering BSS glide that, somehow logically, turns into a hoe-down. The EP-closing title track reminds us that living in the sticks can still provide simple pleasures, taking a moment to absorb the sounds of birds chirping and children playing outdoors while still allowing the countryside to create gasps of astonishment. Nick Tosches used the ""twisted roots"" metaphor to connect American rural music (""a crazy bastard sort of thing"") from as far back as the 17th century to what would eventually become rock'n'roll. Annuals are far from a country band in any popularly understood sense of the term, yet they seem equally cosmically attuned to their surroundings as the gentrified descendants of the wild shadowland (you can see the band's fascination with real roots on each album's art). Their cover of ""Swing Low, Sweet Chariot"" is fitting in this greater context, not for political or racial reasons as much as the song's universal appeal for transcendence from chaotic surroundings. Unlike the blog-(and-'Fork) fueled mess of praise and hype these kids had to wade through in 2006, Frelen, like its predecessor**, is how this collective sounds when struggling to make sense of its own frenzied fantasy world.","Before web sensations Annuals make their jump to the majors this fall, we're given this B-side stopgap.

The Cool,Lupe Fiasco,by: Mark Pytlik,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3f6ea9e61561daa6b9b/1:1/w_160/719263fe.jpg,2008-01-08 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11022-the-cool/,Atlantic1st and 15th,"Serious bonus points go out to anyone who can manage to extract some kind of meaningful narrative out of The Cool, Lupe Fiasco's purported concept album. His pre-hype interviews may have informed us that the record centers around three metaphysical characters called The Cool (spun off from the track of the same name from Lupe's 2006 debut Food & Liquor), The Streets, and The Game, but it turns out those facts-- or any discernable storyline, really-- aren't immediately evident from just, you know, listening to the album. There's a fine line between respecting your listeners' intelligence and mistaking your own vague allusions and abstrusities for some kind of coherent statement, and this time around, Lupe's landed on the wrong side of that line. But here's the thing: The Cool ultimately features enough isolated moments of widescreen drama that what it fails to deliver in terms of a linear experience, it makes up for in sheer pathos. There are genuinely thrilling moments to be had here; some of it from Fiasco's storytelling abilities, some of it from his lyrical dexterity, and some of it from his willingness to submerge himself in the theatre of it all. Add it up and you have an album that unwittingly delivers on its promises, even if it takes a slightly convoluted route there. The Cool's overarching story may exist mostly in Lupe's head, but there is some sort of vague logic to its structure. Forgetting the cringeworthy and condescending opening monologue ""Baba Says Cool for Thought"" (which you should probably play once for laughs before banishing to the trash can), its first portion is relatively untroubled by any of Lupe's big-picture proselytizing. Instead, we get tracks like the virtuosic double-time of ""Go Go Gadget Flow"" (mostly just a lyrical flex) and the hooky first single ""Superstar"", with Fiasco protégé Matthew Santos (who has probably heard a few Coldplay albums) playing Adam Levine to Fiasco's Kanye West. There are also two other highlights upfront: the bittersweet chamberpop lament of ""The Coolest"", on which Lupe, backed by a choir and dripping strings, weighs up his conflictedness with a laser-sharp opening line (""I love the Lord/ But sometimes it's like that I love me more"") and the lazy jazz of the shuffling ""Paris, Tokyo"", which adds another dimension to this past October's Fiascogate by sounding pretty much exactly like vintage A Tribe Called Quest. Conflict is a big part of Fiasco's persona, and in this record's first half, he wrestles with it accordingly, tempering any allusions to his comfortable lifestyle with what sound like warnings to himself. As these become increasingly portentous, the album's production style moves towards darker, more cinematic flourishes; as if moving in time with the circling pianos, brooding strings, and moody guitar squalls, Fiasco pulls the camera back from himself to take a rooftop-level view of his surroundings. The rest of the album plays out this way, with the first person expunged from the frame and replaced by Fiasco in storytelling mode. When it works, it works tremendously. Much has been made of Fiasco's love of comic books, and indeed there are stretches during this second half where you can feel him working a lot of the same angles; his predilection for stylized city-under-siege dystopia is so refined that it's not difficult to imagine these stories playing out in panels. The beautifully shaded rapper origin story ""Hip-Hop Saved My Life"" kicks off an evocative three-song stretch that includes the chilling ""Intruder Alert"" (which uses the title phrase to connect the stories of a rape victim, a drug addict, and a landed immigrant) and the doomsdayish ""Streets on Fire"". Elsewhere, though, tracks like the much-maligned ""Gotta Eat"" (on which Fiasco uses a cheeseburger as a clumsy metaphor for the high-calorie lifestyle of the streets, or something), the UNKLE-produced, rap/metal, sub-Linkin Parkisms of ""Hello/Goodbye (Uncool)"", and the jokey closer ""Go Baby"" render the album's final third a mixed, occasionally tedious, and anti-climactic affair that provides little in the way of satisfying resolution. With the notable exceptions of Snoop Dogg (who appears on the middling party track ""Hi-Definition""), Fall Out Boy's Patrick Stump (who lends production to the surprisingly bumping ""Little Weapon""), and UNKLE, there isn't much room for outside collaboration on The Cool. In fact, from Santos and producer Soundtrakk to Chicagoan rapper Gemstones and vocalist Sarah Green, most of the album's remaining featured talent comes courtesy of 1st and 15th, the Atlantic-bankrolled label of which Fiasco is co-founder and acting CEO. While the jury's still out on whether that stems from a canny marketing sense or control-freakishness, it doesn't leave much room to doubt that the vision for this sprawling, grandiose, and occasionally overambitious record came from anyone other than Fiasco himself. Whether he delivered on the full extent of what he wanted to achieve is up for debate; luckily, he's good enough that even when he comes up short, he's still better than most.","Not quite the concept album we were promised, The Cool still features isolated moments of widescreen drama-- and Fiasco's storytelling abilities, lyrical dextrousness, and willingness to submerge himself in the theatre of it all make for a rewarding sophomore album.

Prints,Prints,by: Andrew Gaerig,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3d65e6ef95969322505/1:1/w_160/2593f437.jpg,2008-01-07 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10990-prints/,Temporary Residence,"If the paisley pattern on the cover of Prints' self-titled debut is an indication of their moniker's meaning then it functions as an insight into their sound as well: neatly laid reproductions of familiar patterns and schemes. Composed of multi-instrumentalists Kenseth Thibideau (who has played with Pinback, among others) and Zac Nelson (who handles most of the vocals here), Prints produce intricate, full-bodied tracks that draw from psychedelia, pop, and electronica, at their best evoking the hypnotic splay of the Beta Band constrained by more traditional pop melodies. Thibideau and Nelson make the most of Prints' eight songs, crafting slow-burn outros and shifting choruses to the margains. Nelson is a pretty good nonsense singer, which is to say many of his best moments occur when he's spouting syllabic goo, as he does during the opening moments of ""Easy Magic"". Like a younger, fresher Dan Bejar, Nelson scats around carefully placed piano chords and a funkily strummed guitar. These elements quietly accumulate over the proceeding four minutes, leading to a sublime finale in which a punchy sequencer provides a breeding ground for Nelson's repetitive chorus-- ""Is it magic?/ If it's easy/ If it's easy"". Prints are most successful when they grab at odd styles. ""Pretty Tick"" is woolly and bizarre, with a droning synth and tiny acoustic guitar figures mic'd too close. The hypnotizing thump of ""All We Knead""'s opening passage gives way to sighing female backup vocals and the song's title turned mantra before Nelson stumbles into marble-mouthed vacancy. There is no emotional take-home on Prints; it's all bullshit, but it's pleasantly escapist bullshit. The duo encounters trouble only when it submits too willingly to formalist instincts: ""Blue Jay"" and ""Too Much Water"" are fairly straightforward pop tracks, but Thibideau and Nelson can't or don't deploy the precision these melodies and structures require. Of course, totally unfocused can be problematic too, as ""Meditation""'s cheekily apt title does nothing to redeem its three minutes of unstructured guitar pluck and tuneless moan. This sort of tone blending has no place on an album as carefully colored and manicured as Prints. The sputtering rhythms and pleasant electronic touches suggest Menomena, Pinback, or maybe Cornelius as contemporaries, though Prints boasts stronger ties to 60s pop forbears than those groups. They succeed most obviously when they cast aside obvious pop formats and send little phrases and gently lapping blips into orbit around their compositions. ""Compositions"" is an apt term, too, as Thibideau and Nelson are far better sound architects than they are pure tunesmiths, though their melodies likely keep Prints from spiraling off toward art-rock bluster. At its best, Prints is just familiar enough, a reproduction of sounds and styles lovingly recast with Thibideau and Nelson's leftfield touches.","Multi-instrumentalists Kenseth Thibideau and Zac Nelson produce intricate, full-bodied tracks that draw from psychedelia, pop, and electronica, at their best evoking the hypnotic splay of the Beta Band.

The Boy Who Couldn't Stop Dreaming,Club 8,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3dac0084474cd0c21c1/1:1/w_160/1f0b7d41.jpg,2008-01-07 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10994-the-boy-who-couldnt-stop-dreaming/,Labrador,"Early in 2007, Swedish label Labrador released its 10th-anniversary compilation, A Complete History of Popular Music. Better add another chapter. Stockholm's Club 8 consist of composer/multi-instrumentalist Johan Angergård-- who runs Labrador, fronts the Legends, and is a member of Acid House Kings-- and vocalist Karolina Komstedt. The Boy Who Couldn't Stop Dreaming is their sixth album, and though it's not a dramatic stylistic shift like some of the duo's previous discs, it's a warm, tender-hearted acoustic pop record, one that emotes through simplicity and gut-punching melodic turns rather than stagy histrionics. It's also Club 8's second album named after a song by the Television Personalities, following 2003's Strangely Beautiful. Like those underrated English post-punks, the Swedish duo have always been unashamedly sensitive, but The Boy Who Couldn't Stop Dreaming has little of its namesakes' insular humor or moddish amphetamine edge. The faster songs, such as first singles ""Heaven"" and ""Whatever You Want"", use everyday language to convey social anxiety and existential pangs, countered by sprightly acoustic strums, organs, bongos, shakers, or whistling. A girl-group bass line and summery organs bring ""Football Kids"" the lonely charm of Glaswegian indie-popsters Camera Obscura, while ""When I Come Around"" is a sort of alternate perspective on Morrissey's ""Suedehead"", with Komstedt cooing casual come-ons to a lover whose dude is away: ""I have no promises to keep/ Double bed where no one sleeps/ Now it's up to you."" The organic instrumentation marks a turn from Club 8's recent run of electronic-oriented albums following Sarah Records-inspired 1996 debut Nouvelle. Though the uptempo numbers are the obvious singles, it's the more somber material that allows The Boy Who Couldn't Stop Dreaming to work as an album. As on another of 2006's best Swedish records, Victoria Bergsman's Björn Yttling-produced Taken By Trees debut Open Field, slower tracks like ""Leave the North"" or ""In the Morning"" put vast, wintry spaces around direct, bedsit-style songwriting, achieving subtle grandeur through the way the way Komstedt's voice sighs from amid rumbling piano or echoey handclaps. Depressive ""Hopes and Dreams"" gives up some of the opening tracks' momentum, but it's needed to set up the bass-driven melancholia of ""Everything Goes"", which swears off hopes, dreams, and faith while imagining ""a warm day in heaven."" Opener ""Jesus, Walk With Me"", like much of the album, represents an attempt to reconcile the beautiful ideal of faith (and the deep human need for, as the Television Personalities put it, ""someone to share my life with"") against secular modernity's skepticism: ""Fool me into believing/ I don't care if you're deceiving me/ Before I go I need to be/ something more than the skin and bones you see."" The words could be a metaphor for what we look for from pop singers, too. The Boy Who Couldn't Stop Dreaming convinces, and that's good news to be shared and stuck on some future Labrador anniversary comp. It ends as we'll be lucky if our own lives and loves (let alone dreams) do, with a goodbye. ","This warm, tender-hearted acoustic pop album is another fine example of Labrador Records' often unsung and understated approach to indie songcraft.

Life Goes On,Trae,by: Evan McGarvey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3c0ea9e61561daa6b4a/1:1/w_160/3789cd56.jpg,2008-01-07 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10971-life-goes-on/,Rap-A-Lot,"For comparison's sake, New England grumpster laureate Robert Frost once summarized life with the same grey truth as veteran Houston rapper Trae titles his fourth full-length: It goes on. It's not a party. It's not a bitch. It just keeps moving. Back to that in a minute. First, for the uninitiated, the immediate: Trae's voice is a throaty bass as wide and monotone as the Texas plains, as congested as I-610 during rush hour, yet somehow agile. Think of a vaguely nihilist Twista on Xanax and Zoloft who can rap in separate gears. Think of a hearse on rims and vogues switching lanes in a vapored midnight. People have been dying around Trae his whole life. Brought up as an MC as a part of the sprawling, multi-dozen Screwed Up Click, Trae's been losing friends and artistic partners to jail and coffins since before his 2003 solo debut. Most affecting for Trae was the 1998 murder of original S.U.C. member Fat Pat. Since then Trae, and his music, have been cast under a perpetual grief. Trae lovingly exhumed a Fat Pat verse to close his blustery, ambitious Restless, and recorded another song for the album with Pat's older brother and S.U.C. original Big H.A.W.K. H.A.W.K was killed in May of 2006. Restless arrived in June. Life Goes On, Trae's fourth, is nothing if not a war with and against grief. Yeah, there are three or four abscesses in song and guest selection-- Yung Joc having the first verse on the album is near unforgivable-- but the album's core sequence holds up a classic emotional curve. He wallows in the bone yard praying to 2pac (""Against All Odds""), he's blasé on capitalism (""Nuthin' 2 A Boss""), he seeks out like-minded others (""Smile""-- with typically terrific guest verses from Styles P and Jadakiss). And, perfectly enough, at the centerpiece ""Give My Last Breathe"", Trae and the whole album turn. Instead of the distant, abstract gruffness and nihilism of the album's first half, Trae confesses, he mourns, and diffuses pride through grief. Speaking directly to H.A.W.K.: ""Tell the devil I'm the truth, that's why he's hiding this one out/ I feel my body had to fight to walk your casket to your grave/ No matter how it went I never thought I'd put you in your grave."" Trae's deft enough to come up with a different rhyme then ending the last two lines with near verbatim phrases. It's the emphasis in repetition and the slight diction change (""put"" versus ""walk"") that gives its resonance. Trae's not an exceptional formalist, but he's an organically savvy MC and his flourishes are subtle. The album moves itself through woozy motions like a patient bedridden and etherized. Dark, recursive bubbles and springs of viscous Texas funk (courtesy of under-the-radar producers like Mr. Rodgers and N.O.V.A & Info) fill in the gaps around Trae's voice. He's stuck in moments he can't get out of: ""Swang"" from 2006's Restless reappears as the beat for ""Give My Last Breathe"". When Life Goes On makes that thematic turn after that track, the dramatic peaks and valleys sharpen in relief. ""Gittin' High"" is a slice of subversive grace-- a rainy, spring-loaded jam about how Trae still won't blaze because: ""I choose to maintain, cause whether I get high or not/ My stress gon' be the same thing."" It's the best, most emotionally nuanced drug refusal song in hip-hop since ""So Tired"" from Hi-Tek's Hi-Teknology 2. Trae corners the market on his kind of titrated anguish. Where The Documentary wailed and pouted-- ""Last year alone I spent 1.5 Mil on my niggaz!""-- Trae murmurs and coughs death wishes and solipsism (""They sent me to live my life in the rain""). He's a self-denier, putting his voice and songs through a darkness visible that's lasted almost his entire career. The work comes first. The songs must be written. The dead are honored in action. Fantastic peaks and a genuine dark energy are tempered by those awful guest choices (Lloyd and Yung Joc most odiously), but I can't shake the feelings of Life Goes On: its got the same weary heart as Scarface, 2pac, and hell, even Joy Division. When Trae says: ""I watch my surroundings/ Like they watchin' me,"" you know that while he's got the spirit, he's lost the feeling. Or, in other words, he's got miles to go before he sleeps.","On his fourth album, Houston rapper and Screwed Up Click affiliate moves from gruffness and nihilism to a weary expression of mourning and loss.

Downtown 81 OST,Various Artists,by: Andy Battaglia,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3b19d034d5c69bf4d57/1:1/w_160/6ef64a5a.jpg,2008-01-07 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10957-downtown-81-ost/,Recall,"Downtown 81 is a dodgy movie that doubles as essential viewing for anybody with even a passing interest in New York. Its chief point of entry, in broad cultural terms, is Jean-Michel Basquiat: The painter, only 19 when the film was shot and not yet the Basquiat of museum lore, stars as an ethereal wanderer of the East Village when the neighborhood played home to lots of weird artists and looked like a war zone. He walks around and happens into people and places-- though, as one of many bits of overlaid narration has it, ""any resemblance between the characters and events depicted here and reality is...purely magical."" Not exactly. As a film, Downtown 81 is a groan-inducing mess, with a limp script (see: a solemn poetry-slam invocation of New York as ""neon literature"") and scores of poorly acted scenes between characters whose sole interest in the proceedings seems to derive from the fact that they were all good friends. It so happens, however, that all the friends at play were extremely cool and important figures on ""the scene""-- the cross-section of culture that, in early-80s New York, included a rich cast immersed in art, fashion, design, dance, and especially music. Music rescues Downtown 81, so much so that the film's goofy missteps and frivolous tone count now among its charms. The soundtrack bears this out: Recently released on CD for the first time (the movie itself was only resurrected in 2000), Downtown 81 offers a survey of 1980s art-music that differs from more austere post-minded compilations charged with making a case for their own worth. The mix of no-wave, punk-funk, and hip-hop heard here plays less like historical data and more like social music-- the kind of stuff that people scammed their way into shows to hear, that got laughed at, and danced to. After the filmic theme, as played by Basquiat's band Gray, the social aspect rushes to the fore with Coati Mundi Hernandez's ""K Pasa-Pop I""-- a manic spat of would-be world music in which background singers vamp behind Hernandez singing/rapping/scatting, as he himself says, ""like a fruit fly on a pear."" Hernandez was a member of Kid Creole & the Coconuts, who show up later with ""Mr. Softee"", a joyous romp that falls somewhere strange between funk and ska. Much of Downtown 81's allure owes to the ways it collapses any perceived distance between such poppy party songs and the abstract anglings of, say, DNA. In the film, the two scenes featuring DNA make up some of the most electrifying footage of a band playing live ever. (Not to mention the film's DVD commentary, in which the director explains that DNA bassist Tim Wright spent many years in the jungles of Belize learning how to be a witch doctor and ""actually is able to converse with flies."") The detuned exhortations of the band's ""Blonde Redhead"" and ""Detached"" work just as well as plain audio, and they slot in on the soundtrack with other nervy experiments by Tuxedomoon, Lydia Lunch, and Walter Steding and the Dragon People. It's not as easy as weird and not-weird, though. There's no such distinction to be drawn on a compilation that flits between the stately jazz of the Lounge Lizards and freestyle rap by Melle Mel, a patch of Cuban music by Pablo Calogero, and the wiry new-wave of the Plastics. Followers of the era won't necessarily need more copies of Liquid Liquid's ""Cavern"" and James Chance's ""Contort Yourself"", but there's great worth in hearing such hits in the midst of lesser known-- and less contextualized-- gems that suggest New York in the early 80s was as much a refuge for fun as it was an asylum for free-thinking.","The soundtrack to a movie made during New York's 80s prime showcases the city as a gathering place for scenesters into art, fashion, design, dance, and especially music.

Rufus Does Judy Live at Carnegie Hall,Rufus Wainwright,by: Stephen Trouss,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3f4b1335d7bf169a694/1:1/w_160/a7d4845c.jpg,2008-01-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11020-rufus-does-judy-live-at-carnegie-hall/,Geffen,"""When I was a kid, I always wanted to be Dorothy,"" drawls Rufus Wainwright, between songs, clearly having the time of his life on stage at Carnegie Hall in October 2006. ""Except for the bad days, when I wanted to be the Wicked Witch."" Rufus Does Judy... is the fulfilment of this childhood wish and the ultimate Judy Garland tribute: A song-by-song recreation of her legendary 1961 set on the same stage, the show which established the troubled singer as ""the world's greatest entertainer"". As a kind of conceptual drag act, it's comparable to Far From Heaven, where Todd Haynes had a similarly gay old time paying lavish homage to the melodramas of film director Douglas Sirk. Rufus Does Judy is a lovingly meticulous recreation (""I feel like Judy Garland's secretary!"" he sighs at one point), right down to the flubbed lyric in ""You Go to My Head"" and the babbled banter before ""A Foggy Day in London Town"", but it's no diligent impression. Wainwright's reedy tenor is no match for Garland's brassy vibrato, but, to his credit, he elegantly outdoes her on a couple of the ballads. Listen again to Garland's original double album-- an oddly primitive recording, full of microphone crashes and a drummer a few clangs short of his trolley-- it's clear that, in concert at least, she was less a singer than an overwhelming dramatic presence, a force of showbiz nature. In fact, in a funny way, the most impressive tracks aren't the songs themselves but rather the astonishing waves of cheers and applause, the sheer rush of devotion from the audience. That's an intensity that Wainwright clearly craves. On his own records he's seemed increasingly trapped in the prissy prison of his languid chamber pop, an orchid blooming in an arid greenhouse. But his talent is far too gaudy to stay cooped up, and over the course of this performance, channeling the chutzpah, getting high off the roar of the crowd, he comes to high-kicking life. Nothing is too corny for him: ""When You're Smiling"", ""That's Entertainment"", even a shit-eating ""Swanee"". He revels in the broader than Broadway bravado, it seems such a central part of his persona, but it's often simply refined out of his records completely. Of course Garland's real showbiz heir isn't Wainwright-- it's Britney Spears. So I wonder if, at heart, this splendid celebration isn't simply mourning a distant dawn-of-the-60s moment, when it was still possible to believe in the amusements of entertainment, and the chance of happy endings for child stars. But is this more than just shits and giggles for devotees of the American songbook? Does it have anything to offer the curious yet showtunephobic indie kid? Well, maybe. In the truly Garlandy spirit of family revue, Wainwright introduces his sister Martha, who turns in a stunning, showstopping ""Stormy Weather"" in an appropriately brazen bid to steal the show. And he himself cuts to the quick of Garland's art with heartfelt performances of the ballads, particularly ""Do It Again"", ""The Man That Got Away"", and ""If Love Were All"". ""I believe that since my life began, the most I've had is just a talent to amuse"", sang Garland on that last number in 1961, making Noel Coward's words her own, milking the self-dramatizing self-deprecation that moved her audience so. Sung by Wainwright the words take on a different ring. He already has the arthouse chic, the operatic range, and the high-class plaudits that Garland coveted. You suspect he would dearly love to have ""just"" that talent, or, in fact, that audience to amuse. He's said that he started listening to the Carnegie Hall album in the weeks and months after September 11, craving some cheap showbiz cheer, but wound up discovering something deeper. Of course, you can dismiss that as camp denial, a kind of wishful clicking together of the heels in the face of terror. But the bluebirds and rainbows of Garland's songs and movies were borne out of real horrors of the 1930s and 40s, and her own very particular demons. What her audience loved about her was her stout, sweaty, determined, ultimately doomed, defiance.","Backed by a 36-piece orchestra, Rufus Wainwright puts on the Ritz and pays a track-by-track tribute to Judy Garland's 1961 Carnegie Hall performance, which has been dubbed the ""greatest night in showbusiness history.""

The band identifies its music as spacey, and its name connotes both insignificance and magnitude. That name evokes the exploration of cold, thin air but the group's debut, Summer Above-- recorded in John McEntire's Soma Electronic Music Studios-- instead evokes water, floating along slowly and steadily on a gentle ebb, with perhaps more patience than the average listener will muster. ""Summer Above"" crawls along, with Marie-Claire Balabanian's vocals barely breaking the surface and the vibraphone wafting in and out like flotsam caught in the tide. The song is discreet vocals over textured drone and guitar tone, which sets the template for the rest of the album. Call it drift rock. Speck Mountain might be compared to Low if they could muster any intensity in that drift, or Yo La Tengo if they could locate rhythm. Instead the music pulls them along gently, without variation, through the crisp guitar lines of ""Hey Moon"" and the halting bassline of ""Girl Out West"". ""Stockholm"" hangs on a thin metaphor: ""When you didn't show up in Stockholm,"" Balabanian sings, ""a fjord turned into a lake."" She has the sense not to explain the imagery, but the repetition of that second phrase throughout the song drains the words of gravity instead of imbuing them with deeper meaning. They play Marco Polo on closer ""Chlorine Fields"", calling out to one another between lyrics that hazily recall poolside adolescence. It's an intriguing moment-- a true highlight-- with multi-instrumentalists Karl Briedrick and Kate Walsh musically executing lyrical concerns. As it proceeds, however, the song wanders into an eddy of electric piano and guitar distortion that disrupts the idyll but doesn't lead anywhere. In this sense, the musicians' instruments could be oars to fight or navigate these currents, but instead Speck Mountain simply drift. There's a certain appeal in this slow-motion procession, as well as a certain accomplishment in creating music that seems to move by forces outside itself. But overall, Summer Above makes for an often lovely, but largely dull record, as if the band has relinquished its creative agency in these songs.","This often lovely debut, recorded in John McEntire's Soma Studios, inches along, with very little rhythm to propel it and only the barest vocals to direct it.

Pink's answers have all gone something like ""Well, um...maybe?"" as he has inadvertently become a Tim Kinsella-like object of disdain/love/fascination for this website. Scared Famous culls 17 tracks from Scared Famous/ FF>>, a 2002 double-cassette that falls somewhere between The Doldrums and House Arrest in Pink's dodgy Haunted Graffiti series. Like every Pink release before it, Scared Famous is not-equal-enough parts random brilliance and sonic bullshit. Much is made of Pink's AM radio fetish, but no one simply picks up a copy of Armed Forces or Radio City and automatically assembles 4-track tapes whose songs feature grating noise breakdowns. Indeed, Pink is an avant-garde artist, possibly reluctantly, definitely goofily; see the original cover art of FF>>, which features Pink photoshopped over the cover art of Amon Düül's Yeti. But couching Pink's noisiness in groups like Red Krayola and Wire makes good sense; these aesthetic styles jibe with Pink's self-imposed limitations and arcane wankery. Such is the case for Scared Famous' strongest track, ""The List (My Favorite Song)"", a muscular post-punk number that thankfully finds Pink eschewing his famously trying falsetto. The horror synths of ""The Kitchen Club"" and the ringing palpitations of ""In a Tomb All Your Own"" also point to these unsung influences. This sense of exploration informs all of Scared Famous, even as Pink's well-worn pop moves inevitably take over. ""Are You Gonna Look After My Boys?"" is Pink's most overt Johnston sketch, all ringtone synthesizers and tinny refrains. ""Politely Declined"" features traded female/male vocals and college rock axe-work. Aggressively bad mixing obscures ""Girl in a Tree"", but its circular piano still aims it towards Fleetwood Mac's soupy orchestration. ""Beefbud"", chunkily bizarre, is a psych-rock relic. The willfully negligent production and arrangement remains, but viewed as a transition between his very early work and the slight improvements he'd made by House Arrest, they're nearly permissible. Still, admitting Pink's experimental lineage-- and even his tape-trading past-- makes it harder to lend him the benefit of the doubt: Surely anyone with his awareness of music history should want better. This has always been the knock on Pink-- that he knows enough to craft mystique but not necessarily great albums. As the hypothetical ""best of"" half of a two-cassette release, Scared Famous is frightful; ""Howling at the Moon"", ""Talking All the Time"", and the title track are chalky and stale. Not to actually attempt to analyze the content of these tracks, but ""Why Can't I Be Me?"" seems like a misplaced sentiment on the re-release of an underground cassette of dubious origin and strident pop abstraction. As if someone was preventing him from truly expressing himself. No, Scared Famous is just as scribbled, vain, potent, and half-assed as always.","Culling 17 tracks from a 2002 double-cassette that falls somewhere between The Doldrums and House Arrest in Pink's dodgy Haunted Graffiti series, Scared Famous mixes random brilliance with sonic bullshit.

MCs like Sole, Sage Francis, and (to cross label lines) EL-P use albums like personal workbooks, sorting through quandaries in complex verse and academic esoterica. But what makes these rappers most interesting to some makes them most repellent to others. Continually pissing in the wind proves your consternation, certainly, but it also means you may ultimately be preaching to a shrinking choir while trying to pretend you're not soaking in your own fluids. It's magnetic only to those with similar polarities. Over his last four albums, Arizona-via-France-via-California-via-Maine producer and rapper Sole has done a lot of pissing, but, thanks to extreme statements (""The white man's the fucking devil/ I wanted to be black at age 13"") and tracks so rich they read like librettos, he's assembled a fervent if meager choir.

The 30-year-old MC unites two realizations on these 13 tracks: The world is fucked, and there's not shit the anticon. crew he co-founded more than a decade ago can do about it. Thanks to the urgency of these proclamations and the craftiness of Skyrider-- who lend violin, banjo, glockenspiel and a dozen other instruments here-- it's his most consistently engaging album to date. If you know this niche at all, these lyrical themes will be familiar. Sole rails mostly against capitalism as it relates to complacency, dropping references to fake Che Guevaras and background music in shopping malls as mind control. He proclaims he's ""too Bakunin for your backpack rap,"" and that ""Living is easy with so many lousy architects."" This is standard territory for Sole and, ironically, it's also his weak spot. Sole's acumen has long been clouded by poor editing, as he adulterates money shots with billows of second-rate images (""volcanic ash on a strip mall"") and cracked references (""I love words like Cortez loved the Mayans""). He misses easy targets here, whether threatening to join a Death Cab for Cutie cover band (they're white, sensitive, and passé, and every fan that hears the slam will laugh at the line mostly for those reasons) or razing liberals sitting in the bathroom reading Harper's Magazine (Sole is a real revolutionary). This time, though, the minutiae that irks Sole coalesces into swift apocalyptic visions, and these realizations-- delivered in long passages of hard, staccato syllables that leave him gasping, as if he's seeing six billion ghosts at once-- make Sole's problems with J.C. Penney's, Spencer's Gifts, and ""pre-fab teen spirit sucked through the coolest scenes"" suddenly more immediate and disconcerting. These qualms are part of a grand vision, and the diorama is falling apart: ""Up to my neck in confusion-- or is it lava?"" Sole wonders for the close of ""Sound of Head on Concrete"", in which he realizes words are too weak to fight back. ""The universe is shrinking,"" he promises on ""A Hundred Light Years and Running"", asking, ""How does it feel when your meteor is crashing?"" Sole's concern is contagious, and it's even more compelling because he knows this album or any album can't save us. When the world burns, as he prophesies, these albums will only be his ""etching in marble...although it's digital, it'll be all that remains. Just some songs that no one needs."" But Sole fancies himself a survivor, and he explains his existence away on closer ""Stupid Things Implode on Themselves"". He's already picked mice over men, and told his choir to ""Let the cockroaches sort it out."" He's already predicted the apocalypse of suburbia and society sinking like a ship tossed by a sea of sin. Then, ""Everything went according to flames.... That ain't a pulse. That's Budweiser bubbling in the intestines still."" But there's explicit hope tucked away here: For Sole, fire and smoke offer not only death but a chance at renewal, at reinvention. He knows his words are too weak to prevent what's happening-- ""Hard as I try, man, I can't change this""-- but he hopes the exercise at least makes him strong enough to see what's on the other side.","Thanks to the urgency of his proclamations and the craftiness of Skyrider's backing, Sole's fourth album is his most consistently engaging record to date.

Krankenhaus? EP,British Sea Power,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3cf5e6ef959693224f7/1:1/w_160/eafac41d.jpg,2008-01-04 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10984-krankenhaus-ep/,Rough Trade,"British Sea Power's 2003 salvo The Decline of British Sea Power still stands as one of this decade's most arresting debut indie-rock albums, an unlikely but assured reconciliation of two opposing strains of classic college-rock: the slash-and-burn guitar screech that made campus-radio darlings out of the Pixies and early Pavement, and the sort of picture-postcard art-rock epitomized by Echo and the Bunnymen album covers. That contrast was amplified in the band's notoriously unhinged live shows-- which often resembled a nature conservatory taken over by asylum escapees-- but the band's contradictory quality was all but washed out on 2005's more temperate Open Season which, as second albums so often do, sacrificed too much of the noise for poise. So it was with considerable relief that I received the news that British Sea Power were planning to record their third album in Montreal with Efrim Menuck and Howard Bilerman, two men who-- through their respective involvement with Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Arcade Fire's Funeral-- know a great deal about striking a fine balance between grit and grandeur. The album, set for release this year, will be called Do You Like Rock Music? In the interim, British Sea Power provide the Krankenhaus? EP, whose five songs answer their own album's question in the affirmative. It's the first British Sea Power release to truly capture the anarchic joy of the band's live performances, specifically that moment when the band's traditional set-closer ""Lately"" degenerates into unhinged thrashing and bashing, wanton destruction, tin-drum marches through the crowd and singer Yan piggyback-riding on guitarist Noble's soldiers. Which isn't to say that history buff Yan has stopped pondering the vagaries of modern life-- his first words on opener ""Atom (Edit)"" are ""I'd be the first to admit this is a bright but haunted age/ I just don't know""-- but the song's breakneck momentum indicate he's not going to lose sleep over them anymore, and if the closing noise crescendo is supposed to approximate the sound of a plane crashing, Yan seems oddly at peace with his fiery fate. (The track appears in prolonged form on Rock Music as ""Atom"", sandwiched by a teasingly mellow intro passage and an even more chaotic conclusion.) The other Rock Music representative, ""Down on the Ground"", provides a more sanguine variation on its predecessor's hard-charged abandon-- tempered by a bright, 120 Minutes-vintage chorus-- but the band switches gears impressively with brother Hamilton's ""Straight Down the Line"", a rickety, lo-fi ramble that could pass for a lost Clean seven-inch from 1982. When Yan returns for ""Hearing Aid"", his mood appears to have taken a turn for the somber, warbling out a loose, barely defined melody over an ominous piano din. But he's soon rudely interrupted by a scorching Crazy Horse guitar grind that essentially serves as the sound-check for Krankenhaus?'s nine-minute, two-part closer ""The Pelican"", a motorik rock-out that's destined to replace ""Lately"" as the band's set-ending, room-clearing meltdown. Krankenhaus?'s air of giddy petulance is infectious enough to allow you to overlook the fact its songs lack the emotional resonance that defines British Sea Power's best work (""Carrion"", ""Fear of Drowning""). But the recent release of Do You Like Rock Music?'s grand first single, ""Waving Flags"", finds the band applying guitar-scraped dissonance to more heartfelt, purposeful songcraft-- suggesting that Krankenhaus? is not so much a teaser for the upcoming album as a document of the spirited rehearsal-space warm-up jams that transpired before they got down to serious business.","After a stellar debut and a lackluster follow-up, British Sea Power prep us for their third album with this EP-- the first recording to capture the anarchic joy of the band's live performances.

Testify,The Simpsons,by: Joshua Love,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2ca13d197565213a825/1:1/w_160/46a0b21b.jpg,2008-01-04 06:00:01,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10737-testify/,Shout! Factory,"Music-- whether in the form of pop parodies, Broadway takeoffs, or consumer-spoofing jingles-- has been intrinsic to the ""The Simpsons"" since the show's beginning: The series' first episode found Bart reworking ""Jingle Bells"" to reference strip poker and Attila the Hun. In the decade to come, ""Simpsons"" writers would use song to skewer celebrity vanity (""We're Sending Our Love Down the Well""), American excess (""Canyonero""), the strained metaphors of country music (""Bagged Me a Homer""), and the gullibility of small towns (the legendary Music Man spoof ""Monorail""), just to name a memorable few. Now, any halfway-respectable ""Simpsons"" fan has seen every episode from the show's first decade multiple times. We continue to watch, either out of comfort, nostalgia, or just flat-out enjoyment, but by this point we've become so familiar with every sight gag and plot twist from the golden era of the series that the vast majority of the material (music included) has lost some of its capacity to provoke or entertain. The recently released Testify collects songs from ""Simpsons"" seasons 11 through 18, a period roundly acknowledged as right about when the show's quality began to slip perceptibly. In truth, that span did produce a number of enduring moments and excellent episodes (unless names like Mr. Pinchy, Linguo, Jebus, and Max Power fail to ring any bells), but even if you hold the second ""Simpsons"" decade in significantly lower esteem than its first, at least this compilation has the benefit of being fresher, right? Well, not necessarily. The sad irony behind Testify is that while fans of the series have grown accustomed to reruns of its initial offerings, the songs from these eight seasons have demonstrated an increasing over-familiarity with the show's iconic characters and their quirks, to the point where the music of ""The Simpsons"" has become less a vehicle for intelligent satire and more an exercise in self-referentiality. Perhaps it was inevitable given the show's longevity and the indelible nature of its creations, but it's hard not to listen to Testify and disappointedly marvel at how many of these songs are about ""The Simpsons"" and little else. ""They'll Never Stop the Simpsons"" is the obvious moment of meta-commentary, but at least it's knowing in its insularity. But play tracks like ""The Very Reason That I Live"", ""Sold Separately"", ""My Fair Laddy"", and ""The President Wore Pearls"" for someone who lacks an intimate knowledge of Sideshow Bob, Waylon Smithers, Groundskeeper Willie and Lisa Simpson, respectively, and watch the laughter die. Maybe there's something to be said for enriching our understanding of an already-established character (and there is some poignancy in Lisa's lonely-at-the-top Evita homage), but songs like ""Testify"" and ""You're a Bunch of Stuff"" are little more than cavalcades of bit characters spouting one or two lines that oh-so-obviously sum up their entire gimmicky personae. (If you can't immediately ascertain who sings the line, ""You're like X-Men #3 in a mylar bag,"" then I imagine you won't find much pathos in hearing Smithers pour out his heart to a Malibu Stacy doll, either.) When the ""Simpsons"" team does look beyond the mirror, they're still capable of delivering estimable satire and sneaky, off-the-wall hilarity. ""America (I Love This Country)"" cannily finds a Lee Greenwood stand-in crooning, ""If you don't buy my record/ Al-Qaeda wins,"" while ""I Love to Walk"" gives us the bizarrely great non sequitur of Steve Buscemi offering tickets to the Independent Film Awards to two guys from Turkmenistan. On the other hand, a healthy portion of the pop culture jokes and references here are well past their expiration dates. Granted, that's the point with ""Ode to Branson"" (a haven for washed-up stars like Yakov Smirnoff and Mr. T), but there's absolutely no excuse for consecutive songs that parody the B-52s' ""Love Shack"" and the California Raisins. Remember, in Soviet Union, shark jumps you.","This compilation collects songs from ""Simpsons"" seasons 11 through 18, a period roundly acknowledged as right about when the show's quality began to slip perceptibly.

Teardrop Sweetheart,Misha,by: Mark Richardson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3e39d034d5c69bf4d99/1:1/w_160/00fe7ff7.jpg,2008-01-03 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11005-teardrop-sweetheart/,Tomlab,"Brooklyn's Misha are a boy/girl duo, and their song ""Summersend"" got some heavy play on your reviewer's iPod on the middle of 2007. With its quivering guitar, simple but effective bass line, and overlapping vocals that found Ashley Yao and John Chao testing the upper limits of their ranges with a heart-melting chorus, ""Summersend"" was the sound of a band reaching beyond itself. Teardrop Sweetheart, the album on which the surpassing ""Summersend"" can be found, shows an indie pop band inhabiting less dramatic territory than this lead track suggests, trying instead for something moodier and subtler. On tracks like ""Losing"", where electronics are prominent and the relaxed and clear voices are subjected to bits of quick-cut processing, Misha could reasonably be compared to the legion of 1980s-curious laptop-pop bands that sprung up in the wake of Dntel/Postal Service's success just after the turn of the millennium. Their bubbly keyboards reference vintage synths rather than replicating them; clipped melodies are sung in a half-whisper; lyrics are about the joy and heartbreak of new love. It's here, on tracks like slow music-box tune ""Delovedly"" and the near-goth ""The Book (Of Glaciers)"", that Misha seem ensconced in an accomplished but underwhelming comfort zone, making music sure to please the converted electro-pop fan but just as certain to leave the dabbler wanting. Since Misha are rather workmanlike when it comes to essentials like chords and melodies, the most interesting moments on Teardrop Sweetheart come when they try something that doesn't quite seem to fit their aesthetic. It's unclear on ""Anaconda"", when they rhyme the name of the great snake with ""Honda"", whether they are referencing Sir Mix-A-Lot. But the lyric, combined with a musical backing of lightly strummed nylon guitar and not much else, gives the song a playful and slightly surreal cast, a sense reinforced by Chao's call of ""Solo!"" before a pleasingly dinky synth break. ""Crystal in Love"" goes for more of an ELO vibe. Its slow intro, complete with sparkling background harmonies over a heavily flanged guitar, explodes into a mid-tempo psych-pop tune that finds Chao singing in a cracking falsetto. It's not nearly as catchy as its forebears, sure, but it's still satisfying to hear Misha trying for a more direct emotional connection in light of the breezy but less memorable material that makes up the bulk of the record. But still: ""Summersend"". These guys wrote that, and this is their first record. While Teardrop Sweetheart is nothing amazing, I remain curious.","Misha wowed us with ""Summersend"" last year, but the Brooklyn duo's latest album is the work of an indie pop band inhabiting less dramatic territory than that track suggests, trying instead for something moodier and subtler.

Change!,The Black Swans,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3bcc0084474cd0c2192/1:1/w_160/ce13defe.jpg,2008-01-03 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10967-change/,La Société Expéditionnaire,"There's something disquieting at the bottom of the Black Swans' songs, something half-shaped and half-seen, like a body in a lake. The surface of the music is usually calm and familiar, but something disturbing appears briefly in the crest of each wave of violin or guitar. On the emphatically titled Change!, their second full-length and first for La Société Expéditionnaire, that something might be dread, or fear, or some secret intelligence about which the band write and play but can never disclose. It's the same something that haunted their debut, Who Will Walk in the Darkness with You?, and their follow-up EP, Sex Brain. Paradoxically, Change! doesn't actually change any of their mysterious intent, but amplifies it. Crisper and more pared down than their previous releases, albeit with slightly less variation among the songs, Change! sounds luminously cinematic, like Pinetop Seven or the soundtrack work of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis, yet twilit songs like ""Hope Island"", ""Purple Heart"", and even the silvertoned instrumental ""Blue Moon #9"" use these familiar sounds for foreign ends-- they're not simply dark, but cleverly dreadful, as if the Black Swans are smuggling something sinister inside the lyrics and chords. Jerry DeCicca's voice still sounds hollowed at its core, deep yet light, with that eerie vibrato that draws comparisons to Stuart Staples of Tindersticks, but with a country bent instead of soul. His and Christopher Forbes' deep Americana guitars still walk in the darkness with Noel Sayres' scratchily emotive violin, the head to the latter's heart. Bassist Canaan Faulkner and drummer Keith Hanlon know to hang back, recognizing that rhythm on these songs must be subliminal at best. Even when the melodies verge on lovely, which they do on every song, they still sound uneasy. The Black Swans may be trafficking in a kind of atmospheric indie folk-rock, but Change! actually plays like a sort of blues, full of thoroughly digested worry and world-weariness: ""There's a dark cloud hanging over,"" DeCicca sings on ""Shake"", ""and trouble on my mind."" It's not that the Black Swans inhabit a strange world, but that they depict the real world from such a strange perspective. These songs portray crossroads, where weird metamorphoses are taking place, as DeCicca describes changing from one self into another. ""This is my new face,"" he sings on opener ""New Face"", ""I wear it for you."" Or consider the grim physicality of ""Coats"", sung over a rising and falling guitar melody: ""My skin is paint, watch it flake/ Pick up the brush, fix the mistake."" So that album title turns out to be a dire exclamation, like yelling Help! or Watch out!, and Change! eventually reveals itself to be a break-up album, where the end of a relationship necessitates traumatic transformation. As DeCicca sings on the title track, ""All that's left is change."" Period.","Crisper and more pared down than their previous releases, albeit with slightly less variation among the songs, Change! sounds luminously cinematic, like Pinetop Seven or the soundtrack work of Nick Cave and Warren Ellis.

MADE,Scarface,by: Tom Breihan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3c313d197565213a9c8/1:1/w_160/beab8344.jpg,2008-01-03 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10973-made/,Rap-A-Lot,"Scarface has a Johnny Cash-type voice, the sort of grim guttural rasp that makes even his most banal lyrics seem like dusty pieces of hard-earned wisdom. When he was his in his early twenties, he already sounded like a weathered old man, one who'd seen too much death in his life. Now that he's 37 and in the second decade of a storied career, his voice has gained even more grit and heft, and his lyrics, once hallucinatory bloodbaths, have evolved along with it. These days, even when he's indulging in nasty sex-talk, every line carries the weight of divine certainty and past hardship. Face hasn't released a solo album of new material since 2002's The Fix, an epic about love and death in America's ghettos and a late-career masterpiece. When he recorded that record, Scarface was president of Def Jam South, where he signed Ludacris, and he had at his disposal both A-list guest-spots from the likes of Jay-Z and Nas and bluesier, more expansive beats than any he'd rapped on. Soon after its release though, he left Def Jam, and he's only occasionally dabbled in rapping since then, recording worthy albums with old crew the Geto Boys and new crew the Product and popping up for a few guest verses. Sometime last year, he announced that The Fix would be his last solo album, that he was sick of the music business. But now he's back with a new album on Rap-A-Lot, the venerable Houston indie that first launched his career nearly 20 years ago. On ""Git Out My Face"", he explains his reasons for returning to rap, and they're predictably confrontational: ""This shit ain't go the planned, I'm caught in a cross/ And if I leave, they won't respect the South 'cause niggas soft/ Talking 'bout what's in they mouth, talking 'bout they cars and house/ That ain't what we about."" After all these years, he still can't relinquish his messianic role. MADE is a decidedly minor album: Barely 40 minutes, it has no guest rappers and its beats are entirely from Rap-A-Lot's house producers. But those beats-- slow and heavy melodic monsters laced with soul-samples and organ-blurts-- mesh beautifully and intuitively with Scarface's weary drawl. Over its ten songs, Scarface mostly treads familiar ground: harder-than-thou street-rap boasts, intimate grown-man relationship talk, wide-angle society-gone-wrong laments. When he's talking hard, as on ""Big Dogg Status"", Scarface can be both thrilling and terrifying: ""He's a nerd, and they fuck nerds in jail I heard/ As a nigga, I came in here with my balls and word."" He's also still a gifted technical rapper with a gift for unshowy but intricate and alliterative rhymes: ""I roll over roaches in Rovers with rims on 'em/ Sniffing out a rat, I expose him and then dome him."" We've heard him say this stuff hundreds of times before, but his tough-talk gets more interesting as it gets more specific. ""Burn"", for instance, is a chilling murder-ballad, as Face explores the emptiness he feels immediately after killing someone: ""My hands got powder-burns, I just murdered a man/ Took his life for nothing/ If you ask me, fuck it."" His voice isn't the only thing he has in common with Johnny Cash. But MADE gains emotional force only when Scarface leaves that behind for the sincerity and vulnerability of a string of relationship songs. The Fix had a couple of truly touching love songs, but on MADE Scarface shows us the other side of romance, vividly documenting the end of a relationship on a couple of tracks. ""Go"" is a list of one man's grievances, moving through trivial gripes and macho posturing toward serious problems: ""You watch a nigga like I'm six years old/ How the fuck you think this shit gon' grow?"" On ""Girl You Know"" he rails against monogamy, sounding seriously pissed and fed up. That sense of unrest remains when Scarface talks about subjects larger than himself. ""Boy Meets Girl"" is a symbolic narrative about the dangers of mixing heroin and cocaine disguised as a self destructive young couple's story. ""Who Do You Believe In"" is an incisive and confessional track about society's ills: the nihilism of poverty, the hypocrisy of political leaders, generational conflicts bred from misunderstandings. And all those societal concerns suddenly become concrete and personal on the final track, ""The Suicide Note"", a tortured rant about a friend who took his own life, a death Scarface evidently blames himself for: ""I hate to say it, but this one here been heavy on my conscience/ My nonchalantness just took a life over some nonsense."" Coming from a slow, booming voice like Scarface's, that confusion sounds all the more poignant, and it's the thing that sticks with me the most about MADE. Scarface is a rap legend and an elder statesman, but on this album, he's got more questions than answers. MADE might be a small album, one that never musically ventures outside Scarface's comfort zone, but it's a heavily personal work from someone with a whole lot to say. If we're lucky, Scarface might have another few albums like this left in him.","The former Geto Boys and Def Jam star finally follows 2002's The Fix, an epic about love and death in America's ghettos, with a record for Rap-A-Lot, the venerable Houston indie that first launched his career nearly 20 years ago.

The Very Best of Ethiopiques: Hypnotic Grooves From the Legendary Series,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2d5b1335d7bf169a4cb/1:1/w_160/d053222f.jpg,2008-01-03 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10747-the-very-best-of-ethiopiques-hypnotic-grooves-from-the-legendary-series/,MantecaBuda Musique,"I don't entirely agree with the title of this compilation. Most likely, the majority of fans familiar with the Éthiopiques series on France's Buda Musique-- over 20 volumes and counting-- wouldn't agree with it either. It's an entirely subjective thing. If I were to make my own 28-track, 2xCD compilation of the very best of Éthiopiques, it would have three or four songs in common with this one. This is a good thing, serving to illustrate the wealth of outstanding music that series editor Francis Falceto has uncovered over the past 10 years. And at any rate, it's hard to argue with the subtitle, as these discs are indeed filled with hypnotic grooves that offer a nice beginner's guide to a series that's earned every scrap of its legendary status. If you like what you hear on this compilation, the next step is obvious: Dive in and start snapping up Éthiopiques volumes. Americans and some Europeans could be forgiven for harboring skepticism about a series focused on reissuing Ethiopian popular music-- two decades later, images of the East African nation's 1980s famine is the first, if not the only, reference point many of us have of the country. It's hard to overstate how tiny a piece of the Ethiopian puzzle those images are. This is a country with a continuous history stretching back two millennia, a nation that converted to Christianity in the 4th century, and the only African nation never to be colonized by Europeans, though it did endure a brief occupation by Fascist Italy in the late 1930s and early 40s. It's also home to the oldest human remains ever found. Because of its highland geography and buffer zones of desert, Ethiopian culture developed more or less separately from surrounding cultures, with distinctive music to match. Though only a few volumes of the Éthiopiques series have focused on traditional music, you can hear its strands running through the dozens of electric rock, soul, and jazz tracks on the records that cover the 1969-1978 ""Golden Age"" of Ethiopian pop music. It's most obvious in the pentatonic scales and melismatic vocal delivery, but it's also there in the six-against-four rhythms, lyrics filled with double entendres, and the saxophone styles of dozens of players who drew improvisational inspiration from the traditional shelléla war chant, used as a rallying cry prior to battle by Ethiopian troops right into the early 20th century. All these elements mixed so seamlessly with American rock and soul in the hands of the country's best musicians created a new style of music. Most of the musicians who played on the scene that came to be known as ""Swinging Addis"" got their starts playing in official bands of Haile Selassie, the last Emperor of Ethiopia-- the Body Guard Band, Police Band, Army Band and official theater bands churned out musicians who were deftly skilled on Western instruments and highly disciplined. Most recordings and performances by singers were backed by official, government-controlled bands until the late 60s, when the first independent groups cautiously made their way onto the scene. These musicians had mostly resigned from official bands, particularly the Body Guard Band, many of whose members had been implicated in a 1960 coup attempt. As the Golden Age took shape, there was almost no formal outside input-- Mulatu Astatqé, the innovator of the Ethio-jazz style and one of the country's most prominent arrangers, as well as a great vibraphonist, was the only musician in Addis Ababa who had received musical education in Europe and the U.S., though others would travel abroad later. Mulatu's greatest counterpart in developing a distinct Ethio-sound, Girma Beyene, was a self-taught keyboardist and vocalist who learned most of what he knew from listening to American Armed Services broadcasts from Asmara in the north of the country (it's now the capital of independent Eritrea). Nearly all of Ethiopia's vinyl and (more commonly) shellac record output was accomplished by two shoestring record labels. The first, Amha, founded by Amha Eshete, was technically illegal when it opened in 1969 in defiance of the government's official monopoly on recordings. Amha was done for after the 1974 coup that deposed Selassie and installed a ruling military council known as the Derg, led by the narcissistic dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam. Maryam's government imposed curfews that effectively destroyed Ethiopian nightlife and censored all media with a heavy hand-- its economic mismanagement was also partially responsible for those images of famine in the 1980s that we're all so familiar with in the West. One record label, Kaifa, managed to stay alive, issuing vinyl records until 1978, recording with just two microphones. The music those two labels captured dominates Éthiopiques, and this compilation provides a good cross-section of the series, including a few cuts from artists who fall slightly outside the Golden Age/Swinging Addis purview for good measure. You get the four biggest singers of the era: Mahmoud Ahmed, Alemayehu Eshete, Tlahoun Gessesse and Ayalew Mesfin, several tracks featuring Girma Beyene, including half of the four vocal tracks he recorded, and a nice, if disproportionately large, helping of instrumental tracks from Mulatu, shelléla sax king Getatchew Mekurya and others. Strangely, no woman singers have been included, although the female voice is so central to Ethiopian musical culture. Other odd decisions include choosing to open disc one with three instrumentals, even though their quality is unimpeachable, as well as only picking Mahmoud Ahmed tracks from Ere Mela Mela (available on Volume 7 of the series). While it's a great album-- and was the first Ethiopian LP to be widely heard in other countries (10 years after its initial release)-- Ahmed has two other volumes in the series, and they're both just as good, if not even better. Ahmed was a master vocalist, though, and all of the tracks that were included are fantastic regardless. Perhaps the only vocalist more powerful than Ahmed was Tlahoun Gessesse, who absolutely wails on all of his inclusions, with melismatic virtuosity and a preacher's fervor. The only tracks that fall well outside the Golden Age-- a solo piano piece by Tsegue-Maryam Guebrou and an otherwordly modern recording of a traditional song accompanied by the ancient Harp of King David by Alemu Aga-- serve as a nice accent, illustrating where a few of the (to Western ears) exotic elements of the Western-influenced popular music tracks came from. What's most striking about the music-- and the thing that makes this series worth checking out to nearly any mildly adventurous listener-- is that these tracks consistently transcend the curiosity factor. Yes, Girma Beyene's ""Enken Yelelebesh"" has a dark, tropical feel and a offbeat melody, Getatchew Mekurya's sax sounds like the work of an alternate-universe Archie Shepp, and Alemayehu Eshete's ""Telantena Zare"" tops its jazzy soul backing with a wildly melismatic and crazed vocal, but fundamentally they're all just great tracks, and they stack up to their closest American and European analogs quite well. Mulatu Astatqe, more than just good Ethio-jazz, is just good jazz. Add in the fact that the Ethiopian recording industry, due to lack of resources, had a built-in quality control-- if you weren't good enough, and your song wasn't excellent, you didn't get recorded. Is this the place to start? Well, it's a good place to start, though you could do nearly as well going straight to Volumes 8 or 13-- it's a matter of how tentatively you want to explore the series-- and you should explore it.

Y34RZ3R0R3M1X3D,Nine Inch Nails,by: Ryan Dombal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Features Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3e5c0084474cd0c21d2/1:1/w_160/70f1f674.jpg,2008-01-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11008-y34rz3r0r3m1x3d/,Interscope,"As 42-year-old Trent Reznor rages into middle age, he seems primed to assume the role of alt-rock's cool uncle: Instead of awkwardly name-dropping TV on the Radio at holiday gatherings (""that Cookie Monster album is fantastic!""), Trent invited the Brooklyn band on tour with him. And, on this reconfigured follow-up to last year's noisy and apocalyptic conceptual clarion call, Year Zero, Reznor assembles an impressive list of remixers-- from the Knife's Olof Dreijer to Midwestern dancer rockers the Faint to Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert of New Order fame. So while the three previous Nine Inch Nails remix records mostly featured Reznor and his studio cronies tweaking their own work, Y34RZ3R0R3M1X3D is less insular and more varied as Trent continues to loosen the reigns on the now label-less NIN machine. It may not sidestep the inevitable inconsistencies that dog almost every redo LP-- as Reznor recently admitted, ""Remix records can be disposable garbage (of which I myself have been guilty to some extent)""-- but the man in black's hands-off approach and inspired taste yield some pleasantly surprising doomsday soundtracks. If Year Zero was the sound of zeros and ones being broken down into fits of code signaling the end of civilization, Y34RZ3R0R3M1X3D is the danceable, post-everything rave-up. It's been a long time since Reznor specialized in making music for goths to shake to, but he still realizes that even the most brooding atheists sometimes feel the urge to flex their pale limbs. So Year Zero's digital freakouts and introspective interludes are largely ditched in favor of straightforward low-end and fist-high chanting. The concept album's internet-aided plot is all but lost, of course, but that's not such a bad thing. Post-punk producer and trend-aping remixer Paul Epworth (aka Phones) and NIN fan Pirate Robot Midget give Reznor a fitting French Touch treatment, and Epworth's ""Capital G"" absolutely nails the power-farting guitar aesthetic across its rousing seven and a half minutes. Ladytron and New Order's Gilbert and Morris dutifully tweak their keyboards, respectively turning ""The Beginning of the End"" and ""God Given"" into potential Violator-era Depeche Mode B-sides, but the Faint figure out the limits of Trent's funkiness the hard way with their squelching take on ""Meet Your Master"". As is the general rule with these endeavors, it's always more interesting when artists attempt a complete revamp (especially since Reznor's formula hasn't changed all that much in the last 15 years). Avant-garde bass legend Bill Laswell and recent Trent bud Saul Williams tank with their lazy and diluted versions of ""Vessel"" and ""Survivalism"" (what possessed them to try to out-NIN Trent Reznor?). But on the flip side, the Knife's Olof Dreijer references his spooky source material in mood only on an expansive 14-minute minimal techno take of ""Me, I'm Not"". Dreijer relegates Reznor's whispering vocals to the periphery; it comes off like a pulsing Ricardo Villalobos remix of the Knife, with subtlety, finger-snaps, and subversive low-end intact. Meanwhile, eternally unsettling chamber innovators the Kronos Quartet manage to convey much of Reznor's Year Zero vision (without a trace of his scraping vocals) with equal parts dissonance and elegance on their rework of ""Another Version of the Truth"". But Best Remix honors go to ambient guitar genius Christian Fennesz, who successfully bridges the gap between his own static-y compositions and Reznor's more brutal noize palette, smoothing out the post-explosion ballad ""In This Twilight"". *Y34RZ3R0R3M1X3D * famously marks the end of Nine Inch Nails' troublesome relationship with Interscope Records and, given the indie and avant-garde nature of its remixers, this makes sense. No matter how one feels about his primitive lyrics or hard-headed pessimism, Reznor clearly has a keen and voracious ear. So even though the disc lacks cohesion and is predictably spotty, its unlikely collaborations with the likes of Dreijer and Kronos make the project somewhat worthwhile. And as he leaves the majors behind (shitting on them all the way) and retreats to his indie-style cult, Reznor should have even more chances to indulge his experimental tendencies. Just as Bowie tapped Trent for some fresh ideas in the mid-90s, the NIN brain trust continues to look elsewhere for motivation. And while Reznor has faithfully clung to his industrial aesthetic for years, his newfound independence might be the catalyst behind a larger sea change for the NIN sound-- perhaps an expanded Fennesz/Reznor meeting of the minds? It's not probable. But now, at least it's possible.","To craft this reconfiguration of last year's Year Zero, Trent Reznor assembled an impressive roster of remixers-- including the Knife, Fennesz, Kronos Quartet, the Faint, and Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert of New Order.

Polysics or Die!!! Vista,Polysics,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3d25e6ef959693224fd/1:1/w_160/7978a6a9.jpg,2008-01-02 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10986-polysics-or-die-vista/,MySpace,"I'm beginning to suspect Japan's Polysics belong to some sort of fair trade conspiracy to shill jittery new wave in the U.S. and UK, countries already swollen with Devo and Pere Ubu soundalikes. Back when the market would've been more receptive, the Polysics released Hey! Bob! My Friend and Neu, impressive works of cataclysmic spaz-rock that largely fell on deaf ears. Polysics or Die!!! and Now Is the Time!, released on Tofu in 2005 and 2006 respectively, hoped to firebomb American indie audiences until they approved, though the latter's watered-down synth-pop suggested that the band's window of opportunity was quickly closing. Now MySpace Records has adopted these foundlings with good intentions, though the upstart label appears unable to learn from the past, as Polysics or Die!!! Vista marks... another Polysics compilation. Vista is basically a compilation of compilations, culling most of its material from the last three Polysics records and a few stray singles. Old standards like ""New Wave Jacket"" and ""Black Out Fall Out"" get primped for yet another U.S. close-up, though the extra gloss on these re-recordings mortgages the brink-of-chaos vibe that made Polysics special in the first place. Plus, a lot of the selections are just plain baffling. ""Go Ahead Now!"" and ""Each Life Each End"" are less-than-optimal highlights from Neu, and the absence of freak-out anthems like ""XCT"" or ""Buggie Technica"" feels like a concerted effort to downplay the group's wackier side. Recent singles ""Electric Surfin' Go Go"" and ""You-You-You"" make a decent case for the band's recent proclivity to power-pop, though even when the latter unleashes its infectious Cars-like synth line, it's hard not pining for their more free-wheeling material. With their ridiculous get-ups and cartoonish sound effects, I can understand why many balked at the Brainiac comparisons Polysics initially garnered. Sadly, Vista only confirms those suspicions. Rather than embracing their id via short-circuiting Moogs and sexually frustrated cyborg rants, the band's indulged in an all-too-human sweet tooth. Chirpy ""Baby Bias"" sounds like a horrible anime version of ""A Bay Bay"" while the obnoxious sped-up chipmunk vocal track on ""Catch On Everywhere"" has reserved a special spot in rock hell. Vista's not an awful release by any means, but it throws egg on the faces of long-time Polysics apologists, and raises the question of whether or not they'll ever care to capitalize on the promising start to their career.","MySpace Records adopts these Japanese spaz-rockers, here offering basically a compilation of compilations, a record that culls most of its material from the last three Polysics records and a few stray singles.

Strangers in Our House,Meneguar,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3d05e6ef959693224fb/1:1/w_160/90b3a545.jpg,2008-01-02 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10985-strangers-in-our-house/,Troubleman Unlimited,"In an unfortunate twist of fate, Meneguar are the kind of band doomed to be written about as ""(just) straightforward rock."" If anything, the stylistic tics demonstrated by Meneguar are the same ones that initially separated indie rock from its ""straightforward"" cousin; the weird chord voicings, yelpy vocals, and insistent, fractured energy that permeate Strangers in Our House are arguably the things that kept indie rock from reaching a mainstream rock audience in the 1990s. Yes, there are no violins, kazoos, hurdy gurdys, or pseudo-tribalistic bongo jams here, but this is far from a simplistic record. Indeed, my biggest problem with Strangers in the House is that it's too high on tension and too short on release. There are always interesting undercurrents of dissonance, but they don't always fall into a pleasing (or even interesting) arc. Stopping short of the big, anthemic moments of like-minded bands such as Oxford Collapse and the Narrator, Meneguar prefer to trade entirely in tight-wound unease. The band is more than capable of getting a lot done within this framework, but the relentlessness of Strangers sometimes dulls the impact of its best moments. Opener ""Scene 2"" is characteristically spare and skeletal, propelled by skittering energy and imbued with a palpable sense of melancholy. The blunt force of the band's debut I Was Born at Night has been pared down and spread out, placing more emphasis on their consistently engaging guitar and bass interplay. ""Bury a Flower"" is quite likely the best song on the record, building to a memorable outro that recalls early Modest Mouse. More so than any other song on Strangers, ""Bury a Flower"" proceeds in a way that is both memorable and interesting, encapsulating the band's approach without seeming rote or by-the-books. ""Freshman Thoughts"" exceeds ""Bury a Flower"" melodically if it doesn't quite match it structurally. Singer Jarvis Taverniere's high, unhinged vocals often land Meneguar in mid-period Polvo territory, minus that band's far-reaching textural explorations and jarring dynamics. Indeed, the in-song shift most frequently deployed by Meneguar is that from insistent unresolved spareness to insistent sing-songy repetition. With fairly consistent arrangement and production, the nuances of the band's songs only really reveal themselves if you're paying close attention. The songs on Strangers in Our House don't necessarily stick with you, but that's part of their appeal; Meneguar make music that is necessarily anxious and ephemeral. Strangers isn't engineered for instant payoff, but it is full of the kind of unassuming intricacy that indie rock at large seems to have abandoned in favor of grander, more immediate gestures, so though it's probably not going to win any popularity contests, Strangers is a rewarding and deeply musical record.","With its weird chord voicings, yelpy vocals, and insistent, fractured energy, Strangers in Our House is full of classic 90s indie rock signifiers-- ones that are all too often brushed aside in this decade.

A Brighter Beat,Malcolm Middleton,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3aaea9e61561daa6b20/1:1/w_160/efde38eb.jpg,2008-01-02 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10951-a-brighter-beat/,Full Time Hobby,"Malcolm Middleton is best known as the multi-instrumentalist who, as one-half of Arab Strap, created music for Aidan Moffat's tales of woe. The Scottish duo split on good terms in 2006, but both members had already begun solo careers years earlier, Moffat as Lucky Pierre/L. Pierre, and Middleton under his own name. Middleton's two prior solo records didn't deviate much from Arab Strap's sound, and A Brighter Beat doesn't either, but it somewhat lives up to its title, in that it's less harrowing than his work with that band, hewing closer to the bolder sound of 2005's Into the Woods. As far as singing and lyrics go, Middleton's biggest influence might be his old partner-- he has a similar dry, deadpan delivery that shows off his Scottish accent, and dark nights of the soul are his bread-and-butter subject matter. That's not to put him down, though, because he writes some good songs, and the instrumental backing he gives them is bolder and more out-front that much of what he did for Arab Strap. The presence of Jenny Reeve on backing vocals is one of several elements that brightens the music-- when they sing in unison, she even makes him sound more melodic than he is. This batch of songs is a bit more focused on simple loneliness rather than the outright dejection he's sometimes slumped into before. There are points at which he actually sounds hopeful, almost sweet. He may be up late thinking about his own mortality on ""Up Late at Night Again"", but he is genuinely in love with the person he's singing to when he hits the big chorus, telling her, ""I'll always want to have you by my side,"" as Mogwai's Barry Burns floods the song with keyboards. On ""Fuck it, I Love You"", he admits his feelings in the hope of bringing his lover home, all over a jaunty beat and jangling guitar. Middleton also shows considerable wit in the way he describes his travels around the world, and inserts a surprisingly assertive prog-rock instrumental break in the middle of the song. A look at the tracklist, with titles like ""We're All Going to Die"" and ""Death Love Depression Love Death"", indicates a real downer, but it's not all as dark as that, and I don't think I've ever heard Middleton sound so damn lively, even when he's singing a couplet like, ""I'm four cigarettes away from having to leave the house/ I've got to make them last until the sun goes down."" Middleton refers to himself as a ""budding failure"" on closer ""Superhero Songwriters"" amid a crashing horn and strings fanfare, but even as he sings it, he's proving himself wrong. A Brighter Beat easily stands with anything Arab Strap did and brims with promise for what Middleton can accomplish on his own in the future.","Best known as one-half of the defunct Arab Strap, Malcolm Middleton returns with his third solo album.

"The Singles, Volume Four: 1966-1967",James Brown,by: Douglas Wolk,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3939d034d5c69bf4d2a/1:1/w_160/43f8933c.jpg,2008-01-02 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10929-the-singles-volume-four-1966-1967/,Hip-O Select,"As 1966 began, James Brown had finally started to find the mode that would sustain the peak of his career; by the September 1967 session that concludes this volume of Hip-O's mail-order-only series collecting all of his singles, he'd definitely reached it. The pivotal moment comes right near the end of the compilation, with the June 67 single ""Cold Sweat"", a song that made every other soul musician in the world break out in one. (Jerry Wexler is quoted in the liner notes: ""No one could get a handle on what to do next."") On ""Cold Sweat"", Brown traded concrete song form for a selection of rhythmic hooks, unresolved chords, and two-note gestures; he cut loose drummer Clyde Stubblefield to play a solo breakbeat at a time when nobody even knew what a breakbeat was; he called for Maceo Parker's saxophone solo as if spontaneously directing his band on stage rather than recording in a studio. It was the most commanding groove anybody had ever heard, and it made everything else on the radio sound stale and starched by comparison. And then he did it again, a couple of months later, with ""Get It Together"". Some of the second half of Volume Four boils down to development and research for the breakthrough of ""Cold Sweat"", especially the jacked-up rhythms of ""Bring It Up"" and ""Let Yourself Go"" and the previously unreleased instrumental two-parter ""It's a Gas"" (originally credited to ""The James Brown Dancers""). But what's notable is how much of the two-disc set isn't, and how much of it is first-rate. (Note: ""first-rate"" is about three rates away from his organ solos, which this time are inflicted on instrumental covers of Ray Charles and Martha & the Vandellas hits. They can't all be winners.) For most of 1966, Brown was working a kind of swinging big-band-via-R&B vibe-- the boogaloo beat he documented in ""Ain't That a Groove"" and its instrumental cousin ""New Breed"", as well as the slightly more programmatic but equally delightful ""Money Won't Change You"" and ""Don't Be a Drop-Out"". He scored another ballad hit with ""It's a Man's Man's Man's World"", which replaced ""Lost Someone"" as the emotional core of his live show for the next 40 years, but he didn't bother going back to that mode for a while on his singles (aside from a peculiar, three-year-old cover of George Gershwin's ""I Loves You Porgy"" that dodged the charts altogether in 67); he revisited Wynonie Harris' ""Good Rockin' Tonight"" and Wilbert Harrison's ""Kansas City"", and re-upgraded his previous upgrade of the ""5"" Royales' ""Think"" as a duet with Vicki Anderson. And he knocked out three Christmas singles in 66, one of which implies that nobody dared to suggest he might want to edit a hook and title that goes ""Let's Make Christmas Mean Something This Year"", and one of which is a brilliant demonstration of his craft: on one side, he croons ""The Christmas Song"" in a solid imitation of polite, Charles Brown-style R&B; on the other, he uses basically the same arrangement, but cuts loose on it, James Brown-style, slurring, howling and rewriting its melody on the fly. There's only one taste on Volume Four of the fury of Brown's live shows, and it's very short-- just over 100 seconds-- but astonishing. ""Tell Me That You Love Me"", the B-side of ""Don't Be a Drop-Out"", is a razor-wire tangle of shrieks and tape loops, a single verse that breaks down into a wall-shattering series of screams, then repeats the whole process. The liner notes tell the story: It's a few fragments of tape salvaged from a scrapped live album's rewrite of Junior Walker's ""Shotgun"", and bludgeoned into something like a releasable recording by production manager Bud Hobgood. There's never been another record like it, and by the time it came out, James Brown was moving so fast that he'd already forgotten about it.","Hip-O Select continues its vital mail-order-only series by collecting all of James Brown's 1966 and 1967 singles.

There Will Be Blood OST,Jonny Greenwood,by: Mark Pytlik,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3e4b1335d7bf169a676/1:1/w_160/9ef8b74b.jpg,2008-01-02 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11007-there-will-be-blood-ost/,Nonesuch,"The first hint that Jonny Greenwood might make a gifted composer came in 1997, when, bored with the syrupy, provincial strings that dominated the tail-end of Britpop, he channeled Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki for the arrangement on OK Computer's ""Climbing Up The Walls"". Essentially a wall of quarter notes played against each other, that noisy squall stood out in dramatic opposition to the ""Bittersweet Symphony""s of the world. Where the traditional rock approach had always been to use strings to amplify melody and opulence, Greenwood was using them to create discord and ambience; in other words, he was playing orchestras like he played his guitar. While his interest in what he's since referred to in interviews as a ""wrong"" string sound manifested in later Radiohead highlights like ""How to Disappear Completely"" and ""Pyramid Song"", his compositional talents didn't become readily apparent until his imaginative score for 2003's sweeping documentary Bodysong. A lush mixture of strings, pianos, percussions, electronics, and otherwise unrecognizable textures, *Bodysong'*s sprawling fourteen tracks allowed Greenwood to indulge in a level of experimentation and free-jazz complexity that wouldn't have otherwise fit on a Radiohead record. Since then, Greenwood's graduation to mainstream film work has been pretty much inevitable, but even still, he'd probably be the first to admit that a Paul Thomas Anderson (Boogie Nights, Magnolia, Punch-Drunk Love) project represents a pretty plum debut. Regardless of how you feel about Anderson as a director, few of his contemporaries manage to weave original music into the fabric of their films quite as devotedly. To score an Anderson project is to have a starring role in it; that this particular film-- a loose adaptation of Upton Sinclair's Oil!-- is set in a desolate California town circa 1920 only makes the task that much bigger. After his initial contact with Anderson, Greenwood apparently wrote hours and hours of music for the film; in the end, the duo pared the score back to a very tidy 33 minutes, a small portion of which was lifted from Greenwood’s 2005 BBC-commissioned suite Popcorn Superhet Receiver. Nonetheless, this is all new ground for Greenwood. If the fidgety Bodysong was proof that he isn't ever likely to be short of ideas, There Will Be Blood feels tighter, more disciplined, and lonelier than anything he's done before. Piano, percussion, and Greenwood's beloved Ondes-Martenot all feature, but it's the strings that take center stage here. While Greenwood has always been vocal about the originators and inspirations behind a lot of his techniques (Penderecki, Gorecki, and Messiaen come up often), There Will Be Blood's string arrangements nonetheless sound vanguard and exploratory in the context of Hollywood film scores. From the goosebump-inducing glissandos on opener ""Wide Open Spaces"" to the spiralling staccatos on ""Future Markets"" to the creeping dissonance in ""Henry Plainview"" (there's that ""wrong"" sound again), Greenwood's alien, experimental sensibilities lurk around each corner.","Radiohead renaissance man Jonny Greenwood makes his Hollywood film score debut with this soundtrack to director Paul Thomas Anderson's latest outing, set in a desolate California town circa 1920.

This Fool Can Die Now,Scout Niblett,by: Liz Colville,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3ae5e6ef959693224b9/1:1/w_160/b911d1c8.jpg,2007-12-14 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10955-this-fool-can-die-now/,Too Pure,"Scout Niblett's fifth album in as many years is engineered by Steve Albini and features four duets with Will Oldham. The record's world could be described as sonically anemic, which, it turns out, is a pleasant place to be: mired in cloudy, druggy reflections, Niblett seems to sit cross-legged, figuratively speaking, head down, a blonde wig perhaps obscuring her presence from her audience. It's only the moping we're allowed to watch, dislike, enjoy-- the crawling, dreary movements of her vocal cords, which take center stage on tracks like ""Let Thine Heart Be Warmed"", a rather Nirvana-y rock number without Oldham decorated with rangy, mangy verses. When Oldham appears, it's to temper Niblett's exhausted rage with see-saw guitar and vaguely romantic lines like, ""We can rest our bones side by side,"" to which Niblett responds, ""It's so fun to see me being me/ Alongside you."" The spineless beauty of the guitar on this traditional, ""Do You Want to Be Buried With My People?"", is of course indebted to a folk tradition epochs old, one driven by a voice's romantic story, but it's to Cat Power that Niblett owes a lot of her songs' pleasure; the two singers have voices that are at equal turns milky and smoky, brave and terrified. But Niblett has declined to make her own Greatest, that troubling, robust kind of album that scares old fans and probably entertains them, too. Instead, Niblett remains underproduced, downtempo, depressing, and teetering on forgettable, at least in the ear of the inattentive and quick to move along. The strengths and weaknesses of ""Kiss"", one of the album's meatier tracks, dance around each other like its two vocalists so often do: a guitar turns in a drunken daze, awakening to the groping howls of Oldham and Niblett every dozen or so measures, and those piercing voices scar the somnolent listener's ears with a passionate chorus, ""It coulda killed me,"" (""it"" referring to the kiss of the title). But the guitar melody is so predictable it's almost irritating, and the fiddly violin that careens in the background is just as dull. Cut out the melody, and the power and presence of the vocal line is fantastic, but the duet seems strained-- even trapped-- in the obviousness of the other instruments. There is a dark, fiery, peaceful quality to a handful of the album's tracks, which is comforting after the riotous interludes of the aforementioned selection. Still, even a gorgeous Buckley remembrance on ""Black Hearted Queen"" can get a little boring in places. The melody is inventive, but the Cat Power faxes get a little much; it's something that can't really be helped, but it's nonetheless distracting. Where it works is on the stormy monster ""Yummy"", which cavorts into a creepier minor-key melody that saves the same group of instruments from sounding as tritely arranged as they do on some of the ballads. And when supported by the line, ""Oh forgive me, I think I'll eat you,"" the song becomes even more engrossing than its strings already allowed. The spacious and playful ""Dinosaur Egg"", which follows, has remnants of Bettie Serveert, the Police, and Liz Phair among its echoic guitar and chatty vocal line. Patience reveals that the last chunk of this album's 14 tracks is where all of its essentials lie. On the ultimate, ""Fishes and Honey"", a piano makes its mark for the first time, an interesting choice that seems tacked on, but not pointlessly so. It's a beautiful way to close things out, a kind of nose-thumb to anyone who didn't make it all the way there. But as with most elegantly downtrodden folk albums, this one takes a handful of listens before its gems can be properly appraised.","Nottingham-born singer returns on Too Pure with her fifth album, a grim, sexy, and sad folk album featuring four duets with Will Oldham.

Leaves in the River,Sea Wolf,by: Stephen M.

Trouble is, I didn't believe him then, and I don't believe him now. Church, who is Sea Wolf's only permanent member, is certainly no wolf: There's no snarling on his highly civilized songs, no aggression, no animal conflict, nor any menace at all. Instead, Brown might be better characterized as a sheep, as his songs closely follow Elliott Smith, Death Cab for Cutie, and the Shins. Sea Wolf hails from Silver Lake, a Los Angeles neighborhood that might be best described as Williamsburg West, as it maintains a bustling scene of indie bands and hipster denizens. Earlimart's early albums of shiny, sturdy indie pop set the mold and have inspired groups like Silversun Pickups, Rooney, Giant Drag, Irving (Church's former band), and now Sea Wolf, which takes its name from the Jack London novel. But where Earlimart and some other progenitors focus on sonics first and songs a close second, Sea Wolf is primarily a songwriter's project. Leaves in the River was produced by Phil Ek of Modest Mouse, Built to Spill, and Shins fame, and he gives the album a light autumnal mood to fit the lyrics. The album begins with the sound of rain, a two-note guitar theme that sounds like a train-crossing signal, and a rising, buzzing ambience. This is not a song, though, just an overture. Once it dies away, the title track begins, and Church describes a Halloween evening walk to a house that's haunted by ghosts of a sad childhood. If he were really a wolf, the story would have been a lot more interesting. Leaves in the River is overburdened with this kind of clunkily conceptual songwriting, especially on ""Middle Distance Runner"", which never sells its central metaphor that love is a track meet. Church fares better on ""Winter Windows"" and ""The Cold, the Dark & the Silence"" (despite that overreaching title), but if he's going to resurrect songs from the EP, he might have chosen ""I Made a Resolution"", which shows he's capable of tweaking his own despairing music with humor and playfulness. Also, that song has some genuine motion, whereas the album tracks sound weighed down with too many un-wolflike intentions. Even the more upbeat songs like ""Black Dirt"", ""You're a Wolf"", and ""Song for the Dead"" never quite percolate, but instead sound mired in the mud of that initial rainfall. Church sounds a little more comfortable on quieter, slower songs like ""The Rose Captain"" and ""Black Leaf Falls"", with its army of shakers. Mopiness may be Church's endgame, but there's so little gravity on this record it's a wonder the leaves fall into the river at all.","Former Irving member Alex Brown Church follows his Get to the River Before It Runs Too Low EP with a Phil Ek-produced debut full-length of highly civilized, autumnal singer-songwriter tunes.

Those who take Burzum's best black metal as an unholy grail argue that Wolves' black-metal half-- characterized by impenetrably fast drums, focused guitars and ferocious, muffled vocals-- is competent enough, if somewhat standard. Meanwhile, those who've heard of the record's operatic, post-rock menace-- serpentine female vocals where most bands would put keyboards and gauzy keyboards where most bands would be countering guitar arpeggios-- find Two Hunters compositionally imperfect, lined with missed opportunities a smarter band would have recognized. And those eager for a successful post-rock/black-metal merger find that Two Hunters-- which more often bleeds one dichotomous idea into the next rather than stack them into one dense moment-- isn't that album. But none of this really matters, whether you're trying to understand Wolves in the Throne Room as a band or enjoy one of the best-paced post-rock or most well-tempered black metal albums you've ever heard. Wolves in the Throne Room-- two brothers and a friend who share a sylvan dwelling and a plot of self-sustaining land outside of Olympia-- aren't really into compromise or expectations. In interviews, they've said they're ""not black metal, or, more accurately we play black metal on our own terms"" and ""I don't know what post-rock is."" They've declared that they don't think of themselves as a progression in the grand black metal scheme, so post-black metal labels need not apply. They've publicly damned their need to tour in a van, to maintain a MySpace page, to sign to a record label. ""We'll see how long we can keep it up before we retire to our farm,"" the trio told Ultimate Metal's Jason Jordan in a surprisingly candid 2006 interview. ""A loud voice in my head tells me that we should only play this music on the winter solstice, drunk on mead and cider, burning torches to remind us of the long-forgotten sun."" Like the band's polytheistic sound, such a Cincinnatian attitude could be seen as ambivalent or even irreverent: Do you want to be a band or a bunch of farmers? Do you want to nod at black metal or do you want to play it? Do you really want your guitar player to ignore the obvious chord change on the beautiful ""Cleansing"", or do you want to perfect your umpteen-minute broods? Actually, that's about right: Two Hunters is mostly indifferent to conventions, or at least their corollaries. The black metal portions of ""Vastness and Sorrow"" indeed sound like U.S. black metal, and the instrumental middle third of the same track sounds like Pelican with sharper talons, bigger wings, and a pacemaker. But the record's real power emerges from the subtle bleeding between the memes, not to mention their stark juxtaposition. The metal moments come in long, grand, ferocious sweeps that keep everything in motion, and the instrumental moments often seem truncated or incomplete because they're interested in the same sort of motion, always seeking the next stop. Nothing's precious or perfected on Two Hunters. It's rough and potent, even when guest vocalist Jessica Kinney delivers its most beautiful moment with her lullaby aria on ""Cleansing"". After all, it's a record about the world ending so it can begin anew. If the world's ending-- and Wolves in the Throne Room believes it is-- that missed chord on ""Cleansing"" is trivial. And there's no better example than closer ""I Will Lay Down My Bones Among the Rocks and Roots"". It uses the rest of the record as its prototype, its dynamics serving as catapults and its pace implying wars and fires and rescues and rebirths. It eases in, guitar notes hanging over zephyr synthesizers that are effective if trite. One chord stops short, and the pounding drums and roaring guitars doze everything. Five minutes in, the double bass drum pushes the envelope, then disappears, sheets of guitar feedback intertwining. The moment is broken by another surge, all militaristic march and tortured yowls. It melts away, returns and melts away again. Only the guitars are left to slink around Kinney's voice. She fades, too, leaving field recordings of birdsong and wind. Its work done on one of the year's most singular, unflinching records, Wolves in the Throne Room return to the farm, expecting fire and floods, with the wars of extremists raging at their backs.","This rough and potent offering from rural Washington State combines black metal ferocity with operatic post-rock.

"The Complete Motown Singles, Vol. 8: 1968",Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3bfea9e61561daa6b47/1:1/w_160/382d9330.jpg,2007-12-14 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10970-the-complete-motown-singles-vol-8-1968/,Hip-O Select,"""Ben, make sure to play 'Precious Lord, Take My Hand', in the meeting tonight. Play it real pretty."" Those were the last words of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., spoken to musician Ben Branch in Memphis, around 6 p.m. on April 4, 1968. How strange that Dr. King's final words should have been about music-- a request for an old favorite, no less. King had seen better days than early 1968. He felt that the Civil Rights movement was drifting, if not coming unraveled, his advocacy for nonviolence increasingly drowned out by a bolder, louder Black Power movement. King's request wouldn't be fulfilled until five days later, when Mahalia Jackson sang ""Precious Lord, Take My Hand"" at his funeral. Riots began in dozens of American cities on the night of April 4 as news of King's assassination spread. In Detroit, which was still recovering from terrible rioting the year before, Motown founder Berry Gordy watched as the violence hit close to home for the second year in a row and he decided he'd had enough: He moved the company's business offices downtown to the Donovan Building and out of the cluster of houses on West Grand Boulevard they had occupied since 1959. All that remained in the old neighborhood was Studio A, aka the Snakepit, where most of the music that had propelled Motown into the very fabric of American life had been recorded. Of all the black men in America in 1968, few were closer than Gordy to living in the promised land King had so famously and eloquently looked toward in the improvised closing of his final speech. His company competed on equal footing with the biggest, most established major labels, routinely sent singles up the pop and r&b charts, and had brought him considerable wealth. Though he scarcely lacked for confidence, I doubt Gordy could have envisioned himself in the position he found himself in when he put the first Tamla label on Marv Johnson's ""Come to Me"" in 1959. As much as Motown had come to define Detroit in the eyes (and ears) of many Americans, Gordy had his sights set West; he'd opened an L.A. branch in the mid-60s, which by this point was churning out about one-fifth of his label's music, and he aspired to a multimedia presence that extended into film. Gordy took off for California fulltime in mid-1968, a move so sudden that even Smokey Robinson, Gordy's long-time friend and one of his closest associates, was taken by surprise when it happened. Between the company's move downtown and Gordy's flight to the Left Coast, many of Hitsville's veterans felt that the sense of community and single-mindedness that permeated Motown in its first nine years had died-- Herb Boyd quotes guitarist and Funk Brother Eddie Willis saying as much in his introductory essay to Hip-O Select's six-disc Complete Motown Singles, Vol. 8: 1968 box. For the music, the moves downtown and cross-country initially meant little-- Motown's racially integrated house band was so good by that point they could've cut the backing for a #1 in their sleep. If anything, they were better than ever, and even the oldest hands in the band were taking their game to a new level-- bassist James Jamerson in particular does some astounding playing on these songs. There were changes at hand, though. The departure of the Holland-Dozier-Holland writing and production team in late 1967 had left a huge void (and spawned ugly lawsuits and counter-suits), though the label would continue to release tracks they had left in the vault throughout 1968. There was no one at the label capable of filling that void, but Norman Whitfield and the husband-wife team of Nick Ashford and Valerie Simpson were able to pick up much of the slack. Aside from personnel shifts, though, it was simply impossible for Motown's musicians to ignore everything else that was going on in music and the world at the time. James Brown's ""Say It Loud (I'm Black and I'm Proud)"" essentially erased the word ""negro"" from polite conversation, the Beatles spent the spring at an ashram overlooking the Ganges and much of the fall riding the six-minute ""Hey Jude"" up the pop chart, Sly & the Family Stone's ""Dance to the Music"" brought funk to more ears than anything before it, and it's hard to shake the feeling that maybe silly love songs aren't always going to cut it when you're watching reports on the Tet Offensive on CBS and your brother is in Vietnam. And so it was that a few of Motown's biggest hits in 1968 pointed in new directions: The Temptations took us on a gritty funk odyssey to ""Cloud Nine"", Marvin Gaye's harrowing, intense version of ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"" finally saw release after a year and a half in the can, and the Supremes topped the charts with the social commentary of ""Love Child"". ""Love Child"" has a story behind it that only could have occurred at Motown: Gordy, anxious for the Supremes to have another No. 1 and hoping to iron out the wrinkles caused by H-D-H's departure, essentially ordered five of his songwriters to write a chart-topper for the group, and put them in a hotel together to get it done. The Supremes were barely even in on the recording session-- Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong would find themselves on ""The Ed Sullivan Show"" dressed as (rather tacky) tramps, miming to a song that went to No. 1 as ordered, knocking ""Hey Jude"" out of the top spot. The Temptations were in transition in 1968 as well-- David Ruffin was out as primary lead singer mid-year after proving unreliable one too many times. He was replaced with Dennis Edwards, who'd been a member of the by-then defunct Contours for a few minutes. Their first two 45s that year were marvels of sophisticated harmony soul, but when Edwards made his recorded debut with the group, it was with his gritty, world-beaten lead on ""Cloud Nine"". The song still features a fair number of harmony vocals, but the members also trade off leads, and the instrumental backing hits like a ton of bricks, with stabbing wah-wah guitar, funky drumming, and Jamerson's frantic bassline creating a groove different from anything Motown had previously done. It was fitting that ""Cloud Nine"" hit near the end of the year, as it captured the zeitgeist of a turbulent period in American history. Most of Motown's other output that year was less concerned with the here and now. Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell continued to be presented on record as duet partners, despite the fact that Terrell was in the hospital with a terminal brain tumor. ""Ain't Nothing Like the Real Thing"", produced by Ashford & Simpson, became one of their biggest and most enduring hits. Gladys Knight & the Pips had found their groove at Motown the previous year with their version of ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"", had a solid year, and the Miracles were as reliable as ever-- if you've followed this series this far, by now you've realized that Smokey Robinson had a truly singular way of writing a melody, whether the song was slow or fast. On ""Special Occasion"", he and the Miracles-- whose unique mix of male harmonies, with Claudette Robinson on top, was unique for the label's roster-- play a brilliant game of call-and-response as Robinson's vocal twists through an up-and-down melody with breathtaking dexterity. It was a mixed year for many of Motown's other long-tenured acts. No group was more affected by the loss of H-D-H than the Four Tops, whose success had been built almost solely on the production team's genius for making dramatic tracks. The label reached into the existing LP catalog to make minor hits out of non-Motown covers recorded in 1967-- ""If I Were a Carpenter"" and the Left Banke's ""Walk Away Renee"", both brilliantly interpreted by Levi Stubbs-- but the group would never quite repeat the success it had with H-D-H. Other groups were winding down or moving on: The Monitors, who'd been a peripheral Hitsville act almost since the beginning, split (Monitor Richard Street wound up in the Temptations the following year). The Isley Brothers, who'd never been given proper attention at Motown, created a stone classic with ""Take Me in Your Arms (Rock Me a Little While)"" (an H-D-H production and a song that had originally been done by Kim Weston years before), but left at the end of the year to reactivate their own T-Neck label; they hit big in their first post-Motown try with the funk classic ""It's Your Thing"". Meanwhile, Martha & the Vandellas struggled to compete with the Supremes, who received far more attention, and the Spinners continued to be nearly ignored. By 1968, Stevie Wonder, who'd been just 13 when he first came to Motown, was blossoming into a genuine savant; he was inching toward the producer's chair and starting to take more ownership of his work, co-writing all of his material and building his own style. ""For Once in My Life"" and ""Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Da-Day"" are masterful performances, but ""You Met Your Match"" is the true revelation on this set, a funky, confident song that features a gritty, virtuoso vocal performance. It also was Wonder's first entry in the producers' log-- he was 18 years old. Shorty Long was more than twice that age and had long been one of Motown's most consistent but least appreciated artists. His singles in 1968 included his own take on Pigmeat Markham's ""Here Comes the Judge"" routine, wherein he plays a judge comically doling out outlandish sentences to assorted miscreants-- history shows Markham's own contemporaneous version to be better and funnier, but Long's actually charted higher, and you can bet that the support of Motown's Soul subsidiary was a big part of that. Of the label's new arrivals that year, Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers, a multi-racial band from the West Coast that featured a young Tommy Chong (yes, of Cheech & Chong) on guitar, paid the best early creative dividends. Their ""Does Your Mama Know About Me"" is a sublime soul ballad with fantastic backing harmonies and a great, swaying arrangement that still has the power to sweep a listener away. They didn't last long, though-- the Vancouvers wound up touring behind Chris Clark, whose bounding blue-eyed soul burner ""Whisper You Love Me Boy"" is a highlight of this set, while Taylor stayed in Detroit, recording. It was Taylor who discovered the Jackson 5 and would go on to produce their early sessions the following year. Though 1968 can be considered a transitional year in many ways for Motown, it was still a very good year for the music, and as with every previous volume of this series, it's brilliantly presented with tons of photos and information. It was a difficult year that saw further escalation in Vietnam, a sitting President decline to run for re-election, rioting across the U.S. and around the world, the assassinations of King and Robert Kennedy, the last gasp of segregationism in the form of George Wallace's presidential candidacy, the Biafran War, the invasion of Czechoslovakia by the Warsaw Pact nations-- Marvin Gaye claimed that that the only bright spot in his life in 1968 was the Detroit Tigers rallying from a 3-1 deficit to beat the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series. But through all of this, and a whirlwind of personal and corporate change, the people of Motown managed to keep a hand on the rudder. In the final week of 1968, as the Apollo 8 mission was returning from the first-ever manned orbit of the moon, Berry Gordy could look in the back of Billboard and see that five of his singles were in the Top 10, with ""I Heard It Through the Grapevine"", ""For Once in My Life"", and ""Love Child"" at 1-2-3. Look further down the chart to number 16, and you'll find Young-Holt Unlimited's ""Soulful Strut"", one of scores of hit singles that climbed the charts on the back of the Motown Sound in the late 60s-- after 10 years in business Motown was not only successful but hugely influential. If Gordy wasn't living in King's Promised Land, he was at least the man on the mountaintop, surveying it.","Hip-O Select continues to collect every Motown single, here presenting the label's output from 1968, a year in which the company moved to a downtown office, Berry Gordy left Detroit for Los Angeles, the Holland-Dozier-Holland writing and production team was no longer in the label's employ, and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated.

In Rainbows [CD 2],Radiohead,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3d4b1335d7bf169a659/1:1/w_160/ca8ff128.jpg,2007-12-14 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10988-in-rainbows-cd-2/,self-released,"The ""pay what you want"" fire sale that launched In Rainbows in October wasn't a new idea so much as a perfect amalgamation of distribution tactics that bands large (Smashing Pumpkins) and small (the thousands on MySpace) have tried since the birth of the mp3. As technorati, Radiohead are to indie bands what Led Zeppelin were to broke old bluesmen: They took the ideas and got people to scream about them. Three months later, the questions keep flying about their business: How many people bought the download? What was the average sum they chucked in the tip jar? Is it true that, even though Radiohead basically gave the files away, a slim majority of listeners went ahead and stole them out of habit? It's fair to say that the shop talk eclipses interest in the B-sides record tucked into Radiohead's $80 discbox (which it packs in alongside In Rainbows on both CD and vinyl, plus pix, artwork, lyrics-- and if you have to ask if that's all worth the price, it's clearly not meant for you). Like the main LP, this bonus disc could not be mistaken for the work of a band other than Radiohead-- from Thom Yorke's nerve's-edge balladeering, to ever-slighter splashes of experimentalism, to guitar tones as fussed over as other band's hairdos. But it also catches the band at its most maudlin: Not only did Radiohead cram their leftovers onto this bonus disc, but they also gather all the mopey, overplayed tropes their last album left behind. Radiohead have always capitalized on tension, but here, that tension turns to exhaustion. The playlist wades from one slice of paranoia to another, the ear going most often to the incessant horror film piano-- and to Yorke's voice. His strained falsetto and near-soul-singing on ""Down Is the New Up"" deliver the risk-taking you'd expect from an odds-and-ends release, but the cynical/alienated rut into which he grinds himself has the persistence of a toothache. ""Up on the Ladder"", which has been under construction since the 1990s, is all climb, no teeter-- and elsewhere bare lines like ""I can't face the evening straight/ And you can offer me escape"" sound like the guy at the next bar stool that you've been turning your back to all night. Here, Yorke sounds like neither a post-millennial prophet nor an uncanny empathist, so much as a crank. Still, the thick fog that hangs over the album doesn't obscure all its gems. Though it goes nowhere, ""Go Slowly""'s slow burn would have fit on the proper album-- for that matter, it could've been an outtake from any of their last four records. The pristine ""Last Flowers"" may be a textbook Yorke ballad, but at least it's a pretty one. As the album's only wake-up call, ""Bangers & Mash""'s antic drums grab your attention until Yorke's crude snarling lets it go again-- although the itchy, uncomfortable feeling it gives you is an interesting break from an otherwise sweatless set. Best-of-EP honors go to ""Four Minute Warning"", a breath-catching little campfire song about (what else?) taking cover from an aerial attack: Radiohead have predicted World War III for so long, it's no surprise they'd stay calm when it shows up. But its weaknesses notwithstanding, this bonus disc isn't meant for the public at large; it's for the fans, who've studied these songs through bootlegs, YouTube clips, and clues on websites. To them, it's an extra goodie in the luxurious Discbox stocking. And as net-savvy as Radiohead may be-- and for as many goofy webcasts and sketchy websites as they've posted over the years-- they still seem to love their hard, physical packages. These aren't just the studio versions of ""Up on the Ladder"", et al.: They're the canonical, compact disc editions, polished and packaged as official versions. A lesser band might have crammed some bootlegs and demo takes in here, but when Radiohead put something on disc, they want it to count. For a band with so many ideas about digital life, they still treat the record as king.","Shop talk about the industry of In Rainbows has largely pulled focus off the bonus CD tucked into Radiohead's $80 discbox-- but maybe that's for the best.

Ditherer,Fog,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3a7c0084474cd0c2170/1:1/w_160/7c25f21d.jpg,2007-12-13 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10948-ditherer/,Lex,"With its emphasis on slacker attitude and anything-goes energy over ambition and technical polish, indie rock is the consummate entry-level genre. It's the musical equivalent of a pick-up-and-play Wii game compared to, say, techno's steeply learning-curved Xbox 360 shooter. As such, musicians who began their careers as catch-all indie rockers before narrowing their focus to more technically and conceptually challenging genres are a dime a dozen. Fog's Andrew Broder is much rarer: His trajectory inverts the familiar one. Fog's first two LPs were released on Ninja Tune, but they were steeped in the Anticon aesthetic (fittingly, Doseone brought Fog to Ninja Tune's attention)-- an obscure haze of post-Prince-Paul sample wizardry ballasted with baubles of melody and avant-hop guest stars, generously laced with rhythmic decomposition and seething negative space. The delicate Ether Teeth gave us Fog at its most challenging and rewarding-- it was an uncompromising attempt to build music that towered, teetered, but didn't move. For listeners bored by artful stasis, the relatively straightforward electro-pop of 2005's 10th Avenue Freakout (which featured discernible structures and more of Broder's vocals than ever before) must've seemed like a step in the right direction. But for those who admired the imperfect yet promising Ether Teeth, it was the first step in a regression that culminates in the unabashed indie-rock of Ditherer. There's nothing wrong with the urge to try on more traditional garb, but while Broder is an adequate frontman, it's not his best look, and Ditherer makes the previously outré musician sound mundane. He's in the habit of mercilessly stretching his syllables over the tricked-out riffs, which is a good cheat to make awkward lines fit into consistent structures, but quickly becomes monotonous. And in this context, his ridiculous lyrics have more in common with the dopey pretensions of Primus than Bob Pollard's absurdist Zen. For Ditherer, Broder coalesced Fog into a rock trio featuring himself on guitar and vocals, Mark Erickson on bass, and Tim Glenn on drums. As if making up for lost time, the album finds Fog stitching together a hodgepodge of rock styles into a quilt of clashing colors. ""We Will Have Vanished"" is ponderous, enervating stoner rock. ""Inflatable Ape Pt. 3"" is indebted to Pavement, with its stabby guitars and nervous drums. The roots-rock-gone-wild of ""I Have Been Wronged"" tangles up a percolating guitar figure with forlorn hound-dog vocals, zippy prog trills, and a lounge-y breakdown. ""Hallelujah Daddy"" is off-kilter Southern rock, and the spacious, eerie ""What Gives?"" (which features Microphones' Phil Elvrum on backing vocals) reminds us that it's hard to understate how crucial Thom Yorke's otherworldly voice is to Radiohead's success. Broder is better at details than broad strokes, and Ditherer contains some excellent ones; they're just buried in the piecemeal and decidedly indelicate songwriting. ""Hallelujah Daddy"", which features a guest appearance from Why?, comes to life in its gospel-rock middle section. The dubby title track (dubby is good for Broder; it plays into his strengths) profits greatly from Dosh's sprightly electro embellishments and Andrew Bird's weepy violin, while ""What's Up Freaks?"" offers a welcome respite from Broder's voice with a guest spot by Low's Mimi Parker and Alan Sparhawk. It's easy to admire the careful studio touches that pop up in almost every song-- the helium-deflating breakdown of ""We Will Have Vanished"", the telegraphic percussive blips and vocal strobes of ""You Did What You Thought"", and the bending sheet-metal on post-rock epic ""On the Gallows"". But it's hard to enjoy them without bogging down in been-there, done-that songwriting.",,4.8,
Walkin' Bank Roll,Project Pat,by: Evan McGarvey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b366ea9e61561daa6ab2/1:1/w_160/bc5fd21c.jpg,2007-12-13 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10889-walkin-bank-roll/,Koch,"To anyone who has ever wondered why Memphis' Project Pat has six proper LP's and a parcel of mixtapes to his name when all he seems to offer is yippy knuckle-headed fury triangulated on a quality spectrum between Beanie Sigel and Jim Jones, there is an explanation. And it's perhaps rap's most known unknown secret: he's the brother of Three 6 Mafia's Juicy J. It's not a very publicized relationship, partly because rappers usually associate with their chosen families and not with their blood (Del Tha Funky Homosapien and Ice Cube, cousins?), and partly because Pat's played strong enough a role in Three 6's hobgoblin hydraulic press over the past few years that the whole professional set-up doesn't seem like overt nepotism compared to, say, the way our federal government has been rolling. But I digress. Three 6 have done and will do a million songs about drank, punching out haters, and property destruction, but no one fills the role of ""enforcer"" quite like Pat. Pat's latest, Walkin' Bank Roll is straight in his high-sticking, head-thumping, one-part glee/nine-hundred-parts gristle wheelhouse. He gets to feast on machine-worked hooks (and the verses that love them) where he can splay out endless mantras that are as subtle in their phonetics are they are rhetorically crude: ""I'm sweatin' like fool, I just popped a pill/ Lookin' down on you boys from chrome wagon wheels"" (note the progression of sonorants). And Juicy and DJ Paul have doubled back on their post-Most Known Unknown sonics and given Pat (they produced the entire album) the appropriate selection of sinister pianos and twinkling strings likely sourced from either Willie Hutch or the soundtracks to the Resident Evil games. Which would be fitting. Survival horror is Pat's bag. No matter what the song's title is, and no matter how far away it might seem be from violence-- ""Good Weed"", ""Hate My Swag"", ""Motivated""-- Pat is going to push someone's wig back. Loving not just the moment of violence, but the setup narrative, Pat gets as close to artfulness as he can when he raps things like: ""Fee fi fo fum!/ You can feel slugs of this the Mossberg shotgun, chest full of blood/ You could say that your life could end in a flash/ Like the wind blows dead brown leaves in the grass"" (""Motivated""). Now those aren't fantastic lines, probably not even great ones, but Pat's immersed himself lyrically. And, regrettably, he's just as entrenched in that violence as a citizen. He finished a four-year sentence in 2005 for a parole violation-- attempting to purchase automatic rifles-- and, it should be noted, he's previously been to jail for robbery. His home, Memphis, is at or near the top of every nationwide murder statistic, and Pat has always been matter-of-fact about how many killers, dealers, and lords adore him. Liberal guilt be damned, he actually knows what he's rapping about. So what keeps Bank Roll from descending into the void that claimed 2006's Crook By Da Book-- an album as jet deep and abyss-like in sound as Missy's Da Real World or Massive Attack's Mezzanine-- are the light production touches and grimace breaking moments in this pixie-stick hood opera. Juicy and Paul space out each song's instrumental intro and outro so Pat only has to spit two verses while keeping the track lengths decent, and they bring in a few handpicked guests to inject a little color in this crimson and kush-green on black affair-- Pimp C is near-perfect on the learned, caustic ""Talkin' Smart"". Pat himself has a bizarre gallows humor and suddenly throws his voice into a high-register hiccup when he wants to emphasize a word. He'll get his ""piiiimpin!"" as squeaky as Katt Williams, and though he doesn't do anything as a funny as praising a woman for having ""rhino legs"" (as he did on Book's ""Good Googly Moogly""), there's a lighter thematic touch here than on previous Pat albums. Give credit to the architects for that. Juicy and Paul close out Walkin' Bank Roll with another free form, blissfully candid outro. They forget the name of the album they're supposed to be rounding out-- Paul: ""What is the name of this album? Cause first he said 'Gimme Me' and now I think he changed to 'Rollin Dollar' or something?"" Juicy: ""No, 'Bank Roll' something about 'Bank Roll'...""-- hype up the next releases from Lil' Wyte, Chrome, and the new Choices movie, laugh, coin a few drinks, and forget a whole bunch of other shit. They are, in the words of Paul, ""drunk, old, and high."" Pat may have all the street medallions, but it sure sounds good to be the guys pulling the strings.","Memphis rapper, six proper albums and a few mixtapes into his career, laces observations about grim and violent street reality with gallows humor.

The Big Stiff Box Set,Various Artists,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3ce13d197565213a9d6/1:1/w_160/4d6e62e9.jpg,2007-12-13 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10983-the-big-stiff-box-set/,Salvo,"Any box set that starts with Nick Lowe's ""Heart of the City"" is going to be pretty good, but any box set that gets from that song to Elvis Costello's ""Less Than Zero"" in 10 tracks via the Damned, Motörhead, and Plummet Airlines' rock epic ""Silver Shirt"" is going to be great. By that same logic, any box set that peppers those mind-blowers with pub-rock like Roogalator's ""All Aboard"" and Lew Lewis & His Band's ""Boogie on the Street"" is going to be a rollercoaster, to put it nicely. The Stiff Records Box Set managed this feat back in 1992, compiling nearly 100 hits and misses on four discs. The Big Stiff Box Set, which deviates enough from that setlist to complement its out-of-print predecessor instead of replace it, is likewise a great rollercoaster: A formidable label retrospective that includes more than its share of incredible tracks mixed with more than a few that haven't aged well or just weren't very good to begin with. Of course, every label, however venerable, has its high points and low, but to its credit, the UK-released The Big Stiff Box Set-- which follows a wave of reissues from the resurrected label-- favors historical inclusivity over consistency and is all the better for it. According to this set, there's no such thing as a Stiff Sound-- the imprint has billed itself as the ""world's most flexible label."" Founded in 1976, Stiff primarily worked 7"" singles by career artists, newcomers, and one-offs, paying special attention to packaging and sending artists out on traveling revues around the UK. Stiff signed artists who would go on to great things and others who would go on to nothing. How's this for impressive? First singles by Nick Lowe, Elvis Costello, the Damned, Wreckless Eric, Kirsty MacColl, and the Pogues. What about introducing Britain to Americans like Devo, the Go-Go's, the Plasmatics, and Richard Hell (unfortunately omitted from this set)? But Stiff's flexibility extended beyond its creative business practices and savvy signings to its music, and despite its rugged independent stance, the label essentially followed larger British trends, tracing pub rock into punk, then ska and new wave, with depot stops at gospel, rockabilly, and soul. It's all pop in the end, which makes The Big Stiff Box Set a grab-bag experience. On one hand, it sounds scattered in places, especially on the first disc, as if the commonality of distribution isn't enough to connect these songs. On the other, such variety can be bracing and even exciting, especially on the second disc, which begins with punk (the Members' ""Solitary Confinement""), touches on bubblegum (Rachel Sweet's cover of Carla Thomas' ""B.A.B.Y.""), detours into ska (Madness's ""One Step Beyond""), catches a flight to L.A. (the Go-Go's' ""We Got the Beat""), and ends up in Jamaica (Desmond Dekker's ""Please Don't Bend""). That's not even mentioning Wreckless Eric's catchy ""Take the Cash (K.A.S.H.)"", Lene Lovich's wonderful staccato delivery on ""Lucky Number"", Jona Lewie's delectably bitter ""You'll Always Find Me in the Kitchen at Parties"". Big and Stiff, eh? Well, the label always had an ear for humor. In 1980, Stiff released an LP titled The Wit and Wisdom of Ronald Reagan, which sold surprisingly well despite being blank on both sides. Stiff trafficked in talky novelties like Max Wall's ""England's Glory"", with its yakety sax and rambling lyrics, and Mick Farren & the Deviants' ""Let's Loot the Supermarket Again Like We Did Last Summer"", with its healthy satiric self-awareness. These songs, mostly forgotten but compiled here for posterity, might have stemmed from outrage, but now sound quaint and innocuous-- not rarities so much as oddities. Except, that is, for Ian Dury, whose songs ""Sex & Drugs & Rock & Roll"" and ""Sweet Gene Vincent"" put this sound toward more serious ends. History's been kinder to Dury than Wall and Farren, obviously. In addition to comparing one band to Huey Lewis & the News with no detectable irony, the Big Stiff liner notes manage to speak to novices who just discovered My Aim Is True as well as to veterans who know the label's catalogue by heart*,* offering extensive introductions to artists as well as obscure trivia. The Big Stiff Box Set is both an introduction to the label as well as an elaboration. In addressing both camps, it does what every good box set should do: Making few distinctions between the legends and the obscurities, these four discs recontextualize what you already know via stuff you don't.","The Big Stiff Box Set anthologizes Stiff Records' legendary nine-year run, and includes more than its share of incredible tracks, both well-known and waiting to be discovered. Among the artists featured are  Elvis Costello, the Damned, the Pogues, Motörhead, Devo, the Go-Go's, and Nick Lowe.

Alone: The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo,Rivers Cuomo,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3cb9d034d5c69bf4d7b/1:1/w_160/9447e0d0.jpg,2007-12-13 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10981-alone-the-home-recordings-of-rivers-cuomo/,Geffen,"Somewhere along the way, someone told Rivers Cuomo that he needed to rein it in. To the world's dismay, he listened, and made three records of faceless, predictable approximations of what the public supposedly wanted his band Weezer to be. Demo collection Alone does the opposite, collecting all sorts of goofy and indulgent ideas-- robot voices, barbershop-quartet harmonies, over-emoting, an Ice Cube cover-- reminding us why we fell for dorks with horn-rimmed glasses and flying-V guitars in the first place. Casual fans and/or haters might wonder what, after three records that were stagnant at best, could be possibly left in the vaults; the superfans know exactly what he's holding back. The inside cover shows off a crammed collection of cassette tapes, their spines promising untold treasures-- Songs From the Black Hole is there, as well as previously unheard of titles and bandnames-waiting-to-happen like Psoriasis Babies and Angst Muffins. As far as basement tapes go, Alone ranges wildly in fidelity and style while still hanging together as a surprisingly cohesive whole. Its liner notes have detailed histories and inspirations for each song-- with lyrics, even-- and photos that exhibit a disconcerting lack of shame. (Bearded Basoon-playing Rivers, Despondent Glam Rivers, collect 'em all!) Best of all: More than two-thirds of the material here was recorded before 1996. As for the rest... we'll get to that. A lost Weezer record it isn't, even if fans have been waiting on one. Songs From the Black Hole was reportedly a full concept album meant to follow the ""Blue Album"" that was scrapped completely before recording what would become Pinkerton. Its story arc follows a five-person (plus one mechanoid) crew of a spaceship on an important mission, our noble protagonist Jonas (hmm...) is given a meaty role while crewmates Wuan and Dondo (seriously, it's in the liners) are one-dimensional avatars for womanizing and partying. That only sort of matters in ""Blast Off!"", the collection's crown jewel and such a fleeting rush of distortion-driven joy that the edges of the supposed dialogue are entirely blurred, and are hardly essential to enjoy it. Not so when it segues directly into ""Who You Callin' Bitch?"", the lament of the unfairly maligned female spaceship cook, whom Cuomo brings to life with some fairly operatic solo vocal moments. More narrative confusion and dick references follow in the cheery a cappella ""Dude, We're Finally Landing"" and the twee-cranked-to-11 of ""Superfriend"", which is at least on par with Pinkerton's stellar B-sides (many of which would have made up this ""lost"" album). If it sounds silly on paper, go over the lyrics to your favorite Weezer song in your mind for a moment, and then take into account that these were written with the help of painkillers as Cuomo healed from leg surgery. These hopelessly corny, irrepressibly infectious songs are the stuff that Weezer freaks are forged in. The rest of the songs come from more familiar territory. ""Lemonade"" borrows its paunchy low-end straight from the Blue Album, while more introspective tracks like the would-be teen-flick soundtrack cut ""Wanda (You're My Only Love)"" and piano ballad ""Longtime Sunshine"" will satisfy the Pinkerton lover on your Christmas list. There's only one previously released Weezer song in the bunch, however. While its plodding tempo nearly turns it into a dirge, ""Buddy Holly"" still sounds pretty great in any incarnation, but doesn't reveal much in demo form besides some silly keyboard presets; it's not as if a Weezer song has ever been ruined by over-production. It does show that Cuomo has his compositions nearly finalized before they get to the band, right down to the falsetto harmonies and lightning-quick licks tucked into the verses. There are more unexpected pleasures as well, like hearing Cuomo moonlighting as frontman for the band Sloan on a strutting cover of oldie ""Little Diane"". Even the compilation's rough spots reveal something: The choked angst of ""The World We Love So Much"" is intimate enough to cause embarrassment by proxy, but it's worth noting that it's a Gregg Alexander cover (yes, the guy from the New Radicals). It divulges an unexpectedly modern influence, and from a relative peer of Cuomo's at that; either could have switched career trajectories if the cards had fallen just a bit differently. And yet, the biggest surprise is that Weezer's latest material is not the bottom of the barrel, and that crossover smash ""Beverly Hills"" only hinted at the depths Cuomo has yet to plumb. Recorded in 2007, ""This Is the Way"" is a stab at MOR urban pop, with what are likely his least inspired lyrics yet. He rhymes ""love"" with ""heaven above"" over a track that, even for a demo, makes old Jon Secada look like old Timbaland, finally indulging in the supposed funk influence he once so studiously avoided. The chorus: ""This is the way a man loves his lady."" It's as if ""Beverly Hills"" was a black hole, and this was the extra-dimensional hell on the other end. But more than being adrift in an unfamiliar genre, ""This Is the Way"" is crippled by the same thing that drags down ""I Was Made for You"", a 2004 demo that closes the compilation. The mostly chronological track list of Alone exposes the same drawbacks of Weezer's later records by the end: By chasing down broad notions of universality in his lyrics and melodies, Cuomo's songs have become increasingly impersonal and vacuous, even when they're as pretty as ""I Was Made For You"". There's nothing about angst-ridden singer-songwriters, forgotten power-poppers, or rappers that we can't all relate to; nor do songs that draw inspirations from science fiction or Madame Butterfly necessarily appeal to a niche audience. It's frustrating that Cuomo has sidelined these weirder, often endearing influences. If nothing else, Alone reminds us that a lot of those over-ambitious, silly-on-paper ideas often blossomed in Cuomo's hands, and there was more to Weezer in their early days than just crisp power-pop and cute videos.","After three safe and predictable records, the Weezer leader goes the opposite route, collecting demos of all sorts of goofy and indulgent ideas, and reminding us why we fell for dorks with horn-rimmed glasses and flying-V guitars in the first place.

Corn Meal Dance / Alphaville Suite,William ParkerÕs Raining on the MoonWilliam Parker Double Quartet,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3a8ea9e61561daa6b1a/1:1/w_160/1df8ec41.jpg,2007-12-13 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11636-corn-meal-dance-alphaville-suite/,AUM Fidelity,"William Parker is one of the most important and creatively vital figures in jazz today, an era when the popular perception is that jazz was something that happened in the past. The New York-based bassist keeps finding new ways to move the form forward and re-arrange his sound-- about the only restriction he places on himself is that the music must be played by people together in a room on acoustic instruments (some of his work for others doesn't follow this rule). This was a productive year for Parker: he published his first book, Who Owns Music?, and these two excellent albums find him in an exploratory mood, both musically and philosophically. Corn Meal Dance reconvenes the Raining on the Moon band he first worked with in 2002, and it's one of Parker's most immediately accessible works-- the open-ended improvisation that characterizes so much of his work has a place here, but the free elements are significantly reined in. This makes sense, given that Raining on the Moon is one of his few projects to feature vocals, and band largely follows the dexterous lead of Leena Conquest, who sings Parker's politically charged poetry with stirring conviction and soulful phrasing. He doesn't let her off easy, feeding her lines like, ""Along came Dr. Yesterday, three heads on two shoulders/ Not looking any older/ Kills everything he can see/ Calls himself the father of humanity,"" but she handles it and then some. Parker's muse on both this and his prior Raining on the Moon LP is drawn to war, sorrow, and the legacy of Civil Rights-- on ""Land Song"", a long meditation on the true nature of property ownership, he creates the character of a slave owner who claims the powers of a god and pointedly tells the narrator, in the person of Conquest, that she is only 3/5 of a man. The material doesn't come off as cerebral as it sounds when the band gets its hands on it. Parker rarely includes chordal instruments in his bands, but Eri Yamamoto's piano sounds fantastic in these thoughtful and sometimes gentle compositions. The title track in particular features one of the most beautiful themes he's ever written, played by trumpeter Lewis Barnes and alto saxophonist Rob Brown with muted lyricism, the piano gives it an even heavier contemplative feel. Yamamoto lays out more on the freer passages, such as the one that fills the middle of ""Soledad"", leaving Parker and the horns to duke it out without relying on the changes. Barnes and Brown are Parker regulars, and they're both on Alphaville Suite, an album whose title and material are inspired by Jean-Luc Godard's dystopian 1965 science fiction film. The double quartet structure isn't a traditional jazz double quartet, with two matched bands going at it-- rather, the first quartet is a jazz band of Parker, Barnes, Brown and master drummer Hamid Drake, while the second quartet is a string quartet of violinist Mazz Swift, violist Jessica Pavone, and cellists Julia Kent and Shiau-Shu Yu. Conquest stops in to sing on the two ""Natasha's Theme"" tracks, but by and large this is a far more dissonant and texturally complex record than Corn Meal Dance. Parker has worked with strings in the past, and frequently plays his own bass with a bow, and here he imposes the same loose compositional structures on the strings as he does on the band. Apart from the thematic material, the strings roam freely, sparring with the trumpet and sax as Parker and Drake hold it down. Parker's compositional method is interesting-- rather than open with a distinct head and let the band members solo over choruses, he moves the band in and out of the themes, alternating them with widely varied passages of open group improvisation. There are moments of sharp dissonance and unconventional technique-- strings played on the frog or with the back of the bow, saxes overblown and honked, but these are balanced by passages of strong forward momentum and clarity. If you've been walking around thinking jazz is dead, these are the kinds of records that could change your mind in a hurry. Parker rarely fails to be interesting, but these albums have more potential than many of his other records to engage an audience that's not already hip-deep in modern improvisational music, while still appealing to his jazz base.",,7.4,
4th & Wall,West Indian Girl,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b390b1335d7bf169a5f5/1:1/w_160/cc658673.jpg,2007-12-12 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10927-4th-wall/,Milan,"To those thinking that West Indian Girl's song ""All My Friends"" might be another entry into the 2007 LCD covers canon: sorry. The L.A. sextet's song isn't a cover, nor does it touch the same emotional spheres of James Murphy's original, or the worthy covers from Franz Ferdinand or John Cale. That not West Indian Girl's point, either; their object with 4th & Wall is quite the opposite, actually. Where Murphy et al use those closest to them as springboards for nuanced expressions of longing, regret, and passion, West Indian Girl sticks firmly within the realm of sun-drenched escapism and celestial sonics: ""All my friends get high."" ""High"" isn't necessarily referring to a feeling created by ingested inebriants, either. No, this ""high"" is of the stripe that movie surfers talk about. West Indian Girl takes literally the ""City of Angels"" moniker of its hometown, and pack 4th & Wall with a glassy, new-age haze. Like the New Pornographers if Todd Fancey's gossamer soft-rock keyboard vibe replaced Carl Newman's driving power-pop, the album's sonic M.O. is spaced-out, burbling synthesizers, guitars that ring like digital travel alarm clocks, and tiffany vocals floating above, and looking down upon the sex and danger pocking L.A.'s streets. The street corner that gives the album its name also inspired 4th & Wall's prevailing dialectic: L.A.'s dueling vibes of heavenly cool and urban decay. The band describes its studio thusly: ""An old warehouse surrounded by a humble community of homeless people living in cardboard boxes and tents. They're our captive audience, listening to us every night...we conjure up spirits and manifest visions...of a better place."" 4th is shot through with this sort of naïve urban transcendence and PSA-level awareness. The sole lyric of ""Lost Children"", for example-- ""You're all alone, and you follow me""-- suggests equal parts sympathy and distance.  Album-opener ""To Die in L.A."" chronicles a moment when, within the confines of the city, you realize that ""you don't know how you got there,"" and first single ""Blue Wave"" and road-trip fable ""Up the Coast"" offer two solutions to the existential quandary: grab your board, or find your keys. Though most of its music is underformed and based on wide-eyed wish fulfillment, West Indian Girl hits their mark once, with ""Sophia"". It's their bombastic classic-rock moment-- a wafer-thin, vaporous ""Layla"", as it were, with the ridiculously overwrought poetry of the verses (""Love is a symphony and/ She and God are one"") leading to a surging chorus. That's only the beginning, though: during the song's three minute coda, Sophia is guided heavenward by a melismatic, glass-shattering soprano, followed a what sounds like a restrained take on Clare Torrey's passionate screaming at the end of Pink Floyd's ""The Great Gig in the Sky"". ""Sophia"" plays like an encapsulation of the 70s' most decadent rock moments heard through a smog of innocent sincerity and Valium, and it's actually pretty great. As depicted through 4th & Wall's liner note photo montage-- a series depicting wayward, streetlit youth trying to make an unforgiving urban landscape their own, somehow-- West Indian Girl's primary strength is its artless, unironic embrace of humanity's capacity to make itself better. The city that inspires them, then, should be the same place they cash the majority of their checks: 4th & Wall might not stand up to scrutiny on its own merit, but there are more than a few teen dramas and automotive ad-men seeking soundtrack fodder for the 18-24 demo. It's a noble endeavor, of course, and a perfect venue for music so charged relentlessly hopeful, all-inclusive sentiment.","L.A. hype band sticks firmly within the realm of sun-drenched escapism and celestial sonics-- a gossamer soft-rock keyboard vibe cataloging the sex and danger pocking L.A.'s streets.

Heaven,Mobius Band,by: Liz Colville,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a17dea9e61561daa47f6/1:1/w_160/419258be.jpg,2007-12-12 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10919-heaven/,Misra,"Well, this is weird. It was always a bit uncanny that Mobius Band were on Ghostly International, home of the glimmering D.C. maestro Outputmessage and a dozen or so other electronic mavens. But the group's second full-length album, Heaven, which Ghostly has co-released with Misra, affirms what an odd match-up this is. The title track of 2005's debut, The Loving Sounds of Static, was more up to speed with the current configuration of this trio; its chugging guitars, steady bass tap, and slightly airy, elongated vocals that suggested the French Kicks, poor victims of an artish rock scene hovering around New York City back in 2003-ish. But this second release is even bubblier and more straight-laced than its forebear, or anything the French Kicks have ever done. The only reason the opener ""Hallie"" sounds interesting is because its engaging little synth twinkles are predictable; this grates after a handful of listens. And then you have Ben Sterling and Noam Schatz tossing in some powerpuff drums and a plagiarized Modest Mouse lick, making for a song that meanders too much, yet not at all. A slice of a pleasant moment is spliced too quickly to be memorable; listen to the song a few times and it will get memorably boring. It's reasonable to call this album a sequel to Wincing the Night Away; it is as playful, as wintry, as powder-caked, and minutely epic as the Shins' third effort-- and would also fit right in with it rhythmically, melodically, and I suppose philosophically. ""A Hint of Blood"" has a rust-tinged, backlit guitar dancing stupidly around a major scale; when I say stupidly I mean to say it's trying to be inventive but isn't. Similarly, ""Leave the Keys in the Door"" does a thing that's typical on this album, halting and grinding forth the rhythm. The problem is that the tonal contrasts-- ragged and rough; sleek and dripping-- are cool in theory, but the melodies and ideas being fronted aren't strong enough to sustain them. Lyrically, there are too many similes, emaciated metaphors, and boring choruses like, ""I don't need no/ Friends like these, no"" (""Friends Like These). Elsewhere, they create a domestic scenario around a ""paint"" metaphor and decorate the Tom Petty-like chorus with whining, trumpet-like digital synth washes. On ""Under Sand"", slippery croons seesaw in fifths around the same exact drum rhythm as practically every other song on the album, and the only pretty moment is the brief, glorious vocal soar by Peter Sax in the final moments of the chorus. But it dies down far too quickly. Back to the boring fifth seesaw-- ooh, a key change!-- and déjà vu drums. Cool cover art, though.","Brooklyn electro-pop band's second full-length is even bubblier and more straight-laced than its predecessor.

EP of Bees EP,We Versus the Shark,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b36b5e6ef9596932245e/1:1/w_160/2c99fcb4.jpg,2007-12-12 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10893-ep-of-bees-ep/,Hello Sir,"We Versus the Shark, along with many of the bands on the Hello Sir label, have picked up the torch from the post-Fugazi guitar outfits of the late 1990s like Les Savy Fav and Faraquet, with records as exciting as those bands' humble, spastic beginnings, if not yet as innovative as those artists at their peak. The Athens, Ga., band's debut seemed poised on the edge of breakthrough, or at least something more than adding up their disparate influences, and they certainly sound more confident on this follow-up EP. But if this breakthrough was to involve slowing down or trimming the fat in some way, well, We Versus the Shark have other ideas. EP of Bees EP (circuitous and maximalist down to its silly title, even), is more, more, more: more vocals, more prodigiously fast and complex rhythms, and more moments that could cause arthritis in Guitar Hero XII: Athens Rises Again. It's not quite as dynamic as the group's debut, but there is never a dull moment-- just songs stuffed with jittery, unpredictable rhythms, jagged guitars, and tense vocals until you can hear the seams tearing. There's the kind of instrumental brawn here that you'd expect from labelmates like Cinemechanica rather than the band that made Ruin Everything! a couple years ago. A slippery, discordant guitar riff precedes a swinging, backwards-blues stomp in ""I Am a Fantastic Battle"", with the vocals going from exhaustingly rapid-fire lyrics to syncopated grunting on the chorus, and more spidery guitar work throughout. It's a weird, winding path of genre, like a Family Circus comic, that the band traverses to sound like math-rock biting at the back fins of prog: Through equal parts basement-show sweat and adroit ambition, that seems to be where they've landed. ""The Lament of Sue Richards"" spotlights guitarist/singer Samantha Paulsen's vocals and a follow-the-bouncing-ball keyboard line, with bass/keys/other singer Jeff Tobias barking over the diverging B-sections. It'd be the catchiest track with Paulsen on her own, but it's even more memorable for its juxtapositions, making other tracks sound a little haphazard in comparison. The song's final flashy breakdown comes out of nowhere, and it's a stunning, unabashed show-off moment for the band that might have you whooping and applauding in front of your stereo. (A quick skim of the live-performance DVD included reveals that while guitarist/singer Luke Fields has plenty of rock star moves, Paulsen is actually our nimble-fingered hero.) Both ""We Versus the Inevitability of Death"" and ""(After)life Things"" play it quiet during the verses while the rhythm section pays no heed, jamming just as quickly and nervously as anywhere else. ""Inevitability"" even flirts on the edge of danceability, with clattering, simmering percussion under the whispers and insinuations of Paulsen and Fields. ""(After)life Things"" has lovely, somber guitar work, and some quiet and oddly poignant calm-of-the-storm moments, though it also seems a bit jumbled. A few of the shrugging spoken lyrics hint at Travis Morrison's expressive intonation, though they're not quite as clever with the content. One male singer is a desperate screamer while the other is an over-enunciator, and there's not much of a range between them. But this is why the band's three-pronged attack, much more evident here than on their debut, works to their advantage. EP of Bees marks a transitional moment, sure, but that's one of the things EPs are good for. A transition this confident promises good things to come.","Spazzy math-rock outfit from Athens, Ga., follows up their debut album with a comparatively intense EP that includes a live show and documentary on a bonus DVD.

Bionik,Dominik Eulberg,by: Philip Sherburne,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributing Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3d3c0084474cd0c21b1/1:1/w_160/c2942c13.jpg,2007-12-12 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10987-bionik/,Cocoon,"Cocoon isn't really an albums label. The eponymous imprint of Sven Väth's extensive club and promotions empire-- which includes a massive Frankfurt super-club, high-profile Ibiza parties, and a booking agency-- normally focuses on clubland's low-hanging fruit: hit singles, either packaged on their own or used to drive sales of compilations or high-profile DJ mixes. Say what you will about Väth's madcap antics, he knows how to pick'em. Both Cocoon's Sound of the... Season mixes and its lettered compilations manage to set the tone for populist but quality dance music that straddles the line between underground and mainstream, always highlighting an intriguing balance of old guard and up-and-comers. But Cocoon seems increasingly to be focusing its efforts on artist albums; last year came Guy Gerber's Late Bloomers and Pig & Dan's Imagine; now Dominik Eulberg follows last spring's Heimische Gefilde with Bionik, an album that takes its title from a picture disc Eulberg released on Cocoon in 2006. Eulberg's never been much of an album artist himself, however, despite the fact that this is his third longplayer. A singles artist par excellence, he excels at the short sharp shock of a killer percussive riff, modulated and drawn out over the course of eight or 10 minutes. The best tunes on Bionik do just that. ""Lotuseffekt"", an edit of the ""Bionik"" single, explodes a synth-poppy arpeggio into something grand and unbridled; the lead keyboards are inflected with trance music's shivering detunings, and the bassy counterpoints are tailor made for spinning deliriously. ""Löwenzahn-Luftwaffe"", likewise, sinks its teeth into an anthemic melody while it busies its hands on batucada-like drum fills. The rhythms on both numbers are far more controlled than is usual in Eulberg's productions, eschewing chaos and clatter in favor of controlled grooves; ""Freche Früchte"" benefits from the same kind of concentration, highlighting ghostly tonalities hovering like halos over his electronic toms, and a snare sound so perfect it'll have bedroom producers buzzing the Ableton forums in search of the sample. Album centerpiece ""Autopfoten"" is one of the heaviest things Eulberg has done yet, letting a chugging, unfussy drum track serve as the foundation for gradually unfolding rhythmic variations. Oblique vocal samples suggest dark forces lurking in the background, as Eulberg plies his favorite trick, a clave-like cowbell pattern cutting crosswise through the headlong rhythm. But a handful of solid tracks does not an album make; that's why dance music invented the double 12"" single. ""Rückenschwimmzipper"", despite a promising (and punishing) intro, quickly descends into short-attention-span churn, marred by gratuitous bit-crush effects and an offputting, overly digitized breakdown. ""Haifischflügel"" spends six minutes clattering around in the dark, beating its virtual sticks against every surface it can find and tripping over weird potholes of silence and grinding, atonal dropouts. It might be a monster on the dancefloor, but at home its erratic behavior verges on the annoying. Then, after almost six minutes of its bull-headed onslaught, the clouds open up to reveal a golden beam of light-- a lovely, wordless vocal (or synthetic vocal) duet that recalls Medieval polyphony. There's something to be said, I suppose, for reserving such a bounty for the climax, but it seems a curiously counterintuitive approach to the album format. As though nodding to the needs of the home listener, Eulberg opens and closes Bionik with more contemplative pieces that reference Autechre's plangent tones, but they're not glue enough to bind the shrapnel-pocked pieces of the record together as one. Bionik is reportedly titled in reference to scientific inventions that ape natural technologies, such as aerodynamic materials that are modeled upon sharkskin's streamlined properties. It's a great concept; unfortunately, there's too much heavy lifting involved in sifting through the album's pieces to let the idea shine through on its own. For his next experiment in bionics, a little less Steve Austin and a little more streamlining would do Eulberg a world of good.","A deft mixer and singles artist par excellence, Dominik Eulberg tries his hand at crafting an album for a third time, releasing his latest on Sven Väth's Cocoon label.

Plum,Various Artists,by: Mark Richardson,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3cc9d034d5c69bf4d7f/1:1/w_160/19930944.jpg,2007-12-12 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10982-plum/,Thrill Jockey,"Fifteen years is a hell of a long time in the independent record business. Love of music, professional integrity, handshake deals, and 50/50 profit splits are all well and good, but you're still talking about something that makes fronting money to obscure government officials you just met through e-mail seem like a sound financial investment. This was true in the best of times, when people actually had to spend money to hear music-- forget about the era of file-sharing. So for a label like Chicago's Thrill Jockey, founded in 1992, such landmark calls for some reflection, maybe a couple of parties, and a well-earned pat on the back. The latter comes in the form of this lovingly packaged and limited-run box containing 10 7"" singles, each featuring associated artists covering songs from the label's catalogue. The ""label artists cover other label artists"" approach is a familiar one, but it makes sense for Thrill Jockey, whose artist roster seems tighter-knit than that of other labels. Part of that is a regional thing, given that a sizeable chunk of the roster has Midwestern roots; and part of it has to do with demand for John McEntire as a producer and his Soma studios as a great place to make a record. But it seems as though Thrill Jockey artists also enjoy collaboration just for the sake of it; perhaps drawing inspiration from the jazz world, they like sitting in. Thrill Jockey has long since moved on from its 1990s association with post-rock and IDM, and Plum, which mostly highlights more recent material, reflects that shift. Befitting the 7"" single format, the set favors proper songs-- even if many of them are bent into weird shapes. Fiery Furnaces, for example, can write catchy tunes and fat hooks when so inclined, but they prefer to deliver the goods with a twist. How appropriate, then, that David Byrne, who has released film score work on the label, tackles the Friedbergers' 2007 anthem ""Ex-Guru"". He reveals the off-kilter shape of the song's structure with his own quirky diction, and also shows just how zany lines like ""I burned all my clothes with eucalyptus juice"" can sound. It's a major highlight here. Archer Prewitt holds down the more traditional end of the spectrum with a faithful cover of the National Trust's ""Mrs. Turner"", a piano-led orchestral pop concoction with the melodic ease of a Harry Nilsson tune. His main band, the Sea and Cake, is represented on both sides of the tribute equation. Mouse on Mars take the original elements of the Everybody track ""Middlenight"" and subject them to some fairly conventional late-90s beats. It's just an OK remix, although the climax-- when Sam Prekop's voice peaks out as a choppy drone grinds away beneath-- has visceral appeal. The Sea and Cake offer a much more interesting version of Califone's ""Spider's House"", meeting the group halfway by featuring a ringing steel string acoustic, a rustic oddity in the former band's über-smooth world. Speaking of which, Thrill Jockey's longstanding interest in bluesy, gritty singer-songwriter material finds its best expression in Califone. Their weary and wasted version of Freakwater's honky-tonk lament ""Jewel""-- mostly just guitar, slide, banjo, and voice-- would have fit nicely on Roots & Crowns. Coming from the same direction but with a greater emphasis on Neil Young-informed classic rock, Baltimore's Arbouretum team with Beach House's Victoria Legrand for a hair-raising run through the urban jungle of Thalia Zedek's ""Bus Stop"". And Zedek also pays tribute to Freakwater, offering a loose, rootsy rendition of ""Flat Hand"". I was never a Come fan, and Zedek's voice never appealed to me, but she always brings focus and intensity to the table and this track is no different. Of course, for many, Thrill Jockey will always be ultimately about Tortoise. They contribute a strange cover of Nobukazu Takemura's ""Fallslake"" that inserts acoustic drums and plenty of studio air around the electronics while reproducing the vocodered lead voice; the appealing sonics almost, but not quite, make up for the fact that this just isn't a very interesting song. Still, that the Tortoise track and a few other selections don't quite catch fire doesn't detract from the appeal of the set as a whole. Thrill Jockey has always courted artists prone to experiment, and they average more than 10 releases a year, so perfection is rather beside the point. Sometimes inspiration can get a little messy.","Chicago's Thrill Jockey celebrates its 15th anniversary with a lovingly packaged and limited-run box containing 10 seven-inch singles, each featuring associated artists covering songs from the label's catalogue.

Say Something,Via Audio,by: Liz Colville,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b35cc0084474cd0c20f1/1:1/w_160/40a45d43.jpg,2007-12-11 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10882-say-something/,SideCho,"Finally, a catchy pop record that's serious: not gloomy, not mournful, and not pretentious. It's serious and earnest, it's occasionally sad, but there is such a beautiful gloss over everything that it sticks, hurts, and feels delicious. Not surprisingly, the album was produced by Spoon's drummer, Jim Eno, who I don't believe puts a stamp on anything; he just added some sort of sealant that keeps the sultry goo of ""Numb"" and sexy-sad lollipops like ""We Can Be Good"" and ""Harder on Me"" in our heads for weeks. Via Audio singer Jessica Martins has a strong, memorable, and pretty much flawless voice, unfettered in reach, with the ability to be an alarming caw (the ravenous climax of bipolar rock/blues number ""Enunciation"") or a silken liqueur (the blues part of ""Enunciation"".) Danny Molad, the mostly-full-time drummer, also sings on much of the album; following up ""Enunciation"" with the duets ""Collaboration"" and ""Hazmat"", we are drawn into a world of thoughts defended or answered by a counterpart of the opposite sex: ""It takes two to turn out/ The lights that shine around us/ Don't you want to try this?/ Darkness won't destroy us"" (""Presents""). Speculation as to the relationships will rivet the listener, but what will hold our attention is the climbs, struts, claps, stops, and restarts that classify one minute of a song as in a completely different mood, key, and rhythm to the next minute. ""Presents"" is rather steady, a smarter version of twee encased in dazzling guitar plucks-- but it's not exempt from a couple of rabid comedowns in between verses. The moody and organic composition of the songs is mimicked in the organization of the album, which, generally speaking, settles into serenades and creeping lullabies in the second half, but never abandons that urge to transform, evolve, and devolve as often as possible. The most immediately gripping tracks are earlier on, especially the opener ""Developing Active People"", which appeared on their self-titled EP in 2004. This may be the quintessential Via Audio track, swooning and rocking in equal measure and knitting Martins' voice neatly in with Molad's. Anyone who has ever heard the Beatles will not be surprised by how the other melodies develop themselves, with more ornate major-minor twists that can be dirty and balladic at once, but what doesn't surprise is pleasing, and what does surprise is addictive.","Brooklyn quartet's full-length debut is a catchy and ornate tapestry of pop produced by Spoon's Jim Eno.

Nightly Things,Begushkin,by: Andrew Gaerig,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3a3c0084474cd0c2169/1:1/w_160/0a04f36f.jpg,2007-12-11 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10944-nightly-things/,Locust,"When I first dipped into Jason Molina's Songs: Ohia catalog a few years back, it seemed to me unlikely I would ever truly parse the differences between Molina's work and that of Will Oldham. This was, admittedly, the product of comparable vocal timbres, but untraceable back catalogs and a shared churlishness compounded the problem. Since then, continually diverging musical paths and a keener ear eventually opened plenty of distance between the artists, though I suspect that separating the specter of Will from Begushkin will be a mite tougher. Dan Smith fronts the Brooklyn band, and he shares an affinity not just for Oldham's peculiar tone and twisted phrasing, but also Oldham's ""sex, violence...folk music!""-scheming. Begushkin's debut album, Nightly Things, survives these similarities on Smith's talent for physical, evocative imagery and through his band's tidy, thoughtful arrangements. Real accusations of plagiarism on Begushkin's part must fall flat, not least because the benefits of joining the death-folk fraternity (a meddlesome cult audience chief among them) are-- how to put this?-- not manifold. Still, Smith shares Oldham's odd quest to marry The Canterbury Tales to folk idioms. ""Nightly things"" are exactly what you'd guess: at one point during the title track Smith strings together ""shooting,"" ""booty,"" ""looting,"" and ""hooting"" with only the faintest whiff of camp. Elsewhere, during ""Bitter Night Choir"", he refers to his mug as ""black and beardy,"" his throat, ""furry."" Smith excels even as he turns his tragi-silly imagery to more emotional concerns, as on ""At Night With Me"", when he mutters, eyes downcast, ""This is like a zoo...you and your monkey paws and me/ In my oxblood shoes."" He will later call a woman-- quite possibly the same one-- a ""bitch wolf."" Smith occasionally falters, or at least becomes predictable, but when he does his band is crisp and alert. Cynthia Hopkins and Stephanie Rabbins, who between them work an accordion, a violin, a saw, and backing vocals, are Begushkin's engine, turning form-driven folk-rock into righteous, detuned versions of Dylan's ""One More Cup of Coffee"". ""Stroll With Mine""'s rhythmic pulls on the accordion and whining violin steer toward gypsy balladry, and Smith and fellow guitarist Stephen Ryskewitch follow suit with the patient, Eastern guitar licks of ""Hearth Light of Our Home"". Smith's whelp-vox struggles during these louder moments-- Oldham's did too-- but Hopkins and Rabbins judiciously back him on the choruses and the shaggy mess pulls through intact. Smith better navigates the calmer terrains of ""At Night With Me"" and ""Bitter Night Choir"", where his couplets puncture the modest gapes of the band. At just eight tracks clocking in under 24 minutes, Nightly Things hardly represents Begushkin stretching their wings, but it does help Smith construct his insular, bestial sphere. Begushkin seem to have discovered the wonders of band interplay eons earlier in their development than their forbears, and the benefits of this are likely to increase as Begushkin moves from the brief, corporeal world of Nightly Things to more realized, distinctive realms.","Begushkin singer Dan Smith shares some of Will Oldham's peculiar tone and twisted phrasing but his band manages to carve out a space of their own on their debut album.

Saw a Halo,Mouthus,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b39f5e6ef959693224a5/1:1/w_160/5495c76d.jpg,2007-12-11 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10940-saw-a-halo/,Load,"The stateside fringes The Wire's David Keenan collectively dubbed New Weird America only four years ago sounded a bit different this different year. More melody, more cohesion, and-- for better and worse-- less chaos: In 2007, several of the bands earmarked in Keenan's wide menagerie came closer to home to roost, at least temporarily. Magik Markers made a piano-heavy record of damaged torch songs, and Marker Elisa Ambrogio sang sweetly with beau Ben Chasny on his latest, Six Organs of Admittance's Shelter from the Ash. Sunburned Hand of the Man proved vivacious beneath the editing touch of British fan Kieran ""Four Tet"" Hebden, while Massachusetts brethren MV & EE washed Neil Young's Decade in lye soap. Devendra Banhart sounded like a 17-year-old with a Lyrichord crush, and Animal Collective continued to hem the noise inside the pop. And a year after releasing a 12-song, 51-minute rock album, Sonic Youth covered Bob Dylan, while Thurston Moore released a largely acoustic album under his forename and Kim Gordon portrayed an aging folksinger in I'm Not There. Oh, and there's Mouthus, the Brooklyn-based, guitar/drums/electronics noise duo of Brian Sullivan and Nate Nelson. For their Load Records debut, Saw a Halo, Sullivan and Nelson landed a mostly perfect album. Though known for electricity and abrasion, Mouthus added acoustic guitars for three of the record's seven tracks. Surprise, surprise. Acoustic guitar excepted, the success of Saw a Halo depends largely on the same elements as the rest of Mouthus' 10 LPs since 2002. The duo's sound still pivots on manipulation. Nelson's drums can sound like traditional traps one minute or dim, percussive clicks the next, and guitarist Sullivan can (but rarely does) twist through a bona fide solo or use his instrument just as an input for pedals and as an outlet for cacophonous textures. Fascinating but vaguely familiar sounds have always been paramount to Mouthus' appeal, as has gumption. Mouthus' most riveting moments have come when Sullivan and Nelson attacked a motif or incidental sound with gusto, pushing everything to be louder, bigger, more daring. On Saw a Halo, they do that seven times. But Mouthus is controlled and composed here, too, and that's the linchpin. Saw a Halo adds structural smarts to sonic iconoclasm as it moves through big arcs lined with micro-plots of clashing sounds. By the time Sullivan lets an eight-minute shrill solo collapse to a feedback-and-percussion din on closer ""The Gift of Sighs"", that arc is exhausting and cathartic. Something about it feels like high drama: The secret is order, with seven tracks split into two sides (you'll notice seven seconds of silence after track four if you're tuning in digitally). Those track markers may seem arbitrary, jokes of sorts amid a persistent, unflinching, even monotonous noise. But the meticulous Mouthus demands attention. Each track shift here represents a significant sonic event buried within the squall, and each new idea drains into the next. Opener ""Your Far Church"", for instance, is a broken, somber ballad of strummed acoustics and multi-tracked vocals, steadily battered from beneath by an undercurrent of clattering drums. They sweep up, digesting and reorganizing the surroundings like a vortex. Track two begins, and leftover vocals are pushed beneath a sharp static gale and stabbed by bursts of guitar feedback. The rhythm mutates constantly. When the shard falls into a deep fryer and its thin, penetrating tone suddenly becomes thick and bludgeoning, track three begins. The drums submit, biding the roar's orders and building into a militaristic, cymbal-and-tom regimen. When the beat finally disappears, the thick static tires of itself. Track four begins, and sheets of sound whittle away into beautiful undercurrents that float like a perfect post-rock comedown. Except then Mouthus come back up, smearing a tampered tribal rhythm with sharp feedback and spectral whispers. Side two does the same, and-- be forewarned-- the close is completely devastating. On Saw a Halo, Mouthus has done what is so difficult for so many bands: They've held firm to what made them innovative and interesting, but they've poured it into a shape that makes it new and forceful all over again. Mouthus were great as early as 2005's Slow Globes; now-- with mastery over some of the most daunting sounds coming out of experimental circles in 2007-- they're mostly peerless.","Here on their Load debut, the noisy Brooklyn guitar/drums/electronics duo hold firm to what made them innovative and interesting while managing to make their sound new and forceful all over again.

8 Diagrams,Wu-Tang Clan,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3c5b1335d7bf169a63c/1:1/w_160/87840af5.jpg,2007-12-11 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10975-8-diagrams/,SRCUniversal Motown,"The general consensus seems to be that RZA has lost his fucking mind. Rap critics, bloggers, and comment-box choirs haven't taken to his strange new mutation-- and that would be a problem even without fellow Clan members Raekwon and Ghostface lashing out at him. Rae complained in an interview with Miss Info that the production on 8 Diagrams ""is not the vibe I want,"" saying RZA was turning into some sort of ""hip-hop hippie."" Ghost has been down on RZA, too, quoted in The Village Voice as saying the producer's ""fumbling the ball...his music wasn't sounding like how it was when we first came in."" And then there's the small matter of Ghostface's decision to release his latest solo album, The Big Doe Rehab, on the same day as 8 Diagrams. The Wu agreed to push their album back a week, but that hasn't stopped fans and critics from pitting the two records against each other in a polarizing boom-bap vs. psychedelia showdown. It gives you a clearer idea of why Wu-Tang hasn't released a record in six years: When a couple of MCs have worked together under the same creative catalyst this long, it's hard to get them all to move in the same new direction at the same pace-- let alone nine of them. Or eight. The death of Ol' Dirty Bastard signified the end of the classic Wu-Tang Clan lineup, even without the internal strife that almost assuredly guarantees we won't be seeing a follow-up to 8 Diagrams anytime soon. Russell Jones' passing isn't the only reason so much of this record sounds the way it does, but it had to have started some kind of domino effect that compounded all of RZA's brooding, spaced-out, and detached tendencies. Nothing here will go down well in the clubs or on the radio. Even the bangers sound melancholy or apprehensive, evoking darting eyes more than bobbing heads. After waiting so long, it's understandable that fans wouldn't want a record like this, where the bleak moments outweigh the triumphant ones. Of course, in due time-- maybe it'll take years-- 8 Diagrams will sink in as a compelling, well-regarded album. And if this really is the end, it'll be the ideal last chapter and a smart bookend to Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers). The production moves that stick out like nails on a chalkboard to rap traditionalists-- the acid-funk guitars, the melodic r&b hooks, the live instrumentation-- aren't nearly as off the hinges as some of rap's weirder recent detours (this isn't the Wu's The Love Below). Instead, they push the boundaries of what RZA's traditionally done without breaking too far out of character. ""Take It Back"" finds RZA revisiting previous work, snatching the same hunk of Bob James' ""Nautilus"" he once turned into Ghostface's ""Daytona 500"", but reduces it to a measured, weaving series of sharp jabs. ""Rushing Elephants"" and ""Wolves"" refine his cleaned up soundtrack-influenced style (circa The W), drawing from Morricone-esque touches (heist-film suspense horns, eerie Western whistles, ghostly choirs) and putting some workmanlike but effective breaks beneath to keep the pulse heavy. And the way he assembles tracks still impresses, whether piling on thin sample layers (a guitar from Nancy Sinatra's ""Bang Bang""; the drum machine taps from There's a Riot Goin' On) in ""Windmill"" until they sound fully fleshed-out, or pulling out surprise changes mid-way through a track: ""Campfire"" cuts under the last couple of lines in Ghostface's verse for a brief dub-echo interlude, and the otherwise understated symphonic soul of ""Gun Will Go"" shifts during Masta Killa's verse to something that sounds like the horn riff to Baby Huey's ""Listen to Me"" played through an old-timey Victrola at 3/4 speed. The more experimental tracks show how comfortable RZA's become with bucking conventional wisdom. Prototypical message statement ""Unpredictable"" piles switchblade strings onto muffled wah-wahs and screaming guitars that sound like Maggot Brain-era Funkadelic scoring a blaxploitation Psycho. (The hook: ""Wu-Tang is unpredictable."" No shit!) ""Stick Me for My Riches"" has some crossover appeal-- skittering digital hi-hats, bombastic horns, r&b vocals-- but give RZA credit for the risky move of bypassing radio-friendly Akon/T-Pain/Ne-Yo-level candidates in favor of a 1970s vet, the Manhattans' Gerald Alston. Even 8 Diagrams' most contentious track, the Beatles-interpolating ""The Heart Gently Weeps"", has precedent, since the Jimmy Ponder soul-jazz cover that acts as its foundation was rhymed over by Ghostface on the circa-Pretty Toney white-label track ""My Guitar"". (Granted, it didn't have John Frusciante noodling over it or Erykah Badu sounding like a 12-year-old on the chorus.) The only time this mad-scientist auteurism comes close to backfiring is the RZA solo showcase ""Sunlight"": Even with the intrusive, beat-derailing martial arts fight scene coda and one of Bobby Digital's more impenetrable metaphors (""I've been highly misunderstood by those who've met us/ They had ears of corn and heads of lettuce""), it's a thoughtful meditation that aims to justify Islam as a source of theological insight at a time when America is least receptive to it. So how do the other MCs ride beats like this? Ghostface makes himself scarce in the record's first half, and disappears completely in the second. He pulls off a few good verses, though, spitting Supreme Clientele­-level rapidfire free-association (""This is real talk, shank lullabyes/ Ben Franks, we like Jet Blue, we stay hella high"") on ""Take It Back"", and narrating a chaotic grocery store ambush/gunfight/struggle scenario on ""The Heart Gently Weeps"". Meanwhile, his partner in disaffection Raekwon shows up on half the cuts, and despite his accusations, there aren't any moments where RZA's production undercuts his style; in fact, pretty much every line he's got-- from the uptempo swagger anthems like ""Rushing Elephants"" and ""Take It Back"" to the slowly-paced murder story in ""The Heart Gently Weeps""-- is hot to the point where fans could start hoping Cuban Linx II measures up. Method Man opens the album with a sorta-enh verse on ""Campfire"" (dude doesn't sound quite right making ""SexyBack"" references) and then spends the rest of 8 Diagrams recapturing the fire he had on Tical, reasserting himself as the Wu's top shit-talker and sounding cockier and more confident than he has in years. GZA doesn't really kick in much for the record's first half, aside from his sharp and briefly ironic verse (""We criticize producers 'til they joints are right"") on ""Rushing Elephants"", but he's all over the last five tracks, popping up briefly to spit at least four lines' worth of jewels and, more frequently, a full verse that's front-to-back intricate like his chess metaphors on ""Weak Spot"". Inspectah Deck returns to his usual role as the out-of-nowhere scene-stealer (yet another reason ""Take It Back"" will be a future classic: ""Son, I've seen Hell, fell into the palms of Satan arms/ Don that I am, made 'im bow in the face of God""). Even U-God and Masta Killa, frequently overlooked as lyricists, sound inspired (check ""Wolves"" as Exhibit A). Still, there's not much real unity on this album-- which makes the album-closing ODB tribute ""Life Changes"" that much more affecting. While Ghostface is inexplicably missing, the other seven surviving members each get the chance to give their own brief eulogy for Russell Jones: Meth pours out some vodka before finishing off the bottle himself, Raekwon waxes reflective, Deck blames himself for not stepping in to help Jones with his troubles, GZA, Masta Killa, and U-God describe their grief, and RZA refers back to his verse on ""Tearz"" (""it's always the good ones that have to die"") before reminiscing over ODB's Grammy-crashing and fights with the law. Given how many times this album was pushed back, it wouldn't be out of the question to suspect some quality control issues, but RZA himself said in The Wu-Tang Manual that he tended to gear the overall style of an album based on what time of year it dropped, and 8 Diagrams couldn't have debuted at any time other than winter-- perpetually overcast, dark before the afternoon ends, and freezing your eye water.","After a six-year absence and the death of Ol' Dirty Bastard, Wu-Tang return with a psych-tinged record that's divisive-- even within their own camp.

Brazil 70: After Tropicália – New Directions in Brazilian Music in the 1970s,Various Artists,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b399c0084474cd0c2156/1:1/w_160/a4f166de.jpg,2007-12-11 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10935-brazil-70-after-tropicalia-new-directions-in-brazilian-music-in-the-1970s/,Soul Jazz,"In the grand scheme of Brazilian music, Tropicália was a tiny movement, centered on less than a dozen artists in one city and lasting only a couple of years. It only takes one pebble to send ripples across an entire pond, though, and that is the effect that Tropicália's brief flash had in Brazil in 1968 and 1969. There were many other styles of music developing in the country during that period-- many of them far more popular than Tropicália-- but none of them was as bold about smashing the familiar and the new together head-on, throwing electric guitars, wah-wah pedals, organs, fuzz boxes, and rock drumming in with avant-garde orchestration, samples, electronics, traditional Brazilian percussion, bossa nova rhythms, and a distinctly Brazilian sense of melody. Once the combination had been made, there was no going back, even though such innovations were initially resisted by many, including many musicians in the Brazilian Left, who theoretically were in the same general ideological corner, arrayed against the military government that took power in 1964 and held it until 1985 (the Socialists were generally nationalists as well, and saw the intrusion of non-Brazilian elements into the music as culturally suspect). Soul Jazz's Brazil 70 compilation is the sequel to 2005's Tropicália compilation, and it uses 19 tracks to give a general picture of the way Tropicália's influence permeated Brazilian popular music as the 1970s progressed. For all the junta's repression of the Left and overbearing censorship, it's remarkable how much fantastic, innovative, and subversive music was made in Brazil under its rule. There was no style we had in the U.S. that they didn't have in Brazil, and this disc necessarily ranges much more widely across artists and regions of the country for its tracks than the Tropicália volume did. By and large, the tracks chosen echo the musical melding of their influences, bringing distinctly Brazilian sounds together with American and British rock and soul to create interesting fusions. Most of it fits into a couple of broad categories: MPB and Jovem Guarda. MPB (Musica Popular Brasileira) was the name given to much Brazilian popular music that didn't easily fit some pre-established label, while the Jovem Guarda (""Young Wave"") was a type of pop music, also called ié-ié after the French yé-yé, that first developed in 1965 and continued into the 70s. Jovem Guarda artists were frequently not accorded the same critical respect as their MPB, bossa nova, samba, samba-rock, and other counterparts, but what they were doing was actually on the cutting edge of Brazilian pop, even if the easy accessibility of the music doesn't sound very forward-thinking today-- in its day, it was just intended to appeal to young people. Several of the original Tropicálistas are in the mix here. Caetano Veloso, who returned to Brazil from self-imposed exile in 1972, gives us ""Joia"", a brief, minimalistic song that features little more than Veloso's layered vocals and Afro-Brazilian percussion from Brazil's Northeast (the original Joia album cover, featuring Veloso, his wife and son nude on a beach was, of course, censored). While Veloso was heading back to the roots, his fellow Tropicália traveler Rita Lee, who had been a member of Os Mutantes, was going in the opposite direction-- her ""Corista De Rock"" is pretty straight early-70s rock, complete with harmonized guitar solos. A few other familiar names: Gilberto Gil's two songs veer from quick-tempoed Carnaval pop to prog-funk complete with odd-metered interjections; Gal Costa is in full funk mode on 1973's ""Pontos de Luz""; and Tom Zé's ""Correio De Estacao Do Brás"", from 1978, is essentially post-punk with its odd, simple funk arrangement. The rest are names far less known to American audiences, but the music is just as fantastic. Brazilian rock pioneer Raul Seixas, whose band Os Panteras was one of Bahia state's first rock groups in the early 60s, and to whom Veloso paid tribute in song on his 2001 album Noites do Norte, is here twice. His ""Mosca No Sopa"" is a perfect illustration of the principle underlying the compilation, placing passages of Brazilian choral vocals and percussion between sudden shifts into boogie rock and buzzing Moog hell. Seixas would later become a follower of English occultist's Aleister Crowley's teachings, and his attempts to create a Crowley-inspired alternative society in Minas Gerais ultimately lead to his expulsion from Brazil. Erasmo Carlos was a key artist of the Jovem Guarda movement, which began on a TV show he co-hosted. Here he balances a gentle acoustic guitar and vocal with loud barrelhouse piano and thumping percussion, not to mention lyrical references to Capoeira, a Brazilian martial art sometimes referred to as the dance of war. Carlos' albums from the late 60s and early 70s are definitely worth tracking down (the only Jovem Guarda musician who I think made better albums, Ronnie Von, isn't featured here). Jards Macale operated in a similar vein, but their contrast of hard kit drumming and electric bass with soft Brazilian tenor vocals and virtuoso acoustic guitar was even more pronounced. The compilation opens with my favorite song by Brazil's greatest glam-rock band, Secos e Molhados (the name means ""wet & dry goods""), ""Amor"", which doesn't quite match up to what American and British glam rock fans might expect with its acoustic guitars, harmonica, jazzy chord progressions, and vocal harmonies. To get a sense of just how they fit into the glam rock picture, you have to see a photo of them in their make-up and wild costumes-- singer Ney Matogrosso, whose rich voice was so high he practically qualified as a countertenor, was one of Brazil's most flamboyant stars, a Bowie for the Southern Hemisphere. It's wonderful to hear a disc that exposes so much of Brazilian music's variety in such a short span of time-- the blistering guitars and funky rhythms of the female-fronted Novos Baianos are miles removed from Ednardo e o Pessoal de Ceara's ""Ingazeiras"", an entirely acoustic song steeped in the legacy of bossa nova that features a thrilling orchestral arrangement. And yet, in spite of its range, the music is all wholly identifiable as Brazilian. There is a deep and mysterious element that rather deftly defies musicological description that makes music Brazilian, far more than geography itself defines the music. No matter how much avant-garde orchestration and distortion you cram into Alceu Valenca's ""Punhal De Prata"", it still exudes this quality. And that's perhaps what this compilation illustrates better than anything else. To say that Brazil 70 isn't comprehensive is to miss the point-- you couldn't sum up the impact of Tropicália on Brazilian music with one disc any better than you could sum up the impact of ""Louie Louie"" on American music in one disc. This is a lot of very good Brazilian music that has always been exceedingly difficult to find in the U.S., and it lets people who'd like to know more dip their toes in, while providing a solid listen for anyone who just wants to visit for an hour. Either way, this is excellent music.","Soul Jazz's Brazil 70 compilation is the sequel to its outstanding 2005 Tropicália compilation, and it uses 19 tracks to give a general picture of the way Tropicália's influence permeated Brazilian popular music as the 1970s progressed.

Whether you're a stock indie geek or the average Starbucks customer waiting in line, his no-frills, North Dakota born 'n' bred folk tunes will likely leave you wondering what's the twist here. Unlike his guest star-studded What I Mean to Say Is Goodbye and the almost fully band-backed Grand Forks, Cavalier recoils at the notion of the meek, solitary Brosseau growing too big for his britches, opting to instead strip the singer-songwriter down to the undergarments of his earlier, humbler material. Maybe Brosseau's an unfortunate folk relic, trapped in a time where the genre's most often appreciated when grafted to more chic styles. Brosseau's tenuous saving grace is his likeness to Woody Guthrie or even Bob Dylan, though while he shares their sparse arrangements, he lacks their acerbic tongue and gravitas. Sure, themes of star-crossed love and suicide crop up, most notably on the forlorn chorus of ""Brass Ring Blues"" (""I've only known an empty gun underneath my bed""), but the stakes always remain small, the politics never extending beyond the path your surrey takes you. The music reflects this, with most songs featuring only Brosseau's voice and guitar, which frequently arppegiates the same predictable chord progressions. A few tracks break up this monotony, such as the loose guitar slides on ""Committed to Memory"" or the mystical Spanish vibe of ""My Heart Belongs to the Sea"", a number that dares to pepper in some piano lines alongside Brosseau's trusty acoustic. The remainder of Cavalier passes by like a warm breeze, the start and finish of each track difficult to determine. Brosseau offers no new perspective on folk mythology. Unlike his concept album Grand Forks, a chronicle of the devastating flood that ravaged Brosseau's hometown in 1997, Cavalier relies on tried-and-true folk subjects like crossing paths with Satan and journeying downstream on a riverboat. Right down to his wholesomely parted blonde hair and enamel-filled smile (think Jack McBrayer's character on 30 Rock), Brosseau's a nifty last bastion of old-timey Americana, but his music sounds sadly obsolete in a country that's grown too world-weary and voracious for simple grassroots ditties.","Prolific North Dakota-raised singer/songwriter returns here to a markedly spare sound, working through well-worn folk themes like star-crossed love and suicide with just his voice and guitar.

Sure, the Brooklyn foursome's records boast that signature crinkly Albini live sound and an array of post-hardcore guitar effects, but they're also devoid of the vitriol their engineer typically instills in his work. Instead, these sheepish indie rockers ruminate over cerebral motifs and intricate time signatures, and their self-titled sophomore album continues to work within the please-and-thank-you rock confines established by their politely catchy debut Icarus. Although they ostensibly draw inspiration from the D.C. underground, the Forms reign in the more envelope-pushing elements of bands like Shudder to Think or Dismemberment Plan, salvaging a sort of introspective bedroom math-rock from the otherwise rowdy post-punk. This diffidence extends to the band's live shows and their relative anonymity amidst the deluge of band pics currently online. Even their album art shuns any possible showboating, composed of little else than extremely blurred photograph collages and the band's name in an austere geometric-themed font. Despite their warm harmonies and almost exclusive use of major scales, these songs reflect the stoic workmanship of their packaging. Imagine your typical Doug Martsch ditty, rife with catchy octave riffs and ringing chords, then compress it under a stiff repetitive beat in an unusual meter and you'll hear something like opener ""The Knowledge in Hand"". While frontman Alex Tween's melody has a sing-song quality to it, the song never cracks a smile, maintaining perfect posture right down to the non-confrontational, conflict-less lyrics: ""With the knowledge in hand/ I have no plans."" ""Red Gun"" and ""Focus"" adhere to an almost identical formula of faux-looped riffs, with Tween obsessively repeating phrases like ""Red gun fire to the ground"" and ""Focus on the target"" until the hook feels as mechanical as the sturdy drums dictating it. Theatrics may be a tall order for these guys, but the album's highlights tend to occur on tracks with more fully realized choruses and outros rather than repeated verses hiked up an octave. ""Bones"" and ""Blue Whale"" each dice up their rote verses with unruly refrains and unexpected breakdowns, and ""White Dot"", with its spectral keyboards and hazy reverb, even dares to wander off into shoegaze territory. Although the Forms may feel most comfortable sticking to the default setting of songs like ""Knowledge in Hand"" and ""Red Gun"", their follow-up, without the aforementioned changeups, would feel like a homogeneous reiteration of their debut. Hopefully another solid album in the bank will steel the group to push their abilities further on subsequent releases. Hey, if some of that Albini abrasion rubs off on the next album, I'll welcome the change of pace.","Although they ostensibly draw inspiration from the D.C. underground, Brooklyn's the Forms reign in the more envelope-pushing elements of bands like Shudder to Think or Dismemberment Plan, salvaging a sort of introspective bedroom math-rock from their otherwise rowdy post-punk.

Spring a Leak,The Lucksmiths,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b39eb1335d7bf169a60d/1:1/w_160/5e65b15f.jpg,2007-12-10 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10939-spring-a-leak/,MatineeLost and Lonesome,"Eight years ago, a little-known Australian indie-pop group called the Lucksmiths released their first compilation of non-album material, Happy Secret. Since then, more multi-dimensional Scottish peers Belle & Sebastian have gone on to hit #8 on the UK albums chart and perform before a sell-out crowd at the 18,000-capacity Hollywood Bowl. American songwriters arguably more precious than this Melbourne four-piece, albeit with inarguably better shticks (albums for all 50 states, lyrics with Victorian and nautical themes, Natalie Portman), have become, if not household, then at least dorm-hold names. Most recently, the younger artist who perhaps best embodies the Lucksmiths' cleverness, vulnerability, and sun-worshiping melodic sensibilities, aka Swedish crooner Jens Lekman, has been crowned ""a fully realized pop genius"" by Slate. As the Lucksmiths unveil their third non-album compilation, ""happy secret"" remains as apt a phrase as ever to describe both the band's music and what it feels like to follow them obsessively. Along with a peppy, punning batch of covers, remixes, live recordings, demos, and other rarities dating as far back as 1995, Spring a Leak includes the restrained, elegant B-sides from the two EPs released around the time of the Lucksmiths' eighth-- and most recent-- proper full-length, 2005's Warmer Corners. The ringing chords of jangle-pop predecessors like the Wedding Present and the Pastels resound through phrase-turning tunes about everyday topics: lazy days, drunken afternoons, Scrabble, jokes that have the narrator's sides ""splitting"" (and his girlfriend, too) and, of course, the weather. Spring a Leak is another treat for longtime fans, and even though, as with 2002 rarities comp Where Were We, it's not the best place for neophytes to start, it's an excellent warts-and-all overview. Among Spring a Leak's vault-clearing 45 tracks, many of the best should give those just discovering the Lucksmiths an idea what to expect from the band's previous outings. A spirited cover of the Modern Lovers' ""Dignified and Old"", a version of the Magnetic Fields' ""Deep Sea Diving Suit"" with guitarist and primary songwriter Marty Donald making a rare appearance on lead vocal, and a disappointingly tame male-female duet rendition of the Smiths' ""There Is a Light That Never Goes Out"" point to three of the most readily apparent influences on the Lucksmiths' songs. Scrappy-sounding recordings from TV and radio appearances here tend to make up with singing drummer Tali White's infectious energy what they occasionally lack in audio fidelity or performance perfection. Either way, it's a cold bastard who can't break a smile at upbeat older songs like balloon-flying ""Up"" (""I'm an idiotic Icarus""), nicotine-nicking ""Smokers in Love"" (""You spend Thursday on your backside whistling 'Friday on My Mind'/ Super-supine""), and character study ""Danielle Steel"" (""A kingdom for a horse/ A condom for a lover""). ""Synchronised Sinking"" sees White pounding away on his stripped-down, stand-up drum set, his tenor lacking its usual Mozzy polish but no less dapper as he dispenses advice ""on a barstool basis""-- ""explain, or you'll explode."" On Pacific-gleaming triumph ""Camera-Shy"", Donald's lyrics make old Polaroids and his own wistful self-loathing come alive. Between time-signature changes, the housebound ""Broken Bones"" finally finds a downside to inactivity. Hell, the Lucksmiths could've easily stopped there and played defense against the critics, but this is a generous compilation, rewarding equally generous listens. An alternate version of the leisurely paced ""Caravanna"" doesn't change much from 1997's A Good Kind of Nervous original, but it should introduce a new audience to its vivid depiction of wanderlust unfulfilled: ""If either one of us could drive/ We could drive away,"" White sings, ultimately conceding, ""I wish there was some furniture that I could rearrange."" Newer songs from 2006's A Hiccup in Your Happiness and 2005's The Chapter in Your Life Entitled San Francisco EPs, such as ""To Absent Votes"" and ""The Winter Proper"", may slow down the tempos too much for those who listen to the Lucksmiths solely for giddy bursts like bassist Mark Monnone-penned ""T-Shirt Weather"" (not on this double-disc set), but their nuanced, subtly unfolding narratives of the extraordinary amid the ordinary mark some of the group's finest songcraft to date. On Spring a Leak, the Lucksmiths give more of themselves than we've come to expect in an age when technology and ubiquitous, freely available reviews seem to have led bands to iron out their idiosyncrasies. If this means skippable joke tracks like mildly amusing (one time) classic-rock diss ""Are You Having a Good Time?!?!"" and the concise, at least, ""$30"", or a few mediocre remixes, then it also means cover songs-- of tracks by Simpletons, the Ladybug Transistor, and the Bedridden, among others-- that introduce new audiences to the broader, still mostly below-the-radar world of twee-as-fuck indie-pop groups. The Lucksmiths, like the Smiths or the Modern Lovers' Jonathan Richman, are an act whose best moments are scattered throughout way too many releases to purchase feasibly all at once, with even extant singles collections leaving out some career highlights. Still, Spring a Leak is, if not Louder than Bombs mind-blowing, still far more comprehensive than Richman comp Home of the Hits. Yeah, the handful of subpar tracks drag down the rating a bit, but whether we're talking Aussie indie pop or Southern rap (UGK, dudes), it's tough to punish a group for refusing to rip off their fans. With even users of the MySpace-band-besieged Wikipedia questioning the ""notability"" of Spring a Leak, the Lucksmiths must still be a relative secret; happily, there's no reason to keep them that way.","Australian indie-pop band's generous vault-clearing is an excellent warts-and-all overview and a treat for longtime fans, even though it's not the best place for neophytes to start.

"The Art of Field Recording, Vol. 1",Various Artists,by: Amanda Petrusich,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3b813d197565213a9b7/1:1/w_160/f1a51b3a.jpg,2007-12-10 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10964-the-art-of-field-recording-vol-1/,Dust-to-Digital,"In the liner notes to Dust-to-Digital's new boxset, The Art of Field Recording, folklorist Art Rosenbaum talks up some of the perks inherent to field recording: In addition to allowing archivists to preserve songs and performances that bled over the (one-time) three-minute maximum for commercial sides (and to explore genres-- prison work songs, sea chantys, unaccompanied ballads-- that were once deemed too non-commercial to release for sale), field recording also allows folklorists to harness ""spoken narrative and social context that seldom found their way onto even the greatest commercial releases."" In this sense, The Art of Field Recording works as an indispensable counterpoint to Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music or Dust to Digital's flagship release, Goodbye, Babylon: Even if you've got a pretty good grip on how these songs worked in a recording studio, hearing them performed in the field-- in churches and homes, by non-professional musicians, complete with spoken asides, slips, yelps, groans-- is revelatory. All of the material included here was culled from field recording sessions conducted by Art Rosenbaum, an Athens, Geo.-based artist and folklorist, who-- unlike some of his peers-- cultivated substantial relationships with his subjects, establishing a camaraderie that endured long after the tape recorder clicked off (Rosenbaum and his wife, Margo, also photographed and painted many of the musicians they recorded, and their artwork is included in the set's liner notes). The material spans a half-century plus one year-- 1956 through 2007-- and is divided into four loose categories (an organizational tactic snatched, admittedly, from Harry Smith): Survey, Religious, Blues, and Instrumental/Dance. Most of these cuts were previously unavailable on CD, although the bulk of the material remains archived either in the Library of Congress, Indiana University's Archive of Traditional Music, or the University of Georgia's Media Archive. The Art of Field Recording is not only an essential resource for exploring early American forms and traditions, it also satisfies voyeuristic impulses. Spinning these discs feels like eavesdropping, or being granted exclusive access to 110 secret songs and performances. And, like any good secret, you'll have a hard time keeping it all to yourself: Sister Fleeta Mitchell (94 years old this year!) and Rev. Willie Mae Eberhard's whoops and twitters are so playful, so intoxicating and free that it's hard not to stop folks on the street-- the mailman, the UPS guy, a neighbor-- and slap headphones over their ears, grinning stupidly and expectantly. The duo's three tracks, taken from the songbooks of the Holiness and Pentecostal churches (""Satan, Your Kingdom Must Come Down"", which opens Disc 1, plus ""Let Me Fly"" and ""I Am on the Battlefield for My Lord"" from Disc 2) are all highlights, offering up a spirited, beguiling mix of piano, vocals, and tambourine. ""Satan"" also serves as a delightfully apt opener for the entire box: Mitchell nods to Rosenbaum to start recording, and when he pauses, you can feel the tension crackle-- ""Start!"" Mitchell spits, aggravated, like a woman deep in labor being told not to push. Her whole body is ready to sing. Nathan Palmer's ""Blow, Gabriel"" (recorded at the Mt. Calvary Baptist Church in Eulonia, Geo., on January 1, 1982) is a stellar example of one of the most haunting American ring-shouts (as Rosenbaum explains, ring-shouts are ""the oldest extant African-American performance form on the North American continent."") Ring-shouters shuffle their feet, moving counter-clockwise to the rhythm of the leader, clapping their hands or pummeling the floor with a broomstick; here, Palmer's deep, easy hollers are offset by the basers' muddy responses, and the entire performance feels personal and guarded (ring-shouts are very rarely performed outside of the Briar Patch community-- meaning even getting this close is a rare privilege). Although the folklorists lugging around tape recorders (and the performers carrying on ancient traditions) are worthy of much heralding, it's equally astounding how essential Lance Ledbetter's work at Dust-to-Digital has been to the preservation of traditional American folksong. It's easy to buy and appreciate these sets without realizing that the bulk of the material might have been lost-- or, at the very least, tethered to archives, readily accessible only to curious faculty, paper-writing students, and bespectacled researchers-- without Ledbetter's interference. The Art of Field Recording is gorgeously packaged, featuring one of Rosenbaum's paintings on the cover, and includes a thick, book-bound insert that annotates each of the songs, offering up context and precious information. Even when Art and Margo are, ostensibly, acting as silent observers, it is still possible to sense the Rosenbaums' presence, and some of the interview-heavy cuts (see Mary Heekin's rendition of ""Lord Randolph,"" from Disc 1) expose Art and Margo's investment in their work. The narrations included here can be as telling as the songs themselves. Accordingly, The Art of Field Recording is the kind of thing you will feel lucky to be allowed to own. Volume 2 can't land fast enough.","Dust-to-Digital's latest box is an indispensable counterpoint to Harry Smith's Anthology of American Folk Music or its own flagship release, Goodbye, Babylon: Even if you've got a pretty good grip on how these songs worked in a recording studio, hearing them performed in the field-- in churches and homes, by non-professional musicians, complete with spoken asides, slips, yelps, groans-- is revelatory.

"Oh, By the Way",Pink Floyd,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3bd5e6ef959693224d4/1:1/w_160/69e12dab.jpg,2007-12-10 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10968-oh-by-the-way/,EMI,"Let's start with the basic facts: Oh, By the Way is a limited-edition 14-album, 16xCD box set containing the entirety of Pink Floyd's studio album discography, immaculately repackaged as miniature LPs with gatefold covers and the original inner sleeves, stickers and posters where applicable. Also included are a special new poster designed by longtime Floyd-affiliated cover art designer Storm Thorgerson commemorating the 40th anniversary of Pink Floyd's first LP The Piper at the Gates of Dawn, and a couple of ""Pink Floyd coasters"" which are included as collectors' items and therefore will never see the underside of a drinking glass, ever.  Depending on where you buy it, the whole thing retails for something in the neighborhood of $250-$260-- just over $15 a disc, which is a pretty fair price if you've ever wanted to own every Pink Floyd album ever in novelty faux-vinyl form. It's also one of the most superfluous pieces of collectors'-market eBay-bait I've ever heard of. There is no rarities disc, no concert material (aside from the live half of Ummagumma), no previously unreleased work, no interviews, no DVDs, no 5.1 audio, no historical liner notes and-- most significantly-- no remasters save the one you can already get on the recently-released standalone 40th Anniversary Edition of Piper. Assuming you're like a lot of people and already own the latest, cleanest retail-release pressings of every Pink Floyd record you'd ever want, Oh, By the Way will serve no purpose outside of a fan-pleasing visual novelty; it practically exists to be looked at instead of listened to.  To be fair, at least two-thirds of this box set is worth listening to-- for the umpteenth time, as the case probably is. That 4.0 is a mark against Oh, By the Way's pointless surface-gloss curio status and its unadventurous by-the-books version of canonization rather than an actual judgment of the music tucked inside. If you really need one of those, pretend that 4's an 8; Pink Floyd's first few phases-- the intial decade or so of their career-- still sound rewarding even as the band itself gets further entrenched in the cultural stasis of classic rock's hermetically-sealed nostalgia. As the sole full-length snapshot of the band's Syd Barrett era, The Piper at the Gates of Dawn neatly sums up what made their first incarnation great-- the balance of whimsy and discomfort, displayed in the band's ability to feel at home inhabiting both chart-friendly psych-pop (""Arnold Layne""; ""See Emily Play"") and experimental space-rock sprawl (""Astronomy Domine""; ""Interstellar Overdrive""). The remainder of the records from the 1960s and their first album of the 70s-- A Saucerful of Secrets, Music from the Film 'More', Ummagumma, and Atom Heart Mother-- reveal a band in continuous and restless transition, looking for their footing and a new identity after Barrett's departure. These records are Pink Floyd at their most aimless-- for every indelible moment like the slow creep towards screaming violence in Ummagumma's live version of ""Careful With That Axe, Eugene"" or their bid for Beach Boys teenage-symphony pop in Atom Heart Mother's ""Summer '68"", there's the tedious multi-part suites that toy with experimentalism for its own sake, some good-start-no-finish soundtrack tidbits and that one Ummagumma track where Roger Waters made a bunch of silly animal and/or ranting Scotsman noises and slapped a big unwieldy 16-word title on it. And then there's the blockbuster stuff. With the exception of 1972's soundtrack-fodder footnote Obscured By Clouds, everything here from 1971's Meddle through 1979's The Wall has become so ingrained in the rock consciousness, so frequently dissected and joked about and lumped in with the Eagles and Yes in the textbook entry for Reasons Punk Had to Happen, that it's easy to forget why Pink Floyd got so huge in the 70s. (I'll pause to let you construct your own pot joke.) That they released some of the most slickly-produced and stylistically versatile music of its time-- simultaneously playing to the strengths of psychedelia, prog, and even r&b (ever play ""Echoes"" and Isaac Hayes' ""Walk on By"" back-to-back?)-- probably didn't hurt their commercial prospects, but a significant portion of their work, The Dark Side of the Moon in particular, was wrapped up in Waters' obsessive search for some kind of human empathy, and in the midst of a culture filled with rampant post-hippie ego-tripping and waning optimism that search rang true with a number of adolescents and college students-- and not just the ones of the 70s. Things do get shakier the further we get into the 80s and 90s: The Final Cut is draining if occasionally patience-rewarding, but the David Gilmour-fronted records A Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Division Bell are cruise-control adult-contempo dross that sand off every edge the band had. Oh, By the Way doesn't do much to make a specific case for Pink Floyd as an artistic entity-- it just drops everything in your lap and asks you to sort through it. But the odds of anybody not having any of this and wanting it all seem kind of slim, something the 10,000-copy run of this set probably anticipated. And with its sights aimed squarely on the diehard fans, putting the semi-complete works of Pink Floyd on the market without any real attempts to add the additional historical context or sonic refining that these fans would likely enjoy is as shameless as the insincere schmoozing of the ""Have a Cigar"" record-biz schmucks the box's title quotes.","This limited-edition 14-album, 16xCD box set immaculately repackages Pink Floyd's studio album discography but offers little to entice buyers other than its design and packaging.

Catch the Brass Ring,Ferraby Lionheart,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b36e13d197565213a937/1:1/w_160/3713deaa.jpg,2007-12-07 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10897-catch-the-brass-ring/,Nettwerk,"If you're playing into the grain of the new Americana, then a big component of your shtick is that you are who you are, and there's a lot riding on your name. In this, the creator of Catch the Brass Ring seems to have an unfair advantage. ""Ryan Adams"" sounds like the neighborhood kid who mows your lawn, but ""Ferraby Lionheart"" could be an X-Man or space pirate. Hearing Lionheart's album, however, paints a different mental picture: A demurely disheveled young man slouched in an overstuffed leather chair; a book shelf to one side discreetly displaying titles by John Steinbeck, Robert Frost, and Walt Whitman; a battered acoustic guitar propped against a synthetic fireplace on the other. The poster-size gloss of Catch the Brass Ring lends itself to this type of visual approximation; listening to the intimately arranged walking bass and sprightly piano of ""Small Planet"", you can practically see the copyright boilerplate in your mind's eye. But while his music bleeds familiarity from every pore, Lionheart remains hard to fathom, as the video for ""Small Planet"" gives us yet another representation of him. Not hirsute and vaguely self-serious, but elfin and vaguely self-mocking: Playing a tiny piano on a cardboard moon, wearing what appears to be a white satin scarf, Lionheart's self-portrayal in the video is too absurd to be anything but parody. Pantomiming the song's lyrics, he actually chases a woman in a fox mask through the forest like some reaver in a Conan the Barbarian novel, albeit one mapped onto a Victorian idyll. But if you can get over the fact that he sounds like Rufus Wainwright with a bad head cold, the sweeping melody has a pleasantly overstated allure. Concise intro ""Un Ballo Della Luna"" is more discerning, a casually doleful acoustic blur that takes the syrupy tang out of Lionheart's voice, which seeps like an ooze over roomier piano ballads like ""Call Me the Sea"". The more agile ivory-tickling of ""The Car Maker"" seems to nudge Lionheart out of his stupor, less stuffy Rufus and more drowsy Sondre Lerche. This liveliness is sustained through the down-stroked bounce of ""A Bell and Tumble"" and picks back up with the hotted-up big-band jazz of ""Before We're Dead"", but on ""Under the Texas Sky"", everything melts back into a puddle of back-porch strummery and soppy harmonies. ""Youngest Frankenstein"" lets us know what Devendra Banhart might sound like were he captured from the wild and domesticated: Secondhand personality is as close as Lionheart gets to the real thing on Catch the Brass Ring. Of course, the album can't coalesce a persona out of all these red herrings. It's impossible to get a sense of who Ferraby Lionheart is, or even who he'd like to be, which is an important aspect of his singer/songwriterly genre-- we're meant to get a sense of direct communication, as if the singers are teaching us about ourselves by speaking honestly about themselves. Specificity has to somehow make itself known through the thick archetypal veneer. Lionheart's fondness for devices like Southern Lit speech (""We can make a meal of dust/ Mary's in the market mural"" he sings on ""Vermont Avenue"", building something more like a diorama than an actual scene) and schmaltzy string embellishments create too many layers for us to perceive him specifically, hearing instead a mostly pleasant (if sometimes overbearing) amalgam of canonical American songcraft, rendered as a closed form. Lionheart's somebody-- something about his earnestness seems cagey and calculated-- but he seems to be going to great pains to conceal who, and in the end, the elaborately staged and topically skittish video for ""Small Planet"" is the best visual representation of his mannered musical pantomime.","New Americana singer-songwriter here comes across like a demurely disheveled young man slouched in an overstuffed leather chair, reading Steinbeck and picking at his acoustic guitar.

Take Music,President,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b374ea9e61561daa6ac6/1:1/w_160/4fc0ed2f.jpg,2007-12-07 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10902-take-music/,Friends,"Even by the modest standards of Q and Not U, not much noise has been made for President, the post-breakup project of that band's guitarist, Harris Klahr. And it's a shame, because while this album's minimal arrangements and budget production values might call for lowered expectations, Klahr's ambitions are lofty and frequently realized, and no beat or texture within his gaze can't be assimilated. ""Bedroom Stereolab"" would be the quickest way to describe the playful diversity of the songs on Take Music. The tracks run the gamut from relaxed and intoxicating, like opener ""Gliding"", to seriously funky workouts like the busy, layered drums and swirling, circular guitar and synth lines of ""Coils of Oils"". All the while, Klahr wails over the music, sounding like a teenage Perry Farrell. Part of what made Q and not U interesting was their ear for unusual rhythms, though they unfortunately broke up before they could ever dig too deep. Klahr probably had no small part in that, and that omnivorous tendency is very much on display here. President can steal from everywhere, and often do: The damp, musty keyboards that drive the creeping butt-shaker ""Light Magus"" (the title should clue you in on the track's inspiration), the pronounced looping of acoustic guitars in the gentle-but-jarring ""Tamb 2"", or the sleazy 1980s synth-pop in ""Reasons in Seasons"". As a digital-only release, it's easy to wonder whether a CD or vinyl release might add something to the muffled chorus of drum circles and wheezing melodicas in ""Ghost Logo"", or what sounds like a cardboard disco diorama (literal microhouse, perhaps?) on the softly nagging thump of ""By the Wall"". To be fair, many of these tracks are more sketches than actual songs-- filled with loops that tantalize, vocal repetitions that build unreleased tension, atmospheres that envelop the listener just to evaporate moments later. But as sketches go, they bode well for future release, provided President's idea of a big single isn't the repetitive and relentlessly perky ""In the Sun"", which closes the record. It's probably the most ""finished"" track, but everything before it hints at a darker, funkier, more sophisticated party. Plenty of bands have aimed for a more omni-cultural sound with punk instrumentation and fallen short (El Guapo come to mind), but the clearly intentional lo-fi production of Take Music deflates a lot of expectation. There's not a lot of weight on sounding authentic here; it sounds like Klahr layers and juxtaposes new sounds for the joy of hearing them in new contexts, and that joy really comes across. We should count ourselves lucky that the latest bedroom pop artist approaches his smallest projects so studiously, managing to take the music seriously without doing the same for himself.","Q and Not U guitarist goes the solo route, with an ear for unusual rhythms and an omnivorous feel for genre that sometimes seems like a lo-fi bedroom version of Stereolab.

Cotton Eyed Joe: The Loop Tapes - Live in Boulder - 1962,Karen Dalton,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b333b1335d7bf169a557/1:1/w_160/02798976.jpg,2007-12-07 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10832-cotton-eyed-joe-the-loop-tapes-live-in-boulder-1962/,Delmore,"In 1962, Karen Dalton, her husband, and her daughter lived in a small shack in the Colorado mountains, with no electricity or running water, but a splendid view and plenty of space to ride horses. Occasionally, Dalton would play at the Attic, which at that time was the nucleus for Boulder's folk scene. As Joe Loop, the club's co-proprietor and a friend of Dalton's proclaims, ""Folk music was in the midst of its most popular period so when Karen performed there, [the audience] really listened. You can tell she was comfortable when you listen to the recordings."" To hear contemporaries and historians tell it, Dalton rarely settled anywhere for long, so for her to find a place where she felt musically at home seems important, at least in retrospect. Fortunately, Loop had the good sense to record some of Dalton's shows at the Attic, and nearly a half-century later, Nashville-based Delmore Recordings is releasing it as Cotton Eyed Joe: The Loop Tapes - Live in Boulder - 1962, a 2xCD/1xDVD set that's a boon for Dalton enthusiasts as well as those who discovered her from last year's re-issue of In My Own Time. Loop's tapes are necessarily scratchy and lo-fi, the audio equivalent of a creased sepia-tone photograph. Occasionally, Dalton's performance strains the capabilities of the recording devices, as on the jarring ""Fannin' Street"", but most of the songs make this technological drawback a defining aesthetic. The haunted ""It's Alright"", completely reinventing Ray Charles' original, sounds like it's echoing directly from 1962; likewise the dusty narrative ""Old Hannah"", which foregoes the guitar, leaving only Dalton's voice to fill the Attic space. ""Prettiest Train"" in particular is a lo-fi opus: Dalton's hard strums and guitar slaps mix into a roughly percussive rhythm for her upbeat blues variation, and she hits the last syllable of each verse line with added force, as if she's singing in italics-- ""Honey, don't you marry no convict man!"" Her consciously and regularly placed accents give the melody a slight rush against her guitar, creating an urgent calamity that sounds barely controlled and more intensely dire than anything else she ever did. Loop is right: Dalton, in her mid-twenties at this time, does seem more comfortable in this setting than on either of her two studio albums. Or, more to the point, she sounds more powerful on these songs, recorded seven years before her proper debut, It's Always Hard to Tell Who's Going to Love You Best. Reportedly, Dalton hated recording-- she had to be tricked into recording that debut-- but the stage is obviously her milieu, especially in an intimate room filled with attentive listeners. There can't be more than a dozen people in the audience, hardly enough to call it a crowd, but they respond to these songs, not just in their clapping but in their silence. Dalton feeds off this dynamic, drawing sharp and confident lines through these old songs. She slows ""Cotton Eyed Joe"" to a crawl and sings it as a folk pastoral, then switches from guitar to banjo (reportedly carved from a bedpost) on ""One May Morning"" and the curious ""Mole in the Ground"". When Dalton speaks (and she barely does), her voice sounds grandmotherly: worn around the edges by hard times and desperation. At times she sings these songs like she's covering herself with a quilt; other times she's in the wood howling in the cold. Along with her ready access to such extremes, the qualities she conveys through these songs-- the self-reliance and sense of personal freedom so valued by her folk contemporaries, as well as her almost desperate disregard for commercial prospects-- are the very same ones that both attract cratediggers and ensure her larger obscurity. Forty-five years after these recordings, Dalton remains one of folk's most fascinating footnotes.","This 2xCD/1xDVD set of intimate club recordings is a boon for Karen Dalton enthusiasts as well as those who discovered her from last year's reissue of In My Own Time.

The Solution,Beanie Sigel,by: Tom Breihan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3b513d197565213a9b0/1:1/w_160/54b0b748.jpg,2007-12-07 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10960-the-solution/,Def JamRoc-A-Fella,"The Philadelphia rapper Beanie Sigel recorded his last album, 2004's The B.Coming, in the weeks between being sentenced to a federal prison on a gun charge and the beginning of his term. That album was like a rap version of Spike Lee's The 25th Hour, the sound of someone who knew he was headed for hard times. In the almost four years since The B.Coming saw release, Beanie served 10 months in federal prison and was acquitted of an attempted murder charge that would've sent him away for a whole lot longer. He was shot twice during a botched robbery attempt. His stepfather was brutally killed in a Philly alleyway, his body set on fire. He saw the chaotic, acrimonious breakup of his label, Roc-A-Fella Records, and the dissolution of his hometown rap crew, State Property. He ignited a minor internet controversy when he told Kanye West, his labelmate and past collaborator, to come out of the closet. By any measure, Beanie Sigel has been through a turbulent few years, and so it's something of a shock to turn on the first track of The Solution and hear him bragging about his money over the Runners' cheesy faux-epic synths while R. Kelly coos professionally behind him. Beanie Sigel is not a smooth rapper. His voice is a halting, raspy snarl, and he delivers his words with hyper-emo bluster, like he's got so much rage burning in his gut that he's helpless to hold anything back, ever. When he's pissed, he sounds dangerous; when he's depressed, he sounds about ready to bury himself alive. And when he's happy, he still sounds depressed. Beanie has always sounded great playing the growling foot-soldier to mentor Jay-Z's liquid kingpin boss. But he's historically had even better chemistry with the gravel-throated Houston legend Scarface, since Face and Sigel share the same air of hard-won authority, the sense that they're trying pull wisdom from chaotic lives. Over crackly East Coast soul-rap beats, pretty much nobody sounds better than Sigel. So it's hard to figure why Sigel would play against his own strengths as completely as he does on The Solution's first half. If Beanie's chief virtue is his embittered honesty, it makes no sense for him to drone on about bottle-popping and money-spending over Floridian synth-rap from producers like the Runners and Cool & Dre. It's depressing to hear him coming with endless money-talk cliches: ""I don't windowshop/ And I don't lease, I just pick and cop,"" that sort of thing. This is Jay territory, however, so it's no shock when he up on ""Gutted"" and completely shows Beans up without ever easing out of autopilot. ""Pass the Patron"" has a shuffling almost-swing drum-shuffle, like B.Coming highlight ""Gotta Have It"", but it never even approaches that song's raging intensity. And ""I'm In"" finds him spitting empathy-free anti-romance over thin, tinkly quiet storm. Beanie is a technical master, and he sounds happy just to be rapping again after so many years on the Def Jam shelf, especially when he and guest Styles P try out a Run-DMC tag-team style on ""You Ain't Ready for Me"". But he wasn't built to rap over halfassed club-rap, and so the only real bright moment on the first half comes when Beanie gets very, very dark. ""Go Low"" is a slow, eerie electro-reggae pulse, and it finds Beanie spitting terrifying jailhouse-bully threats: ""No pause, no homo, no vaseline/ When I enter niggas slow with that broomstick."" For four minutes, it's like he's venting all the rage that he represses elsewhere; it's not pretty, but it sure is effective. If ""Go Low"" proves anything, it's that this guy can't be domesticated, not even by himself. The album's second half mostly comes from the Philly producers Dre & Vidal, who Beans had originally tapped to do the whole album, and it offers a glimpse of what could've been. The transitional track is ""Hustlas, Haze & Highways"", where Beanie talks about hustling and makes fun of people in tight jeans over glinting smooth-jazz horns that recall Vol. 1-era Jay. Then, on ""What They Gon' Say to Me,"" Beans is all the way back in his comfort-zone, spitting short-tempered gangster shit: ""I suggest you retire, stop rhyming/ Your life based on a popped condom and bad timing."" Soon, though, he turns that ire inward. ""Judgment Day"" sampled Black Sabbath's ""War Pigs"" and finds Beans fretting about not being a good-enough Muslim. On ""Dear Self"", Dre & Vidal somehow figure out a way to make a James Blunt sample work, no mean feat, while Beans relentlessly interrogates his own ignorant side, then lets that ignorant side snap back at him. And the album-closing ""Prayer"" finds Beans sinking into total despair: ""I often find myself stuck, staring in space/ Feels like hours at a time, thoughts drifting away."" As the song ends, we realize Beanie's been idling at a stoplight, zoning out and getting lost thinking about everything bad in his life. As producers, Dre & Vidal aren't any less superficial than the Florida duos on the album's first half, but they understand that Beanie needs either slow, organic tracks or fiery, roiling ones. And when he has those tracks, it's almost stunning how completely Beanie switches his style up, flagellating himself where just a few tracks before he was laughing at people who buy beer instead of Ace of Spades. The Solution is a deeply schizophrenic record, one that completely divorces Beanie's cocksure swagger from his introspective depth. Maybe next time around Beanie will figure out how to unleash both of those sides on the same songs, to let them build on each other and complicate things. If that happens, something tells me the Runners won't be involved.","The Philly rapper follows his urgent 2004 album The B.Coming with a schizophrenic record split between bottle-popping and money-spending and the darker, more introspective stuff at which he excels.

Exodus: 30th Anniversary Edition,Bob Marley & the Wailers,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3be5e6ef959693224d7/1:1/w_160/8e21674c.jpg,2007-12-07 06:00:01,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10969-exodus-30th-anniversary-edition/,InterscopeTuff Gong,"By the time Bob Marley died-- in 1981, of cancer-- he was one of the world's first global superstars, famous and lauded from Europe through Africa and the Americas. Some even saw him as not just a reggae singer but as a folk hero, a sort of freedom fighter, and to this day his enduring image feels greater than the music he made. Yet it's that music that drives Bob Marley, Inc., which has extended Marley's legacy one step beyond mere icon: In the 21st century, Bob Marley's a bona fide brand, a veritable back-to-school staple every bit as important as more practical dorm-room accoutrements, a mildly rebellious signifier for those not quite ready to wade into the slightly muddier waters of the Che Guevara poster. Marley isn't the best reggae singer Jamaica ever produced, but he's certainly the best-known and best-selling. Indeed, nary a music listener goes a lifetime without picking up Marley's best-of Legend, a disc that stresses the singer's mastery of pop music in general as much as reggae specifically. Ironically, those millions of copies of Legend shipped and sold each year as totem, talisman, or token have obscured Marley's place as an album artist, but the singer's catalog shouldn't be an afterthought. 1977's Exodus-- recorded in London exile after a failed attempt on his life-- turned out to be Marley's biggest-selling studio album. Recently, Time magazine tapped it as the greatest LP of the 20th century. Other Marley discs had bigger hits and still others had better album tracks, but the balance Marley strikes between politics, religion, and romance on Exodus-- compare and contrast the urgent title track and the laid-back ""Jamming""-- shows a pop star at the peak of his powers. For better or worse, it's Marley's mellower side that sets the tone of Exodus. It may have come off nuts at the time, but Robert Christgau's comparison of late era Bob Marley to Steely Dan isn't totally off base. Songs like ""Waiting in Vain"" and ""Turn Your Lights Down Low"" are first and foremost smoooooooth, and if chants like ""The Heathen"" and ""Guiltiness"" hint at a certain call to action, the presentation trumps the message. ""Exodus"" may make you want to rise up and fight on the side of Jah, but the message you take from the album as a whole is the one delivered in ""One Love"" and ""Three Little Birds"": ""Don't worry about a thing/ Cause every little thing gonna be all right,"" goes the latter; ""Let's get together and feel all right,"" Marley says in the former. It was on stage rather than in the studio where Marley's revolutionary powers were at their greatest. He was a charismatic force, and celebratory tales of his fiery performances are legend among those who witnessed them. A previous deluxe edition of Exodus included among its bonus tracks several songs from Marley's famed June 4, 1977 performance at London's Rainbow club in support of the album. This specially packaged set (like a small hardback book, akin to the recent repackaging of Culture's Two Sevens Clash) drops the album-related bonus tracks in favor of a DVD featuring Marley's Rainbow performance in its entirety. The show's been released before, so this edition really offers nothing new, save a reminder that, yes, he was every bit as good as people say. As the performance, the final in a four-night stand (all supposedly recorded at the time for a live album), proceeds, Marley's mantras grow more urgent. His rendition of ""War"" is steeped in conviction, ""No Woman No Cry"" plays like the standard it's since become, ""Get Up, Stand Up"" starts off staid before quickly shifting into high gear, and ""Exodus"" ends the night on an enviable high note. Alas, Marley never made it to America on the Exodus tour. He injured his toe playing soccer and cancelled the U.S. tour, and while he did eventually return to the road, by then the damage had been done: Through a combination of bad luck and religious disdain for medical treatment, that same toe injury led to the spread of cancer throughout his body. Given weeks to live, Marley played his final show in Pittsburgh, of all places, perhaps an ignominious place to end such a storied career but as good a start as any to the places his legacy has stretched since.","Bob Marley's best-selling studio album features a good chunk of the songs you can find on the reggae singer's venerable cash-cow Legend, but that's no reason for newcomers to overlook it. This reissue adds a DVD featuring Marley's legendary 1977 London Rainbow performance in its entirety.

Elegies to Lessons Learnt,iLiKETRAiNS,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b37d13d197565213a953/1:1/w_160/5204a418.jpg,2007-12-06 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10911-elegies-to-lessons-learnt/,Beggars Banquet,"Dip into iLIKETRAiNs' modus operandi and one risks drowning in affectation. There's that name, for starters. Then there's the band's habit of writing songs based on historical figures and events-- pick-me-ups like the Fire of London, witch trials, the Black Death, and Spencer Perceval, the only British Prime Minister ever assassinated. The group performs them in front of scratchy old projected films (you know, like a live soundtrack). And they used to dress in British Rail uniforms, too (now it's black armband-adorned mourning attire, not unlike Arcade Fire as currently costumed). But you can't listen to a light show, and gimmicks don't mean a thing if the music doesn't move you. To their credit, the Leeds group owns up to the debt it owes such acts as Sigur Rós and Godspeed You! Black Emperor. But unlike the latter, the group has vocals, and unlike the former, those vocals are in English. And proudly so, too, as the group takes its listeners on a trip down the dreary, shadowy back alleys of British history. The disc even comes with a collection of historical essays. To say, then, that the group's promising full-length debut Elegies to Lessons Learnt is steeped in melodrama is a bit like accusing Nick Cave at this late date of Old Testament overkill. ""We All Fall Dawn"", the first track on Elegies, is indeed heavily indebted to the Bad Seeds as well as the aforementioned compatriots, and truth be told if the song hooks you off the bat you're probably golden for the disc's duration. Bristle the littlest bit at the portentous bombast, however, and the rest of the disc will likely wear you down like endless freight cars clattering down the tracks. The best approach is to actually take the apparent humorlessness of iLiKETRAiNS as a sign of a sense of humor. You have to have at least the tiniest inkling of 21st century irony to appreciate David Martin's Grand Guignol delivery as the gloomy dirge ""Twenty Five Sins"" builds to a bleak eulogy for a city in flames, or ""Spencer Perceval"" plods through nearly ten minutes of rousing intensity. It's all quite incredible, in every sense. There is an unfortunate redundancy to the disc, though, as each epic's pounding percussion and oddly predictable dynamics begin to blur. As awesome and awesomely imposing as songs such as ""The Deception"", ""Death of an Idealist"", and ""The Voice of Reason"" may be, there are only so many times you can hear a track lead to the same massive orchestral crescendo before the music comes dangerously close to formula. Overkill may be the name of the game, but the weight of subject and execution is often suffocating. And that's ultimately where the disc lets you down. Despite its intricately considered aesthetic and artfully arranged songs, Elegies lacks both the grace of Sigur Rós and the pure menace of Godspeed. It's cinematic, to be sure, but those same carefully delineated and very specific subjects rob the music of some of its mystery, putting a damper on any sense of discovery or adventure. No question, Elegies to Lessons Learnt is an undeniably effective 50-minute ride, but it's also rather coldly mapped out. Tales of doomed persons and disastrous events drawn from the horrific annals of history, you know where all these songs are going before they've even left the station.","Inspired by horrible historic events, iLiKETRAiNS specialize in the pressing weight of the inevitable, which may be why, for all its strengths, this otherwise strong debut has a been-there-done-that vibe about it.

How You Sell Soul to a Souless People Who Sold Their Soul???,Public Enemy,by: Evan McGarvey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b38e13d197565213a96f/1:1/w_160/a7962dde.jpg,2007-12-06 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10926-how-you-sell-soul-to-a-souless-people-who-sold-their-soul/,Slam Jamz,"Entering their third decade of hip-hop proselytizing and nation-building-- lest history forget, they were blasted by students in city squares during the overthrow of the former Yugoslavia's Slobodan Milosevic-- Public Enemy has entered a productive reclusion on their 11th full-length. A far cry from their recent self-indulgent pouts, 2002's Revolverution and 2005's New Whirl Odor, How You Sell Soul to a Souless People Who Sold Their Soul??? gets at the finicky emotional recipe for P.E.'s success. Instead of pretending to strut and rage à la those aforementioned mid-1990s old grey mare trudges, How You Sell Soul (there is no way to cleanly truncate most P.E. titles) revisits instrumental blueprints from Fear of a Black Planet and It Takes a Nation of Millions, enshrined intros-- ""The brother don't swear he nice/ He KNOWS he nice!""-- and plays the self-referencing cards with aplomb. Because when piss and vinegar is your blood type, there's no such thing as tempering. Old age is just a new window to shoot from. The band combats ""age"" with disclosure: The liner notes sprawl like yearbook memories, thanking old AC/DC records for inspiration alongside Chuck's hand-holding descriptions of just how and why each song was constructed-- sample history, just WHY he respects KRS so much and just needed him for ""Sex, Drugs & Violence"". Chuck D even tones down his still-glorious solo megaphone riot and concedes: ""Thank you for letting us be ourselves/ So don't mind me if I repeat myself/ These simple lines be good for your health"" (""Harder Than You Think""). Simple chestnuts they are: kids gotta read, governments gotta be questioned, and gangster rap is fine, as long as you know it's rap, not reality. And the skeletal disclosure works. Aside from a few ungainly, obvious missteps-- trying to play the Scott Storch melodic game on ""Amerikan Gangster"", wasting the KRS run-in on a track that sounds like a D12 refuse pile (""Sex, Drugs & Violence"")-- the album is finely sequenced. Newsreel-ish interludes punctuate the album into thematic thirds (rebirth, bitches!/appraising the day/stumping for the apocalypse). The nakedly obvious structure loosens everyone's valves. Chuck worries about images and phonetics-- ""watch the masses move as a mass of switches,"" ""Botswana to Watts and Queens."" The best melodies are given the space (Read: minimal Flav howling, Chuck pays attention to breath control) to breathe-- see the stubble-funk trash on ""Frankenstar"", the Commodores sample on ""Escapism"", and, the album's best track, Redman's burbling production and winsome guest verse on ""Can You Hear Me Now?"" When How You Sell Soul rounds the corner into its raging final third, there's a nice little epiphany. With the way we now appreciate and consume music, P.E. may never be able to change America again (they probably have a bigger contemporary fanbase outside this continent), but they still can light up a few souls. No matter their pop ""relevance,"" they refuse to, and refuse to let their listeners, be complacent. Read Orwell, beat Yung Joc with a trashcan, don't watch CNN. Just. Do. Something. When the apocalypse is finally unveiled, don't be the hollow man Joc-ing your way toward Bethlehem.","Awkward titles are a given at this point, but the legendary hip-hop outfit brings the musical goods this time out, resulting in their best album in years.

Spinning Pieces,Ethan Rose,by: Andrew Gaerig,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b37a13d197565213a951/1:1/w_160/11fa76a9.jpg,2007-12-06 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10909-spinning-pieces/,Locust,"For three weeks I have attempted to finger the thematic underpinning of Ethan Rose's Spinning Pieces. A collection of three pieces recorded between 2003 and 2007, each track sources a different mechanical device: music boxes on ""Miniature & Sea"", player pianos on ""...The Dot and the Line..."", and an automated carillon-- a 100+ ton tower containing dozens of large bells-- on ""Singing Tower"". Each source is digitally kneaded into extended, wordless compositions. So then, a theme. ""Reclaiming the music from the machines"" seems incongruous amid Rose's substantial computer-aided manipulation. ""The juxtaposition of old and new technologies in music"" fails because Rose is bent on blending sounds, not comparing them. ""Transferring the mechanical into the digital"" seems equally unpalatable, as Rose mostly borrows from the sources' tones, not their programmed pieces. Forget it: Spinning Pieces is plainly ambient mood music, however it was conceived. Keith Fullerton Whitman-- another sound philosopher-- often provides neat, ordered photos of the guitars, keyboards, and widgets he distills; if nothing else, Rose's fascination with noisemakers offers a similar measure of discovery. It's not that Spinning Pieces had to be recorded using these anachronistic devices, but their incorporation does provide a sense of rustic unity. Anachronistic is the right term -- nostalgic is not. Player pianos have disappeared from everywhere but the atriums of medium-upscale department stores, and music boxes, well, iPod etc. And apologies to anyone bemoaning our nation's dearth of carillons, but Spinning Pieces isn't really about fondly remembering. Rather, Rose explores both the sounds these machines made and the methods with which they made them. ""Singing Tower"" opens with a series of ringing bells, but its quivering middle passage suggests the vibrations that push the air around the carillon's cables and hammers. ""The Dot and the Line"" reproduces not just the precise, rolling notes of the player piano but the hum of the music roll's turn. The crank of the windup key inhabits the blank space of ""Miniature & Sea"". Rose's additions are wooden and damp, at their best they recall the handcrafted boxes and constructs that held his machines. These are the same ideas Rose mined on his 2006 debut Ceiling Songs, though likely because of Spinning Pieces' separate recording dates, the process here is more discrete. Any added distinction, however, does little to clear up how sounds from a tiny Portland piano shop end up as largely formless avant-garde compositions. Indeed, for all of its clever, quaint sourcing, Spinning Pieces skews toward the heavily abstract. There is nary a melody or rhythm to be found, unless you care to imagine the machines' natural hums into the tracks. ""The Dot and the Line"" turns a music roll's tune into hazy notes that wash ashore and before sliding backwards. The closing minutes of ""Miniature & Sea"" depict what a music box might sound like if its lullaby were smeared and played as a long, gently shifting tone. Rose enjoys this sort of blurring: taking familiar, melodious tones and shaping them into still-recognizable but mostly dissimilar ideas. That these tones come primarily from mechanical gadgets gives form to the flotsam he injects between them; not merely pretty noises separated by digital wicker, Spinning Pieces is pretty noise strewn about the wires, gears, and scrolls there were once constrained by.","Taking recordings of bells, player pianos, and music boxes, this Portland, Ore., experimentalist digitally kneads his sources into extended, wordless compositions.

The Knee Plays,David Byrne,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b350b1335d7bf169a591/1:1/w_160/634a3941.jpg,2007-12-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10870-the-knee-plays/,ECMECM,"The CIVIL warS: A Tree Is Best Measured When It Is Down was set to be experimental theatre director Robert Wilson's most massive achievement to date. Best known at the time for his 1976 five-hour operatic collaboration with Philip Glass, Einstein on the Beach, Wilson was leading troupes from six countries in the production of CIVIL warS, a 12-hour avant-garde opera that would premiere at the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles. Although Wilson lost funding before staging the full production, several smaller versions of the play were individually performed around the world. ""The Knee Plays"", the American contribution scored by David Byrne, premiered in Minneapolis in April 1984, and had its vinyl release on avant-jazz label ECM the next year. ""Knee Plays"" is Wilson's own term, contrived to describe the connective vignettes that link the larger sections of a production, allowing for set and costume changes. Byrne signed on to produce the interstitials for CIVIL warS, and his subsequent performances have been comprised solely of the adjoining sections, which hold together rather well-- as well as one of Wilson's non-narratives can, at least. Nonesuch's current release of Knee Plays-- for the first time on CD-- adds eight previously unreleased tracks and a dense recollection of the pair's mind-meld by Byrne himself. In many ways, a collaboration between Byrne and Wilson was perfect. Most obviously, Byrne's work with Twyla Tharp and Jonathan Demme on The Catherine Wheel and Stop Making Sense, respectively, indicated a keen interest in similar sorts of theatre, as well as the ability to pull off a collaboration with often wonderful results. The pair's stylistic and procedural similarities run deep as well: Both Byrne and Wilson had gained reknown by mastering the use of patient, tourettically clipped and repetitive phrases and gestures; they also shared a fascination with antisociality (at times, mental illness) and the mundane realities of everyday life. They even looked similar, in a tall, geekily dashing sort of way. Originally envisioning a Japanese drum ensemble, Byrne instead opted for music more in the vein of New Orleans' Dirty Dozen Brass Band-- a perfect fit for a play inspired by the Civil War and scored by Byrne, at this point seemingly fascinated by all art with strong cultural resonances. From the opening track, ""Tree (Today Is an Important Occasion)"" to the quintessentially Byrnian spoken-word closer ""In the Future"", the music is variously light, dramatic, authoritative, and empathetic. Byrne's ethnomusicological streak in full force, several sections of his score were adapted from traditional music: ""In the Upper Room"", ""Social Studies (The Gift of Sound)"", and ""Things to Do (I've Tried)"" are faithful gospel adaptations, and ""Theadora Is Dozing"" comes from the Bulgarian folk tradition. Byrne, like Wilson, treats simple behaviors with the utmost delicacy and curiosity. In the essay included with the Nonesuch re-release, Byrne discusses his decision to accompany the music with narration (by himself, of course) as part of the Dadaist and Surrealist traditions: ""None of these (text pieces) was directly related to Bob's 'story' and they were certainly unrelated to the stage action...to 'illustrate' things that are happening on stage with music or text is redundant."" Anyone familiar with the liner notes to Stop Making Sense will recognize the narration over ""Upper Room"", for instance: ""Being in the theater is more important than knowing what is going on in the movie."" Similarly, ""Things to Do"" is a numbered to-do list (""Number 25. Putting houses next to bumpy things/ Number 26. Shaking things next to other things""), and both ""Tree"" and ""Social Studies"" approach everyday activities from the perspective of a stranger to Western culture. The most successful of these is the original closer ""In the Future"", on which Byrne shows off his knack at predicting technological and social trends, ending with ""In the future there will be so much going on that no one will be able to keep track of it."" That statement seems applicable to most any historical era, but who's quibbling? He's right. The most striking characteristic of The Knee Plays reflects the most overlooked quality shared by Byrne and Wilson. Both artists are deeply invested in appeals to their audiences' most basic human sympathies, yet their approaches are often misunderstood as cold by those who can't meet the work on its own terms. Extracted from its theatrical roots, Byrne's score holds up remarkably well, a testament to his unique vision at the time of its composition-- coming at the end of one of pop music's most fascinating creative streaks.","Originally conceived as one part of Robert Wilson's ambitious, avant-garde opera The CIVIL warS, this 1984 work is being issued for the first time on CD, with the addition of eight previously unreleased tracks and dense liner notes by David Byrne himself.

The Big Doe Rehab,Ghostface Killah,by: Ryan Dombal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Features Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3baea9e61561daa6b3a/1:1/w_160/3acfd6e8.jpg,2007-12-06 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10965-the-big-doe-rehab/,Def Jam,"Talking about the title of his seventh album, Ghostface recently offered a sleep-inspired explanation: ""Dreams-- you can't really remember the dreams-- but I was someplace, I don't even know if it was rehab, but it was mad money in there. When I woke up, the first thing that came to my mind was The Big Doe Rehab."" For most people, a dream filled with money would make them think of what they could do with all that cash. Ghost is not like most people. His vision is aptly conflicted; though he's ostensibly in rehab for having too much money, the only cure-- according to the characteristically daffy album art featuring orange medicine bottles filled with Benjamin Franklins-- is more doe. When it comes to the hustle, there is no way out. Continuing with the harrowing narrative fervor that defined last year's compelling Fishscale and the old soul loops that have remained a constant throughout much of his career, Ghost's new album may not uncover many of the verteran MC's still-hidden darts but, even 11 years after his solo debut, there's no denying one of hip-hop's most vibrant voices in its comfort zone. Of course, his sweet spot is anything but sweet. As usual, the drug-peddling tales here deal in the currency of consequence; in Ghost's world there's no such thing as a simple transaction. Even on the hands-in-the-air anthem ""We Celebrate"", the boasts are tinged with annoying necessity (""The pool's a pain in the ass/ Fifty grand on Windex, kid/ They keep it clean, the whole bottom is glass"") and concession (""If you fat I might take one for the team/ But I gotta get drunk first, know what I mean?""). Elsewhere, the terrors are more substantial. Both ""Walk Around"" and ""Yolanda's House"" are entries into the list of Ghostface chase classics (see: ""Run""). ""Walk Around"" starts where most murder-rap songs end-- right after the shots go off. Describing a grizzly corner store scene, the trigger-happy narrator doesn't skimp on the details: ""A part of his nose was stuck to my Padres"" (trumping Prodigy's similarly gruesome ""you've got some stomach on your Nikes"" line from earlier this year). Soon, the killer is puking in his friend's car and dismissing claims of insanity (""don't put me in no mental clinics"")-- it's a yarn ripe with the tangible vulnerability and irrationality of a first-time offender. Meanwhile, on ""Yolanda's House"", the emotive rapper enlists both Method Man and Raekwon to tell his harried tale. ""God strike me if you don’t like me,"" huffs Ghost. ""I'm tired and I'm out of breath, the weed got me paranoid."" The lines evoke Sam Jackson's famous take on Ezekiel 25:17 from Pulp Fiction. And while RZA may be the Wu-Tang member who can call Quentin Tarantino a close friend, Ghost's intricate crime stories and flamboyant violence-- not to mention his extreme verbosity-- increasingly sound like deleted scenes from one of the director's post-modern epics. On this track, a miraculously revived Method Man has to pull himself together after Ghost bursts in on him mid-coitus while on the run (""She’s asthmatic and you laughin', son/ I bumped my toe on the nightstand just running trying to grab the gun,"" Meth bitches, pulling up his underwear). These guys are well aware that getting caught with your pants down can often be as endearing as it is embarrassing. Just as they provided the sweeping musical backbone to Jay-Z's American Gangster, producing tandem Sean C and LV of Diddy's Hitmen crew work their criminally smooth style on five Rehab tracks. But while Jay used the duo's blaring horns to vault himself to triumph, Ghost embodies the sweat on the '70s session man's brow as he relives the pain and hard work of his nostalgic sound snippets. ""I'll Die for You"" works around purchasing an expensive Marvin Gaye sample by pinching a symphonic bed of strings that uncannily replicates the lush grooves of What's Going On. On the track, Ghost fancies himself a modern martyr (""I die for the babies who can't eat with bare feet who need they mother""). But this Messiah won't die for just anyone (""First off yo you ain't my peeps/ I know we from the same town and shit/ But we ain't that deep""). Unfortunately, given the current internal Wu-Tang Clan war, those disparaging comments sound like they could be aimed at the RZA. In his songs, Ghostface is always striving and battling and starting a ruckus so, in a weird way, his press fight with the RZA-- involving alleged unpaid dues and the head Clansman's unorthodox (and fantastic) production on new Wu album 8 Diagrams-- is apropos. Even as both the Wu-Tang and Ghostface release two of the best rap albums of this shallow year within one week of each other, the group's problems overshadow their conquests. Fittingly, at the proper ending of Rehab, Ghost isn't chilling on some getaway island, he's rushing headlong into an untold number of cops waiting to shoot him dead, Butch Cassidy-style. There will never be a happy fade out for Ghostface-- and lucky for us he still can't quite figure out why. On ""The Prayer"", Rehab's acapella conversation with God, an r&b singer named Ox sums up the rapper's ongoing turmoil as well as anyone could: ""He said, 'Son you should know you're born to die'/ I said, 'I do, it's just hard sayin' bye'.""","Continuing with the harrowing narrative fervor that defined last year's compelling Fishscale and the old-soul loops that have defined much of his career, Ghost's new album may not uncover many new darts but, even 11 years after his solo debut, there's no denying one of hip-hop's most vibrant voices in its comfort zone.

Close to Paradise,Patrick Watson,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b384b1335d7bf169a5e3/1:1/w_160/c36b5a94.jpg,2007-12-05 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10917-close-to-paradise/,Secret City,"Prior to last September, Patrick Watson was primarily known as the guy who christened his band with his own name-- not ""The Patrick Watson Band,"" mind you, just ""Patrick Watson."" After the second annual Polaris Prize ceremony two months ago, Patrick Watson (the band, and the guy) became a perfect example of a victory gained through split votes. Close to Paradise, Watson's second album, emerged triumphant after the panel of Canadian critics failed to choose between the overwhelmingly better choices: Arcade Fire, Feist, the Besnard Lakes, Junior Boys, Julie Doiron, the Dears and Chad VanGaalen. While plenty of WTFing went down in the wake of Watson's win, a few listens to Paradise lend support to the album as a generic consensus pick. On his MySpace page, Watson lists among his influences Nick Drake, Jeff Buckley, Björk, John Coltrane, David Lynch, Claude Debussy, and Erik Satie. Yeah. Watson is certainly not one to underestimate his own potential, that's for sure, and he aims Paradise toward a sense of whimsical classicism. Yet, as could be predicted for a guy with such high artistic aspirations, Paradise employs baroque, delicate arrangements as representations of something bigger, leading to meander in place of grandeur,  and frequently unearned moments of bombast. It is sort of pretty, though, and mostly harmless. Also not hurting its push toward accord: Paradise is packed with all angles of de rigeur Canadian indie signifiers: bombast and skittishness, childlike wonderment and world-weariness. Like a Disneyfied Michel Gondry, Watson is often preoccupied with the bewildering logic of what happens when we sleep, but only to the extent that he can extract a magical sense of fairy-tale escapism from it. ""Sleeping Beauty"" needs no explanation beyond its title, and on ""Slip into Your Skin"", Watson requests: ""Be the blanket for my bones"". The album-opening title track and ""Daydreamer"" begin with twinkling Peter Pan ambience, then fly out the window awash with wide-eyed astonishment. The former segues into a languid haze of Gilmour-esque fret-slides and Watson's multi-tracked, puckish vocals. The latter opts for muted, evocative electronic flourishes and unimaginative requests, like ""Daydreamer/ Come to me now."" Like his arrangements, Watson's sentiments are too often emotionally overwrought and underdeveloped, neither allowing the listener to actively fill in the gaps or fully release to the music. Watson's singing voice has garnered frequent comparisons to Jeff Buckley, but let's not get carried away. Watson is a fine mimic of Buckley's sui generis quaver to an extent that can't be accidental; he even manages to wrench one pretty good song-- ""Luscious Life""-- out of it. But there's much more to Grace than timbre alone, and Paradise lacks anything remotely close to romantic longing. Granted, this is not necessarily Watson's project here, and he shouldn't be faulted for not being androgynously sexy enough. Yet a proper comparison might be more instructive: the French-café vibe on ""Weight of the World"" and ""The Storm""'s gentle acoustic lilt more appropriately cast Watson as a twirling seraphic troubadour, more Banhart than Buckley. Or perhaps Barrie, as in J.M. Perhaps that final comparison underscores the central failure of Paradise: Watson is guilty of a bit too much innocence.","Like a Disneyfied Michel Gondry, this Polaris Prize winner is often preoccupied with the bewildering logic of what happens when we sleep, but only to the extent that he can extract a magical sense of fairy-tale escapism from it.

My Last Day,Kim Hiorthøy,by: Marc Masters,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b37813d197565213a94c/1:1/w_160/9655c7f4.jpg,2007-12-05 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10907-my-last-day/,Smalltown Supersound,"Like the his album-cover designs for the Rune Grammofon label, Kim Hiorthøy's music is simple, well-crafted, and aesthetically pleasing. His visual art often deals in basic lines and solid colors, and My Last Day, his fourth full-length for Smalltown Supersound, uses minimal beats, plain chords, and small melodic accents in primal combinations. Hiorthøy basically sketches with sound, adding and subtracting elements from his aural canvas before settling on a final mix of colors. But where Hiorthøy's design can be varied and unpredictable, tossing in unexpected ingredients, his music tends toward a monotony that weighs it down. Many of the songs on My Last Day stick to a narrow set of sounds, moods, and tempos. Even Hiorthøy's sketch-ist patterns become rote-- almost every song patiently juggles its parts so that for a while we hear just the beat, then just the beat and some piano, then some piano without the beat, and so forth. That trick becomes so overdone that one of the few songs not constructed that way, the metronomic ""Den Långa Berättelsen Om Stöv Och Vatten"", sounds refreshing in comparison. Still, if Hiorthøy only does one thing musically, he does it well. Even the most unsurprising tunes on My Last Day are tough to resist-- catchy, smooth, and doled out with enticing restraint. There's something alluring about the way the sparse melodies of ""Beats Mistake"" and ""Goodbye to Song"" avoid becoming all-out hook-fests, or the way the cooled chords on ""Skuggen"" and ""Wind of Failure"" paint ambiences without descending into New Age chill. But that mellow vibe also makes the album a bit too soundtrack-ready. It's not hard to imagine that, with just a few boardroom alterations, many of these cuts could garner advertising commissions. The only real curveball on My Last Day is its shortest track, the 71-second ""Hon Ver Otydlig, Som En Gas"". With twangy string-plucks, breathy horn, and snapping percussion, it sounds like the kind of beatific interlude that might pop up on a mid-period Tom Waits record. It probably wouldn't make much sense for Hiorthøy to fill an entire album with such pieces, as melodic techno is clearly his forte. But a few more swerves down unbeaten paths might have helped the best tracks on My Last Day to rise higher, rather than water each other down.","Rune Grammofon visual designer offers his fourth full-length for Smalltown Supersound, and it's crafted by minimal beats, plain chords, and small melodic accents in primal combinations.

Babylon Rules,Clockcleaner,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b37e9d034d5c69bf4d04/1:1/w_160/524fc90a.jpg,2007-12-05 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10912-babylon-rules/,Load,"I don't know about the members of Clockcleaner. I mean, I like the low, sinister squall of the band's noisy punk as well as their arch delivery. But the band is all but banned from playing their hometown Philadelphia for reportedly attacking minorities verbally, the handicapped physically, and other bands' equipment...urinarilly. In lieu of a signature hit, their MySpace page auto-loads a phone message from an angry, threatening fan, who insists that singer John Sharkey is ""felonious."" They've done their best to sully the icon of Kurt Cobain by calling their last record Nevermind and summarily talking tons of shit on Nirvana in subsequent interviews. And the lyrics of Babylon Rules, when intelligible, do their very best to debase and offend. I think these three might be...jerks. But then that's the whole point. Likeminded selective sludge-plumbers like Pissed Jeans have already plowed through this niche, using it for a platform to sing on everything form sexual desperation to ice cream. While the territory of these bands is well covered (but still necessary), Clockcleaner are still trying to push a few buttons while they're at it. Babylon Rules has a bass-heavy lurch akin to the Jesus Lizard and Flipper, but played by hardcore geeks (as in the genre) who understand where those bands were coming from, and with a similar sense of space and terror. Still, they're not just emulating the sound of these bands-- there's a genuine desire to make listeners uncomfortable here. On opener ""New in Town"", the guitar line is oddly syncopated like a hurried message in Morse code, and the rhythm section slithers while singer/guitarist John Sharkey lets out sometimes campy and often desperate squeals and grunts, giving it all a woozy, carnival-gone-wrong feel. ""The birds and the bees won't save you now,"" Sharkey intones while the guitar mimics seagull divebombs, before his lyric switches perspectives (""I have a reputation to protect! Don't come inside me, I'm new in town!""). Even when crawling through a dirge__,__ they don't lose their swing-- the arch anti-solo squiggles of guitar make ample use of blues-scale heroics, piercing noise, echo and open space, while the rhythm section always finds an honest-to-god groove, sluggish and oppressive as it may be on ""New in Town"", ""When My Ship Comes In"", and more. There's more of that uncomfortable rhythm on the stilted and sleazy two-note stomp of ""Caliente Queen"", and some nagging piano à la early Stooges in ""Vomiting Mirrors"" in between its brutal stops and starts. Babylon Rules sticks to the punk-album formula in the best ways, with an all-out thrasher as the penultimate track (""Daddy Issues"") and by being powerfully, thankfully concise at eight tracks. The record might even be a bit tame compared to the band's reputation, but points to them for at least trying to provoke, for being a reminder of the responses this kind of music used to elicit-- the near-fearful reaction of audiences who must've felt like they were presented with some kind of dare.","Clockcleaner have a bass-heavy lurch akin to the Jesus Lizard and Flipper, but this Philadelphia outfit isn't just emulating the sound of those bands-- there's a genuine desire to make listeners uncomfortable here.

Marina Gasolina EP,Bonde Do Rolê,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3ab9d034d5c69bf4d4d/1:1/w_160/3d45cde7.jpg,2007-12-05 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10952-marina-gasolina-ep/,Domino,"Earlier this year, Domino released Bonde do Rolê's With Lasers, an explosive party record ballasted by Marina Vello's jump-rope chants and Pedro D'eyrot's smarmy raps. It was as if M.I.A. had teamed up with the Gerardo of ""Rico Suave"" to make a baile funk platter so cagily dumb that to hate it was to hate fun itself. In fact, With Lasers had everything that M.I.A.'s Arular had: tersely syncopated rhythms, fat night-crawling basslines, complex mechanical percussion pilfered from vintage hip-hop and electro, cosmopolitan nursery rhymes and stylized war-whoops, immaculate sample-happy production, and a pan-global foundation. It also had one thing that Arular lacked-- reams and reams of frat-rock riffs clogging up almost every track. M.I.A.'s minimal approach allowed her songs' subtleties to emerge; Bonde do Rolê's love of 80s cheese-metal drowned their better decisions in a riot of shreddage. As if acknowledging the perils of citing Scorpions and their ilk as primary influences, Bonde do Rolê selected ""Marina Gasolina"", one of With Lasers's most spacious, mannered tracks, as the centerpiece for this odds, ends, and remixes EP. The original version begins deceptively with a dramatic four-four thump before trailing off into a drumline of strobe-lit vocals, clattering hand percussion, baggy brass bleats, and cut-up shout-outs to obvious progenitor Afrika Bambaataa. This new ""radio edit"" even does away with that red herring, lopping about 30 seconds off of the already brief track. ""Marina Gasolina"" isn't distinct enough from the original to be essential, but in the context of the EP's three new songs, it shapes up as the starting point in a happy new direction for the band-- one without rock guitars. ""Contaminada"" finds Bonde do Rolê trading off whimpers and grunts over a brass pattern reminiscent of the one on ""Marina Gasolina"", sampled frog croaks, and 808 malfunctions. While the unfortunately-stylized rap verses (imagine a Portuguese Bobcat Goldthwait) make it the EP's most overlookable track, the beat slams, and a certain amount of exuberant obnoxiousness is a vital component of Bonde do Rolê's shtick. ""Cagado"" is more roundly satisfying, weaving deftly chopped shouts, telegraphic percussion, and splashy claps into a tight braid of insistent rhythm, with a smoothly linear and hypnotic progression. ""Miami Beach"" is the biggest surprise: The Portuguese/English raps are goofy, playfully aggressive, and American-pop-culture obsessed (Don Johnson, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and Tony Montana all get mentioned), but Vello's melting, melodious chorus-- shot through with icy synth whispers-- sounds like something Out Hud might have done circa Let Us Never Speak of it Again, if their wholesome good-times vibes were replaced by a more overtly sexual hedonism. Even when they were obsessed with wah-wah chords, Bonde do Rolê made the sort of music-- rhythmically interlocked yet distinctly partitioned-- that sounded remixed the first time around. So it's no surprise that songs from With Lasers are fertile for remixers. Fake Blood digitizes the brass on ""Marina Gasolina"" and drops in gallons of the same kind of molten, overdriven fuzz that made Vitalic's ""La Rock 01"" such a goosebumpy rush, while Peaches retrofits it with speed-freak vocals and jaw-clenching cocaine synths. CSS's remix of ""Office Boy"" is breezy, robotic funk, while Architecture in Helsinki's is bedecked with pep-rally whistles and power-tool synths (unsurprisingly, CSS loses the song's guitar part, while AiH emphasize it). The Bitchee Bitchee Ya Ya remix of ""Solta O Frango"" funnels the original's disjointed, sing-along IDM into a gradually-widening cone of incendiary rhythm, while Ladytron's is a hard, dark swagger, again tailor-made to complement the ingestion of what Jay McInerney once dubbed ""Bolivian marching powder."" But whether or not you enjoy destroying your septum and haranguing your friends at a breathless clip, Marina Gasolina's focus on nuance over pyrotechnics makes it at once more listenable and more promising than Bonde do Rolê's exciting, exhausting debut.

Live,Interpol,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0f0ea9e61561daa4694/1:1/w_160/266221f8.jpg,2007-12-05 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10961-live/,Capitol,"From the beginning, Interpol seemed a little too big for the underground. Their sound was familiar, but well-defined; even more so was their aesthetic, as the band wore the same suits for entire tours and kept the design of their releases minimal and uniform, like the austere jangle of their songs. The warm reception to their debut album, Turn on the Bright Lights, was almost a matter of course. As their audience grew, their music toed the line between consistency and stasis, while the band released singles, EPs and expanded reissues with the zeal of more popular mainstream acts. This six-song live release is the latest example of Interpol carefully extending their brand without changing much with the music therein. Yet the choice to release this only via iTunes and selectively chosen independent brick-and-mortar record stores is a curious concession to an audience they've spent a lot of time and energy trying to grow beyond. It's no surprise that the tracklist leans towards the band's most recent record, but for the most part the EP's inclusions are exceptional. The bad: Starting with Our Love to Admire's tepid opener, ""Pioneer to the Falls""-- its extended organ intro/audience tease might be more captivating than the song itself-- and the band's least exciting single to date, ""The Heinrich Maneuver"". But even those songs radiate more emotion from singer Paul Banks and sterner performances from their MVP rhythm section than they do on record. Rather than the singles, or any material at all, from Antics, Live puts OLTA's best tracks next to a furious reading of their signature hit, ""Obstacle 1"", and Turn on the Bright Lights favorite ""Stella Was a Diver and She Was Always Down"". If you'd just tuned in, you might mistake their new material for being just as worthy as these older tracks that still hold up rather well. It makes for a canny bit of career summation and, consciously or not, it sends a message to fans who may have lost faith. And for the most part, the gambit pays off. Freed from it's ponderous bookends on OLTA, ""Mammoth"" sounds as propulsive as it should be, and ""Rest My Chemistry"" becomes the eagerly anticipated late-setlist highlight, its flirtatious and cocksure charm so pronounced you won't care the whether the lyrics are about groupies or not. Yet anyone who's actually seen the band-- and with the glut of international festivals they've played, chances are you have-- knows this isn't entirely representative of Interpol's shows. Their setlists are obstinate (even ""Stella"" is a near-perpetual choice for their encore), and their performances err on the side of accurate as opposed to passionate-- they sound pretty much like they do on record. (Then again, maybe one should be careful what one wishes for.) Perhaps the concert at London's Astoria that these songs were taken from was a very special night (and they could have given us the whole performance if so), but as any sort of document, it seems like a bit of a cheat. The EP isn't quite essential, but far more considered than most of their extraneous releases, and it's hard to complain when, for once, the price is right, and it might get someone back into an actual record store at the same time.",,6.1,
The Hunt for the Gingerbread Man,MF Grimm,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b377ea9e61561daa6acd/1:1/w_160/8da35856.jpg,2007-12-04 06:00:05,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10906-the-hunt-for-the-gingerbread-man/,Class A,"If your tastes in hip-hop tend to skew outlaw, then you've likely heard more than a few gingerbread rhymes (Clipse, Biggie and Beanie Sigel come to mind). While invoking that character is an effective way of portraying a sense of lost innocence amidst the trappings of the drug game, there's a reason that the Gingerbread Man isn't likely to surpass Scarface or any number of despots any time soon in terms of ubiquity-- other than ""catch me if you can,"" there's little else to the story, certainly not enough on which to base nearly an entire album. But considering that MF Grimm managed to record the first triple-album in hip-hop history from a wheelchair just last year, I wouldn't doubt his willingness to try regardless of whether it's a good idea in the first place. So to recap what you currently know: subterranean MC with an aversion to quality control releases his fourth LP in two years and it's a concept piece about an anthropomorphic gingerbread man. Does this sound like a good idea to you? The reason The Hunt for the Gingerbread Man falters is predictable-- even if you never hear this record, you can probably guess the exact way in which Grimm incorporates the title character. As was the case with Bobby Digital, ""Gingy"" acts as an incredibly thin filter for the sort of trite gangsta rhymes their creators likely see as beneath them. The awkwardly named avatar pulls bitches back to his gingerbread house, goes ""wildin' out in Candyland"" and generally runs from the law without really identifying his crimes in the first place. But other than the contemplative introspection of ""Earth"" and a few hints of racial tension with ""crackers"" over the color of his skin, Grimm traipses through his fantasy construct by contributing little resembling true insight, unless you think basing multiple tracks almost entirely on candy name-dropping (""Half Baked"", ""Gangsta Pastries""-- really) is a proper substitute. You would've thought this sort of style was properly buried the second time Ice Cube penned ""A Gangsta's Fairytale"", but then again, Grimm doesn't sound like he has much of a relationship with any hip-hop that's been created since the mid-90's anyways. That much can be gathered by the plethora of sub-Primo incorporation of vocal snippets from the likes of Method Man and Onyx with a sonic aesthetic that's indefensibly anemic for 2007. Worst of all, not since Rappin' Grandma has there been a more dispiriting appropriation of old school than the hook on ""The Fox""-- ""don't push me 'cause I'm close to the edge/ the fox tried to kill Gingerbread""-- it sounds even worse than it reads. Production-wise, the beats are so close to backpacker parody that Party Fun Action Committee can stay retired: just about everything sounds like it's been stuffed in a knapsack for the last decade, built on papery snare hits and Doom-lite snoozers that suggest Grimm spent his weekends crate digging in call centers. Even when MF pulls out a clever simile or ear-turning phrase, it gets subsumed by the sort of lockjawed, cadence-mindful spit that sounds like it predates him actually learning how to flow. Then again, you can't really call The Hunt for the Gingerbread Man a failure in the true sense of the word; this will likely be nobody's introduction to Grimm's body of work, no one's going to lose their job over its sales and there's a good chance the guy's already got his next project already mapped out. If nothing else, it's a validation of Grimm's status of underground legend, because this is the kind of record you can get away with when you have to answer only to yourself.","Subterranean MC with an aversion to quality control releases his fourth LP in two years and it's a concept piece about an anthropomorphic gingerbread man.

Dreamers-- especially those dreaming after a contradictory and untenable political system-- know the necessity of sticking together: Part of Guinea President Ahmed Sékou Touré's guard was made up of Havana's troops, and in 1965, Bembeya Jazz, Guinea's national orchestra, toured Cuba, where vocalist Aboubacar Camara supposedly brought tears to the eyes of the respected Orquesta Sensación singer Abelardo Barroso. The Syliphone Years reissues a 2004 compilation of the same name, gathering the band's singles from the 1960s and 70s recorded for the state-run Syliphone label. Bembeya's music has plenty in common with the Congolese rumba popularized by artists like Tabu Ley Rochereau and Franco in the 50s and 60s-- Sékou Touré wanted the national orchestras in Guinea to infuse a modern, popular African sound with Guinean folk music-- but the rhythms feel more skittery, the tone more nocturnal and meandering. There's plenty of hustle, but you get the sense that the wallflower beauty of Bembeya's quieter moments would leave more dance-imperative Congolese with raised eyebrows. Bembeya is at least partially distinguished by the electric guitar work of Sekou Diabaté, who did as much to make one rethink the possibilities of the instrument as D. Boon from the Minutemen or, well, the aforementioned Franco. All of these guitarists made a style out of musical diplomacy by tying together rhythmic elements within their band. When Diabaté peeks out, it's in predictable ways-- like Boon, who always played the same guitar solo-- but he doesn't often do so; it's as a liaison, not a soloist, that he's most effective. He's a rhythm guitarist, but-- and I said the same about the his playing on the African Virtuoses compilation-- the rhythm is all ornament and arpeggio rather than strum and jangle, here featuring trails of rudimentary echo and reverb. The impression is like a sky littered with stars. Bembeya never let a drone loose, but the constant interweaving and syncopation of staccato horn, guitar, percussion, and the dub-like bass voids of Mamadou Camara (which warrant special mention), make a continuum of sound. And while Bembeya's music was calculated to rally the greatest number at the lowest common denominator for the socialist cup, it's still great music to dance to (especially when one's other options, save Cuba, are the near-absolute groovelessness of North Korean pop or barrel-chested Soviet choirs). Identifying a sound or band with their place of origin-- calling them the ""sound of"" their home-- often serves as a fanfare for a lot of tenuous metaphors. And tenuous metaphors have their place, absolutely. But it's a stranger thing still to consider that Bembeya was the sound of Guinea because the government made them so. It's not often people pipe up on behalf of for Naval brass bands, though maybe they would if Naval brass bands weren't so darn square.","This compilation gathers singles recorded in the 1960s and 70s, when Bembeya Jazz National was Guinea's national orchestra; the group combined Congolese rumba with Guinea folk styles.

Dance Party in the Balkans,Alaska in Winter,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b386c0084474cd0c213b/1:1/w_160/c5f2c2b6.jpg,2007-12-04 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10920-dance-party-in-the-balkans/,Regular Beat,"Having a musician more famous than yourself appear on your record is a double-edged sword. Because Zach Condon of Beirut plays some trumpet and ukulele on Alaska in Winter's debut, it's gotten more blog hype than an album by a unfamiliar musician on a little-known label would traditionally merit. This is a boon, because Dance Party in the Balkans is subtle and idiosyncratic in a way that doesn't align with modern popular indie music's gravity and bombast. It's quite likely that this fine album would've been overlooked if not for Condon's cameos. The downside of having a built-in blog hook on your album is that, while you'll get more exposure, it will often focus solely on a dubious interpretation of this hook. One wonders if Alaska in Winter auteur Brandon Bethancourt has come to regret asking Condon, his childhood friend (not to mention Beirut collaborator Heather Trost), to play on the record, effectively branding it as a Beirut side-project in exchange for more album sales. Of course, the one song on the album that sounds really Beiruty, the drippy anthem ""Close Your Eyes-- We Are Blind"", has garnered the most attention so far. It's an anomaly, and I'll take the sputtering, richly-harmonized electro of ""The Homeless and the Hummingbirds"", the sprightly piano ballad ""Your Red Dress (Wedding Song at Cemetery)"", or the thunderous box-step of ""Rain on Every Weekend"" over it any day. While Bethancourt and Condon share a fondness for woozy brass and sinuous gypsy strains, their music is drastically different at structural and aesthetic levels. Dance Party in the Balkans hybridizes a far-flung variety of forms into chilly, beat-oriented, downtempo hymns: amorous Balkan strings, the melismatic vocal tapestries of classical Arabian music (often so gently vocoder-kissed as to sound more spectral than robotic), icily splintered piano loops (which are actually played live), skittering hip-hop percussion (ditto), and soaringly simple indie pop melodies obscured in an atmospheric haze. The voices droning through the splashy percussion and glacial pianos of ""Twenty Four Hours in Lake of Ice"" sound like they haven't seen the sun in some time, a semse that persists through the more abstract, less rhythmic half of the songs. It's difficult to overemphasize the pervasive chill that hovers, paradoxically, around the album's warm melodies: Even its most luridly romantic moments sound remote and contemplative. The unfortunately-titled ""Lovely Lovely Love"" is such a moment, and among the record's highlights: a swelling, non-instrumental sound-alike of Imogen Heap's ""Hide and Seek"" for the indie rock set. Where Condon's voice soars over Beirut's music, Bethancourt's nestles into his own, which partially explains the chilliness. Also, he recorded most of the music in Alaska, in winter, before returning to New Mexico to flesh it out. After you check out the Iditarod and the aurora borealis, there's not much to do besides hole up with your music and think about how freaking cold it is. The album's resistance to pop structures is another key to its aloofness-- instead, the arrangements tend toward the incantatory, the fugal, the intuitive drive forward. Hooks last for entire songs (see the tense, cyclical piano figure undergirding the lyrical strings on ""Balkan Lowrider Anthem"") or never appear at all (see the stately dirge ""The Beautiful Burial Flowers We Will Never See""), lending a sense of gusty expanse to an album pinioned by taut rhythms. This is suburban low-riding music at its most self-aware: a far cry from Beirut's guitar-intensive chamber music.","Beirut pal and Alaska in Winter auteur Brandon Bethancourt hybridizes a far-flung variety of forms into chilly, beat-oriented, downtempo hymns.

Free's been mostly out of the public eye since that record, embarking on a pilgrimage to Mecca and doubtlessly listening to The B. Coming hundreds of times. He's probably pissed that his former mentor, Beanie Sigel, came up with the ""I still spit gangsta, think Muslim, and act Catholic"" line first, but beyond that, you get the sense on his long-awaited follow-up Free at Last that he's trying to make a similar record-- one that's alternately boastful and ruminative, and on which he mostly avoids those misguided attempts to become a crossover star. Free at Last also marks a shift away from the commercial behind the boards, with-- as he moans about on ""It's Over""-- Freeway neither working with Just Blaze nor Kanye West, who between them produced three-fourths of Philadelphia Freeway. Instead, like a lot of Roc-A-Fella records, Free at Last employs sweeping soul loops and it's content to forgo a hook when the source material will do just fine. Though it isn't as opulent or expansive as Jay-Z's American Gangster, Freeway is still in some pretty tony real estate, with the live percussion of the orchestral ""When They Remember"" and ""Reppin' the Streets"" both flirting with Ghostface levels of classic soul. Freeway's first album since 2003, Free at Last unsurprisingly often nods to the salad days of Roc-A-Fella, with the MC frequently decorating his verses with Sigel and Jigga quotes. ""This Can't Be Real"" catches you up to speed (""They say Free's nekkid/ He won't sell another record/ Y'all talkin' reckless!"") with enough ambivalence to rise above rumor mongering, and on single ""Roc-A-Fella Billionaires""-- a maddeningly catchy tribute to outlandish buying-- you can hear the difference between new money's hunger and the shit-eating satisfaction of CEO wealth as Jay-Z simply flips his ""Dirt Off Your Shoulder"" flow while detailing his spending habits (""I just copped me of all things/ A professional ball team""). Throughout Free at Last, Freeway displays a deft ability to play the foil to less exuberant MCs, with the exception of a firebreathing Busta Rhymes cameo on ""Walk With Me"". Free's intensity can be a lot to take in one sitting, which is why guest spots from Jay-Z, Jadakiss, and Scarface feel like the work of crafty sequencing. (Unfortunately, Lil Wayne collaboration ""Step Back"", once marked for the record, has gone missing.) Whatever religious enlightenment Freeway culled during his time off doesn't seem to translate to anything here, but his braying hood laments mix well with a typically sage Scarface verse on ""Baby Don't Do It"", as the Houston MC laments ""I don't wanna be another joke/ 55, doing concerts, relying on the shows."" Listeners can guess which collaborations are skip-worthy from the tracklist alone. ""Executive Producer"" 50 Cent looms large over the mid-album trough of ""Take It To The Top"" and ""Spit That Shit"", temporarily turning Freeway into a G-Unit club connoisseur. Meanwhile, Cool & Dre's coke-cutting synths on ""Lights Get Low"" stand poorly in opposition of every other sound on the album and a Rick Ross appearance is a year too late to inspire anything other than wisecracks about hip-hop's most accomplished beards. By the brief closer, ""I Cry"", Freeway finally gives into his emo-rapness, lamenting a life's story of woes, from having his G.I. Joe's go missing to being incarcerated during his daughter's birth. It's his voice more than his lyrics that has made him seem like an open book, but the title of this album isn't a mere play on words or a reference to his lengthy between-album hiatus; Free at Last is a portrait of someone who's still discovering his own identity.","After a lengthy hiatus, the distinctive MC returns with a record reminiscent of Beanie Sigel's The B. Coming, one that's alternately boastful and ruminative, and on which he mostly avoids misguided attempts to become a crossover star. Jay-Z, Scarface, Jadakiss, and 50 Cent all guest.

Time for Heroes: The Best of The Libertines,The Libertines,by: Stephen Trouss,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3b413d197565213a9ad/1:1/w_160/89623d9a.jpg,2007-12-04 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10959-time-for-heroes-the-best-of-the-libertines/,Rough Trade,"Three years after they cracked up and fell apart, the Libertines' greatest hits arrives as confirmation that the group's tempestuous career wasn't simply a two-year collective British hallucination. It really did happen-- the desperation, ambition, hysteria, celebrity, notoriety, tears, reconciliation, love, and squalor, but I'm not sure how much of that you can hear on this 13-track souvenir. It's become a critical commonplace to insist, in a Brian Eno kind of way, that pop is less about simply making music than about creating a world, and the Libertines are a test-case in just how far you can push this. The Libertines were conceived from the start as a well-read critical wet-dream of the perfect post-Strokes British pop group. If the Manic Street Preachers found a ready-made reading list and manifesto in Greil Marcus's punk fantasia Lipstick Traces, the Libertines claimed a similar touchstone in Michael Bracewell's England Is Mine. Bracewell's history craftily charted the wistfully utopian impulse in English art from the Brontes to the Smiths, via Oscar Wilde, Powell & Pressburger, Mark E. Smith, and Kate Bush. And self-proclaimed inheritors Pete Doherty and Carl Barât delighted quote-hungry hacks with their talk of ""sailing the good ship Albion to Arcadia."" The group's Bernard Butler-produced, Jam-indebted debut single ""What a Waster"" went a little way to walking the walk-- it's a tumbling, shambolic tale of visionary rent boys and crackwhores, whose diaries read like ""the Beano or the unabridged Ulysses,"" and which most came to life when Barât spat the lines ""what a divvy, what a fucking div"" with gusto and relish. Placed midway through this compilation's untimely running order, it still sounds like the greatest thing they ever recorded. Listening to the rest of Time for Heroes, even to indie disco standards like ""Don't Look Back Into The Sun"" and ""Can't Stand Me Now"", it feels like the band succeeded in spite of the half-assed meagerness of their music. They opted for Mick Jones to helm their subsequent records, vainly hoping that some of the Clash's panache might rub off, but Jones' slack production only hindered the group. His scuffling skiffle sound-- tinny and tame-- gazes up at the Only Ones' heroin-fueled star but is happier lying in the gutter. And for hotshot pop poet laureates, they scarcely scraped together another couplet worth quoting. ""There are few more distressing sights than that/ Of an Englishman in a baseball cap"" they sing on ""Time For Heroes""-- which may have inspired a generation of indie kids to don their dad's old trilbies, but ain't exactly Coleridge. No, the Libertines' strength lay less in music than in their sense of the possibilities for self-mythology. Particularly in the gossipy village of the UK, pop has been been knitted ever tighter into a modern entertainment-media complex, and the Libertines worked this like grandmasters. The daily sordid soap opera of the group-- as broadcast and narrowcast, downloaded and dreamed up through newspapers and message boards-- is much more compelling than any of the music they made. Eventually, in songs like ""What Became of the Likely Lads?"", it devolved into their only subject. Doherty and Kate Moss became the couple for a moment when indie and pop, glamor and squalor, NME and Heat magazines finally merged in the echo chamber of modern celebrity. Indeed, it could be that the greatest pieces of art associated with the band are actually Roger Sargent's photographs, as featured on the sleeves both of this collection and of the self-titled second album. These richly suggestive stills staged the band as heirs to the rock tradition of Brian Jones, Sid Vicious, Richey Manic...figures who in some ways owned their respective bands through odd charisma and enigmatic intensity. Except while their predecessors were iconic adjuncts or supplements to the music, with the Libertines that's practically all there was, and the records feel like an incidental part of their pop world. It seems odd to deny how potent and powerfully compelling the spectacle of the Libertines has proved. But without a single or song strong enough to carry them beyond their pop moment, you wonder whether their presence will inevitably dwindle beneath the homage of their fans and pale imitators. As Barât and Doherty must surely know, there is no future in England's dreaming.","Three years after the band's dissolution, Time for Heroes cherrypicks the Libertines' singles, B-sides and fan favorites, but digs up no real novelties, and suggests a group mythically rich but musically meager.

The London Book of the Dead,The Real Tuesday Weld,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b383c0084474cd0c2136/1:1/w_160/3d00fcd4.jpg,2007-12-03 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10916-the-london-book-of-the-dead/,Six Degrees,"Over a handful of full-length releases, UK singer-songwriter Stephen Coates has established the template of the Real Tuesday Weld: a foggy concoction of cocktail-soaked big band, ragtime, lounge, bluegrass, and, improbably, electronic pop. This is typically dolloped with the archness of Stephin Merritt or Momus. Last time around, on The Return of the Clerkenwell Kid, the Weld's world also involved an alter ego, Clerkenwell's eponymous Kid. On The London Book of the Dead, all of Coates' typical foibles remain in place, but the alter ego has been replaced by a sort of Tibetan Book of the Dead for London. Um, as implied by the album title. Borrowing the Bardo Thodol's soul-passing-through-life narrative arc was probably helpful in organizing the album, but it chokes the songs a bit, making for some overly concept-driven experiences that, again, remain all too familiar. Still, the Real Tuesday Weld's ambitious, anachronistic whimsy is an all too rare commodity in pop, particularly because Coates never deigns to remove the yawning distance between singer and narrator. Where the ideas don't always pay off, the strikingly old-fashioned arrangements and the production and songwriting updating them still make for some unusual and rewarding juxtapositions. ""I wrote this song long before the war,"" Coates croons on ""It's a Wonderful Li(f)e"", and of course he could mean any conflict from World War II to the current situation in Iraq. The track is a highlight of The London Book of the Dead, summing up its contradictions. Its slow, swinging horn samples and bright piano set up a tale that obviously isn't Frank Capra. Constantly invoking the title pun, Coates' mordancy cuts through: ""I'll say you're beautiful, when you're not beautiful."" Oh but my mom says I gots inner beauty. The basic conceit of the album means it begins, more or less, with birth and ends, more or less, with death. ""Life is good when you're feeling love"" and ""when you're filled with blood"" both, Coates sings through oily-water effects on opener ""Blood Sugar Love"", with its dinky electronics, bassoon, and arpeggios. The tune is unnecessarily reprised at the end of funereal waltz ""Bringing the Body Back Home"", which has more horns, bells, and stately drum rolls, about someone who's ""reached the end of your love""-- but ""love was the one thing worth living for,"" we're told, as UFO synths, bluegrass fiddle, and jazzy piano make it hard to tell which part's ironic. Andrews Sisters-style female harmonies wrap up too-brief closer ""Apart"". Less concept-heavy songs are mostly light and amusing fare: the cynical, debonair Cole Porter parody ""Kix"", the completely 21st century (except for its writerly subject) lap-pop with acoustic guitar of ""Dorothy Parker"", or the dreary ""I Love London"", which could've been one of Paul McCartney's Tin Pan Alley nods if not for its anti-romanticism and lyrics about crack dealers. The scat-driven ""Cloud Cuckooland"", which sounds like little more than a revamp of the Real Tuesday Weld's highly memorable 2004 video selection ""Bathtime in Clerkenwell"", is more trying, though, as are a few stifling instrumental or nearly instrumental interludes. It's on jaunty ""I Believe"", however, that Coates sums himself up best: ""Yeah, I believe in people who I believe believe in love."" There's a fine album here, but it's a few degrees of separation removed.","With the archness of Stephin Merritt or Momus, UK singer-songwriter Stephen Coates delivers a foggy concoction of cocktail-soaked big band, ragtime, lounge, bluegrass, and electronic pop.

Collected Works,A Mountain of One,by: Tim Finney,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b382c0084474cd0c2133/1:1/w_160/7bc181d6.jpg,2007-12-03 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10915-collected-works/,Mountain,"It's a mark of the curiousness of A Mountain of One's music that my attempts to compliment them frequently come out sounding decidedly ambivalent. Like: imagine the spectral post-rock of Bark Psychosis's Hex with all the sharp edges massaged away. Or: it's swirling Balearic rock infused with the earnest pomp of Mike and the Mechanics. Perhaps it's just in the nature of this UK group to resist any straightforward way of approaching them. On this collection of their releases to date (two EPs and two new compositions), their music can be as alienating as it is enticing, but unlike the legions of noisy punk or freak-folk bands that walk this same fine line, it's an obscene taste for beauty that can add a slightly sickly edge to Collected Works' seductiveness. A Mountain of One exist in the same ""nu Balearic"" interzone as Swedish duo Studio, albeit with a less clearly pronounced debt to dance music. Yes, they dabble in Tangerine Dream-style synth wanderings, in drowsy disco rhythms, and even in pomo sampling-- but then, the Verve did that too once. And the Verve is not a bad point of comparison for much of this music, not least because the two bands share a wide-eyed stargazer quality and psych-cum-soft-rock lushness. More insidiously, if A Mountain of One follow the Verve in becoming a ubiquitous rock music choice for dance fans, it will be as much because they embody what dance fans often presume to be the point of rock (the heightened role of performance, the appearance of lyrical depth... perhaps just its alleged capacity for meaning it, man) as because of their formal similarities to dance music (electronic brushstrokes and voluptuous over-production). Tenuous though it is, this line of communication with dance music remains the key to A Mountain of One's success. On their first and better EP, the group is captured poised in the space between project and band. Already they flaunt a decidedly spiritual edge on the urgent acoustic strum of ""Ride"", and in the ghostly and magical power-ballad ""Freefall"", which has the inspired idea of splitting the difference between the Blue Nile and 10cc-– the singer's gentle, resonant falsetto perhaps never having known hoarseness. But such gestures feel primarily aesthetic, as if A Mountain of One love rock music mostly for the sheer sonic loveliness of its serious vocals and soaring choruses. And these moments are balanced by more mysterious pieces, like the mélange of piano chords and operatic vocals on ""Our Eyes"", or the marvelous Italo-disco cover ""Can't Be Serious"", which features Martina Topley-Bird's fragile voice over a whimsical disco groove that becomes progressively overshadowed by a chorus of moaning guitars. The band's second EP falls back slightly from such heights by pursuing a less ambiguous spiritual argument: with its endlessly spiraling guitar lines, distantly rumbling percussion and close-harmonizing chorus vocals, the epic ""Innocent Line"" offers a such a decadently reverent sound that it calls to mind the orgiastic musical climaxes of Pentecostal mega-churches. It's not a question of whether A Mountain of One believe in the brand of rococo spiritualism they evoke, but rather whether the song can support the amassed weight of meaning and significance invested in it. Such is the transformative promise of ""Innocent Line"", together with its even more overblown instrumental companion, ""Innocent Reprise"", that disappointment becomes almost inevitable (this may be overstating it: later on ""Arc of Abraham"" treads a very similar line, yet its intoxicating air of mystery saves it from drowning in a sea of pomp). Perhaps such pitfalls are a necessary part of A Mountain of One's considerable charms. Collected Works feels uncomfortably fervent at its best as much as its worst: the difference is that between the carefully stage-managed grandeur of the massive church service, and the quiet, inscrutable awe inspired by an abandoned cathedral. Perhaps this music is most affecting not when it speaks to us directly, but rather when it speaks to and about itself: on the astonishing ""People Without Love"", the band introduce a street zealot's rant to a glorious loop from Fleetwood Mac's ""Caroline"", and then surrounds them with layers of shimmering synthesizers and wistful guitar. The song moves from fiery certainty towards a tentativeness that is beguiling, more fragile hymn than rousing congregational chorus. In this solitary uncertainty lies A Mountain of One's most promising future-- and anyway, the congregations hardly need them.","As they dabble in Tangerine Dream-style synth wanderings, drowsy disco rhythms, and pomo sampling, this UK band exists in roughly the same interzone as Swedish duo Studio, albeit with a less clearly pronounced debt to dance music.

8,Supersilent,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a09413d1975652138407/1:1/w_160/3dc44910.jpg,2007-12-03 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10903-8/,Rune Grammofon,"When Supersilent advertise that they record live in the studio-- or rather, when other people advertise it for them-- it's not a boast. Sure, rock bands who just let the tapes roll are doing something special, but that's because rock bands fuck up a lot, and because they want you to think those perfect hooks just came out of thin air, like a miracle. But in the world of jazz and improvised music, it's just another day at the studio. Supersilent don't make any great show of technique, and you'll have no problem believing that only four guys are making this music. And it's not about catching a moment, but arguing a fundamental point-- by presenting the music with as few sweeteners, as few distractions, and as little bullshit as possible. Norwegians are not great bullshitters. I've had Thanksgiving dinners with Scandinavian-Americans who enjoyed their meals in supersilence: small talk is a waste. And while it's true that Norway has plenty of raucous and goofy bands, Supersilent captures the graver side of the nation's character. Like their first seven albums, 8 has no song titles or liner notes. You'll never see them name a song ""Audio Virus Blues"" or ""Helge the Spaceman"". They never telegraph what they're doing before they sit down and do it. Yet even by Supersilent's austere standards, 8 is hard to latch onto: less rhythmic and frenetic than 1-3 or 4, more aggressive than 5, and the best proof yet that 6-- the most accessible record in their catalog-- was an anomaly: its repeated motifs, engrossing textures and snatches of beauty were gimmes compared to this set, which is sludgy, irregular and unwavering, an electroacoustic behemoth lumbering beneath your house. (Be sure to listen to it with a good subwoofer: cram it into iPod earbuds and you'll miss half the story.) It's also one of their most satisfying records. A low level of tension keeps you on edge, even during the ballad-like ""8.4"" or the serene close of ""8.5"", where Arve Henriksen's trumpet strokes the mellotron's forehead like a mother . On the drum kit, Jarle Vespestad obviously isn't here to keep time; instead he demonstrates, like Phil Selway on Kid A, that grim soundscapes are a smart drummer's playground. And producer and noisemaker Helge Sten, aka Deathprod-- whose name is the only corny thing about the band-- adds unidentified electronics and noisemakers, and one of his chief goals seems to be to make the hackles on your neck rise without your even noticing. The balance between the four members remains unbreachable. At the close of ""8.3"", Storløkken's brash analog keyboard tries to organize the clatter and buzz from the other three, but it's hard to tell when he suggests a conclusion if anyone will follow his cue; and in ""8.6"", Henriksen's falsetto suggests monk-like tranquility into the piece, but the other guys are having none of it: unlike 6's ""6.6"", where they let his voice reign idyllically, here he's cast aside like a man saying prayers in rush hour. Likewise, when they almost settle into a conventional groove on ""8.5"", you feel like it could end at any moment; Sten's fuzz guitar keeps them unsettled, until for a few transfixing moments it rears up and roars-- and then sinks again so subtly you can barely tell what you just heard. There's no small talk, because small talk would be distracting, disingenous, and would cover up what's in their minds and hearts-- which is what 8 delivers, pared to its most honest form. Why waste a single breath?","Less rhythmic and frenetic than 1-3 or 4, more aggressive than 5, and the best proof yet that 6-- the most accessible record in their catalog-- was an anomaly, this is another austere, rewarding record from Arve Henriksen's Scandinavian collective.

B/E/A/T/B/O/X,Glass Candy,by: Andrew Gaerig,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b396ea9e61561daa6afd/1:1/w_160/427c2243.jpg,2007-12-03 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10932-beatbox/,Italians Do It Better,"The dirty little secret of this year's excellent After Dark compilation is that its flagship act, Glass Candy, kinda sorta got shown up. The duo of Johnny Jewel and Ida No still seems earmarked for (relative) stardom, but their Italians Do It Better labelmates carried them on the imprint's coming-out party. Of course, judging Glass Candy on just four singles/outtakes-- three of which were covers-- is unfair, especially considering that Johnny Jewel also does time with The Chromatics and Farah, two of the compilation's standout artists. In his review of the record, Marc Hogan suggested that a fair amount of reverence for their source material might've been at play in Glass Candy's timorous After Dark contributions, which would explain the chasm between those tracks and the more adrenaline-jacked B/E/A/T/B/O/X. A fall tour exclusive (currently available in limited quantities through the Troubleman Unlimited website), B/E/A/T/B/O/X is hardly a stopgap. Including robust re-recordings of After Dark's ""Rolling Down the Hills"" and Kraftwerk cover ""Computer Love"", the disc's nine tracks collectively offer more than 40 minutes of exclusive material. And while it's possible that some of these tracks might be slated for an upcoming full-length, B/E/A/T/B/O/X marks a premature reward of Glass Candy's accruing buzz. It's useless to try and bullshit you into believing that the stylized no-wave of Glass Candy's 2003 debut, Love Love Love, has anything more than a perfunctory effect on the band's current sound, but B/E/A/T/B/O/X does suggest a carryover of certain values: a terse, unflinching attitude and an economy of arrangement, if not track length. Like Alison Goldfrapp, Ida No retains an empowering lack of self-consciousness even as she deploys the tact and patience of a pop singer. Jewel, meanwhile, places No's instincts in measured relief; tracks boil over with bass sequencers and 4/4 kicks. One stray synth is permitted a melody line, and the ratio of treble to bass is inverted only occasionally. No isn't sexless or prude, though the echo on her voice suggests that you need not apply. Her star is born through physical inaccessibility and the fact that she's better friends with the DJ than you; it's enough. This is a joint effort, though. ""Candy Castle"" features a Mannie Fresh-like synth-trumpet compounded by lusty runs on Jewel's sequencer and No's abstract lyrics, which in turn are augmented by wordless sighs draped in reverb. ""Life After Sundown"" begins as a tribute to the linear electro vibe of Italo-disco forbears but slowly falls into orbit around No's indistinguishable refrain. Instrumental ""Last Nite I Met a Costume"" seems born of austere, alien reel-to-reel video and it sets the table for closer ""Digital Veriscolor"", a tour de force of kraut-inspired groovemaking and hissed coos. B/E/A/T/B/O/X is a primer, to be sure, but it's a strong one beset with an LP's length and signifiers (an intro, strong sequencing, the penultimate instrumental). Glass Candy's previous false starts can now be dismissed as pulled punches, or a band in its genesis; either way, this record marks a flat-out improvement. B/E/A/T/B/O/X informally dashes Glass Candy as ""OMG punks w/ synths"" and officially announces Glass Candy: aggressive, formidable beat-mongerers.","A fall-tour exclusive (currently available in limited quantities through the Troubleman Unlimited website), B/E/A/T/B/O/X boasts nine tracks and over 40 minutes of exclusive material from one of the Italians Do It Better label's flagship artists.

The Joshua Tree: Deluxe Edition,U2,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3acea9e61561daa6b24/1:1/w_160/2c9782d3.jpg,2007-12-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10953-the-joshua-tree-deluxe-edition/,Interscope,"U2 started out as a scrappy band riding the punk wave out of Ireland, but from the beginning they clearly had their sights on America. And indeed, the States ate up U2's bombast, landing both War (1983) and The Unforgettable Fire (1984) in the U.S. top 20. The group fed off that enthusiasm, criss-crossing the country as much as its schedule allowed. The more the band's fan base grew, the harder U2 worked to get even bigger, and in 1987 they enjoyed their breakthrough into superstadom thanks to The Joshua Tree, which went on to sell 10 million copies in the U.S. alone. Funnily enough, while The Joshua Tree once and for all catapulted U2 to permanent superstardom, the album marks something of a conscious refinement of the group's sound. The album was nowhere near as strident as War or as radically overwrought as The Unforgettable Fire (which was, lest one forget, recorded in a frickin' castle). Reunited with producers Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno, it's as if the band finally took a moment to ponder the wide-open American spaces it had been traveling through for years and applied those musical and cultural observations to its songs. It's an album made for dusty, empty flyover country. U2 have always flirted with charismatic Christianity, and the Joshua Tree songwriting process finds the band in a particularly reflective mood; ""I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"" and"" ""With or Without You"" are steeped in religious imagery, but even their constant radio rotation hasn't robbed these introspective songs of their potency or effectiveness. Smartly, U2 balanced those personal songs with more universal tracks, often with an emphasis on forgotten people and forgotten places around the globe: ""Red Hill Mining Town"" (about the mid-80s UK miners strike), ""Exit"" (inspired by Norman Mailer's Gary Gilmore tome The Executioner's Song), ""Mothers of the Disappeared"" (about Argentina's murdered political dissidents), and ""Bullet the Blue Sky"" (about U.S. meddling in Central America). ""Bullet"" is one of the few Joshua Tree non-singles to remain a live U2 staple-- its bluster hints at the band's current broad aesthetic-- but it's slightly out of place among a record mostly characterized by its grace, subtlety, introspection, and beauty. That holds especially true for its more mysterious (or at least less overplayed) second half, which roughly begins and ends perfectly with the ballad ""Running to Stand Still"" (about heroin addiction) and gentle outro ""Mothers of the Disappeared"". In between, ""Trip Through Your Wires"" is the rare blues track to prominently feature co-producer Eno's favored novelty, the Omnichord, while ""One Tree Hill"" and the apocalyptic ""Exit"" showcase wickedly screwed up and uncharacteristic guitar solos from the Edge. No question, the disc deserves this anniversary treatment, but other U2 albums need the remastering more. As for the 14-tracks disc of B-sides and extras, it's best to keep expectations firmly in check. U2 aren't known for hiding away gems, or for that matter, sharing their studio experiments-- not even the reggae-tinged version of ""I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"" shows up here. What we get instead is mostly the usual array of previously released tracks and familiar rarities-- best among them are ""Spanish Eyes"", ""Silver and Gold"", the original version of ""The Sweetest Thing"", and ""Deep in the Heart""-- plus a handful of tracks new even to hardcore fans. Of those, ""Beautiful Ghost/Introduction to Songs of Experience"" and ""Drunk Chicken/America"" are moody spoken word pieces. The Patti Smith-styled ""Wave of Sorrow (Birdland)"" is similarly a bit out of character for the band, which explains what it's doing here. While the haters were already on board, it was with its next album, Rattle and Hum, that the group's egos finally overtook their ambitions, and it took a near fatal break and the resounding triumph Achtung Baby to set the band back on track. But to this day U2 's Joshua Tree breakthrough-- and, in particular, Bono's insistence on living up to the messianic role his fans and admires foisted upon him-- still resonates as a lingering source of scorn, suspiciousness, and ridicule. If you don't doubt that, then try to sit through the (videotaped, not filmed) July 4, 1987 concert at an outdoor venue in Paris, the 40-minute Outside It's America documentary, and the music videos stuffed onto the set's DVD. About the only remarkable thing about the concert is that it starts with ""I Will Follow"" rather than ""Where the Streets Have No Name"". As for the doc, it plays like a Rattle and Hum test run that will leave you throwing things at your screen as the band goes shopping, signs autographs, and poses for photos. There is, however, a rare glimpse of U2's sense of humor that teases their future neo-ironic rebirth hidden on the DVD: footage of the fames Dalton Brothers, the band's country alter-egos, who opened a few dates on the Joshua Tree tour (replete with Adam Clayton in drag). But after a couple of minutes of their shtick, you'll want to throw stuff at them, too.","Twenty years ago, U2 graduated to superstardom with The Joshua Tree, an album that's survived all those years in the spotlight as a masterpiece. Now the disc gets the requisite set of B-sides and rarities, plus a DVD.

Through the Wilderness: A Tribute to Madonna,Various Artists,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3955e6ef9596932249a/1:1/w_160/4906cfe6.jpg,2007-11-30 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10931-through-the-wilderness-a-tribute-to-madonna/,Manimal Vinyl,"Madonna is an ideal candidate for the tribute album treatment, having already inspired several in the past but none quite as sturdy or as much fun as Through the Wilderness, proceeds from which will benefit the charity Raising Malawi. Despite having a string of smart hits throughout the the past three decades, she doesn't inspire the same reverence as other icons often do, allowing the artists on Through the Wilderness to freely reinvent these songs in much the same way that Madonna continues to freely reinvent herself. From album to album, she changed her hair color, her style, her sound, even her identity at will; likewise, these indie acts-- including Lavender Diamond and Giant Drag-- change up lyrics, drop out lines, refashion melodies, and re-interpret meanings, with no regard for re-creating a particular sound or aesthetic. Even though it covers her career from ""Everybody"" through ""Hung Up""-- and even though the tracklist would make a great Madonna best-of-- Through the Wilderness doesn't get bogged down in musical proselytizing or cultural weight-shifting. No one here has to argue for Madonna as a serious artist or legitimate influence, precisely because no one here seems to feel that such an argument needs to be made. The motion in Madonna's songs makes them sound all the more exotic today, inspiring some crafty synth-pop covers on Through the Wilderness. Several acts, like Jeremy Jay and Ariel Pink, ably conjure the dark emptiness of postpunk with their homemade versions of ""Into the Groove"" and ""Everybody"", respectively, evoking Madonna's decade without copying her music. In fact, as an audiovisual experiment, I synched up Mountain Party's gloomily grandiloquent ""Material Girl"" with Anton Corbijn's clip for Propaganda's ""Dr. Mabuse""-- perhaps the ultimate postpunk-into-new-wave video. The two matched up creepily and nearly perfectly, despite the one-minute difference between them. While some acts see the titular wilderness as a post-industrial wasteland, others interpret it as though the title refers to Death Valley and turn Madonna's hits into dusty California guitar nuggets. Golden Animals drop out the chorus and rewrite ""Beautiful Stranger (Blues)"" as Creedence Clearwater Revival swamp blues, and Alexandra Hope makes ""Lucky Star"" into a chipper freakfolk number. Lion of Panjshir render ""Crazy for You"" with tabla, sitar, and acoustic strums, but lose none of the song's erotic spark, thanks to Ariana Delawari's bold and breathy performance. There are, of course, a few uninspired readings; every tribute has them. Giant Drag's timid, note-for-note reading of ""Oh Father"" is, well, a giant drag, and ""Who's That Girl?"" is beyond Bubonic Plague's ability to salvage it, although I imagine few artists could. Conversely, the stand-outs on Through the Wilderness sound so good and so natural that you might be convinced these are the originals that Madonna covered so long ago. The Winter Flowers-- based in Misty Mountain Top, Calif., of course-- give ""Live to Tell"" the CSNY treatment, complete with desert sunset atmosphere, noodly guitar fills, epic solos, and gorgeous harmonies sung by Astrid Quay and Gavin Toler. And, as another audiovisual experiment, I synched up Madonna's video for ""Cherish"" with the Prayers' cover, which transcends its straightforward reading with an ebullient boppiness. It didn't work at all, but at least you can still dance to it.","Artists such as Lavender Diamond, Giant Drag, Ariel Pink, and Jeremy Jay take turns covering Madonna with proceeds going to charity Raising Malawi.

Jukebox Explosion Rockin' Mid-90s Punkers!,The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion,by: Andrew Gaerig,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b35e5e6ef9596932244a/1:1/w_160/b254a32b.jpg,2007-11-30 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10884-jukebox-explosion-rockin-mid-90s-punkers/,In the Red,"Jon Spencer realized long ago that trying to engage the Stones or the Stooges or Howlin' Wolf intellectually is a fool's errand. Spencer is a better racketeer and guitarist than capital-A artist, so he apes their style while holding their complexities in open contempt. Jukebox Explosion Rockin' Mid-90s Punkers!, a collection of In the Red singles and a handful of rarities, speaks to Spencer's sense of history and controlled irreverence. The packaging for Jukebox is like that of any blues comp: fuzzy photographs and humble anachronisms. Uncut sheets of 7"" labels are strewn about, and there's a warning about surface noise from the vinyl transfer-- vinyl released to mimic a series of singles by rockabilly legend Charlie Feathers. Collecting five 7""'s released by In the Red and adding eight additional tracks, Jukebox does nothing to show Spencer's range-- he had little-- and no summation of his career would take Jukebox's 50 minutes. What Jukebox does do, at least moreso than Spencer's Matador albums, is highlight JSBX's bilious competitive streak. Do not pit two minutes of your music against the JSBX; they will fucking hurt you. The In the Red issues are the most righteously contentious: rancorous spurts like ""Shirt Jac"" and ""Bent"" are mainline fury, though the sluttish horn on ""Son of Sam"" and barroom piano on ""Get With It"" point towards the well-worn dynamics the band would quietly accumulate. The four-minute Orange outtake ""Showgirl Pts 1 & 2"" is Jukebox's most thrilling entry. With Cristina Martinez (Pussy Galore, Boss Hog, Mrs. Jon Spencer) whispering in the background, wailing blues chords war with whistling synths. Spencer screams ""Fuck! I ain't goin' out like that...Wake up!"". Pity they didn't aim at this experimental-cum-blues-noir more often. ""Do Ya Wanna Get It"" features Dr. John on piano and gives the idea of what kind of firepower Spencer might carry should you decide to, um, actually engage him in musical battle. The hilariously annotated notes, though not written by Spencer, play up the band's reputation, recounting how the ""pussy"" Caroline label threatened to sue over a song bearing its name. ""Dig My Shit"" was originally available ""on an otherwise completely worthless compilation on Matador Records"". Jukebox's cover features a zombie JSBX shoveling dirt on crudely labeled records (Oasis! Pixies!). None of this is meant to disguise the fact that Spencer has been playing one song, at slightly varying tempos, since 1985, and that this song has mostly gotten worse with age. The fifth In the Red single cut during the Plastic Fangs sessions, ""Ghetto Mom"" / ""Do Ya Wanna Get It"" is by some margin the weakest material here. Jukebox's arcane sequencing-- on which A-sides are separated from B's and a bizarre assortment of rarities are inserted at random-- does the collection no favors. Do not, though, make the mistake of backing the wrong dog in this fight; Spencer knew exactly what he was doing. Submitting a single to In the Red, he scribbled, ""The songs are short...So make this fucker loud!...Print labels silver on deep/navy blue if possible. Big holes."" Now them's fightin' words.","This collection of In the Red singles and a handful of rarities speaks to Spencer's sense of history and controlled irreverence.

X,Kylie Minogue,by: Tom Ewing,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3a6ea9e61561daa6b16/1:1/w_160/0bf5ae12.jpg,2007-11-30 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10947-x/,ParlophoneCapitol,"The best summary of Kylie Minogue comes from Grant Morrison's 1992 Zenith comic: ""Kylie is Vera Lynn for Third World War,"" yelled an eight-foot raver robot, and though nobody knew it then he was right. Like 1940s siren Dame Vera, she's one of Britain's most beloved entertainers, a comforting fixity in the pop firmament. But since 2001's career-defining ""Can't Get You Out Of My Head"", there's also an expectation that she'll play the futurist, define pop's leading edge. X, her comeback album after a fight against cancer, doesn't always succeed in balancing these two Minogues. When Minogue's irrepressible teen chirp dominated Britain's charts in the late-80s, critics deplored her even while conceding that she herself was a likable personality. Minogue's career has often seemed a series of attempts to expand on this basic likability-- to add sex, or credibility, or modernism to the mix. The main barrier is generally her voice: Thin, slightly nasal, and prone to strain, it's a 128 kbps instrument in a 320 kpbs world. Minogue has usually been skillful enough to pick material that suits it, however. ""2 Hearts"", X's first single, is a fine example: An electro-rock vamp gesturing toward Goldfrapp, it's built around heavy piano rolls that give the track some bottom and Minogue freedom to hiss and slink. ""2 Hearts"" ticks all the Minogue comeback boxes-- it's an unexpected stylistic move, it plays to her strengths, it's not copying herself or her close peers. It also, unfortunately, sounds like nothing else on X, which hops around searching for a sound it's comfortable with. X can seem like a revision primer for Minogue fans who've ignored the past few years of chart pop-- here's a bit of Gwen Stefani-style clockwork playground pop; here's some nu-Britney Spears cut-ups; here's some Sugababes sultriness. Here's electro-disco, cosmic disco, and just plain disco disco, plus nods to 1980s street dance and 00s r&b. If she'd thrown in a ska sample and cockney accent we'd have the whole contemporary UK pop scene on a single CD. As you'd expect, not all of these styles suit her. ""Heart Beat Rock"", for instance, has fizzy Neptunes keyboards and a hot, stuttering beat. But the half-spoken lyrics need more sass than Minogue can give. Stefani giggling ""I can make your heartbeat rock"" might have been convincing-- Minogue just sounds twee. When that track ends and ""The One""' shimmers gloriously in with New Order guitars and morse-code synths, the return to 4/4 dance-pop brings an almost tangible inrush of confidence. ""I'm the One-- love me love me love me,"" she sings, and for these four minutes she is and we do. This kind of unfussy, hook-first music is what Minogue has always been best at, and back in her comfort zone she thrives. In fact-- ""2 Hearts"" aside-- X's best tracks recall earlier victories. The heart of ""No More Rain"" is a hushed and lovely meditation on life's prettiness, like Minogue's haunting 2005 track ""Made of Glass"". Calvin Harris' production on ""In My Arms"" is like a cassette player version of Justice-- all hiss and stickytape-- but Minogue's roots were in cheap Xerox pop and she bounces around the tune with gusto. Other songs see good ideas more clumsily executed. A Serge Gainsbourg sample makes ""Sensitized"" swing harder than anything else on X, but Minogue doesn't have the vocal power to match it. ""Speakerphone"" starts off with a tantalizing harp figure, then bundles it to the back of the mix assuming we'd prefer a Daft Punk retread instead. ""Nu-Di-Ty"" boasts the same writers, and the same sliced-up vocal treatments, as some of Britney's standard-setting Blackout, but here the relentless identity shifts result in a grating, baffling mess. On Minogue's comeback album, we want to hear Minogue. Ultimately, we do. ""Wow""'s funked-up electro sexiness may feel contrived, but its excitement is infectious anyway: It's great to hear Minogue having as much fun as she did on ""The Loco-Motion"" 20 years ago. Likability has got Kylie Minogue this far, and it pulls her through again-- even the weak tracks on X have a sparky enthusiasm that makes their magpie modernism sound less cynical. Vera Lynn wins this one: The third world war may have to wait.","On her post-cancer comeback album, Kylie Minogue seems as if she's crafted a revision primer for those who've ignored the past few years of chart pop, when more of what she does best would have been preferred.

I Wanna Go Backwards,Robyn Hitchcock,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3a513d197565213a996/1:1/w_160/60075283.jpg,2007-11-30 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10945-i-wanna-go-backwards/,Yep Roc,"Robyn Hitchcock's catalog has been sprawling and self-referential from the get-go. The title of his solo debut, Black Snake Diamond Role, was a play on ""Black Snake Diamond Rock"", a song by the Hitchcock-fronted and then-recently disbanded Soft Boys. In the 26 years since Black Snake's release, Hitchcock's songs have remained riddled with recurring characters and self-aware puns. That Hitchcock is not often cited as an influential figure outside of his work with the Soft Boys speaks to the weirdly self-contained nature of his musical world. While he's covered a great deal of stylistic ground over a dizzying number of albums, each one is an iteration of a musical persona so unique and fully realized that it seems almost impossible to emulate. The liner notes for I Wanna Go Backwards' 2xCD outtakes and demos set While Thatcher Mauled Britain serve as something of Rosetta Stone for the recurring imagery on these releases. In the only text accompanying the box set that is not unerringly cryptic, Hitchcock explains that these records were inspired by the despairing state of Britain at the time they were written and recorded. Aside from elucidating the frequent appearance of colonial themes (see Eye opener ""Cynthia Mask"" and I Often Dream of Trains' ""This Could Be the Day""), this also speaks to the oddly intrusive quality of the darker elements in Hitchcock's work. While these albums take place largely in the plane of the imagination, the integrity of this world is always being undermined by an invisible dialogue with an increasingly sad and decrepit reality. Released just a year after the Soft Boys' demise, 1981's Black Snake Diamond Role is the most immediately accessible of these three records, and in many ways the silliest. Opener ""The Man Who Invented Himself"" sands down the new wave edges of the Soft Boys into bouncy piano flourishes and an unflinching pop sensibility. Still, the weirdness of this record is palpable and often quite menacing, even when Hitchcock is being witty or flip. In ""Do Policemen Sing"", which recalls the fragmented sleaze of the Soft Boys' ""Old Pervert"", Hitchcock engages in a call and response verse with himself, asking and answering: ""Do policemen dream?/ Yes, when they're fast asleep/ And when policemen dream/ It proves they're fast asleep."" This kind of weird circular aside shows Hitchcock at his most charming and his most baffling. Though Black Snake Diamond Role is in many ways the most accessible of these three releases, I Often Dream of Trains is the unqualified masterpiece, a beautiful and haunting record that recalls in equal parts Syd Barrett and Monty Python. While Black Snake does its fair share of genre-hopping, I Often Dream is deeply and profoundly schizophrenic, running off in several directions at once with unblinking conviction. The understated, haunting beauty of ""Nocturne (Prelude)"" is followed by ""Sometimes I Wish I Was a Pretty Girl"", which is frenzied and off-key enough to lend some unsettling menace to its obvious humor. Even the most seemingly tossed-off or silly moments of I Often Dream of Trains contribute towards the album's overall thematic pull. The goofy acapella ""Uncorrected Personality Traits"" points to the album's odd emphasis on psychoanalytic themes, at once adding a humorous light spot to the record and lending new weight to its obtuse imagery. These reissues (each album is available separately as well) improve upon Rhino's earlier batch of re-releases, adding, removing, and resequencing some tracks to good effect. The demos compiled as While Thatcher Mauled Britain are, unfortunately, nowhere near as enlightening as Hitchcock's liner notes. Most were already released as You & Oblivion, and while some of the songs are quite good (see ""Fiend Before the Shrine"" and a sturdy demo version of ""Queen Elvis"") the compilation primarily serves to reinforce the musical and thematic concerns of the three proper albums, rather than offering many delights of its own. Still, even the most substandard material has its place here. Given the thoroughly far-flung nature of Hitchcock's solo catalog, it was a wise move to compile this set according to aesthetic continuity rather than strict chronology. Though he may not be included in the current canon of indie music's influential forebears, the material on I Wanna Go Backwards has aged remarkably well. Twenty-five years and countless albums later, these albums still offer an abundance of charm and mystery.","Robyn Hitchcock covered a great deal of stylistic ground over a dizzying number of albums, and this 5xCD set-- featuring three of his early solo albums and two discs of demos and outtakes-- attempts to make sense of his unique musical persona.

Radiance of Shadows / Guilted by the Sun,Nadja,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b36813d197565213a92c/1:1/w_160/03a17da4.jpeg,2007-11-30 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11632-radiance-of-shadowsguilted-by-the-sun/,Alien8,"When Toronto electro-metal duo Nadja are at the height of their powers, the entire world feels as if it could collapse beneath the pressure of a manipulated guitar, a drum machine, a bass, and two bent voices. Radiance of Shadows, the fourth full-length album the band has released this year, pushes to and pulls from such apocalyptic promise for 80 minutes, saturating their cathedral volume with sounds both thick and rich. Though Nadja plays torpid, doomy metal that replaces the usual toolkit with keyboards, the music's effect recalls black metal: Huge and impenetrable, the sound loudly grates, collapses, then instantly slams back at full tilt. Radiance of Shadows, Nadja's best album to date, is a series of warm-ups, cool-downs, and sprints that turn those sounds into a dramatic marathon through steep hills. A vortex of instability, Radiance's three tracks are exhausting. The album's only fault (a term that borders on hyperbole here) is its conceptual foundation. Touched, the second LP Nadja released this year and its second ever for Alien8, funneled song-like sentiments into the band's devastating sounds. The lyrics (about a lover responsible for an arachnid metamorphosis) fit the music (tangled, beckoning, forceful), and the narrative and sculpted noise reinforced one another. But Radiance shoehorns its concept-- lovers branded to one another by the sun-- into sounds that speak more vividly than their words ever could: ""I am turned to dust by the heat of your breath,"" ends the second track. ""Reduced to subatomic particles/ Leeching through your skin/ Each time a cell splits off/ We become a new flesh,"" the closing third picks up in total treacle regalia. Whatever: These tracks maul with an intensity that betrays plenty of feeling and passion, and their rapturous sense of motion and crushing sense of sound imply the love affair just fine. Guilted by the Sun, the Nadja album between Touched and Radiance, doesn't light the same response: More concise and more dynamic, it's only a teaser for the band's full fury. Compared to Radiance's long-distance sprint, these four tracks over 28 minutes feel like watching two B-list ball teams stranding runners for 53 scoreless outs, only to have a pinch hitter benched for personal reasons smack the shit out of a sweet-spot fastball in the ninth to win it. Like a member of the clean-up crew, you're left watching the crowd thin out, disappointed in its Saturday night entertainment. Guilted slams in, crushing placid guitars with drum machine jolts and Baker's lacerated roar. After four minutes, it falls apart and rebuilds, stalling once more to let quick beats disrupt a bed of noise. The album's best moment comes as all of Nadja's devices-- rumbling bassline, drums, synthesizers-- short out one by one, a reminder that this cretaceous size is electronically driven. ""By"" wraps turmoil in heavy fuzz, and drum machines slip phantom beats inside of a militant, direct stomp. It plateaus, corrodes and slopes into ""The"", which growls, then lurks. ""Sun"" does much the same, just over eight minutes instead of four. You'll call its overly logical, pedal-predictable fade-out in the air. Taken together, Guilted by the Sun and Radiance of Shadows elucidate the problems and payoffs of what's been a frantic, fantastic year for Nadja. After four full-lengths, two collaborations, two solo discs of somnambulant electronics, and a post-rock record from Baker in less than 12 months (with three discs slated for release early next year), Nadja's capabilities and compassions seem mostly without bounds right now. The duo's pacing may be laborious, and its hyper-dynamics can be exhausting. Still, the sounds between those poles and along those protractions are as impressive as anything anyone is currently doing near metal.","This Toronto-based electro-metal duo has released four records in 2007; these represent the good and bad extremes of the band's frantic year.

I Was Submerged,Tulsa,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b34d5e6ef95969322432/1:1/w_160/793e404e.jpg,2007-11-29 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10867-i-was-submerged/,Park the Van,"Tulsa is not from Tulsa, nor even anywhere near it. The Massachusetts band isn't even technically named for the Oklahoma city, but rather for the 1971 book of photos by Larry Clark that depicted Oklahoma youths indulging in promiscuous sex, drug abuse, and violence. Clark went on to direct KIDS, Bully, and Another Day in Paradise in the 1990s, which gives you an idea of how dark his worldview is. Tulsa the band isn't nearly so focused on depravity and self-destruction, but their Southern rock-influenced music does have a hint of danger and a dark tone descended from old murder ballads. The quickest, easiest comparison for Tulsa is My Morning Jacket-- loud guitars, lots of reverb, and soaring vocals all make them superficially similar. Below the surface, though, they're quite different, and Tulsa has developed a strong and intriguing sonic character for its songs. Lead singer Carter Tanton has a spectacular voice, and he uses it to the fullest, with long, plunging held notes, wordless accents, and a self-harmonizing technique that lends weightlessness to some of his best melodic phrases. His voice, as much as the songwriting, makes these songs memorable and gives them an ageless quality. Though Tanton could probably sing a recipe for chocolate éclairs and still make it sound good, Tulsa still delivers a consistent if somewhat vague lyrical view, featuring couplets like, ""Your mind is a newborn child/ Disappointment drives it wild,"" from ""Rafter"". That song has one of the band's most interesting arrangements, with swells of organ that rise up through the guitars and a drum part based more on full-kit patterns than a simple beat. They're good at building contrasting sections into their songs, with rough lead guitar parts that balance the smooth effortlessness of the vocals. A major-key guitar riff rises suddenly out of the minor-key murk of ""#2"", which begins as a foreboding descent into darkness with a snaking organ part and panicked vocals that recall a less preacherly version of 16 Horsepower's David Eugene Edwards. ""Shaker"" shifts on a dime into a texture dominated by acoustic guitar, then just as quickly shifts back to thick-toned electric riffage. ""Mass"" is just a heavenly, high-powered rock song, with a beautiful melody and huge, twanging guitar part. On just their second EP (at seven songs and half an hour, you could call it a mini-album), this band sounds very ready to have a great run. Though credited as a quartet here, they've since pared back to a trio, which hardly seems like something that will stop them, because they still have the centerpiece of the band in that voice. Even their less compelling moments, such as the mostly instrumental meander ""I Feel Great"", help fortify the group's sonic world. I look forward to their first full-length.","Massachusetts band is sometimes evocative of My Morning Jacket, with a countrified rock sound that includes loud guitars, lots of reverb, and soaring vocals.

Out There,The Heliocentrics,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b33a13d197565213a8e7/1:1/w_160/b0026b1d.jpg,2007-11-29 06:00:03,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10842-out-there/,Now Again,"It's a weird feeling to know what you like about a record while still having a difficult time figuring out what it is, exactly-- or at least finding a tidy way to categorize it.  Out There, the UK-based Heliocentrics' debut CD, has a slippery lineage: there's funk and Afrobeat, but it's too restless to stay on the groove for long, and whatever jazz there is-- mostly of the soul-fusion-era Blue Note ilk, with touches of free improv elasticity-- refuses to be completely straightforward. Throw in sideways hints of David Axelrod's orchestral jazz-rock, the United States of America's early psych electronics, and the odd Lalo Schifrin score, and Out There begins to resemble a period of time more than a sound. Even the op-art and Eurostile font-decorated cover, era-specific as it looks, seems stylistically non-committal. When a track on Out There works, then, it works as a series of recognizable ideas that ricochet off one another and combine to subtly redefine whatever it means to sound like ""the late 1960s."" It helps that much of the material of the milieu that inspired this music was already occupied with its own shifting targets and avant-meets-populist tendencies, especially in the utilization of non-Western compositional ideas. You can hear it in tracks like ""Joyride"", which uses its halfway-krautrock groove to blur the lines between Eurasian and African exotica, and the Middle-Eastern melodies on ""Before I Die"", and ""The American Empire"", which find a place for suspense-film strings and amplified thumb piano alike. If you have to find a specific niche for Out There, you may as well classify it as progressive jazz-funk of sorts-- drummer and de facto bandleader Malcolm Catto has a thing for intricate polyrhythms, and there's a certain improvisational looseness and experimentation here that goes a bit further beyond the no-nonsense grooves of most retro-soul bands. And while there's no shortage of stylistic inspirations to be heard here, the influence of Sun Ra stands out as one of the most significant, starting with the name of the band itself. ""Age of the Sun"", ""The Zero Hour"", and ""Sirius B"" all envision a version of the Arkestra replete with a stronger tendency to focus on the one-- imagine Clyde Stubblefield drumming his way through The Nubians of Plutonia. Even as a live-band outfit, the Heliocentrics find a way to connect the dots in a particularly hip-hop way: most of the signifiers that Out There streamlines and fuses are production touchstones for a certain caliber of beat-junkie that arose sometime in the early-to-mid-90s, taking DJ Premier and Pete Rock's deep-funk and jazz obsessions further out into arcana. Think DJ Shadow, who provided the Heliocentrics' first high-profile appearance on his supremely genre-confused 2006 album The Outsider, where they concocted a sort of unplaceable jazz-folk-soul-blues hybrid on ""This Time (I'm Gonna Try It My Way)"". There's a lot less of that song's Boz-Scaggs-session-band feel to Out There, but the modular universal-pop tone, retrograde as it may seem, couldn't come from any other place than the unlikely connections that spring up between breaks from one dusty old LP to another.","Last heard guesting on DJ Shadow's The Outsider, UK band's debut full-length touches on funk, Afrobeat, soul-fusion-era jazz, and 1960s film soundtracks.

Iron Curtain Innocence / Harvest of Dreams,Bobb Trimble,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b37f9d034d5c69bf4d07/1:1/w_160/bee1d01a.jpg,2007-11-29 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11634-iron-curtain-innocence-harvest-of-dreams/,VengeanceVengeance,"Most serious music fans have a fantasy in their minds wherein they discover a lost masterpiece that no one else seems to know about. There are certainly plenty of them out there to be found-- most music fails to get even decent distribution, things are marooned in home countries with tiny populations, and sometimes records are just overlooked or misunderstood in their day. If you were to stumble across them in a dusty old crate, it would be tempting to trumpet Bobb Trimble's two albums as lost masterpieces, and to a certain kind of music fan they are, but to most people they will play more as interesting, occasionally superb curiosities. Trimble hailed from Marborough, Mass., and was part of nearby Worcester's late-1970s/early-80s ""Wormtown"" scene, which comprised mostly punk bands who played very different music from what he was trying to do. Loosely, Trimble falls in the psychedelic loner category of American fringe music, alongside guys like Rick Saucedo, D.R. Hooker, and Faine Jade. He wrote melodic songs and had a high, pinched, somewhat feminine voice that gives his work an almost alien quality, especially given the way it fits into the haunting atmosphere of his compositions. Though he was essentially making what constituted pop music in his head (but wouldn't in most people's minds), he seemed to have a grasp of his inevitable outsider status. Case in point: his first album cover featured a cheap studio shot of him in front of a microphone, holding a Gibson SG guitar with the pick guard removed and a Thompson submachine gun. Iron Curtain Innocence is an imaginative debut sprinkled with a few excellent songs and a number of interesting sonic combinations. It's not brilliant, but it is strangely captivating. Trimble's drumming was rudimentary at best, which means most of the songs are smeared across the tape at very slow tempos. His guitar playing, on the other hand, was quite good, and he wrote unique chord progressions that heightened the sense of nervousness and lurking danger of his songs. His voice was his other great musical asset, and he did everything he could think to do with it-- harmonizing his melodies, layering himself in the background, trying out various primitive processing methods, and generally using it as a mood engine to crank up the level of paranoia already suggested by the rest of the music. Bits of craggy Moog and fuzz guitar pop up here and there, as do dollops of xylophone, backwards masking, and all manner of sound effects, from radio transmissions to cars starting. The real gems from the debut album are the fuzzed-out psych march ""When the Raven Calls"", and ""One Mile From Heaven"", a gentle, mostly acoustic song with a beautiful chorus that showcases his falsetto at its best. Trimble's second album, 1982's aptly named Harvest of Dreams, uses many of the same musical elements as the first, but the songs are a bit stronger and his grasp of atmosphere had developed considerably. That didn't stop him from including ""Oh Baby"", a bizarre track featuring Trimble and the Kidds, a band of pre-adolescent children he briefly fronted. Half the track is backward, and the part that's played forward is hardly any less odd, with its kid vocals and shaky drums. Highlights on Harvest of Dreams include ""Premonitions: the Fantasy"", which features his doubled falsetto and sounds like a lost Big Star or Chris Bell solo session with a bit of recorder and harmonica added on, and ""Armour of the Shroud"", a dark song cut through with dial tones and cold xylophone phrases. The guitar is processed to sound almost like a vacuum cleaner at certain points, and the vocals wander in and out of processing as Trimble calls for ""God [to] save the dreamers."" It's dark and implacably weird, but Trimble is so obviously earnest and working toward a vision on these recordings that you can't help coming away charmed. Judging by the demos tacked on to the end of the disc, Trimble was only getting better at his craft when he hung it up, ensuring that his albums would pass into legend for psychedelic and outsider music fans, changing hands for grotesque sums of money. Secretly Canadian has solved that now by bringing them back to life. They've colorized the album covers, rescued the sound with a solid remastering job, and included a few extras (calling them rarities would just be redundant) from Trimble's stash of unreleased tapes. These records are not for everyone, but if you gravitate toward the eccentrics and misfits of music, they're certainly something you should hear.",,6.9,
Thisisme Then: The Best of Common,Common,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b39a9d034d5c69bf4d33/1:1/w_160/05164894.jpg,2007-11-29 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10936-thisisme-then-the-best-of-common/,Columbia LegacyRed Ink,"Somehow, it makes sense that Common's found himself following the Mos Def/Ice Cube/LL Cool J/Fat Boys tradition of rappers-turned-actors: Despite a couple of bumps in the road where he overextended his reach (Electric Circus) or fell into a formulaic rut (Finding Forever), he's done a good job finding new roles for himself. It's easy to take for granted, but the way Common evolved through the course of his first three albums-- each one delivered during a pivotal transition phase for hip-hop-- shows a dedication to craft that you only really get from MCs who never stop thinking they have something to prove. Thisisme Then: The Best of Common covers the MC's three-record stint on Relativity, before his Soulquarians partnership took his stylistic restlessness into a different phase. It's a primer on his early years, containing every major single released from 1992's hyperactive debut ""Take It EZ"" through 1997's Badu/Roots-tinged ""All Night Long"", plus a handful of solid album tracks and one song, ""High Expectations"", that previously appeared on the soundtrack to Soul in the Hole. With 15 tracks to work with over those five years, there's plenty of space for a solid representation of who Common was in the early-mid 1990s, with his Cube dis cut ""The Bitch in Yoo"" the only noticeable omission. But just because it's comparatively exhaustive doesn't mean it's cohesive. That's because the first third of the CD is dedicated to tracks from Common's first record, Can I Borrow a Dollar?, which has long been overlooked in the wake of his successive work from Resurrection onwards-- and understandably so, since his lighthearted, borderline-comedic delivery, booze-and-bitches subject matter and kitschy pop culture references are another universe from the Common fans have grown to appreciate. Funny thing is, he's pretty damn good at that whole catchy Das EFX/Naughty By Nature stream-of-consciousness style that was sweeping pre-Wu East Coast rap at the time: As flat-out goofy as his lyrics are on ""Take It EZ"" (""I'm a Dr. Pepper, wouldn't you like to be a Pepper too/ Steppin' through, yodel-ay-hee-hoo/ Oui oui mon cheri, a comment-allez-vous?"") and girl-chasing follow-up ""Breaker 1/9"" (with its great string of impotence jokes in the second verse), there's also a hardcore street consciousness seeping through, and it's manifested even more in the keep-shit-real diatribes in ""Soul by the Pound"" and ""Charms Alarm"". The casual misogyny scattered through some of these earlier cuts (and highlighted in the Beatnuts-produced ""Heidi Hoe"") might be the most uncharacteristic element of all, but it also shows how far his attitude's come since. The heart of Thisisme Then is four tracks from Resurrection, and they're revelatory after the Dollar material even if they're familiar on their own. Within two years, his manic flow became streamlined, meaning overtook wordplay and his main production partner No I.D. shifted from elbow-throwing boom-bap to subtler, jazzier elements; the resulting album is one of rap's most personal and real-life-centered albums-- even if its reputation was hard-earned. (In 94, The Source gave it a lukewarm 3.5 mics out of 5; by 98 it was one of their 100 Best Rap Albums.) ""I Used to Love H.E.R."" gets all the love, and after 13 years its rap-as-girl-gone-wild metaphor still resonates, even if you're not as hardline anti-gangsta as he is here. But hearing it right after 92's ""Heidi Hoe"" gives it a new dimension-- the woman/genre he chastises for ""always smokin' blunts and gettin' drunk… I see niggaz slammin' her, takin' her to the sewer"" also winds up implicating his younger self. That search for absolution carries through ""Book of Life"", where he unflinchingly comes to terms with his reliance on liquor and fast food and concludes with a slick reversal of fatalism: ""I don't think I'll ever be happy until I rest in peace/ Of mind, and find who I am."" The other half of Common's maturing persona-- the dude who lyrically destroys shit with pinpoint focus-- rounds out the circa-94 picture with ""Resurrection"" and ""Thisisme"", and that raw brand of consciousness is something an entire subset of hip hop's been scrambling to catch up with since. Which brings us to the 1997-era material-- five tracks from One Day It'll All Make Sense, along with the semi-obscure b-ball anthem ""High Expectations""-- that established Common as a reputable commercial pillar of purity and Afrocentrism in a post-coast-beef world. All five of the album tracks included here take the ethos of Resurrection, polish it ‘til it gleams and throw in a few notable collaborators: Lauryn Hill's singing adds weight to an already heavy look at the personal stake in the abortion debate on ""Retrospect for Life""; Cee-Lo waxes theological on ""G.O.D. (Gaining One's Definition)""; Q-Tip stops in to reprise the hook to Tribe's ""Sucka Nigga"" on the out-of-context ""Stolen Moments Pt. III"". But Common's lyricism still takes center stage, bordering Ghostface-level multilayered abstraction on ""All Night Long"" and reminiscing about his Chicago-landmark upbringing of hip hop and teenage restlessness in ""Reminding Me (of Sef)"". Calling this CD The Best of Common should have an unspoken ""Vol. 1"" appended to it, but even with the weird formative years included, there's little here that wouldn't fit under a title like this.","This compilation cherrypicks the best of Common's work for Relativity, for whom the hungry, young MC delivered three varied albums that displayed a compelling dedication to craft.

Believo!,Enon,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a15bea9e61561daa47a3/1:1/w_160/fc88e5ef.jpg,2007-11-29 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10946-believo/,SeeThru BroadcastingSeeThru Broadcasting,"You're not crazy, losing your memory, or drunk: There's already one review in our archives extolling the virtues of this album. This just in: It's still great. Thanks to its reissue on Touch & Go, the label that grants eternal life to scads of underappreciated records (and the long and present home to Enon), we have the chance to further flap our gums about why Enon are so great, and why this record remains a fine place to start. Believo! is a bit of a black sheep in Enon's catalog, even if they've never been a very predictable band. But the group that recorded this album-- frontman John Schmersal and former Skeleton Key members Rick Lee and Steve Calhoon-- were dispersed before they made it to a second record. Toko Yasuda and Matt Schulz would make up the trio on High Society and onward, and since then they've veered between taut, unpredictable modern rock and strange, moody synth-pop from album to album, rarely stopping at any point in between. Schmersal had recorded lo-fi folk as John Stuart Mill, as well as some bedroom beats and hold music as Enon alone, while Lee was known for banging out rhythms on found objects, kitchen tools and junkyard scraps. Henceforth, Believo! has a lot goofy noises, which is almost always a plus. But Schmersal's songwriting smarts-- along with a pervasive atmosphere that's both humored and creepy-- glue this record together and keep it sounding fresh today. Perhaps part of the reason Believo! didn't initially get the fair shake it deserved was due to the long shadow of Brainiac, the fiercely-beloved cult act whose career was cut short by the accidental death of singer Timmy Taylor, for whom Schmersal played guitar. Taylor's most distinctive vocal trait was his elastic, nearly inhuman falsetto, and hearing a pretty similar vocal on opener ""Rubber Car"" likely brought Brainiac to many listener's minds. But closer listening reveals how different Enon were. ""Rubber Car"" itself was nearly electro in its lurching verses and layered keyboard gurgles. It was also far more pop than anything Schmersal had attempted with Taylor, taking the the harsh electronics of Brainiac's final EP, Electro Shock for President, to stranger and more accessible heights. A dose of detachment was key to helping Enon distinguish themselves, too: Brainiac were humans that wanted to be machines, while Enon mk.1 were more like robots approximating humans, with gloriously freaky results. So many albums fail when brand new bands attempt to try everything at once, rather than focus on what they do well. Believo! is one of the rare exceptions, where the group does everything they try pretty well. They let deep, mechanical bass loose in tracks like ""Rubber Car"" and ""Matters Gray"", and sneak in bludgeoning grunge-pop beneath the blips and bleeps of ""Conjugate the Verbs"". Portishead were a hip band to namecheck at the time, but few drew from their influence the way Enon did with ""Cruel"". Even if Schmersal's quivering falsetto-- far from Taylor's, it should be noted-- and the gossamer guitar effects were a little left of the mark, the result was positively unnerving. Elsewhere, collage-like sound experiments pop up in the title track and ""For the Sum of It"" without disrupting the songs' momentum, even adding to the latter's freewheeling charm. Centerpiece shoulda-been hit ""Come Into"" rolls like a square-wheeled wagon: Here, pre-war moviehouse organ and acoustic strumming meets blackhole-heavy guitars and weaving keyboards in the chorus, and not one element sounds out of place. The sweet, weightless hooks of ""Get the Letter Out"" are a slight hint of the direction Enon would later take, but then again, they'd never again record something quite so woozy and delirious as ""World in a Jar"". By the time Believo! ends with the negative creep of ""Elected"" and ""Biofeedback"", they've pulled off the fleshy rubber masks to glare at us with LED eyes. When I wrote earlier this year on Grass Geysers... Carbon Clouds, I called its songs ""radio- and arena-ready,"" but it wasn't some sort of sell-out connotation-- rather that Enon should have been kings of the sandbox then, and I'm mystified why they still aren't. Why did their electro-dabbling indie contemporaries get all the love? Even Radiohead have spent 10 years of their musical career toeing the line between man and machine, and they've never sounded like they were having this much fun. Maybe re-releasing this record will jog some short-term memories out there, and serve as a reminder to fans that you can have it both ways, being mischeviously experimental and unrepentantly pop at the same time. More recent records make it clear that Enon have perfected a balance, but maybe Believo! is a more interesting record for lacking it.",,8.4,
Gone Faded,Soft,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b36c9d034d5c69bf4cec/1:1/w_160/1bf57bb6.jpg,2007-11-28 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10894-gone-faded/,Academy Fight SongSilver Sleeve,"In press kits, interviews, and fanatical web reviews, Soft's diligence gets played up nearly to the point of self-mythologizing. As the legend goes, they formed back in 2003, holed themselves up in a Williamsburg apartment, and put their noses to the grindstone five nights a week for an entire year, so dedicated to songwriting and rehearsing they forewent live shows. After releasing a snappy EP in 2005, they've finally birthed Gone Faded, a debut album that, despite its four-year gestation period, feels no more prodigal than the next anglophilic Brooklyn band. Of course, we've heard tales of maddeningly meticulous songwriters before, whether it's Brian Wilson taking nearly 40 years to complete Smile or Rivers Cuomo claiming to have invented mathematical formulas for the perfect pop song. But hearing this spiel about an unproven band that churns out slick Britpop and shoegaze carbon copies doesn't nearly have the same effect. Oh yeah, and there's also that seminal songwriting eccentric Kevin Shields-- Soft can't even pretend to hide the massive debt they've racked up to him, right down to half-heartedly copping his reclusive shtick. Now this isn't to knock Gone Faded completely. On a handful of tracks here they scrape the heavens of post-Loveless shoegaze, particularly bands like Swervedriver or Ride, who took elements of the genre and tidied them up into three-to-four minute pop-rock songs. ""Higher"" could've slacked and become a cheesy Coldplay ballad, but singer Johnny Reineck justifies the track's cadre of effects pedals and tacky studio sheen with strong melodies and a smart, subtle chorus. ""You Make Me Wanna Die"", while laughably similar to Oasis at their peak, contains as many mind-blowing riffs as the Gallagher brothers inserted into their Beatles-esque hits. However, as Soft ventures away from this formula, their limitations become painfully apparent. Reineck's vocals especially get stretched thin, as stabs at Madchester like the title track and ""Great Spirit"" find him sounding like a chipmunk version of Shaun Ryder. By the album's second half, the band doesn't even feign interest in creating high-concept art, indulging instead in toothless acoustic songs peppered with ad hoc reverb licks and gratuitous harmonies. The buzz is that these guys busted their humps with Gone Faded, and the excess of artifice here confirms that. Sadly though, while stressing over stylistic emulation and production x's and o's, they forgot to write enough fleshed-out songs.","Brooklyn band looks to Britpop and shoegaze for inspiration, with mixed results.

Aluminum Lake,Concentrik,by: David Raposa,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b363c0084474cd0c20ff/1:1/w_160/91236bcc.jpg,2007-11-28 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10887-aluminum-lake/,Drag City,"In the past, Tim Green would use the Concentrick moniker as an outlet for creative urges he couldn't sufficiently satisfy with his more notable musical outlet, the Fucking Champs. For the fourth Concentrick album, however, he's taking a different tack, with a version of the ruckus he offers during his day job more informed by his other notable gig as a member of flower-powered Citay. For listeners looking to scratch that instrumental itch only the Champs can reach, but not in the mood for the group's relentless virtuosic shredding, Aluminum Lake is the perfect solution. The album begins with ""Waterfall"", a song that could find a nice home on the soundtrack of an anime-laden role-playing Playstation game, fluttering in the background while you choose between upgrading your strength or your wisdom. The album's title track follows, with its somber torpor and elegiac string section acting as a palette cleanser for Aluminum Lake's heaviest hitter. ""White Bear"" is the one song on the album that comes closes to the Champs' metal-up-your-ass M.O., spending over three minutes expertly building up to the inevitable (albeit subdued) riff onslaught-- it's not the display of fleet-fingered dexterity one might expect or hope for, but it's still showy and kick-ass enough to perhaps inspire the flashing of devil horns in the comfort of your listening area. Some of the tracks opt to take a quieter meandering route, as song titles like ""Transillumination"" and ""Time Is The Sphere Which Surrounds The World"" might suggest. There's plenty of raucous rock to be had, though. The groovy half of ""Punjab Glory"" should satiate any burgeoning desire to shake your moneymaker to any sort of odious boogie-rock, while the song's other half is taken up with another blistering solo. ""Divine Wind"" gracefully melds the otherworldly grandeur of ""Kashmir""-era Zeppelin with Iommi-esque chugging (and perhaps, with those high-arcing guitar notes, a slight nod to ""War Pigs"" as well). The motorik bounce of ""Expertz"", on the other hand, makes the track sound like an early Trans Am outtake-- were it not for Green wheedly-wheedling his way to the song's conclusion, one might think it was a straight-up cover. In fact, some doubters might see this album as Tim Green covering himself, deploying his usual bag of tricks in a needlessly watered-down fashion. For those with a glass-half-full view, this is simply Green giving listeners an enjoyable tour of the many places he's been.","Tim Green, best known for his work in the Fucking Champs and more recently with Citay, offers an enjoyable tour of the many places he's been.

Cry-Baby,Ungdomskulen,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b35a5e6ef95969322444/1:1/w_160/4cce8d7d.jpg,2007-11-28 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10880-cry-baby/,Ever,"Loosely translated, ungdomskulen is provincial Norwegian for junior high school, which in this case seems like an adolescent scrawl across a bathroom wall. It might be approximated in English as Junyer Hi Skool-- an adolescent scrawl across a bathroom wall. Sure enough, the songs on Ungdomskulen's debut album, Cry-Baby, detail such teenage concerns as masturbation, public erections, hard rock, and mythical creatures sketched in notebooks, but Ungdomskulen are neither brats like the Black Lips nor pretend-goths like Fall Out Boy. Instead, the trio are both the freaks and the geeks, deviants deciding their fates with a ten-sided die before cramming for that trig exam. Cry-Baby is a busy album, cramming eight long songs with as many digressions, tangents, and asides as possible, transitions be damned. It can be a little jarring and occasionally repetitive, both of which are forgivable for the band's misfit relentlessness on ""Modern Drummer"" and stand-out ""Spartacus"", with its shouted chorus and spiraling trajectory. Occasionally, they jam aimlessly, as on ""Ungdomskulen"", but most of these songs-- even ""Glory Hole"" with four-minute clockwork cowbell breakdown-- are purposefully and thoughtfully constructed. Up close, opener ""Ordinary Son"" is a frantic dancepunk track similar to those by Klaxons or early Liars, with herky-jerky guitar riffs and a bouncily melodic bassline. Take a few steps back, though, and the entire ambitious arrangement becomes visible, reminiscent of Built to Spill's guitar epics. Drummer Øyvind Solheim rides his high-hat furiously between the notes, and singer Kristian Stockhaus, in his thick-frame glasses and scruffy beard, shows off his formidable metal falsetto on the chorus. The song reaches a fevered climax around 2:30, then starts to wind down. But that's a feint: Ungdomskulen re-attack with short exclamatory riffs, then regroup for a lengthy mid-song groove as Solheim tests out his cowbells and Stockhaus and bassist Frode Kvinge Flatland, hidden behind a cascade of dark hair, swordfight with their guitars. Shamelessly, they do the same fake-out ending later in the song, and on almost every song thereafter. It works every time. And yet, for all their wankery, Ungdomskulen never departs from its power-trio line-up, meaning there are very few sounds on Cry-Baby that don't emanate either from drums, guitar, bass, and vox. Cry-Baby is just strings and skins, and by necessity, it's democratic, emphasizing each element equally while covering a lot of ground, from the pop melodies of ""Feels Like Home"" and ""My Beautiful Blue Eyes"" to the noisy crunch of, well, ""Feels Like Home"" and ""My Beautiful Blue Eyes"". These songs are all motion, mixing indie-rock lightning with heavy-metal thunder and revealing a belief in rock's spiritual powers: ""I feel that your fills are real,"" Stockhaus tells a modern drummer on ""Modern Drummer"". ""You fill up the void that we all have inside."" On one level, their approach-- the musical equivalent of running ""Serpentine!""-- seems to short-circuit any stab at seriousness, not that they're trying to be the Arcade Fire. But Ungdomskulen manage to rock sans irony, finding a certain freedom in adolescent arrest.","Eclectic Norwegians, cramming into their long songs as many digressions, tangents, and asides as possible, are both the freaks and the geeks, deviants deciding their fates with a ten-sided die before cramming for that trig exam.

Gyrate Plus,Pylon,by: William Bowers,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b38c9d034d5c69bf4d1d/1:1/w_160/d86b268c.jpg,2007-11-28 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10924-gyrate-plus/,dBArmageddondBArmageddon,"…on which the beloved Gyrate gets its remastered, expanded, completist, contextualized due. Even with liner notes by principals from R.E.M., the B-52's, and Gang of Four, this reissue from the dependable vinyl-miner James Murphy at long last permits the appreciation of Pylon to stop being hipster homework; DFA's generation-later vouch frees the listener, finally, to enjoy the assaultive relationship of Michael Lachowski's often ominous boing-boing-bass and Curtis Crowe's hot-pursuit whackamole drumming. The 10 songs from every copy of this seminal Athens band's debut are here, as well as both of the alternating ""11th"" tracks. Also included: The ""Jamaican"" version of ""Danger"" (""Danger!!"") from the Pylon!! EP, the confident first single, and a previously unreleased track whose title is also, less than incidentally, Gyrate's defining preoccupation: ""Functionality"". The original three musicians had a self-assignment. Their aim: To get NYC ink and then press kaboom. They weren't yet traditionally proficient with their instruments, and thusly seemed to approach their technological implements with a ""How can I use this tool?"" ethos, resulting in a kind of primitive precision, each member locking into a groove hardly ever intuitively related to that of another member. Before they found Vanessa Hay (née Vanessa Briscoe), they came close to using a recording about teaching parrots to talk as ""vocals."" Hay's eventual Situationist bark often reduced musicality to Pavlovian stimulus-responses via a joyless-sounding (but, ironically, joy-producing) series of reports or demands: ""Cool"" fascistically declares everything cool, baiting dissidents. ""Dub"" brags angrily of devouring dub at the start of each day, lest any white British acts think themselves superior digesters of the mode. Whereas Joy Division demanded ""Dance, dance, dance to the radio""; Pylon grunts the tad-more-individualistic ""Dance, dance, dance if you want to,"" even though the invitation is parsed like a warning with harsh consequences. ""Volume"" instructs its audience to ""forget the picture"" and ""turn up the volume."" ""Gravity"", obviously about the physics of the nightclub, taunts listeners by telling them that they both ""cannot resist the urge"" and ""cannot dance,"" framing the insanely danceable track as an incitement to rebel against its mouthpiece. ""Read a Book"" is some seriously infectious Maoist literacy-advocating combat-rock. Other tracks seek to provoke proletariat detournement: ""Precaution"" is about anything but risk minimization. ""Human Body"" juxtaposes bottom-rung job skills (""I can sweep/ I can mop"") against enlightened capabilities (""I can think"") while espousing ""safety glasses"" and ""safety shoes"" for the sake of a vessel that can ""function/ without going to school."" ""Working Is No Problem"" pretends to establish boundaries between the brain and the body, but the knowledge that Hay was a nurse, factory worker, and Kinko's manager makes it even more literally functional: Lyrics such as ""Everything's in boxes"" and ""I'm not a racecar driver"" obtain a kind of not-neurotypical discipline. ""Stop It"" raises the faux-dictatrix stakes, as the listener is instructed first to not rock-n-roll, and then to rock-n-roll on cue. ""Driving School"" merely catalogs, unromantically, the common nouns of public schools' instructing folks to use the dominant/subsidized means of transportation. The song insists that for certain industries, the government is a willing propagandistic babysitter, and even the stereo is implicated. Yet: all of these cuts are pogo-able, full-on jams, every scraped string ahead of (the mainstream version of) its time*.* Did Hay adopt such a dry tone in order to defuse gender-based responses to her band's art, to become a sexless object instead of a sex object? (I, for one, am intimidated by the orgyhole-shorthand-versus-radio-signal agenda of her current project, FFFM.) Many a female-led band since (Numbers, Controller.Controller, Love of Diagrams, Glass Candy) has adopted her iced-ham, standoffish tone. Maybe, like her fellow Georgian artist Flannery O'Connor, Hay ""refused to do pretty."" Meanwhile, her bandmates were busy wondering how minimalist, how non-""human,"" analog dance music could get without ceasing to be fun. The result: a kind of militaristic disco. No, wait, I meant: android reggae. No, wait, I meant: postpunk without the melodrama. Of course Pylon didn't blow up like their fellow Athens luminaries; they were too fucking Spartan.","The legendary Athens band goes from being hipster homework to being easily appreciated thanks to a DFA reissue that includes every song from both versions of Gyrate, plus a few singles and extras.

David Bowie Box,David Bowie,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b39d5e6ef959693224a1/1:1/w_160/50670988.jpg,2007-11-28 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10938-david-bowie-box/,Columbia Legacy,"Since the 1990s, David Bowie has been in the worst kind of rut. It's not that his output has been substandard-- each of his recent albums has had its share of pleasures. The problem is that by and large his output has been just good enough. As a result, nearly each of his releases from the past two decades have earned the usual ""best album since..."" reviews, and Bowie did admittedly sound more engaged than he had for most of the 80s (a decade he himself has since mostly written off). But considering that virtually everything Bowie recorded between 1970 and 1980 became more or less canonized, it's a bit of a legacy risk to re-release his most recent slate of CDs as a boxed set, with each album expanded to double-disc sets containing a mostly negligible collection of catalog detritus. It calls attention to the very albums that refurbished Bowie's iconic status, but outside of that big picture context it's a bit of a rocky ride. Following the Tin Machine debacle, Bowie eased back into his own name again. The tentative Black Tie White Noise captured Bowie at perhaps less than the peak of his powers but certainly working hard to regain them, and that's what made Bowie's first bona fide 90s comeback, 1995's Outside, such a bummer. On one hand, it was filled with such familiar collaborators as piano player Mike Garson and Brian Eno, who hadn't worked with Bowie since the famed ""Berlin"" trilogy of Low, Heroes, and Lodger. On the other, the album was borderline unlistenable, marred by an ill-conceived concept and too many indulgent detours. Outside nonetheless contains some of Bowie's most exciting songs, vigorous attempts like ""The Heart's Filthy Lesson"" and ""Hallo Spaceboy"" to ingratiate himself to a new generation of potential listeners (a strategy extended to a joint tour with Nine Inch Nails). Indeed, Trent Reznor contributes one of the many remixes of ""The Heart's Filthy Lesson"" now amended to the album, though the Pet Shop Boys' version of ""Hallo Spaceboy"" is not among that song's quartet of remixes represented. The formerly Japan-only ""Get Real"" is unexceptional. A jungle mix of ""I'm Deranged"", on the other hand, telegraphs Bowie's next move. With 1997's Earthling, Bowie made the firm transition from leader to follower, borrowing bits of drum'n'bass to lend his songs some contemporary cred. At the very least, the second disc shows songs such as ""Little Wonder"", ""Seven Years in Tibet"", ""Dead Man Walking"", ""Telling Lies"", and ""I'm Afraid of Americans"" are remix-friendly, with new best buddies Reznor and Moby handling several of the new editions. But versions of ""Pallas Athena"" (from Black Tie White Noise) and ""V-2 Schneider"", recorded under Bowie's alter ego Tao Jones Index, are still mostly lame. After Earthling Bowie again changed directions, this time resulting in the much mellower Hours.... Sprouting from sessions meant for the forgotten video game Omikron: The Nomad Soul, bits of Hours... found Bowie, the chameleon, looking backwards for once, and the hardcore fans-- i.e., anyone still paying attention-- recognized glimmers of the man's golden era amidst the relative mediocrity. Original versions of ""Thursday's Child"", ""New Angels of Promise"", and ""The Dreamers"", from the video game, crop up on disc two, as well as a couple of fun remixes of ""Seven"" from Beck and versions of Hours... songs that were plopped on movie soundtracks like Stigmata. Perhaps buoyed by the disc's respectable reception, Bowie reunited with producer Tony Visconti (who had worked with Bowie off and on since 1970, and who produced many of his best records) for the well-liked Heathen (2002) and Reality (2003), albums which seemed in part efforts to raze the recent past and return to his arty (and better adored) heyday. The records are steeped both in nostalgia and thoroughly modern post-9/11 paranoid, tough covers of songs from the likes of the Pixies, Neil Young, Jonathan Richman, and George Harrison among their highlights. The extra disc of Heathen features remixes from Moby (again) and Air (who do a good job spacing up ""A Better Future""), but most curiously the bonus platter includes new versions of mid-60s songs ""Baby Loves That Way"" and ""You've Got a Habit of Leaving"", as well as ""Shadow Man"" (written circa Aladdin Sane). The extra disc of Reality now includes a cover of ""Waterloo Sunset"", plus gets a totally pointless new version of ""Rebel Rebel"" and three even more unnecessary remixes of the same. But they're almost worth it to get the wonderfully silly Sigue Sigue Sputnik cover ""Love Missile F1-11"" (which should warm the cockles of Ferris Bueller's Day Off fans). Taken as an uneven whole, the generically titled David Bowie Box serves as an unnecessary reminder that for much of the past 10 years, Bowie seemed to be tossing things out to see what sticks. Yet by the time Bowie toured behind Reality (before open heart surgery halted his comeback) the scattershot gambit appeared to have worked. In the time since, Bowie has recharged his cultural currency, plying elder statesmen to such acolytes as Arcade Fire and TV on the Radio.

Placelessness,Alina Simone,by: David Raposa,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3655e6ef95969322450/1:1/w_160/e8ad67f2.jpg,2007-11-27 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10888-placelessness/,54º40' or Fight!,"Alina Simone's debut EP, Prettier in the Dark, showcased a singer-songwriter still trying to find herself. In a presumably coincidental case of serendipity, her protagonists underwent the same sort of self-discovery Simone herself struggles with over the course of this record. Moments where her voice displays a fragile strength are undercut by moments where her singing turns shrill and coarse. Evocative, lyrical images are offset by awkward stabs at meaningful poetics. Some songs benefit from the space and sparse arrangements Simone and her producer give them; others simply unfurl in a graceless fashion. Despite its faults, the EP was an intriguing effort from a performer that showed a great amount of potential. Unfortunately, Simone's first full-length (appropriately titled Placelessness) finds her in a place not much different than where she began, making many of the same missteps she did the first time around. At this point in her career, Simone sounds best when she sounds like someone else. Some exposure to her vocal proclivities will undoubtedly bring Cat Power to mind, and her songs are at their strongest when she attacks them cross-bones style, adding skeletal drum and bass accompaniment to her fractured guitar slashes and equally fractured singing. The album's opening and closing moments are its peaks. Lead track ""Velvet Painting"" says its peace in a brief, punchy fashion, and is followed by the more measured, but no less intense, ""Saw Edged Grass"". The album's final song, ""Country of Two"", is the album's best, the band's dry attack underpinning a striking portrait of a woman alone with her lover in ""a placeless place I found with you."" Despite a less-than-graceful ending where she attempt to conflate the American flag's stars and stripes with ""sickle-celled hammer-headed sharks"", the song succeeds by playing to Simone's strengths. The problem with Placelessness is that these shows of strength are few and far between. The seven tracks nestled between the three previous mentioned are songs where Simone tries to broaden her aesthetic palette beyond what she does best. Though admirable, this overreaching leads to tracks like ""Nightswimming"" (where Simone shrieks ""just step ahead"" over and over atop somber banjo picking) and ""Riot Act"" (where Simone, alone with an electric guitar, tries to carry a song by shouting her way through). Her idiosyncratic voice can be charismatic and powerful in the proper setting, but letting it flail about unfettered in such an exposed manner does Simone no favors. When she sings a capella, as she does during the beginning and ending of ""Lonesome"", she throttles her lyrics with overwrought cries and wails. These histrionics turn what could be wrenching emotional moments into coffee-house versions of ""American Idol"" open tryouts, and it's miscalculations like this that ultimately sabotage whatever promise the album contains. Alina Simone reports on her web site that her upcoming album (due next spring) will be comprised of cover songs written by Russian ""punk-folk"" singer Yanka Dyagileva. Here's hoping that by singing someone else's words, she can begin to discover her own voice.","Singer-songwriter follows her Prettier in the Dark EP with a full-length of evocative, lyrical images and sparse arrangements.

Pale Young Gentlemen,Pale Young Gentlemen,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3559d034d5c69bf4cc9/1:1/w_160/36de5757.jpg,2007-11-27 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10876-pale-young-gentlemen/,self-released,"Too much Black Kids. Not enough black people. Congrats-- you're caught up on the last month of ""why indie rock sucks"" and prepared to dismiss the blog-approved, self-released album from Pale Young Gentlemen on principle. Oh, if only it were 2005 again for these guys! Their penny orchestra sound is just enough off the beaten path to raise notice and the cutesy DIY details can fill out the rest (there's a song called ""Clap Your Hands"" and anyone who received this record by mail now has the drummer's address). But if people are really willing to stem the process of thrusting embryonic bands into unjustified shitstorms of press, more power to Pale Young Gentlemen, as their eponymous debut is a lean 30 minutes that's better served as a springboard to something greater, equally balanced promise and ""not there yet."" Pale Young Gentlemen employ a female cellist, but the band name is most definitely not used for ironic purposes. Though it starts with a sinister riff that could pass for Miami bass gone acoustic, the opener has a bold chorus pining for the ""milk white glory"" of an unattainable ""Fraulein"" with a classic piano-pop melody. From Beirut's heat-n-serve Franco-Americanisms to Gogol Bordello's Balky/Balkan dance of joy, indie European vacations are becoming more frequent, but the Gentlemen opt towards hitting the Great White North with a frequency that must play well in their home state of Wisconsin. The first half of the album plays closest to this style, with jumpy upbeat rhythms and stein hoisting chorales that ratchet the bawdiness of ""Me & Nikolai"" (""we saw her standing there/ she was in her underwear"") and prop up the good-timey Supertramp vamps of ""Saturday Night"". The self-released and self-produced aspect isn't a canard either, as there's a natural sound that renders the guitars paper thin, places the vocals front and center and has every other instrument sounding direct to tape. Usually, you're supposed to extrapolate how a beefier budget could make this better, but it's quite the opposite here. It's easy to imagine the wintry quietude of piano ballad ""As a War"" drowning in symphonic goo or the rippling ""Up North"" (a two-minute love letter about escaping to Canada) being robbed of its innocent charm. Singer Mike Reisenauer becomes a make-or-break proposition, as his falsetto dangerously courts Chris Martin parody, and he often confuses overpronunciation (""mother"" becomes ""mortar"") with theatricality-- ""Clap Your Hands"" grabs the listener with the most force, but there's an affected, overly fussy nature to it (""Click your heels/ Dance, dance/ Grab your girl/ Dance, dance"") that's a little too Panic! at the Beer Hall for its own good. But while Pale Young Gentlemen is frontloaded and slightly naïve like a record of this sort should be, there's more than enough reason to anticipate what they're capable of when they decide to get darker, older, and less gentle.","With a DIY release and a penny orchestra sound, this Madison band should appeal to fans of Beirut and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah-- and their self-released LP should serve as a springboard to something greater.

"Lovers, Lead the Way!/The Heat Can Melt Your Brain",Viva Voce,by: Joe Tangari,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a2385e6ef95969320381/1:1/w_160/7bd4380b.jpg,2007-11-27 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11626-lovers-lead-the-waythe-heat-can-melt-your-brain/,Asthmatic Kitty,"The vagaries of the recording industry have always seen to it that a lot of great music will go through periods of unavailability for reasons well beyond the control of the artists or even the labels. Viva Voce's second and third albums certainly fall into that category-- good music that disappeared for a while. Lovers, Lead the Way! and the Heat Can Melt Your Brain, both made by Kevin & Anita Robinson, are what most home recordings can only aspire to be: complex, classy, and memorable. I was glad to hear that they were being reissued in this convenient 2xCD package, because they're both records that deserve a wider audience now that the band's profile has risen with their move to Barsuk (their 1998 debut is still lost for the moment). Lovers is hugely enjoyable, full of simple pop, bombastic instrumental passages, weird home-cooked experiments, and as many instruments as the Robinsons could get their hands on. Anita's guitar playing and Kevin's drumming really came into their own on this album, and the fact that they both play and sing well obviously works in their favor as they pile up the vocal harmonies and instruments, weaving hissing Chamberlain and warm organs through their songs. ""Red D-Lish"" is still among their very best songs, with its Brian Wilson percussion and ragged, inspired guitar solo, but there are plenty of other great tracks, from the progged-out instrumental ""Yr Epic Heart"" to the sweeping, beautiful opener ""Fashionably Lonely"", which opens the album with an orchestrated passion that would make Jeff Lynne blush. Heat opens quite differently, with a ferocious peel of fuzzed-out guitar, but on the whole, it's really in the same basic headspace as its predecessor. The spouses trade lead vocals and combine on abundant backing harmonies, and if anything, the playing is even stronger and more inspired. Anita's lead guitar parts are confident, and her thick, gutsy tone is exquisite on ""Free Nude Celebs"". ""High Highs"" is a brilliant sidestep into smoky r&b that betrays the couple's Muscle Shoals roots with a fat, melodic bassline and soulful vocals. ""The Center of the Universe"" is still their most majestic moment, with Kevin's assertion that ""the center of the Universe is a star-sucking hole"" backed up with huge swaths of cosmic electric guitar. The bonus material, lumped together on disc two after Heat, includes three previously unreleased demos, four live performances, and a bare-bones Tunng remix of ""Wrecking Ball"", originally from Lovers. The demos are, well, demos-- roughly recorded but reasonably fleshed-- and two of the songs are new to us. (Though ""Doo Wap Death Trap"" ultimately became Heat's ""Daylight"".) The live performances, three from a KEXP appearance, the other a cover of the 1926 David/Rose song ""Tonight You Belong to Me"", are all excellent. I'm not sure if they had any hired guns with them at KEXP, but it sounds like a full band, or at least a lot of programming and triggers. ""Tonight You Belong to Me"" is a sweet and sparse duet backed only by guitar and melodica. Amore!Phonics has done a good job of pulling all this stuff together and adding value with the unreleased tracks and a thick booklet complete with full printed lyrics and tons of photos and original art by Kevin (no overwrought liner notes, either). The detectives among you will notice that I gave both of these albums a 7.6 in 2003 and 04, respectively, but I've raised their cumulative score simply because I think time has been kind to them. This speaks to one of their greatest strengths as a band: While their music has moments of pop immediacy, it also has enough complexity and depth that repeat listens are very rewarding.","Viva Voce's second and third albums-- complex, classy, and memorable home recordings-- thankfully resurface in a convenient 2xCD package.

The Hollows EP,WHY?,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b39713d197565213a97d/1:1/w_160/caca1cdf.gif,2007-11-27 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10933-the-hollows-ep-us-eu/,AnticonTomlab,"Yoni Wolf and his band Why? are outcasts from groups of outcasts. While Anticon is an apt fit for his verbal diarrhea, even Wolf's folk-leaning early work stood a few yards apart from the label's roster, and their recent work has even less to do with hip-hop than the highly experimental collective that launched records from the likes of Doseone and Odd Nosdam. This isn't necessarily a bad thing-- 2005's Elephant Eyelash further blurred genre lines, leaning on guitar and drums but within freewheeling near-collage-like compositions, and it gained the group its biggest audience to date. A subsequent opening slot for the Silver Jews' first honest-to-god tour delivered on expectations and found them wowing open-minded audiences with their performances and confounding search engines across the country ever since. Now, Why? issue a pair of 12"" records of remixes and covers-- one on Anticon and one on Tomlab-- in advance of their March 2008 album, Alopecia, featuring sometimes unlikely contributions from Boards of Canada, Xiu Xiu, Dntel, Half-Handed Cloud, and members of Yo La Tengo and Islands. Why?'s own contribution to this new EP-- you know, the single it's named for-- is even further from their already tenuous relationship to hip-hop. On the track, Wolf ""sings"" more, the track's ominous dirge-like beat sounds more rock than hip-hop, and its sudden lurches in tone and instrumental interjections feel that much more linear. While ""The Hollows"" is an enticing enough peek at their upcoming full-length, what's more interesting is how much inspiration other artists find in Why?'s material. Not only are these grab-bag EPs consistent-- which should be a contradiction right there-- the songs contributed would fit well in each artists' own catalog. Two groups take a crack at ""Yo Yo Bye Bye"", from Elephant Eyelash. Xiu Xiu's attempt (from the Anticon EP) is a little too wordy to leave room for Jamie Stewart's dramatic vocals, but he sounds comfortable with the rapid verbiage while the gentle electronic soundscape feels warmer, and has a pulse that races quicker, than much of his band's recent, more contemplative work. On the Tomlab version, Dump (aka James McNew of Yo La Tengo) offers a version of ""Yo Yo Bye Bye"" that sounds as intimate as any of his home-recorded projects, and features much of the same reverberating fuzz bass and drum machines, but with a patience and a bump in recording fidelity that make it far less claustrophobic. It's also far less fragmented than the original, which turns out to suit the evocative lyrics just fine. On the Anticon EP, Half-Handed Cloud are the black sheep, attempting a drums, piano, and voice medley of Why? songs called ""Pree-Teen Apocalyptic Film Acting"" which is expectedly precious, your enjoyment of which may depend on your tolerance for the band itself and the sound of a musician's ambitions skipping merrily outside the bounds of their ability. To further twist bullyish tension burns on the arms of fans, The Hollows EPs feature two remixes of tracks from the upcoming Alopecia. Dntel's Anticon EP track returns to his cuddly headphone-techno roots with its insistent, espionage-evoking beat. Wolf's steadier, typical hip-hop delivery makes what could be an MOR move for both into a mind meld instead. But Boards of Canada, with the understated but insistent loping beat they add to ""Good Friday"", make you wonder why they're not working with more rappers. They bring a newfound clarity and movement to Wolf's words, and even though he's working a deadpan monotone, BoC manage to add several different textures without ever stepping on his toes. Though they've remixed the Anticon roster before, it's a tantalizing step outside of BoC's comfort zone, and an amazingly sensitive collaboration, over which Wolf leabes some provocative call-outs and males plain-faced admittance of the therapeutic value of his lyrics (""shit I wouldn't even admit to my head-shrinker""). The slinky beat and restrained horns make for a track that sounds sun-kissed and debauched all at once. Joining BoC and Dump on the Tomlab release, Nick T of Islands might throw the biggest curveball on either EP with a cover of Wolf's side-project Reaching Quiet's ""Broken Crow"". Dour and weightless, it's a sluggish classical piano and drum dirge that ends with an sharply incongruous keyboard tone (not so far from Boards of Canada), hinting at depths his band has yet to plumb. One single and two remixes is a bit of a tease for those waiting on the release of Alopecia in a few months, though each of these singles handily stands apart on their own.",,7.0,
Sawdust,The Killers,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b39c13d197565213a98c/1:1/w_160/d03a779d.jpg,2007-11-27 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10937-sawdust/,Island,"They can be taught! What separates the Killers from contemporaries such as the Bravery and Panic! at the Disco-- and what will ensure an audience when those bands have fully fossilized-- is that the Vegas quartet can learn and adapt. While they evolved out of the Strokes' 1970s guitar strut and a flyover approximation of that band's New York-centric sense of style, the Killers have since managed to move up the evolutionary ladder, developing actual tools and displaying the capacity for reason. Sam's Town, their second rung, predicted opposable thumbs and verbal language in the band's future. The band used Springsteen to poke out even more drama from new wave, cross-breeding two very different species-- the Boss' concentrated working-class rock with effete British new wave. Surprise: It sometimes worked. On their way forward, the Killers offer a glance backward with Sawdust, a hodgepodge of everything they've tried in the past as well as a few things they'll no doubt try again in the future. With its vague title and ludicrous artwork, this catch-all gathers outtakes, B-sides, covers, Jacques Lu Cont's Thin White Duke remix of ""Mr. Brightside"", and a dorky hidden track that reveals their debt to Stone Temple Pilots. What the Killers haven't learned is how to dial it back: These songs, just like the albums they were recorded for, are busy with sounds and effects, as if they are aiming to deploy every studio knob or realize all of their harebrained ideas at once. Opener ""Tranquilize"" sounds weighted with stuff-- the typical drum-bass-guitar, of course, but also more guitars, synths both ominous and light, a children's choir, Lou Reed-- all in service to trite lyrics and bombastic melodies. Likewise, their cover of Joy Division's ""Shadowplay"" shoots for epic, losing the minimalist menace of the original in a maelstrom of garishly climactic instrumentation. The Killers' clunky more-is-more aesthetic derives from stadium bands like Depeche Mode, whose music had to sound good in an arena as well as on headphones. But Depeche Mode had the good sense to streamline their songs, making you listen deeply, not broadly. In this sense, Sawdust is musically dense but superficial, with seemingly no grand plan for all those sounds beyond having all those sounds. Songs like ""All the Pretty Faces"" and the too-wry ""Glamorous Indie Rock and Roll"" ramble on long after the band has spent that particular nickel, and even shorter tracks like ""Under the Gun"" and ""Show You How"" never feel concise like three-minute pop songs-- the not-so-bright side of ambition. Even the ""Mr. Brightside"" remix, which breaks the song down just to build it up again, reconstructs with the wrong elements and loses most of what made the original so enjoyable in the first place. On the other hand, boneheaded bombast is what the Killers do best, and they know enough not to grasp for subtlety. Because it's not a proper album and therefore not a big statement, Sawdust may actually be the Killers' loosest collection to date. Whenever listening becomes a trudge, there's a relatively off-the-cuff track like their cover of the Mel Tillis-penned, Kenny Rogers-popularized ""Ruby Don't Take Your Love to Town"". Buried in the back half of the album, it sounds like they recorded in a practice room, with only a few instruments at their disposal. Of course nothing the Killers do is that spontaneous, but nevertheless, they do right by the song, powered by Ronnie Vannucci's rolling beat and Brandon Flowers' slight reimagining of the chorus. Similarly, they downplay Dire Straits' ""Romeo & Juliet"", delivering it like a song instead of a community-theater monologue. Following in Mark Knopfler's footsteps, Flowers refuses to emote, which has wrecked other covers, and the band's understatement is appreciated. Overall, there's a strong sense of exploration on Sawdust; if the Killers don't seem to have much intuitive understanding of balance and songcraft, the overproduction at least suggests a strong musical curiosity underlying their obvious career ambitions. To date, the Killers' greatest accomplishment has been keeping their possibilities wide open, which few acts have managed to do without coming across as timid or aimless. If they can keep that up and actually go to unexpected places, regardless of the results, they'll be walking upright while other groups are still dragging their knuckles.","The Killers follow Sam's Town with this odds'n'sods collection, a hodgepodge of everything they've tried in the past as well as a few things they'll no doubt try again in the future.

The Patron,To Kill A Petty Bourgeoisie,by: Aaron Leitko,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3425e6ef95969322422/1:1/w_160/0c3208f0.jpg,2007-11-26 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10851-the-patron/,Kranky,"In order to correctly critique capitalist society via anthropomorphic metaphors, Animals needed some talk-box guitar solos. To capture the desperation of a rock star at war with Japanese Robots, Kilroy Was Here needed a short film. To tell the underlying love story of two merging companies, The Patron necessitates a sampler. And some foot-pedals. And probably some Max/MSP plug-ins. Concept albums are the arbiters of new rock technologies. They're the proving ground where musicians can try out exorbitant, faddish, and gimmicky gadgets to see if they go up to 11. With its hazy abstractions and digital futzing, To Kill a Petty Bourgeoisie's concept record The Patron probably makes use of several unproven instruments, and it at least ends up with some pretty decent textures. The album's convoluted storyline centers on some sort of abstract corporate entity and its eventual slide into betrayal and destruction. Or something like that. Vocalist Jehna Wilhelm's lyrics are too obscured among the showers of reverb and storms of glitchy distortion to catch much of the convoluted sci-fi plot. Meanwhile, the few discernable phrases tend to be oblique I-Ching style couplets like ""Generous exchange/ Leave nothing to chance."" But Kraftwerk's Computer World wasn't a great record because of the clarity of its political commentary, but because, with its talking machines and analog synths, it had an amazing sound. Similarly, the crafty manipulation of gadgetry provides The Patron's best moments. ""The Man With the Shovel is the Man I'm Going to Marry"" slowly evolves from a soothing synth pattern into swirl of chattering drum machines and effect-heavy layered loop-cannons of Wilhelm's tiny voice. On ""Long Arms"", buzzing samples and distortions give way to a swelling march that recalls the spacey-headed crescendo rock bands. Compared to the concept albums of the past, though, something seems to be missing. The Patron could use a few drums solos, maybe, or a medley or two. For all of its myriad atmospheric charms, the sampler-and-guitar set-up inhibits TKPB a little. Plodding lifeless rhythms largely dominate the record and any dynamic shifts come slowly, if at all. Not that TKPB have committed a Mindcrime or anything. The Patron's songs may have little in the way of variation or structure, but the duo's combination of pop melody and lo-bit-rate noise provides plenty of lilting and creepy moments. To Kill a Petty Bourgeoisie's gadgets don't go up to 11 on The Patron, but they do make a lot of noise.","On its first album for Kranky, Minneapolis-based duo creates a concept album of sorts, using voice, guitar, and lots of computer processing.

Teenager,The Thrills,by: Amanda Petrusich,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b33db1335d7bf169a56a/1:1/w_160/ddf7599f.jpg,2007-11-26 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10846-teenager/,Virgin,"The Thrills' debut, 2003's So Much for the City, and its follow-up, 2004's Let's Bottle Bohemia, were both recorded in Los Angeles, reflecting the Dublin-based quintet's fascination with America's Westernmost edge. The pull to the coast is not particularly unusual, nor is it especially complicated: Aside from its massive mythic legacy both in-print and on-screen (see: Raymond Chandler, Playboy, Joan Didion, Robert Evans, The Big Lebowski), there aren't many places in North America more geographically volatile than California (see also: thousands of years of wildfires, mudslides, floods, earthquakes). All that fragility yields a certain kind of romance-- California has earned its reputation as the golden land, the last haven for fantasists and thrill-seekers-- and the Thrills spent the bulk of their first two records buying into the mythology, alternately anointing Brian Wilson and Gram Parsons, building an ocean-soaked, harmony-heavy homage to California's dreamy dreams, shaking ground, and unrelenting sunshine. For Teenager, their third LP, the Thrills abandon Southern California to camp out in slightly-less-luminous British Columbia (in the record's press kit, the band explains that their studio-- The Warehouse, in Vancouver's Gastown district-- was, in fact, located in ""the worst neighborhood in all of Canada""). Accordingly, Teenager feels much less geographically inspired than the band's previous work, focusing, instead, on the deep prickles of nostalgia. As its title suggests, Teenager is a record about the awkward, impossible freedom of adolescence; unsurprisingly, most of these songs are written in the past tense, and almost all feature allusions to ""simpler times."" The album's title track-- a wispy, plodding dirge, heavy with compunction, swirling guitars, and tiny bits of piano-- lays it out best: ""I don't care for the past/ But if I could go back/ A teenager again/ If I could go back/ I'd trip over again,"" moans frontman Conor Deasy, voice high, longing, and fragile. More evidence of teen-wistfulness piles up: the band follows ""Teenager"" with ""Should've Known Better,"" a clumsy, banjo-addled lament on adulthood (""I harbor doubts/ I didn't live my youth with sufficient recklessness/ I envy your youth/ Yes, I envy your youth""). Deasy's lyrics aren't especially revelatory, but it's awfully hard not to relate to the record's basic sentiments, whether you're 19 or 99: It's maudlin and stupid and hopelessly clichéd, but who doesn't occasionally lament the inevitability of aging, whether it's griping over achy joints or wishing it was still OK to makeout with someone in the woods, one hand wrapped around a plastic red cup of warm, underage beer? Nostalgia rules here, and the unhinged glee that comes from being sun-sick and cramming too many Red Vines has been traded for more melancholic tones. But musically, Teenager isn't a huge departure-- the Thrills still mix classic bonfire melodies with slightly more ambitious moments (think big, booming UK pop-rock). Guitarist Daniel Ryan's banjo and mandolin flourishes are almost always transcendent, and Deasy's sickly whine is weirdly addictive, in the grand tradition of Neil Young. Teenager is gloomy without feeling fatalistic; melodic without feeling facile. For the Thrills, a quick locale change has managed to yield impressive results.","For its third album, the Dublin band abandons Southern California to camp out in British Columbia, and accordingly the record feels much less geographically inspired than the band's previous work, focusing instead on the deep prickles of nostalgia.

Red Bloom of the Boom,Bear in Heaven,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b36213d197565213a921/1:1/w_160/5349f913.jpg,2007-11-26 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10886-red-bloom-of-the-boom/,Hometapes,"Bear In Heaven's debut album doesn't automatically reveal itself to the listener. It's too abstract to get in one sitting, full of through-composed songs and strange ambient pieces. But while it may take several spins to get everything, something about the album's atmosphere grabs you the first time. Maybe it's just that the record's most tangible assets-- the vocal melodies and rhythms-- are being held just out of reach, ready for the taking with a bit of work, or it could simply be the inventive textures they create. Whatever it is, Brooklyn's Bear in Heaven have a way of drawing you into their world and making you feel like you belong in its alien landscapes. In that regard, it reminds me a bit of the early-1990s UK post-rock outfits Bark Psychosis and Disco Inferno. Those bands had influences of course, but, like Bear In Heaven, they put together their sounds in such a way that it was hard to tell exactly what those influences were. This is a band that will go from ambient washes of synth and samples to sludgy, pseudo-anthemic passages of throat-straining emotion to minimalist beat-making to slippery, Eno-inspired indie rock in one song like it's no big deal. This approach works better on some tracks than others, naturally. Opener ""Bag of Bags"" has an oddly appropriate title because of the fact that its various passages don't link seamlessly-- it's a piece of music full of smaller pieces of music. But the next song, ""Slow Gold"", is just the opposite. The fragments it's built from fit together like a jigsaw puzzle as it glides from a mysterious intro through a couple of hushed indie-rock verses to a hellish passage full of loud, repetitive vocal phrases sung/shouted in close harmony. The most haunting track is also the most abstract, a long, spooky piece called ""Fraternal Noon"", which recalls Can's ""Aumgn"" with its patchwork of strange sounds. The wordless vocals sound as though they're trapped inside the synthesizer that provides the main texture, and the heavy echo and processing make the guitar sound like percussion and certain bits of percussion feel like tonal instruments. It's essentially formless, but still somehow memorable, like a nightmare just after it's awakened you with a start. With seven songs in 43 minutes, Red Bloom of the Boom feels something like a 70s prog-rock or krautrock album-- a true cohesive work in an era when the album-as-art form appears to be slowly dying. It has a dreamlike logic to the way it flows, going from the reverb-heavy ""Fraternal Noon"" straight into the driest song on the album, ""Shining and Free"", which stutters along on an unadorned, straightforward drum beat but also includes a few totally unexpected bursts of dub echo and phasing. It ends with a spine-chilling drone that whispers the album to an unresolved close. It's the perfect dénouement for a record that defies easy description and never goes quite where you think it will.","Moving from ambient washes of synth and samples to sludgy, pseudo-anthemic passages of throat-straining emotion, this band's debut brings to mind both early post-rock outfits Bark Psychosis and Disco Inferno as well as mid-70s krautrock.

Sadly, two-and-a-half years later, I am again reviewing a compilation-- this one is Causes 1-- whose proceeds benefit the same, with no clear end to the conflict in sight. Darfur has been a showcase for modern human brutality for much of this decade, but just as depressing is that the international response has been a showcase for myopic ineptitude, lack of cooperation, and a general inability to do anything meaningful to end the war. The non-governmental organizations on the ground in Sudan-- this compilation gives much-needed funds to Doctors Without Borders, Human Rights Watch, and Oxfam America-- have had little help apart from a few failed agreements that no one other than ineffectual, unempowered ""peacekeeping"" forces has stepped forward to impose. Causes 1, the first volley in what promises to be a series from Waxploitation, is aimed at Darfur, with 100% of the proceeds from sales going to the three aid organizations mentioned above. To emphasize the urgency of the cause, the Waxploitation people have announced that the CD version will be available only in a limited run, while the iTunes download version will be available for only 90 days. (Note: This record can be purchased directly through Waxploitation.) As I said when reviewing ASAP, the cause and organizations are worth your attention under any circumstances. So, the disc: It's a mixture of rarities and exclusive tracks, primarily from popular indie bands such as Bright Eyes, the Shins, Death Cab for Cutie, Spoon, Bloc Party, and Animal Collective. The quality ranges quite a bit, but if you're reading this website there's probably at least one track that appeals to you. My favorite moments are the 1-2 of the fantastic, glistening ""piano version"" of Cornelius' ""Wataridori"" and Chris Vrenna's remix of David Sylvian's creepy ""Late Night Shopping"", which strengthens the original and sands off its more scattershot moments. Sylvian is an elder statesman on this disc, along with the Cure, who turn up with a pretty good live version of 1983's ""The Walk"" that replaces the original's synths with guitars dripping in delay. As you might have noticed, these tracks are fairly apolitical, and the same holds true with most of the rest. The biggest exception is the (International) Noise Conspiracy's ho-hum nu-punk track ""Washington Bullets"", which offers a fairly by-the-numbers critique of American capitalism and foreign policy. Otherwise, it's pretty agnostic. Clint Mansell's remix of the Shins' ""Turn on Me"" gets rid of most of the vocals and focuses on the guitar while cutting up the drums into some interesting patterns. Animal Collective's opening live version of ""Safer"" is simply chaotic. The ""middle version"" of Spoon's ""Rhythm & Soul"" is inferior to the album version. Death Cab for Cutie deliver a surprisingly wonderful cover of Julian Cope's ""World Shut Your Mouth"". And Bloc Party's ""Rhododendrons"" (originally a ""Hunting for Witches"" B-side) is as good as anything on A Weekend in the City. The only true dud is Travis' seemingly topical (but actually not) cover of ""Gimme Some Truth"", in which Fran Healy weakly barks his way through one of John Lennon's bitchiest, most petulant tracks. So here's where the conscientious consumer comes in. If you like any of these bands, you could do a lot worse than snagging this disc. Even if you're not interested in the record, there are other ways to donate to these organizations, and it's something everyone should consider doing (there are plenty of other NGOs that need operating funds, too). Either way, Causes 1 offers a low-impact way to get involved, and hopefully, I won't be reviewing a third Darfur benefit in another two years.","This mixture of rarities and exclusive tracks from artists such as the Cure, Bright Eyes, the Shins, Death Cab for Cutie, Spoon, Bloc Party, and Animal Collective gives much-needed funds to the Darfur-related efforts of Doctors Without Borders, Human Rights Watch, and Oxfam America.

Ask Forgiveness,Bonnie “Prince” Billy,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b398ea9e61561daa6b03/1:1/w_160/06483ad5.jpg,2007-11-26 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10934-ask-forgiveness/,Drag City,"At this point in his career, Will Oldham can do pretty much whatever he wants. Before reaching his 30th birthday, he'd already mastered Leonard Cohen-aping folk gloom (on Palace Brothers' Days in the Wake), Appalachian country-rock (on Palace Music's Viva Last Blues), and darkly grand balladry (on Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy's I See a Darkness). But rather than continuing to reinvent himself, Oldham now seems to be resolving his dizzyingly multifold identity, shoring up the elements of his sound that have remained consistent throughout his career and subtly incorporating attributes of all of his past personas. If anything, this eight-song mini-LP (which consists of seven far-flung covers and one original) most closely recalls 1995's laidback and largely acoustic Hope EP, augmented with the female backing vocals and orchestral flourishes that mark his more recent work as Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy. The most striking thing about Ask Forgiveness is its consistency. While you used to be able to spot a trademark Oldham curveball (an unexpected ""fuck"" or ""dick,"" for example) from a mile away, his idiosyncrasies are increasingly being absorbed into the core of his approach, and no longer disrupt the continuity of his music. In a sense, it makes him less ostensibly interesting-- such ruptures are part of what made Oldham such an intriguing character in the first place-- but this turn toward unassuming directness is also making clear how singular Oldham is as an artist. What's both impressive and limiting about this release isn't so much the song selection, but rather the fact that every track is seamlessly rearranged to hit all the familiar Will Oldham notes. Nowhere is this more apparent than on Oldham's cover of ""I've Seen It All"", originally recorded as a duet between Björk and Thom Yorke for the former's Selmasongs. In Oldham's hands, the hypnotic and protracted melodicism of the original song is replaced with a straightforward rustic ambience. By minimizing the massive textural and dynamics shifts of Björk's version, Oldham places much more emphasis on the song's beautifully stark lyrics. The multi-part harmonies and subtle strings that Oldham deploys during the song's chorus add a gradual and understated ebb and flow, without even attempting to recreate the grandiosity of the original. Oldham's more conventional cover choices are no less successful. Mickey Newbury's ""I Came Here to Hear the Music"" opens Ask Forgiveness with impeccably arranged guitars and breathy female backing vocals. A cover of Phil Ochs' ""My Life"" shows Oldham imbuing his vocals with a subtle expressiveness that far exceeds the ""whiskey-soaked"" tone for which he's known. Even the most off-the-wall material (Danzig's ""Am I Demon"", R. Kelly's ""The World's Greatest"") come off as perfectly well-considered, totally free of awkwardness and/or cloying novelty. And the one Oldham original, ""I Loved the Streets"", is possibly the jauntiest tune here, unerringly concise and enjoyable. Discussing at length how each of Oldham's covers varies from the original doesn't quite capture the spirit of this release. Ask Forgiveness doesn't offer Oldham's ""take"" on well-known and well-loved songs so much as it showcases a unique and distinctive musician performing a scattered set of songs he enjoys. Which is the best we could hope for: an unlikely and understated release from an artist with absolutely nothing to prove.","This eight-song mini-LP-- which consists of seven far-flung covers, including tracks originally by Björk and Thom Yorke, R.

Getback,Little Brother,by: Joshua Love,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b347ea9e61561daa6a7a/1:1/w_160/122728c0.jpg,2007-11-21 06:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10855-getback/,ABB,"In 2005, North Carolina-based hip-hop group Little Brother released The Minstrel Show, a record brazen both in title and tenor that sought to castigate the culture of materialistic, anti-intellectual bojangling that had besieged and benumbed the black community in the form of commercial rap music and mainstream TV programming. Unsurprisingly, this played exceptionally well on indie-rap message boards, in coffee shops, and college campuses coast to coast. But outside the Ivy, where people eat, laugh, fuck, and don't spend a hell of a lot of time thinking about whether their culture is eroding, it didn't make a dent. It's easy for the (over)educated among us to get hip to the underground and then snicker at the poor deluded masses filling their heads and ears with trash, but what happens when we have to step outside our theory-addled cocoons and explain looking down our noses at our neighbors and kin? Confronted with his aging, still-hustling ""niggas on the corner,"" Phonte illuminates this dilemma in a single line-- ""they ask me if The Minstrel Show means I'm ashamed of them""-- but in truth the whole of Little Brother's third full-length, Getback, represents a brass-tacks attempt at figuring out just why he and Pooh are rapping, and for whom. The project's essentialist nature is evident not only in the brevity of its composition (11 songs in under 50 minutes) but also its cast, one man short with the departure of the group's producer and biggest name 9th Wonder (who does make a cameo return to handle ""Breakin' My Heart""). That leaves the sonics in the stead of a motley collection of beatmakers, most notably Talib Kweli collaborator Hi-Tek (who helms the languid, gently whirring ""Step It Up"") and A-lister Nottz (the soulful, celebratory ""Two Step Blues""). The man with the most credits (four), however, is relative unknown Illmind, who submits a mixed bag between the too-busy ""Sirens"" and the smoothly reflective ""That Ain't Love"", ultimately failing to make anyone forget even the modest legacy of 9th's work with the group. Still, this is undoubtedly Phonte and Pooh's party, and all the fascination and frustration of Getback lies in listening to two MCs struggle to decide where they belong. Red-herring opener ""Sirens"" may be politically charged, but the record's real headspace is set with the succeeding track, ""Can't Win For Losing"", in which Phonte rejects fans, family and scenes as sufficient motivations for enduring the hip-hop grind before embracing friend and mentor Jazzy Jeff's trenchant advice of ""fuck 'em, 'Te, do it for you."" Belief in self is great, of course, but as the poignant refrain of one song puts it, ""dreams don't keep the lights on,"" and the remainder of Getback is preoccupied with how to juggle ideals and financial realities, individual dreams and the reciprocity of relationships, even the aesthetic choice between whether to crack jokes or talk tough. The uproarious ""Good Clothes"" and ""Step It Up"" attest that the duo (particularly Phonte) is capable of crafting highly clever hip-hop (""a nigga can't attract Cristal with a Boone's Farm mindstate""), but the flashes of quick wit are regrettably few and far between. Instead, untrustworthy friends (""That Ain't Love"") and demanding females keep marring Pooh and Phonte's good moods, bringing out grumpily regressive sides of their personalities that don't suit the typically easy charm of either MC (sure, no one gets skeeted on, but ""a woman's life is love/ A man's love is life"" is a subtly offensive maxim). It's telling that Little Brother sounds happiest on ""Two Step Blues"", an ode to the simple joys of shaking off the 9-to-5 and cutting a rug at the VFW with old family and friends. With all the acclaim they've earned and controversy they've courted, however, this unglamorous, down-home utopia might actually be the toughest for Phonte and Pooh to bring to life.","After the finger-waggling of the divisive The Minstrel Show, Little Brother's third official full-length-- and first without 9th Wonder-- represents an attempt at figuring out just why the duo are rapping, and for whom.

Places,Georgie James,by: Jessica Suarez,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b35313d197565213a90b/1:1/w_160/7b733da5.jpg,2007-11-21 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10872-places/,Saddle Creek,"Washington, D.C.'s Q and Not U took five years to transition from panicky, post-punk ruckus-makers to something approximating a Dischord Records pop band. Formerly a cubist nightmare of angular riffs and stuttering drum beats, Q and Not U ended their run with 2004's Power, whose hooky opener ""Wonderful People"" more or less announced that whatever the band had been in the past was done. Drummer John Davis was less present on that record, which perhaps accounts for the shift from tricky change-ups to quasi-disco. Q and Not U disbanded the next year after they had, to paraphrase, reached their goals as Q and Not U. Turns out both Davis and fellow founder Christopher Richards had new goals, neither of which sounded anything like each others'. Davis' first proper full length alongside D.C. singer-songwriter Laura Burhenn as Georgie James is bridge-bridge-chorus-heavy power pop, as blissfully laid-back as Q and Not U were wound up. Davis and Burhenn orignally bonded over a shared love of 70s power pop that's translated unfiltered into Places. They share vocals on nearly every song, which helps to recreate the bristling A.M. radio/""Yellow Pills""-era vibe that saturates the album. It's difficult isolating what makes a great pop song, but it's simple to isolate what's good about Places: On-the-beat drum stomps, frequent handclaps, endless bridges, swaying piano and downstroked guitar, more handclaps, and almost-cultish good cheer. ""Need Your Needs"", the LP's first single, veers a bit from those traits: Davis' rhythms and guitar are closer to Q and Not U's last stand, but when Burhenn comes in, it's all piano, shakers, and roses. They make a good combination-- nuanced drum patterns meet big, toothy melodies. ""Comfortable Headphones"", Places' hookiest track, brings to mind fellow power-pop aficionados the New Pornographers. But Carl Newman's group updated power pop's admittedly shallow concerns; Georgie James maintains the genre's self-reflection: songs about writing songs, chorus that extol the joys of singing together, as if any real problems could be solved in real time. ""Comfortable Headphones""'s title comes from this line: ""We want you here at home/ With your demos/ And your comfortable headphones."" An even simpler sentiment preceeds it on ""Henry and Hanzy: ""I think you should stop and sing along."" Georgie James' other nod to indie is in Davis's uncannily Bob-Pollard-esque voice. The resemblance is so striking that, at certain moments it sounds as if Burhenn is singing along to an outtake to the Ric Ocasek-produced Do the Collapse. In contrast to Davis, Berhenn's vocals are warm, if a little nondistinctive. That's the one problem— Places is power pop all the way, which means that sometimes everything starts to blend into an undifferentiated pop soup, meant to stream continuously into your ears from out of your alarm clock radio or portable record player. That's part of the appeal, though, the relentless drive towards a Platonic pop song, and its why one of the most appealing things about Georgie James is that they're wonderfully uninteresting.","Former Q and Not U drummer John Davis' first proper full length alongside D.C. singer-songwriter Laura Burhenn as Georgie James is Saddle Creek-released bridge-bridge-chorus-heavy power pop, as blissfully laid-back as his former group was wound up.

The Valerie Project,The Valerie Project,by: Matthew Murphy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3895e6ef9596932248e/1:1/w_160/e494db7a.jpg,2007-11-21 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10921-the-valerie-project/,Drag City,"A surrealist fairy tale involving vampires, lecherous priests, witch-burning, and budding teenage sexuality, Jaromil Jires' 1970 film Valerie and Her Week of Wonders could scarcely have been more tailor-made to become a cult favorite. Considered a classic of Czech New Wave cinema, the film's reputation has also benefited greatly from Lubos Fiser's original film score. As with the soundtrack to the 1973 version of The Wicker Man, Fiser's enchanting score has itself become an important underground touchstone, whose echoes have been heard in the work of Broadcast, Tim Burton, and all across the psych-folk terrain. Now, as a tribute to the film and its enduring appeal, a collective calling themselves the Valerie Project have created and performed an alternate soundtrack to accompany 35-mm projections of Valerie and Her Week of Wonders. Led by Greg Weeks of Espers, the Project unites an impressive ensemble of Philadelphia-based musicians that includes several members of Espers, Tara Burke of Fursaxa, and electronicist Charles Cohen. One of the group's stated goals is reframe the film to help viewers advance new interpretations of this complex work. Whether or not they've succeeded in that regard is likely open to debate, but nevertheless their dense, vibrant new score can certainly be savored as an engaging and imaginative song cycle in its own right. Even after multiple viewings, Valerie and Her Week of Wonders can remain a bewildering spectacle, and its dream-like plot defies easy synopsis. Long story short: a young girl hits puberty, gets herself a pair of magic earrings, and all hell breaks loose as she soon discovers that seemingly everyone she encounters is a shape-shifting blood relative, a lascivious clergyman, and/or a vampire. In fact, the film is filled with so many odd plot twists and bizarre images that it effectively becomes a blank slate for its composers, as virtually any score that is even remotely mystical or enchanted is going to sound more or less appropriate. So it is interesting to note that the Valerie Project have here neither done a faithful recreation of Fiser's original score, nor have they necessarily taken the soundtrack in any radical new directions. Instead, the music here can almost be considered as a fantasia on the themes introduced by Fiser, and is best appreciated as a supplement to the original score rather than as a replacement. In the original score, Fiser and collaborator Jan Klusak used a gauzy array of woodwinds, harpsichord, and a children's chorus to craft a soundtrack that elevated the film's off-kilter balance and sense of anti-authoritarian whimsy. For their part, the Valerie Project have incorporated certain elements of Fiser's design-- a lyrical flute passage here, some disembodied voices there--but with the aid of Weeks' acid guitar leads and a forceful string section they have instead captured more of the film's underlying melancholy and brooding aura of loss. Despite my best efforts, and the Valerie Project's descriptive song titles, I had very little luck in synchronizing their soundtrack with a DVD of the film in any truly precise or meaningful way. (Although there does seem to be a portentous twinkle of chimes whenever those magical earrings appear onscreen .) That said, the group do a fine job of conveying the general mood and atmosphere of the film's action through the disorienting psychedelic swirl of ""Grandmother"" or with the robust strings of ""Burned at the Stake"", and once you have seen the movie it becomes easy to discern which scenes each track is designed to evoke. As with her Fursaxa work, the wordless vocals of Tara Burke are a sumptuous treat throughout, and the album's strongest pieces such as ""Eagle's Theme"" or ""The Feast"" match or better the transporting splendor of anything yet created by Espers. Weeks has stated that he feels Valerie and Her Week of Wonders projects a political or cultural message that remains relevant today through its themes of lost innocence and responsible pastoral living. And though the film is certainly abstract enough to be open to a variety of interpretations, this feels to me like a bit of a stretch. The film's sexual politics might seem rather problematic to today's audiences, and it certainly doesn't paint a very rosy picture of pastoral life, especially if you don't like getting chomped by vampire grannies. There is little doubt, however, that the Valerie Project's passion for Jires' film and Fiser's soundtrack has taken them well beyond anywhere they might otherwise have gone, and with this album it is an enjoyable privilege to join in their travels.

Shelter From the Ash,Six Organs of Admittance,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b385b1335d7bf169a5e5/1:1/w_160/9236ef77.jpg,2007-11-21 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10918-shelter-from-the-ash/,Drag City,"Shelter from the Ash, the third Drag City release in three years from Six Organs of Admittance, plays like frontman Ben Chasny's California singer-songwriter record. Indeed, it's not hard to imagine someone being enamored by Chasny's latest, a bright collection of eight tracks that shine beneath the same layered production Tim Green recently lent to Citay's adventurous Little Kingdom. The acoustic guitars ace a Bert Jansch affinity, and the electric guitars supply sheets of sound and arcs of solos. The lyrics offer an outcast empathy, and the vocals are pretty and pensive. But that's about it: Eight songs in 42 minutes, a generally pleasant listening experience. There's nothing too surprising, too challenging, or too risky, nothing that gambles the record's generally nonplussed, if somewhat dark vibe. This is also the first Six Organs record that doesn't feel like a summation or extension of recent work. The Six Organs catalogue has always been non-linear, skipping from austere acoustic compositions on 2003's For Octavio Paz to tonic-based acoustic cycles played beneath a loud, crackling turntable loop on 2004's ""The Six Stations"". Last year's The Sun Awakens amplified or accentuated such acoustic pieces, while the manipulated folk feel of 2005's School of the Flower reached back somewhere between the 1998 eponymous debut and 2003's splendid Compathia. Given the exploratory transience of Six Organs' catalogue, Shelter from the Ash feels too much like work, too much like what had to happen. Here, Six Organs is doing for psychedelic folk what Jackson Browne and the Eagles did for pop-reared folk-rock, hybridizing polished, perfected takes on touchstones into a safe-for-anyone alloy. Shelter from the Ash doesn't sound like Hotel California, of course, but it does approach its sound with the same mannerism. The parts are exaggerated typecasts, from the loud Amazon field recordings that open ""Goddess Atonement"" to the ostentatious guitar solo that follows. The imperfections, subtleties, and idiosyncrasies that once lined Six Organs records are now buffed clean, replaced by precise, predictable, unimaginative flourishes. The ad hoc backing band of Green, Matt Sweeney, and Comets on Fire electronicist Noel Harmonson on drums plays it evenly. They shore up the songs without adding much interest, mostly giving Chasny space for showman solos that are only occasionally interesting. Chasny even harmonizes with his girlfriend, Magik Marker and Basalt Fingers collaborator Elisa Ambrogio, on three tracks. Sure, their best duet, ""Strangled Road"", is a dream, but it confirms the album-rock ease on every level. ""Coming to Get You"", a seven-minute track that builds into a guitar-and-drum coda, barely burns, releasing instead a thin veil of smoke. The record's second half picks up the pieces slowly, an aggressive acoustic solo densely stacking layers of notes like a thick blot in the middle of a pointillist sketch. The action ebbs and flows toward the disc's last electric guitar solo on ""Shelter from the Ash"". Again, feedback cuts through consistent, clattering drums. It collapses, not having accomplished the sort of magnetism it implies. Closer ""Goodnight""-- Chasny's most staid pass on the record, matched by Ambrogio's echoing vocals and Green's gentle electronics-- brings the vibe back. Every Six Organs album for Drag City has ended with lingering beauty, be it the languid wending of the 24-minute drone that ended The Sun Awakens or the plaintive, unexpectedly simple ""Lisbon"" that kissed School of the Flower goodbye. ""Goodnight"", like the album it caps, is the most obvious. These techniques-- cacophony-to-calm conclusions, bombastic, even extraneous guitar dexterity, soothing instrumental melodies doubled in cooing harmonies-- aren't new to the Six Organs canon. But on Shelter from the Ash, they're combined with more necessity than creativity, of the design simply because they've long been in the toolkit. This doesn't mean that Chasny is looking to sell out by making pretty songs with flashy parts. Actually, this is less of a reach and more of an arrival at a foreseeable point. But Chansy, has worked on over two-dozen albums in the past decade, and he's rarely seemed short on muses or passions. Expect the mannerism here to yield to something wildly different very soon.","Ben Chasny's third Six Organs of Admittance Drag City release in three years is a a bright if humdrum collection of tracks that shine beneath the same layered production Tim Green recently lent to Citay's adventurous Little Kingdom.

"Mutantes ao Vivo: Barbican Theatre, Londres 2006",Os Mutantes,by: Mike Powell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b37613d197565213a948/1:1/w_160/1796b9a9.jpg,2007-11-21 06:00:01,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10905-mutantes-ao-vivo-barbican-theatre-londres-2006/,Luaka Bop,"The music made by Brazilian psych-pop band Os Mutantes in the late 1960s and early 70s is panic at its most colorful. Put on a song from one of their early albums, listen for five seconds, skip ahead 30, and you're likely to hear vastly different moods. Their 1999 retrospective was called Everything Is Possible! because, I guess, they actually believed it was, and all within the confines of three minutes: garage-rock boogie squirming under wailed Portuguese, bossa nova torn apart by homemade effects pedals, musical theater, sound effects, and the most unencumbered goofiness this side of first grade. It doesn't hurt that they founded the group as teenagers and that two of the group's main members, Arnaldo Baptista and Rita Lee, were compulsive acid-eaters (a ritual that likely precipitated Arnaldo's appearances at mental hospitals throughout the 70s). When they were upbeat, they sounded manic; when they were slothful or stoned, they sounded suicidal. (Arnaldo did, eventually, jump out a window. Improbably, he lived.) Noting their extremity isn't to overemphasize an underbelly in their music-- consider it ""romantic,"" if that seems less grisly-- but to acknowledge a delirium in their sound that distinguished them from both American psych-pop bands and the musicians working in Brazil's Tropicalia movement of the late 60s. Even when Mutantes brought sunshine-- the invincible puppy love of Caetano Veloso's ""Baby"" or the jammy ""Bat Macumba""-- they sounded frayed, ecstatic; more stagger than strut. When I interviewed Arnaldo Baptista's brother, Mutantes guitarist and vocalist Sergio Dias, last year, he talked about the intensity of sharing a stage with Arnaldo for the first time in 30 years: ""One stare, and it's like looking in the face of the sea, but you can see what lies underneath. The depths, they're abyssal."" Reunions tend to force hyperbole: People are either too excited or too skeptical of the event as an extra-musical experience to actually listen to it. This is unfortunate for bands, who are either uselessly congratulated or immediately dismissed, and for listeners, who have their minds made up a month in advance of the performance and would spare themselves worry by staying home. Mutantes put out a couple of wonderful albums (1968's Os Mutantes; 1970's Divina Comedia), but always benefitted from having a smartly chosen collection (the aforementioned Everything Is Possible!). Their first reunion show at London's Barbican Theatre in May 2006, like their whole career, is mixed. Many of the songs are suspect to begin with-- in the early 70s, Mutantes became wilier and more bombastic; the result is a mix of American hard rock and Jesus Christ Superstar more gauche than exciting-- but they also cover a lot of their best material: ""Ave Lucifer"", Jorge Ben's ""A Minha Menina"", ""Baby"", and ""Panis et Circences"". Much of Mutantes' seduction relied on the sound of their records-- the immaterial magic of messy analog recordings, the way sounds crush together-- so it's easy to feel apprehensive of lucid mixing-board documents. But whatever might've been lost in a gestalt wooziness or mystery is balanced out by clarity of performance: The sound is fuller and more clinically separated, bringing out horn lines, drum patterns, and countermelodies previously obscured by recording quality. A good metaphor for overall difference is in the female vocal presence. Mutantes' original singer, Rita Lee, was the narco-cuddlebunny incarnate: doe-eyed, absent-mindedly sexual, bashful, white fur hats, and a high, soft voice that sounded constantly on the verge of fluttering away from the song entirely. Lee and Baptista divorced in the early 70s, and she declined to participate in the reunion; a woman named Zelia Duncan took her place. Zelia is confident where Rita was self-effacing; her voice is deeper, woolier, and more soulful. Zelia Duncan has tattoos. Rita Lee would never get a tattoo. But it's not as simple as brash instinct versus composure or gush versus professionalism. Sergio Dias occasionally embarrasses-- his spoken-word intro about Sergio Mendes on ""Cantor de Mambo"", his apparent preference for perfunctory guitar solos-- but Arnaldo sounds almost unnervingly frazzled, a balloon to Sergio's rock. The band sounds overstaffed, and the overly bright, corny keyboard patches collide with the homemade effects pedals the band has used for forty years (designed by the eldest Dias brother, Claudio). Which is to say that it's as happily disjointed as the band always was, even if not quite as totemic or authentic-sounding. Many of the lyrics are sung in English, not Portuguese. Portuguese is a vastly prettier language. Some might see the translation as retroactive pandering. But on ""Panis et Circences"", a lyric emerges that non-Portuguese speakers would've never heard before: ""I want to sing a song illuminated by the sun."" The sun!: loving, essential, warming; also, incredibly dangerous. Hot potato. More power than we could ever understand. The metaphor is heavy-handed, sure, but this is a reunion, remember? Mutantes never touched the sun because the glory would've seemed to simple; instead, at their best, they approximated some of its most alluring and lasting contradictions.","This 2xCD live collection documents the famed Brazilian group's first reunion show, at London's Barbican Theatre in May 2006, and despite missing original singer Rita Lee, it still finds the band in full voice.

Hexes For Exes,Moving Units,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b34ec0084474cd0c20da/1:1/w_160/4a7afa59.jpg,2007-11-20 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10868-hexes-for-exes/,Metropolis,"Never exactly critical darlings, Los Angeles trio Moving Units has rested on the laurels of being one of the dance-punk revival's earliest progenitors-- at least that's what the band's fans will argue. Exercising this dance-punk grandfather clause is a highly dubious defense though, considering that a) the earlier dance-punk groups aren't, on the whole, necessarily better, and b) the Units are one sappy ballad away from having their revival membership rescinded. Whereas their 2004 debut Dangerous Dreams merely slapped dance elements together with a safety pin, Hexes For Exes waxes too sentimental to maintain the band's dance façade. As its bitter title and sulking opener ""Pink Thoughts"" practically proclaim, Hexes suffers from a pretty nasty Cure streak that runs through nearly every track. Unfortunately, Units frontman Blake Miller isn't Robert Smith, and his nasally tenor only exacerbates the album's lengthy stretches of self-loathing and romantic angst. Instrumentally the band pulls off a half-decent tour through 80s goth pop, tossing in four-on-the-floor drum beats more out of habit than necessity. Of course, there are some straightforward, stay-the-course dance tracks, most notably single ""Crash & Burn Victims"" and ""The Kids From Orange County"", but they fail to overcome the Units' vanilla songwriting. The only remotely engaging aspect of Hexes is the band's subtle transformation into a pop band. ""Wrong Again""-- hands-down the catchiest track here-- mines the quasi-ironic sunny pop of Cure's early 90s material, its bubblegum chorus atoning for a half-hearted faux-Interpol verse of droning guitars. With its quirky opening riff and bubbly bassline, ""Dark Walls"" sounds like a radio-friendlier take on Echo and the Bunnymen, a formula better refined on the more memorable ""Paper Hearts"". When Miller's feeling really down in the dumps though, he drags the band down with him. After dispensing some of his strongest hooks to date, Miller's at a loss for melody on mid-tempo numbers, often settling for cheap imitation Britpop (""Kings and Queens of Nothing"") or worse, indulging in his sensitive side and pulling out the acoustic (""Hearts Departed""). The fact that these purported heart-on-sleeve SOS signals sound so emotionless is the real tragedy lurking through the album. Although catchier than before, Miller never sounds anguished on Hexes but rather completely at ease as he croons over dance beats or equally stiff guitar riffs. Having formed in 2001, the band may precede the infestation of dance-punk Johnny-come-lately's, but they've never turned their headstart into any sort of musical advantage. Even sadder, Hexes's 80s fixation finds the band throwing their hat in an already over-saturated ring of Cure and Smiths soundalikes, a move that's pretty unoriginal, no matter how long you've been around.","Los Angeles trio and dancepunk survivors Moving Units here suffer from a pretty nasty Cure streak that runs through nearly every track.

Prism of the Eternal Now,White Rainbow,by: Zach Baron,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b32f5e6ef959693223ff/1:1/w_160/e031accf.jpg,2007-11-20 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10829-prism-of-the-eternal-now/,KrankyMarriage,"Adam Forkner, 31 years old, of Portland, Ore., shares his hometown's penchant for multiple aliases and solo work: stints as a Dirty Projector and a Jackie-O Motherfucker, founder of Yume Bitsu and Surface of Eceyon and World, solo as [[VVRSSNN]] and Soft Dolphin and Adam Forkner and White Rainbow. Forkner has the individualistic streak that endures in the area, handed down from the pioneers who settled the Pacific Northwest and whose descendants are his peers. Today, they work side-by-side but almost always separately, and rarely under their own names, posing as the Blow, Panther, YACHT, E*Rock, Silentist, Strategy, etc. Not surprising, for someone who grew up so deeply in thrall to Portland's simultaneously DIY and new age ethos, is Forkner's near-obsession with cults: Dr. Bronner's Moral ABCs, Unarius' Universal Articulate Interdimensional Understanding of Science, Scientology, Rastafarianism, Mormonism, and Father Yod's Source family and its belief in the Eternal Now, the last of which gave Forkner his album title. Forkner's confessed fascination with the cult surely had a hand in the ""White Rainbow Full-Spectrum Vibrational Healing Center"", an occasional museum piece and traveling installation involving video, lights, a canopy and several hours worth of live improv. Forker called it an opportunity to ""be able to explore sound with people,"" and to join with them as they come and go. Forkner, by his own account, has always been a bit terrified of impinging any further on anyone else, and now explains his time in his other bands as a way of mediating his own subjectivity-- writing songs to achieve a degree of removal. White Rainbow, however, signals a change. As he told The Fader, ""it was a mistake to think that people wouldn't want the straight tryyp."" Prism of the Eternal Now, goes the idea, is all Forkner. The Portland laptop posse-- not just White Rainbow-- has long agonized over how to bring their goods to market, a sentiment expressed best by Panther's Charlie Salas-Humara when he told the Portland Mercury that ""Panther is primarily about the performance. I'm proud of the music, most definitely, but it's a release for me."" Figuring out how to translate their communal yet independent style on record has been a local burden, one that perhaps explains the fact that the city has yet to produce a really fantastic solo studio album (the Blow being the exception that proves the rule, more so since the band's most cherished output was the result of a collaboration between Khaela Maricich and YACHT's Jona Bechtolt). Prism of the Eternal Now is the fifth White Rainbow release since 2005, and the third this year-- a quickening pace audible in new songs like ""Middle"", which sound almost metronomic, ticking like a clock yet to be invented. Belying Forkner's tendency to pose for publicity photographs in Grateful Dead t-shirts and loose white yoga outfits and to muse at length about ""The Now"" are his songs themselves, which are neither baggy nor ungrounded. White Rainbow's debts are to Terry Riley, to whom he dedicates a song, ""For Terry"", and to Brian Eno, whose Oblique Strategy cards he consults, rather than to, say, Spiritualized. As someone who works at length with loops and other static elements, Forkner's too focused to scramble anybody's mind, including his own. Best are his sober psychedelics: the hissy jungle navigations of ""Warm Clicked Fruit"", the early Pink Floyd planetary spacing of ""For Terry"", and the Beaches and Canyons gurgling of ""Big Drop"". True to his own word, Forkner's attempts to jam-- to write songs-- stiffen up what's otherwise just the right degree of pliant. The rounding bongos on ""Pulses"" and ""Mystic Prism"" were better left at the fairground; the mechanical reproductions that circle through ""Middle"" could better haunt the hard-drive they were eventually taped off of. Forkner's best instincts as an artist are to do no harm-- to lay it out open-ended, to imply, even encourage a kind of all-encompassing unity without being too pushy about it. In this, his work faces the same cult dilemma with which he is obsessed, and about which he once wrote: ""What fascinates me in all of this has always been the perpetual dialectic between enlightened spiritual purity and all-too-human melodrama.""","Portland's Adam Forkner is a busy guy; after founding both Yume Bitsu and Surface of Eceyon, this is his fifth solo album in three years as White Rainbow, his alias for exploring minimalism and drones inspired by Terry Riley and Brian Eno.

Parades,Efterklang,by: Andrew Gaerig,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b346c0084474cd0c20ce/1:1/w_160/9cbbe4ec.jpg,2007-11-20 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10854-parades/,Leaf,"On their lauded 2004 debut, Tripper, Efterklang took an ""If you build it, they will come"" approach to pop music. The Danish quintet manicured warm, abstracted orchestrations and nervy electronics and patiently waited for the hooks to arrive; that these hooks sometimes-- but only sometimes-- did was the album's great charm. Parades, the group's follow-up, incorporates the same elements but marks a sea change in approach and execution: downtempo indie pop ousted for ribald chants, martial percussion, and trumped-up circumstance. To Efterklang's credit, Parades comes off about as smoothly as a sea change can, inarguably the product of the same band playing with the same toys. The shift towards more boldly defined pop is real, though: Under Giant Trees, a mini-album released this spring, debuted at the top of the Danish singles chart. Even Trees, though, feels like a halfway post on the path to Parades. Where the band previously garnered comparisons to Sigur Rós and Rachel's, they now skew closer to the skyward, communal missives of Danielson or Arcade Fire. Efterklang are less visceral than those bands, though, as they privilege viscous, loopy passages over sustained momentum. Efterklang's carefully tended electronic touches are more subdued, replaced by increasingly ostentatious horns and strings. Refrains are severed and discarded, verses are obscured by a green film. Efterklang's five swell to ten and twenty, yell then scatter. Rallies, then, might've been the better title, sharing a parade's celebration but suggesting intermittent clamor rather than linear pageantry. ""Mirador"" slides from fevered strut into a monkish quiet before regaining its fortitude. ""Caravan"" is the recipient of the album's art-rockiest touch: a boys choir, whose surgical harmonies fly in the face of Parades' most rhythmically sturdy arrangement. ""Cutting Ice to Snow""'s acoustic jangle and unmolested piano border on quaint, though damn if Efterklang don't use those album-closing moments as a prelude to one last huzzah. The creeping electric piano and summoning chants of ""Frida Found a Friend"" offer refreshing dissonance in the middle of the album's pastel overload. Each song is augmented by indiscernible-- and therefore effectively wordless-- choruses on which the band repeatedly aims for rapture. Parades is nothing if not eventful. You would think, though, that a band that trades tempos, styles, and moods as often as Efterklang would be a bit more...dynamic? Parades' recipe-- soft verse, big chant, heavenly ""aaaaaaaaa"", elliptical, Nordic orchestrations, stir-- is clever to avoid repetition but extremely taxing. Must every track aspire to a 12-act epic? The band would've done well to pace themselves-- ""Him Poe Poe""'s Spartan repetitions and two-minute duration are an example of how Efterklang might've eased the pedal more often. Perhaps that's the point, though-- Efterklang spent most of Tripper in patient meditation. Tired of waiting for it to come to them, Efterklang unshackle themselves on Parades, a sober, decisive grasp at grandeur.","Where this Danish band previously garnered comparisons to Sigur Rós and Rachel's, they now skew closer to the skyward, communal missives of Danielson or Arcade Fire.

Red Carpet Massacre,Duran Duran,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b37bb1335d7bf169a5d5/1:1/w_160/2bf205e6.jpg,2007-11-20 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10910-red-carpet-massacre/,Epic,"It was a pretty well kept secret, but a few years ago the original lineup of Duran Duran reunited. No, really, they even recorded an album, Astronaut. That might not ring a bell, but people still flocked to the band's shows in hopes of hearing its enviously huge cache of instantly recognizable hits. Among them, we may be able to count Timbaland, Justin Timberlake and Danja. The three play a major supporting-- some might suggest driving-- role on Duran Duran's album Red Carpet Massacre. It's a marketing dream, and in theory it's an inspired collaboration. After all, Duran Duran want nothing less than to be relevant in 2007, while Timbaland (and to a lesser extent, Timberlake) want nothing more than be relevant in 1987. (One dissenter turned out to be guitarist Andy Taylor, who jumped ship early into production.) Duran Duran have always known their way around rhythm, and while a disc of potential remix fodder might mean contemporary success on the Euro club scene, to hit the pop big leagues once again Duran Duran has to sell itself to a generation raised on hip-hop and r&b. Yet while Timbaland, Timberlake, hell, even Danja are certified hit makers, no one-- the band included-- brings much to the table to work with on Red Carpet Massacre, which is uneven at best even compared to Duran Duran's long player legacy. ""The Valley"" is a convincing re-introduction to the band-- especially when that slap bass sneaks in under its pulse-- and the synths on the title track should ring a few bells. But the double time beat is all wrong for the group, a surface stab at something aggressive that comes off pale and half-hearted. Then things go really screwy. ""Nite-Runner"" features both Timberlake and Timbaland, and in fact might have easily fit on the former's last record. Alas, Simon Le Bon was never much of a singer, and he struggles to carry the song just as the listener struggles to hear Timberlake's guide vocal (the same way you can strain to hear Prince preening beneath the surface of ""Manic Monday""). It's doubly distracting that the song barely sounds like a band product at all. Truth be told, it probably would have worked better as a stand-alone track, stuck on a soundtrack perhaps. The Timberlake production ""Falling Down"", the album's first single, is a listless ballad that would have been better off given to Timber pal JC Chasez, since Duran Duran doesn't quite know what to do with its generic plod besides add one of the most unexciting guitar solos in recent memory over its draggy coda. It's an unfortunate lead to the disc's true turn to the lame with the boring acoustic jingle ""Box Full O Honey"", which aims for mystery and cinematic majesty but comes nowhere near either. Timbo's ""Skin Divers"" starts off like a pale rewrite of Britney's ""Gimme More"" but would have worked a lot better in the mold of one of Duran Duran's meatier classics rather than its thin, faux-pop incarnation. Timba track ""Zoom In"" is yet another reminder that the farther the super-producer veers from his strengths the less noteworthy his output becomes. Duran Duran admirably strive to be contemporary with Red Carpet Massacre, but considering what they've cobbled together, it's hard to imagine anyone would be convinced by this wan culture grab. The problem isn't that Red Carpet Massacre pushes Duran Duran out of their comfort zone. The problem is that they sound just a little too comfortable there to make the most of bad situation.","Duran Duran hook up with Timbaland and Justin Timberlake in a further bid for the immortality the band deservedly achieved three decades ago.

Alive 2007,Daft Punk,by: Ryan Dombal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Features Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b38d13d197565213a96b/1:1/w_160/fe5c8b82.jpg,2007-11-20 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10925-alive-2007/,Virgin,"The blitzing ""Pimp My Pyramid"" scheme. The pulsing honeycomb. The tiny metal heads bobbing up and down. The Lite-Brite leather jacket reveal. The dude in front of me who wouldn't let a pair of crutches stop him from dancing as if the apocalypse were mere minutes away. The sensual explosion that was Daft Punk's Alive 2007 show is difficult to overstate-- or reproduce. Even with the biggest, flattest, sharpest HD set-up, there's no way to sufficiently recreate the most exuberant LED-laden music blowout ever staged. So Daft Punk didn't even try: There will be no Alive 2007 DVD. Commenting on the decision, Daft Punk's Thomas Bangalter recently told Pitchfork, ""The thousands of clips on the internet are better to us than any DVD that could have been released."" And, in many ways, the Alive tour is a perfect match for YouTube-- the ancient Egypt by-way-of ""The Jetsons"" spectacle barrelling its way through shitty compression quality with blinding force. But still, even the most hectic web clip can't equal the French duo's visceral sound-and-vision assault, so the focus of Alive 2007 falls on the reason why Daft Punk were allowed to lug 11 tons of equipment around the world for the last 19 months in the first place: their music. Playing like a flawlessly sequenced and paced greatest hits album, this full-set Paris recording from June finds Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo connecting the booms among their three albums while officially cementing one of the year's most rewarding and welcomed comebacks. Lest we forget, before the out-of-nowhere debut of the now-iconic 3D triangle in April 2006, it seemed like Daft Punk lost the plot. The monster riffage and mind-numbing gloom of 2005's Human After All had our favorite party-starters turning downright nihilistic. And early screenings of their art-house opus, Electroma, evoked (unfortunately accurate) comparisons to Vincent Gallo's on-the-road/oral sex epic Brown Bunny (except with endless scenes of hunk-o-metal ennui filling in for the graphic oral sex). After the shattering pop breakthrough of 2001's Discovery, Daft Punk were going through an especially angsty adolescence-- their spit-shined heads way up their own asses. But then, amped-up with enough electricity to illuminate a black hole, French house's masked men upstaged Madonna, previous electronic pioneers Depeche Mode, and (ironically) Kanye West at 2006's Coachella. And now, they're everywhere (except Gap ads, thankfully)-- getting sampled on no. 1 hip-hop songs, filling magazine spreads, spawning worthy would-be successors and, of course, owning the internet (on Flickr, Daft Punk photos currently outnumber Justin Timberlake snaps 2:1). With a bounty of latent good will on their side thanks to the incredible re-playability of their first two albums, Daft Punk finally gave fans a million flashing reasons to fall in love with them all over again. One of the most remarkable aspects of Alive 2007 is how well it recontextualizes career nadir Human After All, turning previously leaden songs into ebullient rock'n'roll manifestos; injected with Homework's air-tight Moroder-style anthems or Discovery's flamboyant funk, Human After All tracks are constantly improved and born anew. The live set doesn't simply run through the hits, mindlessly segueing from one smash to another. Instead, well-worn favorites are glued together, cut-up and mashed into pieces. The titular refrains of ""Television Rules the Nation"" and ""Around the World"" combine to form the globe's most dance-friendly TV station theme song before the Black Sabbath crunch of ""Television"" is sent down upon the impossibly buoyant ""Crescendolls"", resulting in the disc's most unlikely-yet-spectacular roller coaster peak. Meanwhile, the creepy hiss of ""Steam Machine"" is atomized and given space-age dynamics, turning it from a oddball bore into a fist-pumping celebration of the industrial age. Wisely, the duo also know when to let the bass be, allowing large portions of unfuckwithable classics like ""Da Funk"" and ""Burnin'"" to work their magic with little robo-meddling. Even without video, Alive 2007 is an exercise in exacting excess, from the blaring ""Robot Rock"" intro to a wide-eyed power-booster of a encore that layers ""One More Time"" atop ""Music Sounds Better With You""-- a combination so ""holy shit"" ecstatic it would seem downright cocky if it wasn't so blissful. Talking about the relationship between artist and audience, Bangalter told Paper, ""Robots don't make people feel like there's an idol on stage. It's more like a rave party where the DJ isn't important. We are two robots in this pyramid with this light show, but everything is [meant] for you to have fun and enjoy yourself."" He's absolutely right about the ""have fun and enjoy yourself"" bit, but the Alive tour separated itself from the millions of DJ parties before it by drawing attention to a fixed point while incorporating everything from KISS-esque pomp to Space Invaders retro-future shock. The results were massive-- the myriad ""best show ever"" kudos deserved. And, just as they hold back their identities at every chance, it makes sense for Daft Punk to hold back the Alive visuals; when more and more mystery is constantly being sucked out of popular music thanks to the insatiable hunger for fresh product and up-to-the-nanosecond information, the duo aren't about to release an imagination-stifling DVD filled with behind-the-scenes tour bus inanity. It's a noble choice, especially when the consolation prize happens to be the Ultimate Daft Punk Mixtape.","Playing like a flawlessly sequenced and paced greatest hits album, this live set finds Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo connecting the booms among their three albums while officially cementing one of the year's most rewarding and welcomed comebacks.

Not Athlete specifically, but it's tough to imagine a time when the world will be hurting for easier-to-license Coldplays or final straws (ahem) that let college freshman know that all those free NMEs in the music library have completely destroyed their ability to properly evaluate rock from the British Isles. Considering the likes of Athlete are as fungible as Denver Broncos running backs, it's probably not wise for them to be three albums deep and still trying to get in where they fit in. At least the instrumental ""In Between 2 States"" is a pretty onramp for the rest of Beyond the Neighbourhood but it's hard for Athlete to be the stadium goliaths they see themselves as when their strongest track could pass for an Album Leaf B-side. ""Airport Disco"", more Terminal 5-D than Studio 54, has Joel Potts moaning ""I want to take you home with me tonight"" in a voice so bored that you'd think he was talking about a kitchen appliance. The most exciting sonic tweak is the booming hip-hop beat that begins ""The Outsiders"", and it lasts about a second before reverting back to an acoustic/drum machine lullaby with strained double-tracked vocals and a hook that manages to be simultaneously forced and aimless. It's not really the melody of ""The Outsiders"" that sinks the song so much as the lyrical conceit ""we are the outsiders,"" a sentiment of which these straightlaced chancers have no real concept. There's a sense of impotence that streaks through Beyond the Neighbourhood, with Potts wishing for the chance to fight Important Band fights but never evincing a desire to really work that hard for it. ""This Is What I Sound Like"" rambles in search of resonance, begging for some cause to align with before admitting ""I'm not making any sense."" ""Hurricane"" has echoey guitar licks that imply grandiosity in a Longwave sort of way, but it's spoiled by the literal moaning about disappearing coastlines and cod eco-concerns like ""I don't wanna run/ I've been here since I was young/ Whoa this city day could be gone within the hour."" It would certainly be to their benefit if they could cobble together platitudes or even melodies that stick, but they can't even do that right; ""Tokyo"" could be the most turgid song ever written about Godzilla for all we know. Their last two records found them about six months behind the prevailing Brit trend, and that hasn't changed on Beyond The Neighbourhood. Like Simian Mobile Disco, they've become their own producers and professed their increased debt to electronic and dance music, but this shift has the completely opposite effect on Athlete, who sound like a band that believes David Gray's malnourished, defeated A New Day at Midnight remains the climax of singer/songwriter flirtation with technology. Without someone to bounce ideas with, they indiscriminately tack classy-sounding loops and keyboards onto songs that are even more hermetic and lifeless than before, and too many listens will likely result in a realization that our time on earth is indeed too short. Beyond the Neighbourhood is the sonic equivalent of a beautiful coffin.","Latest record from Coldplay soundalikes who comes across like a band that believes David Gray's malnourished, defeated A New Day at Midnight remains the climax of singer/songwriter flirtation with technology.

As guitarist for the overlooked 1990s band Medicine-- the first American group signed to UK label Creation-- he used a four-track recorder as a distortion pedal. As Electric Company, he crafted intricate, jarring IDM from bits of music and found sound. Now, with the release of what he calls his ""first proper solo album"", Laner has made his own version of a psychedelic folk-rock record, drawing upon his affinities for dense, layered compositions and shape-shifting song structures, in the process quietly slipping into 2007's sunny electro-psych-revival with Caribou and Panda Bear. Neighbor Singing opens by announcing in no uncertain terms where Laner's muse has taken him. First track ""Find Out"" is a well-executed raga-rock pastiche that liberally quotes the frantic guitar work and hymnal vocalizing of the Byrds' ""Eight Miles High"" while foregrounding Laner's own busy, blissed-out serenity. ""Out Cold"" follows, a spacey hodgepodge of hallucinatory country-folk held together by Laner's preternaturally calm melisma. Next is the boundless, drifting ""Lovely World"", which seems to have taken its titular inspiration from an astronaut's perspective. Mirroring the trajectory of his own career, Neighbor's focus can wander a bit, and many songs don't take a shape as much as coalesce around a flickering sensation. A case in point is the all-too-brief ""Arlie"", on which his most fragile melody-- a tender apology somewhere between Brian Wilson and Mark Linkous of Sparklehorse-- hovers temporarily in a thick haze of echoed piano and Mellotron, then slowly disappears. Yet even Laner's more meandering moments on Neighbor reflect more upon his past experience with sound-sculptures-- or, in the case of ""Falling Time"", recreate them directly-- than a drift toward navel-gazing. Most importantly, though, Neighbor is Brad Laner's return to making a guitar record, one that shows he is still finding ways to extract as many mangled and gorgeous sounds from his instrument as ever. Sharing space with his soft, gossamer vocals and keyboard flourishes, the axe frequently makes its presence known. Part of ""Out Cold""'s paisley collage is a digitally-treated, high-frequency ""Tangerine""-type solo; ""Alambres"" and ""Vecino"" (Spanish for ""neighbor"") alternate Latin American picking with dirty psych smears; ""June Gloom"" vacillates between robotic acoustic strums and all-out dissonance. Neighbor's scope is wrapped up and encapsulated on its final song, ""Circumscribe"", which completely engulfs a bottleneck slide moment with a coda of whooshing, clattering noise. It's an appropriate finishing flourish for a record that executes so well its author's quick bursts of inspiration, packaging them within an aesthetic that threatens, but never fully implodes. Laner himself explains best in a slightly different context, in his last lyrics on the record: ""We're not talking 'til all you've dissembled is made right.""","Former leader of Medicine and Electric Company makes his own version of a psychedelic folk-rock record, quietly slipping into 2007's sunny electro-psych-revival with Caribou and Panda Bear.

Discovered: A Collection of Daft Funk Samples,Various Artists,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3439d034d5c69bf4cb4/1:1/w_160/0e067d22.jpg,2007-11-19 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10852-discovered-a-collection-of-daft-funk-samples/,Rapster,"There's a catch to tracking down the origins of sample-based music, and it goes beyond the standard questions of how significantly a producer changes the context of a song or how much money they might have paid for the rights to do so. That catch comes when you scan the liner notes for sample credits and discover that the source material of your favorite beat is terrible. ""Peter Piper"" and ""They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)"" are stone classics, but have you ever tried to listen to Bob James' ""Take Me to the Mardi Gras"" or Tom Scott's ""Today"" in their entirety? Not exactly the weightiest stuff. The RZA and Jason Forrest and Juicy J & DJ Paul make great beats because they find new avenues of greatness for already entertaining music-- Al Green, Creedence, Willie Hutch, etc.-- but it's also impressive when a producer builds a pop music marvel out of someone else's schlock. It's no secret that a lot of Daft Punk's best work is sample-heavy, though the revelation of their songs' source material is too often met with a bit of man-behind-the-curtain disappointment by the group's more easily disillusioned fans. A widely-viewed YouTube video montage entitled ""Where Daft Punk Got Their Samples From"" starts with the caption ""I [heart] Daft Punk-- but..."" ""But"" what? They got some of their best hooks from wonky jazz-funk and Barry Manilow? Uh oh, time to retract that ""unconditional"" status. If Discovered: A Collection of Daft Funk Samples proves anything, it isn't that Daft Punk are surreptitious thieves-- it's that they're transformative reinterpreters, and in more than a few cases, flat-out miracle workers. Discovered pulls a neat trick by starting with the one song Daft Punk obviously cribbed from without actually managing to improve upon-- ""Release the Beast"", the 1980 song from Philly group Breakwater that was notoriously looped for Human After All's ""Robot Rock"". The Daft Punk track crumbles within a 10-foot radius of the original, a towering edifice of electro-funk that sounds like an army of rampaging Rick James clones copping AC/DC moves to a fist-pumping synth/guitar riff. All ""Robot Rock"" did was take out the fun parts: the close-harmony vocals, the mid-chorus guttural exhortations, and the intricacy of the rhythm guitar. And the ending air-raid siren, for that matter. There's a couple other good songs on here, like Cerrone's intense Italo hit ""Supernature"" and Karen Young's likably campy Dr. Buzzard's knockoff ""Hot Shot"", but it takes a lot of straining to hear them as sample sources: The former is unrecognizably pitchshifted and slowed down for ""Veridis Quo"", while the latter is reduced to a miniscule snippet on ""Indo Silver Club"". There's also Chaka Khan's peerless post-disco classic ""Fate"", sampled for ""Music Sounds Better With You"", the 1998 club smash that Daft Punk's Thomas Bangalter recorded with fellow house producer Alan Braxe and vocalist Benjamin Diamond. Epochal as that single is, it's the only instance on Discovered where a Daft Punk member took a recognizable portion of an already great song and made it shine in a different context. Too bad this collection misleadingly includes a house remix that bears little resemblance to the original 1981 version Bangalter and Braxe sampled-- which brings the comp into an area of meta so perplexing it's best to just completely ignore its ramifications and chalk it up to copyright issues. Whatever its intent, Discovered mostly proves that the more recognizable one of its songs is as a Daft Punk sample source, the less likely it is to stand alone as an enjoyable track. There's some small amusement in hearing the intro to Little Anthony & the Imperials' ""Can You Imagine"", which provided the buoyant little riff and the ""heeeeey/ Ain't it funky y'all/ Wheeee/ Whooo"" vocal refrain for ""Crescendolls"", but its lower pitch makes it feel oddly sluggish compared to the Daft Punk track, and once it gets into the heart of the song-- idealistic but dopey vocals about ""a world free of pain/ a world where color is only a name"" and a backing groove that almost sounds funky enough to score ""The Love Boat""-- it starts sounding like what it really is: a grab for a slice of the circa-77 disco pie from an R&B group who recorded their best and biggest hit in 1964. Edwin Birdsong's ""Cola Bottle Baby"", looped and then chopped to smithereens on ""Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger"", sounds similarly lethargic, although if you're enough into post-Headhunters funk fusion it could be enjoyable-- as long as you can ignore Edwin's labored ""fizz fizz fizz"" lyrics. And without the euphoric vocoder vocals, pulsing heartbeat bass, and X'ed-up Eddie Van Halen solo of ""Digital Love"" to give it its rightful context, the intro of George Duke's ""I Love You More"" plummets off a cliff into a goopy slab of doe-eyed uptempo fuzak. It's all a little like finding out that one of the spaceships in the background of Star Wars' Death Star trench run scene was actually a shoe.","This collection of Daft Punk sample source material indicates that they're transformative reinterpreters, and in more than a few cases, flat-out miracle workers.

D Sides,Gorillaz,by: Stephen Trouss,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b38ac0084474cd0c213f/1:1/w_160/164fef2e.jpg,2007-11-19 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10922-d-sides/,EMI,"In 2007, pop renaissance man Damon Albarn continued to work at an almost unrivaled pace, unveiling both his psychogeographic London concept suite/supergroup the Good, the Bad and the Queen and writing and staging his first opera, Monkey: Journey to the West, at the Manchester International Festival. Now as the year draws to a close, almost as an afterthought, he's put together another peculiarly rewarding double album of Gorillaz outtakes, B-sides and, remixes. Gorillaz is the kind of project that used to define adventurous British pop-- a love of African-American music combined with an art school interest in multimedia presentation. These days you could argue that it's precisely Jamie Hewlett's animated mask-- the cartoonface, if you will-- that's given Albarn the license to monkey around with hip-hop in a way to gladden the heart of the Sasha Frere-Jones' of the world. It's provided the necessary distraction from the otherwise overwhelming image of a pasty old white English indie dude deciding to make records with Dan the Automator, Dangermouse, and De La Soul. The first disc of this double album set is evenly split between sketches and absolute gems. ""People"" is an early demo of the irresistably bubblefunk ""Dare"" which demonstrates, by his absence, what a canny idea it was to recruit Shaun Ryder. ""Rockit"" is an amusing one-off, a parodically uninspired slice of cockney geezer electro that might have been knocked out by Ian Dury in an off moment. But tracks like ""We Are Happy Landfill"" and ""Murdoc Is God"" feel like studio doodles that got out of hand. The best songs, ironically, aren't really Gorillaz tunes at all, but seem to have wound up here for want of a better home. ""Hong Kong"", a beautiful late-night urban lament-- filigreed with Chinese zither played by Zeng Zhen-- was an encore and heart-stopping highlight of the Gorillaz stage show, but was originally commissioned by the charity Warchild and feels like an Albarn solo song in all but name. And the same could be said for ""Stop The Dams"", a lovely, moving Icelandic protest song, complete with oddball rant from Einar Örn, once of the Sugarcubes. The second disc consists of some dutiful remixes of ""Dare"" and ""Feel Good Inc"" from the DFA, Soulwax, and Hot Chip, but is notably chiefly for an absolute hash of a remake of ""Kids With Guns"" courtesy of the would-be English street urchin Jamie T. More rewarding by far is the ""Chinese NY"" reimagining of ""Dirty Harry"" in Mandarin. 2007 ends with rumours of a full Blur reunion scotched once more, and reports of a full-length Gorillaz movie in production. You wonder if Albarn is spurred to all this solo and side-project activity by the refusal of Graham Coxon to rejoin the fold, the failure of his original band to properly regroup. If so, ideally the reunion will be infinitely postponed, giving us several more projects with the wit and daffy ingenuity of Gorillaz rather than the prospect of one more conventional careerist rock record.","Damon Albarn's cartoon band bows out with a double-disc set of B-sides, outtakes, and remixes.

11:11,Mac Lethal,by: Evan McGarvey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a23013d19756521387ee/1:1/w_160/03f243e5.jpg,2007-11-19 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10875-1111/,Rhymesayers,"The de facto Paul Wall of Rhymesayers (not political like Brother Ali, not confessional like Slug, not, well, anywhere near the quality of MF DOOM), Mac Lethal sticks around his home town of Kansas City and its middle-class kinda-white collar, kinda-blue collar environs. On his label debut, 11:11, that means dispensing cordial party anthems (""Pound That Beer"") with Big 12 fight song handclaps and plenty of social realism (a glib survey of Mac's working-class buddies and foils on ""Know It All""). Technically, Mac's more ambitious than his tools will allow. When he tries to spiral into gatling-gun assonance his breath control fails him, vowels indecipherable from gasps. He's got more than his share of annoying habits: telling everyone what a song is about before the song starts, and trying balance out his everyman, toothless ""I get sad too!"" melancholy with the Marxism so many indie-rappers seem to adore. But Lethal isn't naïve. His previous Love Potion compilations-- released on Kansas City label Black Clover-- have chugged along for about half a decade. He knows his audience enough to hate the same things they hate, and to keep tongue firmly in cheek when he compares a girl's body to a bottle of Shiraz and namechecks Cool Water Cologne. For God's sake, he proudly barks: ""I used to like Tool!"" You keep looking, prodding, interrogating 11:11's thin 14 tracks for something more than the aesthetic of average-ness, the homogenized middle-class confessions and triumphs and complaints-- ""this world is plastic and fake/ And I was born a few generations late""-- and you dig up bland string screeches, typically ""jazzy"" independent rap drum loops, and a few subversive giggles-- ""a gun named Corey Feldman and a gun named Corey Haim!"" Despite Mac Lethal's faults and deficiencies, he's a local boy, and it's probably no coincidence that when he settles and focuses on his hometown he actually loosens up and finds a way to blend his Puckish tendency with social pulls. The album closes with the almost beautiful ""Sun Storm"" where Lethal praises the wind on the Great Plains, and paints KC as over a warm acoustic: ""I'm from the Meth lab city of broken dreams and cracked out dopamine's/ Where everybody looking for an ocean scene/ Where Pac and Big are passé cause back home/ We speak in terms of Mack Dre and Fat Tone."" Through all the labels and veils and we finally get down to what Mac Lethal believes in-- Kansas City first, everything else second.","This Kansas City MC tackles everyman melancholoy and social realism on his Rhymesayers debut.

Mountain Home,Mountain Home,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b33cc0084474cd0c20bd/1:1/w_160/78d36c05.jpg,2007-11-16 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10845-mountain-home/,Language of Stone,"The ongoing psych/folk resurgence has birthed countless curiosities, unpolished gems, and treasures designed to sound just like their once-buried inspirations. Yet it's also required a tremendous suspension of disbelief that in this day and age so many are embracing the aesthetics of bygone eras with the same fervor as Renaissance fair revelers and exacting Civil War reenactors. The scene's so lacking in irony it's practically ironic. The second release from Drag City affiliate Language of Stone-- the label run by Greg Weeks (of the Espers) and wife Jessica Weeks (of Woodwose)-- Mountain Home's self-titled debut collects such (maybe not so) strange bedfellows as Shining Path guitarist Ilya Monosov, buddy Joshua Blatchley, Kristin Sherer, Marissa Nadler, and Greg Weeks himself. Yet the five-song disc is so spare, so reserved, so removed from the usual cluttered collective approach that credits are almost superfluous. In fact, it's so easy to get caught up in the carefully fostered and savvily promoted self-seriousness of the psych/folk scene, which features so much naval-gazing its adherents are practically doing summersaults, that every once in a while it's best to ignore the proper names and credits and just go with the music. Mountain Home's brand of glacial, haunted songs comes from such an eerily pure place that it's virtually otherworldly. It works like noise canceling headphones, shutting out the world and pulling your attention exclusively to the songs themselves. It's music meant not only to clear your mind, but expand it as well. Or so we might assume. Maybe Mountain Home designed the disc for washing the dishes. But there's something unavoidably compelling about the opening ""The Sparrow"" that transcends coffeehouse musings and autumnal daydreams. There's a tension to the song drawn from the subtle addition and subtraction to and from the already scant instrumentation, with the closing subcutaneous drone of strings and harmonium a powerful punctuation mark to a track that might otherwise have trailed off as ellipses. ""Battle, We Were"" is more of the same-- with an emphasis on more, though even at over ten minutes the song doesn't overstay its welcome. Does it need that much time to say what it needs to say? No. But like ""The Sparrow"" its effects are cumulative, so what's the rush? The rest of the disc plays out in similar fashion, albeit with slight but significant variations. ""Comes, the Winter"" is bookended by abrasive dentist's drill drones, the startling intro drawing back until the hum of the harmonium is brought into better focus (though not as cleanly as the crystalline guitar). The traditional murder ballad ""Omie Wise"" includes fragmented banjo and spectral vocal swells, and when the song goes silent for a nearly imperceptivity short breath, the effect calls attention to the appropriately Gothic vocals once they resume: ""Hold me, dear Omie, tell to you my mind/ My mind is to drown you and leave you behind."" It's some spooky shit, as is the next traditional track ""Nottamun Town"", which could be a surreal account of the last moments before death (and allegedly may be one inspiration for Dylan's ""Masters of War""). ""Ten thousand stood round me, and yet I's alone,"" sings Blatchley, as if from the perspective of a fallen soldier watching the battle go on around him before all goes dark. If you do manage to suspend disbelief, you might just buy that there's something deeper to this most formal of formalist exercises than an archivist's curiosity, ear for good material, and knack for imitation. Suspend disbelief, and you just might buy that Mountain Home is serious about keeping this music alive for another generation of imitators.","Spooky faux-traditional folk that falls eerily close to the real thing, Mountain Home, like its titular inspiration, helps you tune out the rest of the world.

To All Dead Sailors,Christian Kiefer,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b34a13d197565213a8fe/1:1/w_160/a989117d.jpg,2007-11-16 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10860-to-all-dead-sailors/,Camera Obscura,"Christian Kiefer and Jefferson Pitcher aren't the most obvious of collaborators. Kiefer is an indie-folk balladeer that parlays his gentle voice and dusky acoustic guitar into haunting blurs of tone and melody (think a dronier Iron & Wine). Pitcher is a Northern Californian sound artist that explores the possibilities of field recordings, feedback, and prepared guitars. Then again, Kiefer habitually renders the naturalistic strange, while Pitcher makes the strange sound natural. On this nautically themed collaboration, which purportedly draws inspiration from the poetry of Pablo Neruda and the fiction of Jose Saramago, Kiefer and Pitcher find each other precisely at the seam where their mirror-image aesthetics meet. As a result, there are no jarring moments when one collaborator overtakes the other. To All Dead Sailors displays a fluid undulation from starry indie-folk to inert sound collage and back again, never breaking its lulling wave-like motion along the way. Kiefer and Pitcher share vocal duties on the album, and their voices will make or break this project for most listeners: In a mostly understated record, they're as overt as a neon signs, and their inflections can be tender to the point of preciosity. But as long as you've a decently high threshold for the saccharine, they're terrific-- both singers sound gracefully open and velvety, playing off of each other so seamlessly that it's difficult to tell where one ends and the other begins. The vocal presence on this album can evoke Rufus Wainwright when it's low, with subtle vibrato; Ben Gibbard when it's high and airy; Holopaw's John Orth when tensed and straining, always moving without friction between these modes. To All Dead Sailors, mirroring the singers' tone, is dense with longing. Each song seems to strain against the boundary of its simple instrumental palette, as if the depth of feeling contained inside exceeds the size of the well. After a mood-setting field recording of waves and seagulls, ""Ship Under Sand"" slowly gathers a melancholy electric guitar figure and bending foghorn-like tones into an ominous dirge, which spills into ""The Captain"", a chiming hymn that features the first instance of the recurring lyrical and melodic motif, ""Oh Captain, bring me home."" Kiefer and Pitcher invoke this captain throughout the album, alternately in tones of salvation and damnation: ""The Captain leads the ship into the rocks/ The watchmen will sleep there with the fishes,"" Kiefer warns on the banjo-flecked lullaby ""Carpenters and Sailors"". ""Erendira and the Ocean"" features the first reprise of the ""Oh Captain"" refrain, this time amid bright flashes of nylon strings. The sparse instrumentation and existential despair of ""Burial at Sea"" evoke Damien Jurado at his most retiring, and ""Astrolabe"" is a churning trail song (although the trail happens to lead to Mars). Pitcher's experimental presence flickers through all of these otherwise trad tunes, and becomes overt in the elegant abstract passages that interleave them. ""Marconi Brings the Cypher"" finds Kiefer's thinned-out voice tracing a fragile melody through vanishing chimes; it's equal parts the submerged rumble of Sailor Winters and the nebulous discomfort of early Nick Drake. ""The Engineer's Dream"" barely exists; it's just a music box tinkle buried in a distant roar. The curtains of reverb-heavy guitar on ""The Mermaid and the Drunks"" grind down nauseously, like a radio expending the last of its battery charge. Given the glut of indie-folk records that render the sea's mysteries in similar trappings-- sampled birds, weary harmonies, and dusty acoustic strings-- you couldn't be blamed for finding the conceit a bit tiresome by now. But this duo's sly embellishments, potent voices, and weighty songwriting makes To All Dead Sailors well-worth enlisting for one more voyage. Bonus points for not succumbing to the siren song of the sea chantey, one of indie music's most overused tricks as of late.","Indie-folk balladeer Christian Kiefer and Northern Californian sound artist Jefferson Pitcher team for a nautically themed collaboration, which purportedly draws inspiration from the poetry of Pablo Neruda and the fiction of Jose Saramago.

Black Hollywood,Camp Lo,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b33513d197565213a8de/1:1/w_160/637581ef.jpg,2007-11-16 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10837-black-hollywood/,Traffic Entertainment,"Camp Lo were underrated even when 1996's ""Luchini AKA This Is It"" put them in the position to be rated at all, but that has to be far preferable to any station they've held since. Over the past decade, they've been faded by endless label woes, commercial indifference, and a special kind of bad luck that had them catching shit for doing guest spots on both Big Willie Style and Bazooka Tooth. And now, five years after Let's Do It Again proved as memorable as a piss at 3 a.m., Black Hollywood is being released on an imprint I've never heard of, and I've seen sales on Lean Cuisines at my local supermarket that got better promotion. If they had an Industry Shakedown or Hell Hath No Fury in them, it probably wouldn't be enjoyable, but it would certainly be understandable. But you don't get to call yourself Sonny Cheeba and Geechi Suede if you can't play it cool, and Black Hollywood is almost every bit as frozen in time as the duo's 1997 record Uptown Saturday Night. Not only have they conveniently forgotten or ignored everything that's happened from 1997-2007, they still act like the two decades before that never happened, either. Nostalgia fucks up more rap careers than incarceration, but rather than lament a time when the art form was realer, Camp Lo appeal to anyone who could tell Clyde Frazier was the shit just by looking at a picture of him. More than telling stories or doling out punchlines, Cheeba and Suede stack images and loaded code words, leaving much to the imagination by setting scenes of top-shelf liquor, potent marijuana, and women who dress like they're on location at an OutKast video shoot. Yeah, much of it doesn't make a whole lot of literal sense, but at their finest, they reach a Ghostface-level of opulence; after slacking in patois, Chiba pulls his voice taut on the self-explanatory ""Ganja Lounge"": ""Fingered they Virgin Islands 'til their walls Niagara Falls/ Martini Rossi body waters...fornicated with Nazi bitches/ Liquor-ated chocolate."" Despite being tagged as the official follow-up to the well-received Fort Apache (The Mixtape Album), there isn't a whole lot album-y about Black Hollywood. Most tracks clock in at less than three minutes, forgoing typical bars and hooks structure for lived-in interplay and stuttered catch phrases. The entirety is produced by Ski Beatz, who goes beyond his current rep as a Jay-Z namedrop with the speaker-rattling ""Posse From The Bronx"" and ""82 Afros"", which appears revamped with nasty fuzz bass and bongos. While they occasionally recall the brassy triumph of Uptown on ""Soul Fever"" or the title track, the seams do show a little when they try to turn budget limitation into old-school homages; ironically, the beat on ""Money Clap"" sounds like two dimes clicking together. Considering the great lengths Lo go to create an alternate reality, they put themselves at great risk any time they step out of it. ""Jack N' Jill"" doesn't exactly moralize, but like its thematic forerunner ""Life In The Fast Lane"", it suffers from having no real investment in its characters. This is an even greater problem with ""Sweet Claudine"", where the duo makes a last-second switch of pimp hats for knitted caps and the glutinous, self-satisfied ""sensitivity"" of Common's Finding Forever. But really, what Black Hollywood suffers from the most is the razor-thin margin for error that comes with having a 36-minute LP as the outcome of a six-year hiatus, which only is a problem if you came into this with expectations. The evidence shows that Camp Lo didn't-- during the seemingly tossed-off salutations between Cheeba and Suede on ""Posse From The Bronx"", you can practically hear the relief of two people shedding a decade worth of extraneous bullshit and rapping for the funk of it. Even if Camp Lo's house of pleasure isn't as lavishly decorated as it used to be, it's still worth dropping by.","It's five years since their last proper full-length, but not much has changed for the New York duo of Sonny Chiba and Geechie Suede, as they continue to stack images and loaded code words while drawing musical inspiration from old soul and funk.

Read & Burn 03,Wire,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b36f5e6ef95969322463/1:1/w_160/ce2b6275.jpg,2007-11-16 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10898-read-burn-03/,Pinkflag,"Wire are right where they want to be. Thirty years after their debut album kicked off a brilliant initial run of three albums, they're respected and independent enough to work free of the usual recording industry constraints, taking all the time they want to work on side projects and let their ideas form fully before committing anything to tape. This essentially ensures that anything they release under the Wire aegis will be at least worthy of the name, and the only pressure to produce is self-imposed. How patient have they been? It's hard to believe it's been five years since Wire released the first two Read & Burn EPs, which were partially compiled in 2003 on the Send album in the U.S. Those EPs mostly ignored the innovative but sometimes unsatisfying electronic music Wire had made during its first reunion, from 1986 to 1991, returning instead to the bracing immediacy and brevity of their earliest music, but with a decidedly modern sound. Read & Burn 03 is something quite different altogether for Wire, a 25-minute EP with four songs that don't seem much like anything they've ever done. The production here feels close to the first two Read & Burn volumes, but it's used to much different ends. Opener ""23 Years Too Late"" is nearly 10 minutes long and balances contrasting spoken and sung sections. The spoken sections are dominated by a warm, rounded synthesizer that slowly oscillates behind deep-voiced, poetic intonations-- on the whole, they sound like a British documentarian sucked back to the beatnik era. The sung portions are more what we've come to expect from Wire v.3.0, with a slapping drum part, gurgling bass line, and strangely processed guitars that cushion Colin Newman's layered vocals from the rhythm. The song eventually slips into an ambient coda descended from the band's earlier textural experiments on 1979's 154 and some of their late-80s albums. The other three songs feel slightly more familiar. ""Our Time"" is late-period Wire in slow motion, with the drums and bass holding down a crawling tempo as Newman's vocal squirms under a blanket of effects and guitars seesaw through the mix. On ""No Warning Given"", the tempo is back up for an ultra-deadpan Newman delivery fringed by a cloud of ambient synth and guitar, which hardens on the chorus. The sonic details are interesting, with Robert Gotobed's ride cymbal and snare drum becoming clearer when the rest of the instruments begin to bleed together into a wash. The final song, ""Desert Driving"", uses a basic loud/soft dynamic, with melodic bass in the verses and grinding guitar in the chorus, though Newman's vocal remains even throughout. Throughout the disc, there's a curious lack of treble-- most of the sound is mid-range with a reasonably thick bass presence-- and it gives the record a very odd character while somewhat hindering its dynamic range. It's not quite Wire at their best, but it's an interesting expansion of their range, which, if word from the band is to be believed, isn't necessarily a sign of things to come. They've claimed none of these songs will appear on the next Wire album, which should be just over the horizon. That's good, because I prefer Wire unpredictable and willing to follow an idea almost anywhere. ","Five years after the first two Read & Burn EPs, which were partially compiled in 2003 on the Send album in the U.S., Wire release part three and it features four songs that feel unique within the band's catalog.

The Black and White Album,The Hives,by: Amanda Petrusich,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b37513d197565213a945/1:1/w_160/be66953d.jpg,2007-11-16 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10904-the-black-and-white-album/,A&M,"Roll back to 2001-02: A swarm of vaguely retro-thinking garage bands with plural-noun names (the Hives, the Strokes, the Vines, the White Stripes) were credited with reinvigorating rock'n'roll. The press went all breathless at the sight of slightly disheveled boys in tight pants, and the Hives were promptly slapped on the cover of Spin, extensively profiled in The New Yorker, and repeatedly fawned over by the NME. Alas, the new millennium's culture-cycle is especially vicious, and by 2004, when the Hives released their fourth LP (Tyrannosaurus Hives, the follow-up to their stateside breakthrough, Veni Vidi Vicious), most folks had moved on-- which is too bad, because of all the over-hyped revivalists of the early 00s, the Hives might be the most fun. Although The Black and White Album features the same ecstatic, semi-ridiculous guitar thrashing that characterizes most of the band's previous work, it also sees the Hives expanding their sound to include more bass and songs that clock in over three minutes. This time, the band ditched its native Fagersta, Sweden to record, mostly, in Oxford, Mississippi, soliciting help from a handful of all-star producers: Pharrell Williams, Jacknife Lee, Dennis Herring (who's worked with Modest Mouse and Elvis Costello), and Thomas Oberg (beloved vocalist for a bunch of Swedish rock bands, including Bergman Rock/bob hund). With all that muscle behind the boards, it's not surprising that this is also the Hives' cleanest record to date-- the Hives were never particularly convincing as a garage band (the impeccably-tailored, color-coordinated suits didn't help), and any delusions-of-grit they may have entertained in the past are wholly eradicated here. The Black and White Album can feel, at times, thematically spastic, spinning more like a mixtape than a proper LP. Pharrell's two standout tracks-- ""Well All Right!"" and ""T.H.E.H.I.V.E.S""-- are both slinky clap-alongs that play remarkably well to the band's party-anthem tendencies: ""Well All Right!"" sees frontman Howlin' Pelle Almqvist shrieking ""People see me and they go/ Ahhhhh! Woo woo!"" over pittering drums and perfectly-orchestrated backing chants, a jubilant bit of shameless self-promotion that suits Almqvist remarkably well. Regardless of how you feel about his thick, barky pipes, Almqvist is a captivating performer-- both live and in the studio-- strutting back and forth like a cartoon Mick Jagger, lips pouted, hips popped, voice undulating, part-James Brown, part-John Fogerty. Each vocal track on The Black and White Album sounds intense and revelatory; paired with Pharrell's playful production, the Hives soar. The Hives' three self-produced cuts are just as jubilant-- with the exception of the instrumental ""A Stroll Through Hive Manor Corridors"", which is all fart-bass and creepy synthesizers. It's presumably a concept song about life-as-a-Hive, but it's also the band at their most subdued. Jacknife Lee's track (""Hey Little World"") is classic Hives, frantic and propulsive, with a few simple riffs and a broad, confrontational chorus (""Whatcha gonna do/ Any one of you?""). The bulk of the record is handled by Herring; on opener (and lead single) ""Tick Tick Boom"" a wall of guitars is balanced by a wall of vocals, with all five band members worked into a proper frenzy and howling away. At their best, the Hives are frenetic and volatile, jolting, pushing, panting-- it's punk rock at its most polished, with only the barest threat of dissolution.","The Hives ditch their native Sweden to record in Mississippi, working with  producers such as Pharrell Williams, Jacknife Lee, and Dennis Herring (Modest Mouse, Elvis Costello).

Heavy Deavy Skull Lover,The Warlocks,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b33f13d197565213a8f1/1:1/w_160/72c615d9.jpg,2007-11-15 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10847-heavy-deavy-skull-lover/,Tee Pee,"The Warlocks have always been the odd band out in the West Coast neo-psych scene, possessing neither the careerist conviction that earned the Dandy Warhols and Black Rebel Motorcycle Club heavy modern-rock-radio rotation, nor the sort of trainwreck volatility that would inspire someone to make a documentary about them (like their mentors the Brian Jonestown Massacre). But if the Warlocks have an image problem, it's one of their own design, given that they've sounded like a different band on every album, evolving from caveman garage-rock stompers (2000's Warlocks EP) to Floydian acid-folk pastorales (2001's Rise and Fall) to Spacemen 3-meets-Stones swagger (2002's The Phoenix Album) to jangly, Spectorized pop (2005's Surgery, the band's first and last release for Mute Records). Heavy Deavy Skull Lover marks another distinct break from previous form, though this time the shift is symbolic as much as it is stylistic. With the more lushly produced Surgery failing to turn on any more heads than the band's primordial releases for Bomp! Records, the Warlocks have retreated to another niche label (stoner-psych specialists Tee Pee Records). And you don't have to look at the band's current press photo to realize that this once formidable octet has been downsized into standard quartet formation: Compared to previous releases, Heavy Deavy Skull Lover sounds noticeably more threadbare and fragile. Along the way, The Warlocks have seemingly sacrificed the two things that differentiated them from their peers: frontman Bobby Hecksher's easy-flowin' melodicism and the band's thunderous dual-drummer set-up. Instead of inspiring the band to sharpen their songwriting, the pared-down Warlocks strum and mumble through Heavy Deavy's eight sprawling tracks like a band waving the white flag. The end goal here is The Cure: Live at Pompeii-- lo-fi dirges heavy on slow-motion distortion, but with Hecksher's usual stoned-out sighs replaced by more pronounced, mopey affectations. That the bookend tracks both feature the word ""death"" in the title offers some indication of the kind of mood he's in, and the pervasively dreary mood makes it hard to tell where the pained opener ""The Valley of Death"" ends and the quicksand-slow descent of ""Moving Mountains"" begins. Clocking in at over 10 minutes, the latter track gives off palpable echoes of Pink Floyd's ""Echoes"", with the band working a repeated four-note descending scale into a sludgy gruel, but to the point where even the song's accelerated four-minute closing passage provides little in the way of climax or resolve. Heavy Deavy boasts a few moments that suggest Hecksher hasn't completely lost touch with the pop-song economy that produced past touchstones like ""Song for Nico"" and ""Shake the Dope Out"": ""So Paranoid"" faithfully adheres to a venerable My Bloody Velvets lysergic-lullaby template to winsome effect, and ""Zombie Like Lovers"" flashes back to the tribal goth-garage rave-ups of the band's debut EP. But if Heavy Deavy's superior songs confine themselves to well-trodden psych-rock territory, it's for the best really, as The Warlocks' more outré maneuvers ultimately go nowhere: the backward-looped ""Interlude in Reverse"" is three minutes of inconsequential squall, while the burnt-spoon fever dream of ""Death, I Hear You Walking"" approximates nothing so much as the sound of Hecksher nodding off on the couch while a late-night telecast of Zabriskie Point turns to white noise. Strangely, this is the only song where Hecksher actually sounds content-- maybe he's stoned; maybe he's amused by the title's accidental pun on Kiss' ""Beth, I hear you calling""; or maybe after five albums and as many changes in direction, he's given up trying to please anybody. But if this is the way The Warlocks' world ends, you just wish they had delivered more bang for your whimper.","West Coast neo-psych band aim to follow peers like Black Rebel Motorcycle Club or Brian Jonestown Massacre to fame-- or, at least, notoriety.

Shooting Spires,Shooting Spires,by: Liz Colville,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3245e6ef959693223e7/1:1/w_160/da5e432a.jpg,2007-11-15 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10820-shooting-spires/,Cardboard,"B.J. Warshaw, aka Shooting Spires, plays bass and sings in the Brooklyn experimental outfit band Parts & Labor. His one-man-band debut album, a surprisingly epic production that sounds like the work of several people despite its bedroom origins, has gorgeous washes of electric guitar along with countless space-defining and space-erasing effects. With the rusty rasp of TV on the Radio's Tunde Adebimpe (SS has toured with the band), Warshaw narrates some indecipherable but still memorable high-altitude night cruises. This is Boris rendered indie for the attention deficient-- a storyboarded version of drone that occasionally asks us to dance, shimmy, or merely nod. But there's no shoegazing or drug-taking required; it's too down-to-earth for that. ""Sky for a Sea"" stands apart as the most emotionally powerful track. With the lyrics obscured by tinny reverbs and white-noise guitar, it's difficult to decipher Warshaw's sentiments-- only sad and bittersweet musical elements can clue us in to the mood. Interest in David Bowie and Brian Wilson is obvious on tracks like ""Right"", the opener, which stomps and whines its rant around pulsating drums and anthemic saxophones. Warshaw subjects his voice to a similar bullhorn-like processing on much of the album; it's a regrettable choice, because it fosters monotony from track to track. By the third song, boredom has set in-- but only temporarily. It's as if ""Embers"" and ""Quarantine"" are just ""Right"" manipulated into a faster tempo, sax replaced by flute-like synth. Things get pretty around ""Alive and Well"", where the rhythm section flits around a more robust but still murky atmosphere of organs, pulsating vocals, and actual drums-- way back there around the 10th layer of track. Many of these songs have a playful and uplifting quality, but with the elephantine emphasis on rhythm and bass, nothing's ever given the chance to get flaccid or cloying. ""A Million Drops"" imparts a recorder-like voice that, as many of the soft melody-makers on the album do, repeats a simple melody line with a little jumpy variation. After the golden ""Sky for a Sea"", there is a three-track closeout of indulgent, whining guitar sustains. There's no hope understanding the words, and Warshaw might actually need to work on this, unless he's content for the message to be yet another sublimated voice in the rhythm section. Yes, all the edgelessness can get repetitive. Warshaw, like the most capable chefs, has his favorite ingredients, but he also has his favorite tempo ranges and chord progressions. Still, more often than not, the results are addictive; Warshaw's signature is almost identical from track to track, but it's as otherworldly and strange as it is friendly and human.","Working alone, Parts & Labor member creates hazy, playful, and rhythmically complex rock, his lyrics obscured by heavy reverb and white-noise guitar.

Mount Eerie Pts. 6 & 7,Mount Eerie,by: Matthew Solarski,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3709d034d5c69bf4cf4/1:1/w_160/509001a0.gif,2007-11-15 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10899-mount-eerie-pts-6-7/,P.W. Elverum & Sun,"Since 2003's Mount Eerie LP, Phil Elverum has kept a relatively low profile, yet remained busy. He's toured a fair deal, worked extensively with his label, P.W. Elverum & Sun, retired and later exhumed the Microphones moniker, dropped a couple of LPs and scattered releases as Mount Eerie, and smuggled an extra ""e"" into his given name. (He's credited on Mount Eerie and earlier albums as ""Phil Elvrum""; note that ""verum"" means ""truth"" in Latin.) And now, four years after Mount Eerie, he returns with this self-professed sequel: Two additional chapters (or are they epilogues?) to the saga laid out on Mount Eerie, pressed onto a 10"" picture disc and tucked between the pages of a massive, 132-page photobook. Mount Eerie represented a seemingly complete cycle-- birth/creation on part 1, ""The Sun"", death on part 4, ""Mt. Eerie"", and an afterlife of sorts on part 5. So...what comes after the afterlife? A few guitar and organ drones into Pts. 6 & 7's first track (of four, all unlabeled), Elverum's opening line gives us an idea: ""Waking up in the known world/ There's something that's left over,"" he declares with his vulnerable quaver. Where Mount Eerie's closing track seemed to offer resolution, doubt and ambiguity have again crept in here. ""The light that does get in is unconvincing,"" intones Elverum. The galloping, piano-accented groove on the second track would seem to suggest decisiveness, but that soon dissolves into the lonesome sound of rain upon a tin roof. Even when the fourth track-- with its heavenly choir, thundering drums, and firmament-penetrating organ,--presents itself as some grand, conclusive statement, Elverum isn't so sure. Clouds break only to reveal other clouds, and rather than fade out, the chorus swells to a precipice and drops off fairly abruptly. ""Mount Eerie revealed, in the breaking of clouds/ And then gone again,"" he laments. His apparent new mantra, more mature if less satisfying: Clarity comes and goes, and all we can be certain of is uncertainty. Ah, but the book? The photographs, all taken with antique cameras on expired film, are given large-format full pages upon which to breathe, and they're not constricted by borders, captions, or even page numbers. Indeed, the book's interior is entirely void of text; the title and other essential info appear only on the tome's spine, which is covered by a dust jacket, blank save for the words ""Mount Eerie"". (Those who've held the UK edition of Cocteau Twins' Lullabies to Violaine collection will recognize the jacket's odd, mossy paper stock.) The photos primarily address the natural world-- one vista even gets a three-page centerfold-- creating an overall feel of detachment, isolation, and, yes, eeriness. Even when figures do show up (most often Elverum himself), they're double-exposed, strangely lit, or out of focus, made to look like ghosts. A webpage created as a ""supplement"" to the book offers descriptions and recollections alongside thumbnail reproductions of the photographs. (The irony that a book celebrating the natural world must draw blood from it in order to be made is not lost on Elverum, and in an effort to account for it, he hooked up with an eco-friendly, highly-regarded printer based out of British Columbia to bring his vision to life-- 20 full grown trees saved, boasts his website). At a time when indie artists are increasingly diversifying their assets, embracing commercial work, soundtracks, and network television, Pts. 6 & 7-- an extravagantly priced book/vinyl combo-- feels like a defiantly anachronistic gesture. But at what cost to fans? The book carries a hefty price tag. Still, it's difficult not to admire Elverum's ambition, and the romantics out there may delight in imagining that somebody out there is going to work a few extra shifts at Kinko's-- and forego buying some six CDs (or, better yet, 60 mp3s)-- just to take this thing home, to hold it in his/her hands, and, above all, to cherish it. After all, you can't very well cherish mp3s.","Four years after Mount Eerie, Phil Elverum returns with the self-professed sequel, pressed onto a 10"" picture disc and tucked between the pages of a massive, 132-page photobook.

Public Enemy #1,Cam’ron,by: Ryan Dombal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Features Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3795e6ef95969322478/1:1/w_160/becf496c.jpg,2007-11-15 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10908-public-enemy-1/,Diplomat,"Cam'ron offers several fun facts in the six-and-a-half-minute spoken word intro to his new 2xCD freebie mixtape. For example: Famed NYC DJ Funkmaster Flex's wife apparently answers to Mrs. Funkmaster Flex. Also, Cam is skeptical of the internet rumors that have surfaced over the last few months (""Next time y'all doin' a movie, just send me my script...I promise I'll play my part a little better""). He still has love for one-time cohort Jim Jones, but he claims ""ain't nothing lasting forever"" (double-negative trickery?). Also of note, the MC claims the NYPD heavily relies on YouTube to keep track of meaningless hip-hop beefs. FYI: Cam occasionally flies commercial (""I flew commercial""). And his mom was sick this summer (""I had a family emergency that took a few months of my time""). The opening tirade is like a gushing, post-vacation LiveJournal entry aimed at an anonymous commenter who bitched about a lack of updates. It's stupefyingly specific, silly, and, within the insular snowglobe that is Dipset, it makes perfect sense. Cam'ron is a drama queen; on his career pinnacle, Purple Haze, he spun explicit ghetto yarns on a song called ""Soap Opera"" and aired out a particularly potty-mouthed phone conversation with an acquaintance on a skit called ""I'm a Chicken Head"". And, though he's now a grizzled vet past his commercial prime, he still has a nagging need to set records (as well as possibly homoerotic utterances) straight. Last year's Killa Season turned his obsession with getting even into an annoyingly blaring cacophony filled with not-so-original threats and boasts. (The accompanying DIY film was a two-hour embarrassment that made Streets Is Watching look like The Godfather). Gone were the cucumber-smooth flights of fancy and cozy pop-soul beats that made Haze so endlessly repeatable, replaced with the hysterical insecurities of a man losing ground not only within hip-hop but within his own crew. But, with Public Enemy, Cam is coming to peace with the fact that two of the rappers he nurtured to stardom-- Juelz Santana and Jim Jones-- have largely eclipsed him in the public eye. He's still peeved about bitchy Nah Right commenters, but he's not taking blatant and misguided shots at Jay-Z or 50 Cent anymore. And, thankfully, Cam's occasionally infantile-yet-charming soft side is back, with some MF Doom-style plastic r&b instrumentals to boot. Yet, this is still a mixtape, and while its MySpace/mailing-list-scam distribution system may be forward thinking, Public Enemy suffers from traditional mixtape trappings: too-long skits, too many underlings and just too much all around. iTunes tells me the tape boasts 2.1 hours of audio-- at least it's easy to tell what to keep and what to send recycling into hard drive hell (click below to listen to a Pitchfork-approved abridged version). The double-album's first eight tracks are startlingly stellar. ""Why They"" is a throwback to the Roc-A-Fella-era. With its Just Blaze-style high-pitched pulse, the track is reminiscent of the woefully underrated posse album Diplomatic Immunity. The song doesn't berate, it swaggers. And Cam reels off some finely tuned Dip-isms that casually conflate snack time with grind time: ""I'm the cookie monster/ Yeah, Chips Ahoy!"" The cartoon gospel of ""Calm Down"", meanwhile, recalls Haze's ""Harlem Streets"", with Cam channeling Martin Lawrence's stressed-out Bad Boys cop as he decompresses with trademark same-word rhymes like, ""Strip club in the crib, not just the pole/ Lights flash, mirrors up, disco ball-- and I disco ball."" ""Just Us"" manages to make shitty sex sound downright sweet and the self-effacing ""Hot Mess"" has Cam coining his best nickname in ages (""Young 60 Minutes"", in reference to his infamous ""stop snitching"" interview on the show) and more or less admitting to his Apple fetish (""Fiends slept in front of my crib for two days straight like I had the iPhone""). After the disgusting skit about bugs in food, though, things get choppier. Without Juelz or Jim, Cam recruits a couple fresh Dippers called Tom Gist (yes, that's his government name) and Penz to take their place. Safe to say, this switch marks a downgrade on all accounts. Gist handles most of the album's ""miserable urban living"" parables-- with dour tracks like ""Kill My Dog"" and ""Think Out Loud"", it sounds like the guy's biggest inspirations are Master P's ""I Miss My Homies"" and the movie Crash. Penz pumps out mechanized responses based on well-trodden mixtape themes. To emphasize his ""versatility,"" the rapper/droid shows both his yin and yang on successive tracks called ""Penz Sad"" and ""Killa Penz"" near the end of the tape. (Could an Encino Man-style Dipset movie dubbed Penz Sad be that far away?) The new additions are good news for previous Dipset C-listers like 40 Cal and Hell Rell, who move up to the B-list by default and, by contrast or not, sound better than before-- 40's verse on ""Troublemakers"" is nearly Cam-worthy as it peaks with the hater-baiting line: ""They baby moms' made me they screen saver."" Clearly, Cam is still out of his skull. No other rapper could or would make a sincere YouTube threat in their boxers or produce hilariously faux-verite ""Where's Waldo""-style clips to promote their free mixtape. Public Enemy finds the Harlem native cooling out and giving up his quest to best today's commercial rap behemoths. He's even growing up a little. On the gorgeous slow jam ""Let Me Know"", he admits, ""the sex is great but trust is the issue,"" and even leaves the possibility of rejection wide open: ""If not tonight, text me though and let me...know."" At long last, another Cam'ron soap opera worth following.","Just a few years after career peak Purple Haze, Cam'ron's music has come to reflect the hysterical insecurities of a man losing ground not only within hip-hop but within his own crew.

The Complete On the Corner Sessions,Miles Davis,by: Dominique Leone,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b373b1335d7bf169a5c8/1:1/w_160/5c79f7f2.jpg,2007-11-15 06:00:01,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10901-the-complete-on-the-corner-sessions/,ColumbiaLegacy,"Miles Davis dropped jazz for good in late 1971-- not that he'd been keeping up many appearances for the genre in several years. Though his band would still occasionally play old standards live, his main show in the early 70s was free-ish funk, openly indebted to Sly Stone and James Brown (and I still wonder what Davis would have made of Funkadelic). Of course, the maligned genre in question-- jazz-- was mostly the property of people writing about Davis, and in some cases, his still-jazz-oriented peers, so it's no surprise to read his bandmates of the time (percussionist Mtume, bassist Michael Henderson, guitarists Pete Cosey and Reggie Lucas, drummer Al Foster, saxophonist Dave Liebman) refer back to those days with no small amount of pride, and scorn towards the ever-present ""critics"". The records Davis made during this time sounded raw (but weren't), hard (and were) and not the kind of thing that was going to fit into any particular canon, even as their maker adopted conscious efforts to position his music for younger, blacker audiences. And he might have dropped jazz, but he picked up something a lot more important: the future of music. Since its 72 release, On the Corner (featured in full on the last disc in the box) has attained a level of infamy outmatching any of Davis' other records, though not really for the right reasons. Downbeat's equally infamous calling-out of its tunes as ""repetitious boredom"" unfortunately summed up the feeling of many folks who would have preferred to only remember Davis' music from the 50s and 60s. However, rock and experimental music fans weren't quite so dismissive-- in fact, today, OtC is one of the easiest Davis records to recommend to a non-convert, especially if they're down with the wtf production and uber-grooved-out beats. Teo Macero's editing/splicing/midwifing of the myriad sessions that comprised the record were no less significant to its sound than Davis' pieces, and considering how records are made today, perhaps more so. Still, it's the avant-funk and druggy ambience that lingers longest. There's a reason people compare this stuff to Can. Disc one features unedited takes of ""On the Corner"", ""One and One"", and ""Helen Butte/Mr. Freedom X"", all of which would appear in messed-with form on the 1972 LP. And though *OtC'*s edits are a considerable part of its magic, the surprising thing with these tracks is how well they work as just jams (greatly assisted by the fact that in most cases, their signature hooks are intact, such as the hi-hat pulse in ""On the Corner"", or the classic sing-song melody in ""Helen Butte""). ""Jabali"" is a previously unissued track, featuring a slow, lurching bassline from Henderson, and gradually picks up steam while simultaneously becoming more psychedelic (anyone order three extra keyboards?). The second disc begins with ""Ife"" (originally issued on Big Fun), and adds Paul Buckmaster on electric cello. Buckmaster's contribution to Davis' music at that time was considerable, especially via turning the trumpeter onto Karlheinz Stockhausen, whose use of recorded and electric sound had a big impact on the recording of OtC. ""Chieftan"" is a previously unissued, agitated vamp, featuring an insistent hi-hat + rim shot beat, augmented (like many tracks from this era) by tabla and sitar. ""Turnaround"" and ""U-Turnaround"" are also new tracks, but whose slow, heavy grooves would have sounded very at home on, say, Live-Evil or Dark Magus. ""Rated X"" (later on Get Up With It) is just a badass funk track that features some seriously distorted production, and should probably be sampled by all crate-digging, rare-grooves DJs ASAP. Disc three begins with another track from Get Up With It (""Billy Preston""-- not featuring Billy Preston btw), and several unissued tracks: the somewhat raucous, wah-wah guitar-powered ""The Hen"", two HUGE mixes of ""Big Fun/Holly-wuud"" (which would later be severed to make both sides of a 74 single), the skeletal, relatively restrained ""Peace"", and the funk dirge ""Mr. Foster"", which takes the basic groove of ""Big Fun"", and stretches it across 15 minutes of mournful vamping and uncharacteristically solemn solos from Liebman and Davis. Disc four contains the two epic-length tracks from Get Up With It, ""Calypso Frelimo"" and the Duke Ellington tribute, ""He Loved Him Madly"". The first piece begins as reverb-drenched, frantic funk, and moves into molasses-paced death groove (though still laced with reverb, as if recorded in a subway tunnel). I've never been a huge fan of ""He Loved Him Madly"", though its extended (30+ minutes) calm is a welcome respite from the otherwise merciless pace of the rest of the box. ""Maiysha"" (also from Get Up With It) begins disc five, and though its major-key, curiously sprightly guitar figure seems a little out of place with generally darker (or more cynical) music on the other discs, it still retains the exotic flavor of the box's music. ""Mtume"" begins with-- you guessed it-- a conga solo by Davis' permanent conga player Mtume, and soon turns into an up-tempo Afro-Cuban groove with cool triple-guitar wah-ing from Lucas, Cosey and Dominique Gaumont. (A shorter outtake of the same track features a good soprano sax solo from Sonny Fortune.) The 19-minute blues-shuffle ""Hip Skip"" (with a pretty bizarre organ solo by Davis), frantic ""What They Do"" (reminiscent of the faster stuff on Dark Magus) and brief, strangely loungy ""Minnie""-- notable mostly for being recorded at Davis' last session in 1975 before his five-year retirement -- are all previously unissued. The final disc of the box contains all of the OtC LP, in addition to a fairly straight blues on ""Red China Blues"" (from Get Up With It, and featuring the only harmonica solo I can remember hearing on a Davis track), and both sides of the ""Big Fun""/""Holly-wuud"" single. So, here we are again, near the end of another year, with another indispensable Miles Davis box to purchase (which Columbia doubtlessly realizes, as the lofty $120+ price tag might indicate). Do you need it? If you're a die-hard, it's obvious: you do. If you've never heard On the Corner, it's obvious: you don't. However, you do need to buy OtC sooner than yesterday. Perhaps in six months or a year, after you've stopped annoying all your friends by telling them how great it is, then you can go back and order the box-- by which time, should be available for about half of what is now. Davis saw the future with this music. Be smart, do the same.","Another year, another indispensable Miles Davis box. This season's gift from Columbia/Legacy is a 6xCD set of every track put to tape by Davis' revolving cast of players bewteen 1972-75.

Waitin' Our Turn,Coughee Brothaz,by: Evan McGarvey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b329c0084474cd0c20a0/1:1/w_160/330efbf2.jpg,2007-11-14 06:00:05,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10823-waitin-our-turn/,Coughee Brothaz Entertainment,"Coffee is the smell you can't get out your clothes? Really? Just coffee? Coming from Devin the Dude and his massive band of friends, colleagues, and former Odd Squad comrades? Coded language 101. A fun, low-budget companion piece to Devin's last solo piece, this year's Waitin' to Inhale, the Coughee Brothaz (say it like java) posse albums sticks to unhurried, sniffling post-G-funk roaches, and, without even knowing it, tosses together a skillet of pleasant, congealed, unambitious toasting. Sometimes the beats nose out in front of the lyrics, (""On The Road"", ""Cockhounds""), sometimes the lyrics (smoking, drinking, smiling, slipping the dick-- in that order) get up off the couch a step ahead of the catatonic basslines and half-asleep claps. It's not a knock against it to say nothing grand is at stake here. The credits in the liner notes don't have individual names next to the tracks. The bulk of the songs were already available on an obscure pre-lease mixtape available at your nearest shady-ass torrent site. While a Scarface cameo on album-opening ""Rise & Shine"" is nice, accessible touch, and second-in-command Jugg Mugg is a loose, uncluttered MC, the voices, on the whole, break down to either Devin or some other dude. The other dudes are fine-- some angry, some queasy, some fluttering spit fires, some bass chompers. When everyone is trying to save the game, it is great to hear people just going through the day with themselves-- ""You might find me at the crib makin' some pizza!"" Shunning almost every vestige of contemporary hip-hop identity, the huddled (in a circle around the lighter) masses of the Coughee Brothaz are satisfied-- delighted, even-- to turn out a few lines about crawling to the parking lot, keeping their fingernails untrimmed to break up weed better, and trying to get a piece of the pie. It goes without saying, but THC ain't the only thing Waitin' Our Turn is drenched with-- most (and by most I mean a healthy 75%) of the MC's have got a sweaty sleaze, totally aped from Devin, somewhere between wood-trim minivan owner and airport bar lothario. Devin himself is a fantastic narrative MC-- a little Raymond Carver, a little Boomhauer, a little Slick Rick-- and almost worth the price of admission alone. He doesn't contribute anything on Our Turn as riotous as the ""Boom"" skits on Exhale or as detailed and warm as, say, the dazzling ""Lacville '79"" from 2002's Just Tryin' Ta Live, but he composes his durable tales and spits out common man come-ons (""I usually don't dance/ But I'll make an exception"") and narrative asides (""Somehow we touched on the subject of weed/ Somehow she also smoked, I said 'Follow me'"") as well as anyone post-Biggie. Devin raps on seven of the album's fifteen tracks, and when he doesn't divvy up a verse he's unspooling a chorus and hook, using that gassy, enunciated croon to push the album cuts along. While low-key drum machines are the backbone of Our Turn, there's plenty of appropriately rural effects and instrumental touches. ""The More I Spoke"" sounds like a three-minute bridge of paper-thin 808s. If you could play Scruggs-style acoustic guitar, it'd sound like ""On The Hunt For A Lady"". ""Don't Get Me Wrong"" has dashes of those decaying P-funk whistles Dr. Dre loved to abuse, and ""Fresh Rims & Vogues"", the album's deftest gem, dishes up swaying, purple rhythms and soft, quitting-time sonar moans. The album doesn't shy away from sideways humor either. ""Yee-Haw"" gets the Southern pride twisted into tongue-in-cheek, and ""Rise & Shine"" plays with the chronic/caffeine metaphor over a piano sample so cheap and twisted it should score budget children's carnivals, a crowing rooster, and faux-British accents. In a fall that feels like one endless slow-roasted August, there are far worse ways to spend the wee hours of the hazy afternoon or murmuring, windows-open after-party AMs than grabbing a beat-up spot on the couch and letting Waitin' Our Turn pass between friends in a room. Just keep it in your cipher.","A fun, low-budget companion piece to Houston rapper Devin the Dude's last solo album, created with a massive band of friends, colleagues, and former Odd Squad comrades, most of whom seem to share the Dude's affinity for weed.

LP,Holy Fuck,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3365e6ef9596932240c/1:1/w_160/0bdb7adb.jpg,2007-11-14 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10838-lp/,Young Turks,"""Find something in the trash... plug it in"": So reads the message next to the photo at the top of Holy Fuck's MySpace, and it's a good starting point for describing their sound. Founded by Toronto musicians Brian Borcherdt and Graham Walsh in 2004, the band's basic setup is simple: a ton of drums, keyboards, and electronic noise generators. All of their instrumental music is created through a process of improvisation and refinement, and the lineup is somewhat elastic from show to show, which adds an extra element of unpredictability to the development of each piece. I felt that their 2005 debut, while it had a few jaw-dropping moments, demonstrated mostly potential, but you can pretty much forget potential on LP. This album is leagues better than the debut, an exciting blend of aggressive rhythm and nuanced, skillfully manipulated noise. The band has developed every song on the record and captured them in raw, live performance (in the case of opener ""Super Inuit"", in front of an audience). The result is frequently exhilarating, a cyborg dance party for a broken future that's closer than you think. One of the band's greatest assets is its dual drummers. By having more than one guy at a kit, Holy Fuck give themselves a rhythmic foundation that's at once solidly in the pocket, incredibly loud, and versatile enough to embellish the songs without losing the lockstep groove at the album's heart. One of the album's biggest and most pleasant surprises is ""Lovely Allen"", the most song-like thing the band has done and certainly the prettiest-- though I'd be remiss to call it pretty without also explaining that the brutal ugliness of the rest of the arrangement is what makes the keyboard melody sound so exceptionally beautiful. Most of these songs incorporate at least one bit of rhythmic keyboard programming to further unite the drums with the buzzing, whooshing clouds of ambient sound spilling over the top. Though it's taken from multiple recording sources, the album sounds reasonably unified, mostly because the important thing is to capture the group at its rawest and most inspired, which it consistently does. We often say casually that bands are ""awesome"" without thinking about the true meaning of the word-- Holy Fuck actually inspire awe during their best moments.","Working through a process of improvisation and refinement, this dynamic instrumental band makes a monumental leap on its second album, an exciting blend of aggressive rhythm and nuanced, skillfully manipulated noise.

Frank,Amy Winehouse,by: Douglas Wolk,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b372ea9e61561daa6ac3/1:1/w_160/6569d8e9.jpg,2007-11-14 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10900-frank/,IslandIsland,"The self-destructive tortured-artist routine was bullshit when Kurt Cobain did it, it was bullshit when Elliott Smith did it, and it's bullshit now. As anyone who's seen the video of Amy Winehouse desperately finger-fumbling her way through ""Back to Black"" at the MTV Europe Video Music Awards knows, her look-how-messed-I-am public persona is now screwing up her art something fierce. So instead of a new record, Americans are now getting a modified version of Frank, her first album, originally released four years ago and subsequently dissed by the artist herself. Its two weakest links, ""Know You Now"" and a pointless cover of standard ""Moody's Mood for Love"", have been yanked out of the original running order and appended as hidden penalty tracks. Winehouse has a hell of a voice, even when she imitates her favorite jazz vocalists-- especially Billie Holiday-- much too closely. (Just in case anybody misses the idea that she's supposed to be a jazz singer who's somehow stumbled into a neo-soul record, Frank begins with a little fragment of Winehouse scat-singing, and the chorus of ""October Song"" doesn't just namedrop Sarah Vaughan but lifts its melody from ""Lullaby of Birdland"".) None of her songs here are as indelible as ""Rehab"" or as cutting as ""You Know I'm No Good""-- and the best are co-written with Nas and Fugees collaborator Salaam Remi-- but you can hear the development of the high-powered songwriter she turned into on Back to Black in the snarky character sketch ""F*** Me Pumps"" and in the way the sharp-nailed ballad ""You Sent Me Flying"" breaks into a Soul II Soul beat halfway through. And although she hasn't quite nailed the 1972 vibe of her later record (despite some corny vintage-vinyl sound effects), a couple of her stylistic experiments pay off, especially the high-drama soul loop that underpins ""In My Bed"". But Winehouse's slow public wreck isn't just an unfortunate thing that's happening to someone who happens to be a star, it's part of her act, and has been from the get-go-- which means it makes her audience complicit in it. Her favorite lyrical topic, even on her debut, is loving not wisely but too well; on ""Amy Amy Amy"", she's gently wagging a finger at herself about her fondness for bad-news boys. And her deliberate affectation of Holiday's unmistakable vocal tics can't help but suggest the narrative we're supposed to buy into: ""Great singer, tragically destroyed by her unhappy private life and bad habits, who turned her pain into universal art."" (What are we as her audience supposed to do? Stage an intervention? Well, we can at least think very carefully about what our participation in that narrative means. And who are we to say we wish she'd stop going on about how she doesn't need any help and get some goddamn help already? Not vultures, that's who.) Winehouse is good enough that she was worth paying attention to for her music alone before her drama started ruining it, but in the light of her subsequent career, Frank comes off as the first chapter in the Romantic myth of the poet who feels too deeply and ends up killing herself for her audience's entertainment. And that is some bullshit.","Originally released in the UK four years ago and subsequently dissed by the artist herself, Amy Winehouse's debut finally lands on U.S. shores.

Fruit Tree,Nick Drake,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b36d13d197565213a934/1:1/w_160/5c33324b.jpg,2007-11-14 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10895-fruit-tree/,IslandIsland,"A popular way to hear Nick Drake's music is as a protracted suicide note, each song leading to the same incontrovertible conclusion. You don't have look very far in his lyrics to find quotable lines pointing the way to tragedy; just listen to ""Fruit Tree"", from his 1969 debut Five Leaves Left, or ""Parasite"", an early song recorded for his 1972 swan song Pink Moon. But listeners also tend to search for foreboding insight within ill-fated songwriters' catalogs, and the knowledge of Drake's early death doesn't intensify or justify whatever emotions exist in the music. The fact that he died may be the best-known aspect of his life, but his songs don't need that tragedy to convey sadness, isolation, confusion, disappointment, and wonder-- all of which may have contributed to his overdose of anti-depressants in 1974, whether accidental or not. Fruit Tree, an incomplete reissue of a defining compilation, touches on the darker aspects of Drake's music, but to avoid romanticizing his doomed life, the 3xCD/1xDVD set couches it in a very close, often very technical reading of his songs. The set was first released in England five years after Drake's death and in America in 1986, and has been repackaged in various permutations since then. Historically, the set has been anchored by Drake's three studio albums, the rarities collection Time of No Reply (which was released separately in 1986), and extensive liner notes, with a black-and-white cover depicting Drake on an empty sidewalk, his overcoat blowing in the wind. This new American version drops Time of No Reply (a curious and almost criminal omission) but replaces it with new and exhaustive liner notes, a DVD containing Jeroen Berkvens' 1999 documentary A Skin Too Few, and a new cover showing a dark-green tree against a northern-sky-blue background. While far from complete, Fruit Tree is nevertheless the most comprehensive Drake compilation available and the best introduction to the singer-songwriter. Its remastering renders obsolete your copies of his uniformly superb studio albums (and should have done the same to any of his rarities collections like Time of No Reply or Made to Love Magic). The absence of non-album tracks from Time of No Reply may make Fruit Tree stronger song for song, but it still gives the sense of an incomplete picture. The new liner notes and Berkvens' elegiac film go to great lengths to fill in this portrait, discussing Drake's life and his death but generally avoiding easy mythmaking. A Skin Too Few emphasizes Drake's essential unknowability: He was never a public figure, so we have no common memory of him, as we have for other dead celebrities. In fact, so little was known about him that every detail of his life, no matter how seemingly inconsequential, has been parsed for significance. And he died so long ago-- 33 years ago this month, to be exact-- that we have lost many people who were close to him, leaving us with the testimony of a very few. A Skin Too Few offers no interviews with Drake and no performance footage, which are typically the bedrock of rock documentaries; Drake gave no interviews and very rarely performed publicly. His legacy is analog. At the center of this film, and of that legacy, is an absence, which Berkvens expresses visually. He situates Drake's songs in landscapes that initially appear as still lifes, but eventually humanity invades the frame in the form of a train or a boy on a bicycle or two professors greeting each other. The suggestion is that these places-- his childhood room, his university quad, London alleyways-- informed Drake's music as strongly as his internal landscape did. It's a simple, valid point that gives a fuller idea of the artist by taking the mortal burden off of his shoulders, at least in part. As a textual complement to Berkvens' film, the new liner notes feature commentary from four individuals who knew Drake well: Robin Frederick, a music journalist, musician, and friend; Joe Boyd, who produced Five Leaves Left and 1970's Bryter Layter; Robert Kirby, who composed for Drake; and John Wood, who engineered all of Drake's albums. Together, they present a very useful alternative to the suicide-note reading of these albums-- a technical approach-- by discussing his songwriting, composing, and guitar playing in fine detail. Of ""Way to Blue"", Frederick observes, ""The heart of the song is the resolving of the suspended fourth to the major third."" Others point to his use of cluster chords on ""River Man"" and ""Place to Be"", the uncommon tunings on Pink Moon, and the unusual time signatures on almost every song. They also explain how these elements interact and how Drake resolves them in unexpected ways. It's rarely mentioned when discussing Drake, but he was an exceptional guitarist, able to strum out intricate rhythms on low strings while picking distinctive melodies on high. He draws from milonga rhythms for ""The Thoughts of Mary Jane"", Mose Allison jazz-blues for ""Man in a Shed"", and Stan Getz for ""Poor Boy"". On Five Leaves Left and Bryter Layter, Boyd, Kirby, and Wood complement his guitarwork with eccentric arrangements, creating a swirl of strings and reed instruments around him. By contrast, Pink Moon, featuring Drake alone, is a guitar album-- by necessity, sure, but what makes the collection so fascinating is how he was able to use his guitar both to evoke the loneliness of a solo musician (especially this solo musician) and to create the effect of two or sometimes even three instruments at once, studied in a variety of tones and styles. Despite its starkness, for this reason Pink Moon may be his richest album. That the liner notes can point this out without alienating lay readers with too much technical language is surely an accomplishment, but then again lay readers have been listening to and discussing these albums for years now, at least since 2000, when Volkswagen used ""Pink Moon"" in its Cabriolet commercial. Perhaps those same listeners didn't pick up on the cluster chords and 5/4 time signatures, but they no doubt felt their effect. The 31 tracks on these three albums evoke the uncertainty of life, a strong wonder at the world, and an equally intense despair as clearly and eloquently through the music as through the words. Drake remains a mysterious figure, so well known popularly yet completely unknown personally; Fruit Tree presents a timid man but a bold artist. As someone who expressed himself wholly through music, Drake understood that his music must be wholly expressive.","This Nick Drake box-- originally issued in 1979-- still features the troubadour's three studio albums, but replaces rarities collection Time of No Reply with new and exhaustive liner notes and a DVD containing Jeroen Berkvens' 1999 documentary A Skin Too Few.

Galactic Zoo Dossier #7: Teenage Meadows of Infinity: Rare Psychs and Stomps / From the Ashes Perfect Attainment Shall Be: Modern Freaked Sounds,Various Artists,by: Andrew Gaerig,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b31013d197565213a89d/1:1/w_160/65df3a0a.jpg,2007-11-14 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11913-galactic-zoo-dossier-7-teenage-meadows-of-infinity-rare-psychs-and-stompsfrom-the-ashes-perfect-attainment-shall-be-modern-freaked-sounds/,Drag City,"God bless psych-rock cratediggers, our most indiscriminate obsessives. Whereas collectors of rare funk records wade through dusty crates for that groove and club DJs search for a competitive edge via rarity and minutiae, the only litmus test for a psych artifact appears to be ""does it sound cool?"" This binary qualification is presumably how we end up with Galactic Zoo Dossier #7's 2xCD set of rare material, a compilation that skips from heavy metal blues to high school free jazz to funky techno. GZD #7 is a handwritten and illustrated zine that offers, in addition to trading cards, a surprisingly professional two-disc mix: Teenage Meadows of Infinity: Rare Psychs and Stomps, nominally ""old and heavy,"" and From the Ashes Perfect Attainment Shall Be: Modern Freaked Sounds, or ""recent and weird."" The results are an exhaustive gathering that slots the Stooges, Devendra Banhart, and Charalambides alongside a barrelful of relative unknowns. The comp's flashing neon advertisement is a full version of ""Cock in my Pocket"", an oft-bootlegged Stooges outtake whose Little Richard piano riff and straight-laced vocal remain the some of group's most unimpeded concessions to early rock'n'roll. It's a lovely coup for a tiny rag, but GZD #7's strength lies in its unearthing of deeply rare treasures, several of which hail from GZD's hometown of Chicago. Gollum kicks Teenage Meadows off with the skuzzy abandon of ""Prayer of Despair"" while the Outspoken Blues nominate ""Turn on Your Lovelight"" for the ""Hey Joe""-Hall-of-Songs-You-Can't-Ruin. The Wheeling High School Jazz Band had a wild-ass conductor who shepherded the kids to avant-swing nonsense. From the Ashes provides more home cooking still: Zappa-fried blues from Plastic Crimewave Sound (whose Steve Krakow edits the magazine and helped compile this material), amplifier drone from White/Light, and a joke-y Chicago Transit Authority cover from an Acid Mothers Temple Empty Bottle performance. Of the more recognizable names here, Banhart turns over a too-long unreleased side that is nonetheless homey and unhinged while the Charalambides contribute a pleasingly aggressive 1995 live performance. De Stijl revival projects Michael Yonkers and Ed Askew are good for a fierce, noisy 2005 demo and a pleasant, clavier-fed folk song, respectively. Solid contributions, all, but GZD earns its merit badge with tracks from bands whose stories start with ""someone sent this in"" and end with ""from who knows when or where."" This is endemic on Teenage Meadows, which includes all manner of bearded ladies: deeply scratched garage rock nugget from ""Unknown Acetate"", a power-boogie strut-- ""Don't Hold Back""-- from unknowns Crowd + 1 and bizarrely, a 30-strong teenage girl ukulele orchestra that sounds like a Saturday morning cartoon nestled in near the end of the disc's moldy runtime. The oddities are cute, but a 37-track, two-and-a-half hour set should ideally offer more in the way of true standouts, especially because GZD #7 is too harebrained and geeked-out to paint a holistic picture of any one scene or sound; its joyous, inclusive tendency cuts both ways, naturally. This is excess in its most benign and good-natured state, though, and for a group of people already invested in Clive Palmer's solo career and Michelle Phillips trading cards, there's only one crucial question, and the answer is yes: It sounds pretty damn cool.","The seventh collection from these psych-rock cratediggers is a 2xCD set that accompanies the excellent handwritten and illustrated zine.

Threads Rope Spell Making Your Bones,Wzt Hearts,by: Mike Powell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b32c5e6ef959693223f7/1:1/w_160/031633a1.jpg,2007-11-13 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10826-threads-rope-spell-making-your-bones/,Carpark,"There's a boring trope in responses to noise-based music that goes something like, ""You won't get it unless you turn it up so loud that,"" and follows with the grisly description of a physical ailment or violation of a city ordinance. But the logic of only understanding music when it inspires you to nausea is about a step away from saying it's easier to agree with conservatives on C-SPAN if you vacuum while they talk-- volume can obscure as much as it might reveal. Listen to Baltimore's Wzt Hearts loud if you have an arbitrary preference for loudness. But there's nothing on Threads Rope Spell Making Your Bones that suggests you have to, and there's plenty to suggest you shouldn't. Though at times trenchant and aggressively noisy, there's nothing particularly bodily about the album. So, caution to the horror and viscera freaks, who won't find anything that sounds like a yeast infection (too sexual and gross, too intimate) or the breaking of a fever (too glorious and climactic, too confused). Instead, Wzt Hearts bundle digital noise and the tasteful drumming of Shaun Flynn with unstable organ drones and long stretches of shaped hiss. Though the record evokes urbanity, the feeling isn't industrial or militaristic-- there's a loose, folk-like quality to it. In that sense, it's just as reasonable to listen to it at a normal volume, to let its waxes and wanes crest at the level of distant traffic. But listening to it as ambience-- admittedly, this is a very tough quality to talk about-- reveals a certain ""unstickiness,"" for lack of a better term. Though Wzt Hearts clearly suggest a chromed-out, decaying city through their sound, it's painted to varying degrees of clarity; as a listener, I find myself sliding around under the drum flutters of ""Hearth Carver"" or the terminal wooziness of ""Viszla"", but other pieces remind me that I left the oven on or that it's sunny outside. This might have something to do with inertia, it might have to do with composition-- Threads isn't exactly a record of discrete or easily articulated qualities. And for however refreshing the digital ambience is-- the elements on Threads pickle in static but never surrender to a big, warm, nasty picture-- much of it feels curiously stuck in 2D. But there's no point in harping on the band's shortcomings considering how great how great ""Hearth Carver"" and ""Viszla"" are, and how much better they sound than on last year's live Heat Chief (Zach Baron, in his Pitchfork review, rated it higher than I would have). Though it's not something you'd often say about doomsayers, with Wzt Hearts, it's worth hoping for the future.","Baltimore band bundles digital noise and tasteful drumming with unstable organ drones and long stretches of shaped hiss, evoking urbanity with a loose, folk-like quality.

Hangin' Nothin' But Our Hands Down,Nurses,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b332c0084474cd0c20ab/1:1/w_160/10174a32.jpg,2007-11-13 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10831-hangin-nothin-but-our-hands-down/,Sargent House,"Even considering the simplicity and affordability of today's music recording technology, and the increasingly cozy global village the internet's reduced our planet (and subsequent indie universe) to, an out-of-left-field band like Nurses still sounds like quite the curiosity. Originally hailing from Idaho but claiming temporary residency in Southern California and Chicago, the band's never had time to establish roots in any particular scene, and their debut's anachronistic horror-show pop suggests the foursome's practically ignorant of any current trends. Despite these apparent handicaps, Hangin' Nothin' But Our Hands Down possesses the brio of a confident marquee release, refusing the modest lo-fi and understatement of most indie rookies. The combination of glitzy cabaret theatrics with a Middle American upbringing may sound untenable and at worst, laughable, but Nurses aren't some indie incarnation of Waiting For Guffman. While drawing from the bombast of Queen, Muse, and Radiohead may seem a tall order, the band comes with their own set of eccentricities to justify an otherwise grandiose, ambitious sound. Perhaps the most obvious of these tics, their debut's insert (which also features astounding artwork) includes a small plastic magnifying glass to view a booklet of lyrics printed in size 4 font. Sure, it's a ploy typically reserved for Happy Meals, but without playing a single note, Hangin' already has you leaning in. Amidst all these idiosynchracies, frontman Aaron Chapman proves the most potent factor in distinguishing Nurses from the chaff. On opener and single ""And Now the Curse of Marjorie"", his tortured vocals, coupled with chilling keyboards and glitchy percussion, evoke Matthew Bellamy's space-age crooning, while the more tender ""Wait For a Safe Sign"" finds him copping Jeff Buckley, right down to poetic lines like ""As sounds echo through crowds and shower our homes."" Taking a cue from similarly vaudevillian act The Dresden Drolls, the band occasionally curbs its theater flair with sharp-edged rock sensibility, especially on ""Lots of Brass"" and ""It Came in a Flash"", each packed with enough minor-key riffs to make Queens of the Stone Age blush. Unfortunately, when the curtain goes down and the lights are dimmed, the band's green songwriting's exposed. Excepting the Lou Reed-inspired fun-house ballad ""He Gots"", the album's more threadbare tracks fall flat, and Chapman's vocal hamming only exacerbates the situation. Although this album's back half runs out of steam, the band's willingness to prove their sound as something more than novelty is commendable, even when it yields mixed results like the Southern Gothic macabre of acoustic closer ""Marching in Places"". Should Nurses ever synergize their musical chops with their oddball allure, the result could be a dazzling side show ready for the big top's center stage.","Originally hailing from Idaho but claiming temporary residency in Southern California and Chicago, this indie band's second album comes with its own set of eccentricities to justify an otherwise grandiose, ambitious, Radiohead/Muse sound.

Home Blitz,Home Blitz,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b33413d197565213a8dc/1:1/w_160/8ca7c27e.jpg,2007-11-13 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10833-home-blitz/,Gulcher,"You might have noticed that there are approximately fifteen million indie bands out there now, many of which sound passably accomplished, though not often terribly unique or with much perspective to offer. Part of that may be because decent-sounding home recording has never been cheaper, easier, or more attainable. When records evocative of the 1980s/90s lo-fi underground pop up in this age of Ableton and GarageBand, they can seem like an affectation-- if not a political act. But then there's Home Blitz, a band that couldn't be more aptly named or more unconcerned with fitting in. This album, which collects tracks culled from split tapes and 7""s, has an amateurish aesthetic for sure, but Home Blitz don't seem totally defined by it. If they're about anything, it's reclaiming or maybe holding on to the remains of innocence. Their loose, bare-bones songs could be garage-rock by default, but they almost always come with a tender, somewhat prepubescent undercurrent-- not the only indie artist recently to pick up Jonathan Richman's ball and run with it, but they may come closest to nailing his guileless charm (the secret being not to try so goddamn hard). In their best moments, Home Blitz fluently mix familiar garage and avant-rock idioms with poignant, evocative details of youth, all in a sweet and surprising conversational tone. They've also got some great songs, and there's more to them than how they're recorded. ""Apocalyptic Grades"" is fuzzed-out and sloppy, barely on the beat, singer Daniel DiMaggio's voice squeaking and missing notes everywhere; it could be a slightly more proficient version of the kid band Eyeball Skeleton. But ""Hey!"" especially is classic in any cast, an exuberant garage-rock ode to electric guitar (which ""can express many emotions""), and the straining, neck-climbing guitar lines that lead into the chorus of ""My Town"" are too canny to be accidental. The compilation has its ups and downs: the more experimental, dour meanderings of ""Bored"" and ""Yard"" have a little less charm than, say, ""Marquand Park"", which takes two minutes of meandering drone to warm up into an insistent anthem warning the listener about a vampire house down the block. But the roughshod and amateurish recording can't be ignored exactly, either. These songs consistently call attention to their seams, always thwarting their momentum and reminding the listener of what they're in for. ""Hey!"", a bubblegum garage tune that halts everything for a chewing gum break, is only the most obvious example. The overdriven bridge of ""Stupid Street"", a real black-and-white to Technicolor moment, highlights the aimlessness of the rest of the track, while ""Right Cut Even"" casts aside all its momentum and built-up competency for scattered, moaned interludes. There's a moment in ""Benches"" where the guitar solo slips from discordant wailing into a rudimentary but effective blues scale, just like a halfway competent player, and that's the part that sounds like a mistake. But what sells the flailing and tape-cutting are plenty of weird concrete details of adolescence, like the parking lot behind the AMC, which is the best place for little league (in ""Little League""). Even more prevalent are awkward, romantic ideas of being a rock star (it's all about ""taking chances and making friends"", according to ""GT Performers""). From the band shivering in the cold of ""Stupid Street"" to the wishing-to-be-road-weary ballad of ""Benches"", these are songs about rock, hoping to rock, and how hard it is to rock. Imagine the first Weezer record, without Ric Ocasek... or a recording studio... or a whole band. Lo-fi might seem like an antiquated notion now, but as with any good story, the songs on this record couldn't take place in any other setting.","Though the sound is rough and the playing often sloppy, this garage-rock outfit manages to transcend the affectations of lo-fi with sharply observed songwriting and sheer exuberance.

Untrue,Burial,by: Philip Sherburne,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributing Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3569d034d5c69bf4ccc/1:1/w_160/a7366144.jpg,2007-11-13 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10877-untrue/,Hyperdub,"If you know the true identity of London dubstep artist Burial, consider yourself a member of a very exclusive circle. Steve Goodman, who runs London's Hyperdub label, knows-- he cuts Burial's royalty checks, after all-- but if anyone else does, no one has yet had the temerity to out Burial's inner Peter Parker. Read an interview or two with the artist himself, and you'll quickly figure out why he's chosen to remain anonymous. Burial's decision not to let a backstory be a part of the music doesn't come across as a strategy calculated to maximize hype, but just the opposite: a means of keeping the music pure, faceless, answerable only to itself-- a closed system. The critical success of Burial's self-titled first album threatened to derail the project's mystery, however. A collection of tunes recorded at home on a low-tech setup over the course of many years, Burial-- moody, brooding, by turns supple and sullen-- shot to the top of many critics' best-of lists last year. To judge from a recent interview with Burial posted on the Hyperdub website, the attention was more distracting than gratifying. ""The first [album] got slightly out of where it belonged,"" he says, ""and I found it a bit difficult to just block things out and make tunes in a low key way again, and it took time to just get back to doing that, and liking it, and doing it fast, and not trying to be a perfectionist. Just trying to dream up tunes again without worrying what people were going to think."" But if it's the reclusive life that Burial seeks, he might just be his own worst enemy, because his new album, Untrue, bests Burial's fans' wildest hopes for the followup. Burial was a worthy, sometimes thrilling record-- an impressive debut-- but it sometimes lost focus, particularly when it attempted to carve out something closer to ""proper,"" clubwise dubstep. But Untrue maintains the style and the vibe of the first album and yet does it better. It's a deeper album-- richer, more complex, more enveloping. The irony is that almost nothing has changed. Burial still makes his beats (at least, so he claims) with relatively lo-fi audio editing software, eschewing the comfort of sequencers and MIDI clocks. His string sounds, which on Burial let many a critic to call his music ""cinematic,"" sound as unabashedly canned as they did last time, and his manipulated vocals-- warped, time-stretched, pitch-corrected-- are just as unabashedly emotive. Like Burial, Untrue is a homage to UK garage, or two-step-- a short-lived, oft-mourned fusion of breakbeats and house music that peaked in the late 90s before morphing into offshoots dubstep, grime, and bassline house. Thus Burial's beats swing wildly, as though flitting between two tempos in the space of a single bar; jittery hi-hat patterns flash like knives being sharpened, and tooth-cracking rimshots invariably fall on the third beat, dividing time in odd ways. His beats seem to rush, trying to catch up with their own out-of-control forward motion, and then-- crack!-- having caught up, they simply hang there, as though unsure what to do with the remaining time left in the measure. It's a relay race marked not by starter's pistols, but stopper's pistols, leaving an impression at once rigid and woozy. But what Burial gets wrong is at least as interesting as what he gets right. Where two-step was marked by its precision-- staccato sub-bass, nimble cadences, rapid-fire vocal shots-- Burial smears everything until the songs' moving parts are all but indistinguishable. In ""Ghost Hardware"", what sounds like the creaking of a swingset grates in the background, as if attempting to tug the music out of its planned arc. On ""Shell of Light"", piano and strings eddy to a crawl as rain drizzles over muted, multi-tracked vocals. There's nothing on Untrue that's likely to work in the dance club, but that's beside the point. Top-heavy with sad string passages and mournful vocal loops, Untrue is an album meant to be heard at home, in the car, on headphones-- his songs feel almost like beautiful secrets being whispered to a listener. Thanks to Burial's use of vocals, Untrue is overflowing with earworms, its spongy terrain pocked and pitted until the ground threatens to give way with every step. It's not a pop album, at least not by Top 40 standards, but his voices-- male, female, and ambiguous-- wriggle deep into the listener's consciousness. They're just intelligible enough to stick-- I'm pretty sure that the refrain to ""Near Dark"" runs, ""I can see why I love you""-- and unintelligible enough to resist dislodging. Occasionally paired with scraps of what might be movie dialogue, they recall the haunted intimacy of Luomo's Vocalcity; like that record, they toy with r&b's conventions, heavy with breath and rippling with trills and melisma, some of it digitally imposed. Like everything in Burial's music, the vocals are supercharged with emotion: Loaded with distance, they often sound like they've been recorded several rooms away from their source. Burial isn't afraid of sidling up next to cheesiness, practically flirting with bathos-- his string sounds are uniformly synthetic and his voices seem expressed in miniature; like Thom Yorke, he raises affect almost to the level of fetish. Burial's all-permeating use of reverb could be a crutch if it didn't work so well. The haze works in his favor, leaving a level of plausible deniability-- you can never be entirely sure that what you're hearing is really there in the track, creating a wonderfully unfinished feeling to the record. ""Sometimes you just want music to stay where it is from,"" says Burial in his Hyperdub interview. ""I love drum & bass, jungle, hardcore, garage, dubstep, and always will till I die, and I don't want the music I love to be a global samplepack music. I like underground tunes that are true and mongrel and you see people trying to break that down, alter its nature. Underground music should have its back turned, it needs to be gone, untrackable, unreadable, just a distant light."" Untrue is just that. It quivers like a hissing lightbulb, one that illuminates the tracks scattered around it-- garage, dubstep, soul-- and in doing so smears them into unique shapes. Untrue shows the hunched, unreadable form of Burial's refusenik stance-- back turned, hands shoved in pockets-- and practically commands you to follow.","The dubstep artist follows his critically acclaimed debut with the even richer*,* more complex, and more enveloping Untrue, a record of reverb-heavy and mournful songs that feel almost like beautiful secrets being whispered to a listener.

Volume 1,The Besnard Lakes,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0df5e6ef95969320062/1:1/w_160/f8436fc4.jpg,2007-11-13 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10881-volume-1/,Break GlassBreak Glass,"To gauge what kind of a year the Besnard Lakes have had, you need only consider that the Montreal band was virtually unknown when they released their latest album, The Besnard Lakes Are the Dark Horse, nine months ago, and now they've already earned their first reissue. Originally released on the band's own Break Glass imprint in 2003, Volume 1 was a patient, languid counterpoint to the frantic, anthemic pop that would soon make Montreal famous, and as such, the album did not reverberate far beyond the band's immediate circle. While their peers in Arcade Fire, Wolf Parade and the Unicorns were reshaping the city's musical landscape, the Besnards sounded more in tune with another time-honored Quebecois passion: Floydian prog-rock. As their friends embarked on North American tours, Besnards co-founders Jace Lacek and Olga Goreas had to content themselves with playing the roles of supportive parents seeing their kids off to college and holding down the fort back home (specifically, at Lacek's increasingly busy Break Glass studios). The critical success of Dark Horse, however, has changed their stature considerably, scoring the band a Polaris Prize nomination in Canada, and an upcoming tour with Peter Bjorn and John. In light of that album's time-lapsed grandeur and swooning choruses, the title of Volume 1 now feels especially appropriate-- not just because it's the band's first album, but because it underscores the album's formative, work-in-progress feel. Volume 1 establishes certain signifiers that would get fleshed out on Dark Horse: the patient builds, the premium placed on mood and space, and the recurring espionage theme that continues to inform Lacek's lyrics. But the album is much more austere in presentation; compared to Dark Horse's inviting nocturnal ambience and Spiritualized-like string-laden swells, Volume 1 favours chiseled, discordant guitar riffs more in line with mid-90s fretboard contortionists like Polvo. The album's duel set pieces, ""Skyscraper Girls"" and ""You've Got to Want to Be a Star"", both run nine minutes long and feel like it too, setting their jangly, downcast refrains atop sluggish tempos and a bedrock of ominous drones as cold and imposing as slabs of concrete. And Lacek had yet to develop the courage to show off the weepy falsetto that propelled Dark Horse's most affecting moments (""For Agent 13"", ""Because Tonight""), favouring a monotone mumble that's buried deep in the mix-- which just goes to show that it takes cajones to sing like you don't got any. So the real rewards here come with picking out hints of what's to come: in its final two minutes, ""Skyscraper Girls"" introduces a squealing guitar solo that foreshadows the climactic, arena-rocking coda of Dark Horse's ""And You Lied to Me""; the hazy girl-group harmonies of ""This Thing"" would later fully flourish on Goreas' sludge-metal showstopper ""Devastation"". Volume 1 is also notable for showing the paths that the Besnards have since chosen not to follow, namely with the urgent, agitated Breeders-style distorto-pop of ""Thomasina,"" driven by Goreas' ""Cannonball""-sized bass groove. But if Volume 1 sounds very much like a debut effort-- both in its streamlined mid-fi production and exploratory, sometimes directionless drift-- its closing track spells out the Besnards' future: ""Life Rarely Begins With the Tungsten Film #1"" may be a mouthful, but its space-bound guitar charge and dreamily ascending melody show the way to the Besnards' second volume.","A patient, languid counterpoint to the frantic, anthemic pop that would soon make Montreal famous, Besnard Lakes' debut album is reissued, with distribution help from Jagjaguwar.

Sweep the Leg,Hangar 18,by: Sam Chennault,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3375e6ef9596932240e/1:1/w_160/96f908bc.jpg,2007-11-12 06:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10839-sweep-the-leg/,Definitive Jux,"On their sophomore disc, Hangar 18 may be even more inaccessible than their Def Jux labelmates. Aesop is a master at hypnotic word scrambles, while El-P's wall of noize approximates a slap across the face. Both styles grab you by the balls and force you to form an opinion about them. Hangar 18, meanwhile, are content to tap at your shoulder and whisper a million seemingly disconnected words into your ear. And though emcees Alaska and Windbreeze have a knack for forging rhythm at 400 mph, there's nothing to latch onto here, and ultimately Sweep the Leg is banal and mundane, predicated on inoffensive electro-lite production and rushed nerd rap flows. To put it simply: the shit is flat. None of which is to imply that there aren't things the group gets right. paWL's production work on the stabbing ""Jump Muthafuh"" approximates the apoca-funk of his fellow Def Jukies, while the Reichian drool of ""Sad"" is hypnotically spare, especially when paired with the melancholic, jazzy embellishments that bookend the track. But these tantalizing moments are few and far between, and too often the tracks feel static and underdeveloped. The synth line that snakes through ""WatchYoSelf"" can be transfixing for anyone who spent their childhood buried in electronic games, but the beat is too stiff and symptomatic of the album's underwhelming drum programming. The bouncing electro of ""Bakin Soda"", meanwhile, is punchy without being funky. The best thing that you can say about it is that it's forgettable and generic. The rapping, meanwhile, seems as if it's been incubated in a hermetically sealed nerd rap container. It's clear that, individually, Alaska and Windbreeze are talented, and it's tempting to be impressed by the sheer quantity of lyrics here, but their voices are too smooth, bereft of the gruff crevices or the aching cracks that reveal personality. While their indecipherable double-time flows are impressive, they're also exhausting. You want them to relax, pull back, and express themselves cleanly and simply. When the subjects of the songs are clear, the themes and ideas are banal. (Check ""Dance With Me"" to see what happens when nerd rappers go to the club.) In the end, Hangar 18's technical acumen and obvious hunger don't amount to much. Listening is a chore. They simply haven't learned how to wield their power, and the album feels more like an exercise than a work of art.","Second album from New York rap crew on Definitive Jux is filled with double-time flows and occasionally tantalizing production, but more problematic elements dominate.

Emotionalism,The Avett Brothers,by: Mike Powell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2f8ea9e61561daa69f5/1:1/w_160/191e2bc3.jpg,2007-11-12 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10778-emotionalism/,Ramseur,"The Avett Brothers' Emotionalism is the most contrived record I've heard this year. It's also one that, like my kitchen table, I've returned to, compulsively and without expectation, for comfort and familiarity. My stupid little bromide, maybe. And what the band-- two brothers and a friend from Concord, North Carolina-- lacks in subtlety, they make up for with embarrassing persistence: Song after song, stumbling through country, bluegrass, orchestral pop, and early Beatles-style pop-rock, they never waste a chance to harmonize or wail, to loose one beat-down sentiment after another, to back-pat or console. In a world so full of cynicism that it's invisible-- and one in which anti-cynics invariably look like thorough dopes-- it's hard to talk about Emotionalism, their fifth studio album, in a way that isn't hyperbolic. It could stand to be 15 or 20 minutes shorter. Some of the songs, like ""The Ballad of Love and Hate"", are ham-handed without sounding humble, allegories stuffed with pulpit wisdom and so bent on supplying a moral that the characters become abstractions. The Avett's heroes, like the Replacements', aren't clever or nuanced-- they're most instructive when puking, bawling, or both. Or, like the narrator in ""Will You Return?"", an unwitting bubba to whom shit just happens: ""I open my eyes/ And here's what occurs/ A pretty little girl/ With pretty little curls/ Leans on my mind/ Leans to the side."" When Emotionalism is good, it's intrusively good, a kind of stop-and-pause experience that will probably inspire inscrutable phone calls to people you care about-- ""I just wanted you know how blessed I am,"" and so on-- which, in turn, will inspire concerned questions from said loved ones about alcohol intake (blame the last thirty years, which made a cultural victim of earnestness). And drunk it is, most of the time-- messy in sentiment, swooning, impulsive. It's that spirit that offsets the album's contrivances. It's not grisly-- some of Emotionalism shows off how irritatingly middlebrow and non-committal alt-country can be-- but it's not too mannered, either. And the Avetts probably get shot by both sides as a result. So play the perfunctory cynic through the opening ruminations of ""Die Die Die"", come to flinch at the aw-shucksisms of ""Paranoia in B-Flat Major"" ten minutes later, cry like a bruised teenager by the time you hit ""Salina"", and then find the wherewithal to glorify your bad decisions by ""Pretty Girl from San Diego"". Emotionalism is the analyst who probes the reluctant patient until he splits like a melon.","North Carolina neo-bluegrass outfit write uncommonly affecting songs as they stumble through country, bluegrass, orchestral pop, and early Beatles-style pop-rock.

Karhunainen,Uusitalo,by: Tim Finney,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5e58bc8e230d040009b1f202/1:1/w_160/Karhunainen.jpg,2007-11-12 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10812-karhunainen/,Huume,"Finnish producer Vladislav Delay (actual name: Sasu Ripatti) may use multiple names for his different sonic impulses, but his personas aren't static: Each expresses an arc of transformation which belies his status as an accomplished polymath. On his albums as Luomo, Ripatti has moved from sensuous longform deep house to stuttery vocal house-pop; on his three albums as Uusitalo, the shift has been more subtle, a gradual, tectonic drift from dub-techno abstraction toward tech-house's disciplined physical economy. These narratives do not exist in isolation, and the revitalisation of the Uusitalo project feels like a semi-conscious acknowledgment that the Luomo project has arrived at an aesthetic dead end, with much of last year's Paper Tigers feeling like hastily assembled footnotes and addendums to the glittering manifesto of 2003's The Present Lover. If Delay doesn't know how to take voluptuous house-pop any further, then Uusitalo's more measured tone offers a potential escape route, allowing Delay to reconnect with house from a new perspective uncluttered by the expectations that attach to his more famous moniker. The instrumental Karhunainen is understated despite its relative forcefulness, the pumping kickdrums perhaps too straightforward for listeners who prefer Delay's history of fractured dub wanderings, but dry and reserved when compared to Luomo's lustrous gleam. The album misses the sort of thematic clarity or alluring vocals that made Luomo's Vocalcity and The Present Lover so pivotal and influential for so many, but what it loses in crossover points it gains in dancefloor currency, with Delay cunningly positioning his sound at the dead centre of current European house and techno. More metallic than most of the last year's crop of deep house revivalism, and yet chunkier and warmer than the rapidly receding minimal archetype, these tightly wound and glistening grooves share much with recent releases from producers such as Simon Baker and Tobi Neumann. Paradoxically, according with the dictates of fashion has a liberating effect on Delay: By abandoning auteurist conceptuality, he regains a lightness of touch rare in even his most pleasure-centred previous efforts. In particular, the energetically squelchy house of ""Satumaa"" expresses a joyfulness that is unlike any of the producer's past work, perhaps because it's not about anything other than the effervescence of its own groove. Not that the album is a straight dancefloor bomb: The largely beatless opener ""Vesi Virtaa Veri"", with its funereal chords and sampled found sound (rustling papers, far off voices, the pant of heavy breathing and the coagulated whine of passing traffic) enigmatically suggests the commencement of a long-dreaded journey, while the shimmering synthesiser hum of closer ""Puut Juuritaan"" resembles a heartsore Tangerine Dream. But the rest of Karunainen sidelines emotional impact in favour of honing in on the sheer physical intensity of the endlessly reiterated beat. After ""Vesi Virtaa Veri"", ""Korpikansa"" immediately drops the listener into a monomaniacal two-note house groove (its furrow-browed pump leavened by an endlessly mutating array of percussive effects) that seems content to drive forward into a constantly receding horizon, its magic lying in the friction generated by its repetition/mutation equation. Such tracks initially feel rigid when compared with the languorous dub-disco grooves of Luomo's Vocalcity album, but on repeated listens Karhunainen is revealed as one of Luomo's most impressively fluid works to date, the percussion changing with the organic rapidity of molecular generation-- just try to keep up with the kaleidoscope of detail on ""Tohtori Kuka"", or to trace the transformation of Sikojen Juhla from buzzy house to clattering schaffel and back again. This sense of the real action happening almost beneath or beyond the level of conscious awareness is one of the album's quiet strengths: as with Stewart Walker's recent Concentricity (another shift toward anti-auteurist dancefloor populism from a distinguished producer), Karhunainen so carefully intersects rigorous simplicity and mindboggling complexity that the two become conflated, with the accumulated whispers of intricate detail and the hefty thump of the house grooves emerging dialectically, like Escher hands drawing one another. As such, it stands in opposition to Paper Tigers, whose collages of clean surfaces and clattering irruptions felt anything but organic. If the latter album wanted to articulate the messiness of desire (the gulf between the fantasy and the reality of other people's bodies), Karhunainen draws back to the deeper relationship we share with our own bodies, the sheer rightness of its grooves suggesting the immediacy of physical submersion.","On his latest excellent Uusitalo release, Sasu Ripatti (Luomo, Vladislav Delay) continues the gradual, tectonic drift from dub-techno abstraction toward the more disciplined sound of tech-house.

Mothership,Led Zeppelin,by: Amanda Petrusich,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b367c0084474cd0c2108/1:1/w_160/6706fa8c.jpg,2007-11-12 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10890-mothership/,Atlantic,"Led Zeppelin were never much of a singles band: From 1969 on, guitarist Jimmy Page was adamant that the group's LPs not be mucked up with filler, so most of their releases contain only between eight and 10 tracks. Led Zeppelin's legacy so significantly shaped the next four decades of rock'n'roll and heavy metal that to further discount any one of those tracks seemed brash, negligent, or stupid. Twelve years of intense self-editing meant that Led Zeppelin required no best-of. Anyone truly interested in their music was advised to dig through their couch cushions until they came up with enough quarters to invest in one (or all) of the band's albums: It would be worth every penny. Mothership-- a collection of 24 of Led Zeppelin's ""greatest hits,"" remastered and selected by the band's three remaining members (Page, as well as Robert Plant and John Paul Jones)-- might be conceptually flawed, but it's hard to argue against songs as indisputably great as these. Mothership is not the first time Page has participated in the distillation of his own work: In 1990, a decade after John Bonham downed his last shot of vodka, Page curated an eponymous boxset (known, in fan parlance, as Crop Circles) which saw their eight-album discography distilled to four perfect CDs. And in 2002, Atlantic released Early Days and Latter Days: Volumes 1 and 2 (each previously available as a single purchase, in 1999 and 2000, respectively), a Page-condoned collection of 23 tracks which awesomely featured all four members of Led Zeppelin on the cover, dressed in giant American space suits and perched casually in front of an illustrated moonscape. Early Days and Latter Days has a tracklist similar to Mothership (the latter adds ""D'yer Mak'er"", ""Over the Hills and Far Away"", ""Heartbreaker"", and ""Ramble On"", but loses ""Ten Years Gone"", ""What Is and What Should Never Be"", and ""The Battle of Evermore"") so, clearly, the idea of Led Zeppelin's greatest hits is contentious even for the band itself. Fans will probably argue over Led Zeppelin's selections-- omitting ""What Is and What Should Never Be"" feels unforgivable-- and it seems obvious that Page, Plant, and Jones were striving hard to represent every last phase of their career: Some work from the band's crucial 1969-1975 era is sacrificed for late-career tokens like the comparably-mediocre ""In The Evening"" (itself a curious selection, given the relative popularity of In Through the Out Door's ""Fool in the Rain"", which was the band's last release to make the pop single charts). Still, content-critiquing aside, the remastering on Mothership is no small achievement, and it sounds revelatory on even the shittiest stereos. Check Bonham's pitter-pattering in the verses of ""Ramble On"", or the still-intact fuzz at the top of ""Immigrant Song"", or the tiny percussive ""fwwpts"" on ""D'yer Mak'er"", or the restored outro to ""Over the Hills and Far Away"". Twist your volume knob heavenward and embrace Plant's inescapable geekiness, yelping about Gollum and Mordor; chug booze and air-drum with John Bonham: Led Zeppelin sound as tremendous in 2007 as they did in 1972. Mothership offers no bonus content or previously unreleased material. It serves, mainly, as an introduction for those (presumably out of classic rock radio range) still unfamiliar with the band. Longtime fans will find little of use here, although anyone who spends a couple hours with Mothership will find themselves duly reminded that Led Zeppelin are quite possibly the finest rock band of all time.","Essentially a primer for those who actually might not be familiar with the Led Zeppelin catalog, this is a collection of unimpeachable songs in search of an audience.

Greatest Hits,Nas,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a0c6c0084474cd0bfc59/1:1/w_160/70e57c38.jpg,2007-11-12 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10896-greatest-hits/,Columbia,"Odds are, if you have any interest in Nas, you've already heard some wisecrack about Illmatic rendering a greatest hits collection redundant. That's bullshit; as one of the all-time great albums in rap history, failing to top it isn't so much a letdown as an inevitability, and from 1996 on, Nas' conflicts with commercialism, identity, and realness have provided more compelling moments on wax than the unending-sophomore-slump theory would have you believe. A 59-minute, 14-track collection like the new Greatest Hits doesn't even begin to cover it all. Still, the market gets what the market wants, so here's your gratuitous contract-fulfillment best-of, hampered by label rights, an absence of deep cuts, and the obligatory previously unreleased stuff. Given the fact that anyone with a computer and a reasonably complete Nas discography can make their own personal Greatest Hits-- throw on five tracks from supergroup the Firm if you want, go nuts-- the thing that defines Nas' best-of isn't that nearly all of the tracks on it are just about bulletproof, but that the stuff that's missing is important if not flat-out crucial to defining Nas as an MC. First, there's no ""Halftime"". His 1992 debut single proved he could carry his own track as well as he could carry his guest verses (speaking of which, a great homemade version of Nas' Greatest Hits might kick off with Main Source's ""Live at the Barbeque""). The track also cemented his viciously intelligent, humor-laced style, and features one of Large Professor's greatest beats. Second, the problem with picking tracks from an album like Illmatic is that you'd have to stop somewhere, but while its four tracks represented here-- ""It Ain't Hard to Tell"", ""Life's a Bitch"", ""N.Y. State of Mind"", and ""One Love""-- are classic enough that they'd be difficult to substitute anything else for, leaving out ""The World Is Yours"" is just about unforgivable; it is Nas' greatest hit. (Here's a reminder why: ""I sip the Dom P, watchin Gandhi 'til I'm charged/ Then writin' in my book of rhymes, all the words pass the margin/ To hold the mic I'm throbbin', mechanical movement/ Understandable smooth shit that murderers move with."") ""Hate Me Now"" is the only track included here that was recorded between 1996 and 2001. Even if that period isn't his richest creative stretch it's weird to have it so underrepresented (at least throw in ""Nas Is Like"" or something). And, thanks to label and rights issues, nothing from last year's Hip Hop Is Dead shows up here, even though Columbia jointly financed and promoted it with Def Jam. Then there's the material that defined a huge step in Nas' career in the 2000s-- namely the Jay-Z beef. ""Ether"" is one of those rare 21st century tracks that's become an integral part of rap language, with its title becoming a lower-case way of saying you've completely devastated your opponent in battle. Put that in a three-song succession with God's Son cut ""Last Real Nigga Alive"" as the elaboration/defense and ""Black Republicans"" as the reconciliation, and you've got one of the decade's biggest hip-hop stories represented-- in microcosm, maybe, but at least it'd be acknowledged, even if it risked reopening some old wounds. So what's the motive to buy this? The new track, ""Surviving the Times"", is a perfectly fine how-I-got-here reminiscence that details everything from his apprenticeship under Eric B. & Rakim to MC Serch getting him his first deal with Columbia (""Shit a little funny, feel a little laughter/ Rebel of hip-hop coming through a white rapper""); it's also a penny short of a buck on iTunes. The other newish cut, the Rush Hour 3 soundtrack fodder/Cee-lo showcase ""Less Than an Hour"", sounds like a Gnarls Barkley outtake with Nas on the other side of the ""ft."" Greatest Hits is still a decent appraisal of Nas' artistic shifts and the risks he's taken in the last decade, with a second half that's as compelling as it is stylistically restless-- the money-stacks bombast and unhinged fury of ""Hate Me Now"" into the introspective slow-burn intensity of ""One Mic""; the hardcore shot-busting swagger of ""Made You Look"" into the classicist teach-the-seeds Afrocentrism of ""I Can"". And going strictly by how good every song on this collection is and nothing else, yeah, it's technically an excellent record. But look at the cover, open the case, take out the CD, leaf through the booklet: You don't see Nas' entire face anywhere in the art for Greatest Hits. You see his eyes-- filtered through a repeated transcription of ""If I Ruled the World""'s third verse on the cover, glancing over a skull-print bandana in the tray, peering wearily through his fingers in a photo recycled from the sleeve to the ""Life's a Bitch"" single-- but you never get a complete portrait. Now turn the case over and check the tracklist...",,6.4,
We Sing of Only Blood or Love,Dax Riggs,by: Aaron Leitko,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b325ea9e61561daa6a41/1:1/w_160/06f4a8cb.jpg,2007-11-09 06:00:05,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10821-we-sing-of-only-blood-or-love/,Fat Possum,"If you long for the days when rock'n'roll frontmen had not only teeth but also fangs (i.e., the late 1980s), then Dax Riggs is probably your guy. Riggs is a goth-rock lead singer to rival pale-faced forbears like Peter Murphy and early Ian Astbury, but he also has some of the latter's later fondness for late-60s psychedelic rock. He's a guy who can lace up a pair of leather pants with a sense of purpose and probably bite the head off of whatever hapless bite-sized creature is within grasp. But for all the heat and hellfire he calls up on We Sing of Only Blood or Love, the album is undercooked, coming in light on ideas and heavy on the leaden death-blues hokum. As the singer for sludgy Southern metal band Acid Bath and more recently the swamp-rock outfit Deadboy & the Elephantmen, Riggs established a brooding sepulchral style that paired theatrically spooky imagery with soulful Bowie-esque crooning. Blood or Love is his first record under his given name and it largely sticks to this territory. Riggs can still take lyrics that would look better tattooed on the arm of an extra in Wild Angels-- lines like ""living is suicide"" or ""Night is the notion/ We are the explosion""-- and make them stand up in their affectation-ridden graves. But nothing on Blood or Love can stay on its feet for very long. Most of the album's songs seem hurried, rising up into squalls of fury only to fizzle out and die around the two-minute mark. ""Living Is Suicide"" starts our dark and soulful with bluesy lamentations giving way to an expansive glam sing-along that runs out faster than a tube of Robert Smith's lipstick. A solid backing band composed of Superwolf and Chavez guitarist Matt Sweeney (who also produced) along with Endless Boogie drummer Andy MacLeod and a few other Brooklyn-based heavies is generally wasted, as they slash through buzzing and chugging arrangements that end before they even begin with nary a breakdown or solo in sight. On the other hand, there's too much of Riggs vampyric subject matter and the lack of subtlety becomes slightly oppressive as Blood or Love winds on. Go ahead and let Riggs take you to the haunted house of his mind in ""A Spinning Song"", then let him take you to the haunted desert of ""Forgot I Was Alive"". But by the time he's bludgeoning you with the haunted circus on ""Wall of Death"" it's time to drop the black velvet curtains. Talented, individual, and somewhat freaky, Dax Riggs is like the smart kid in high school that wears all black all of the time. You totally could have been best friends with him had he only stopped breaking off your conversations to obsess over J. O'Barr lithographs and Samurai ethics. Only with Riggs it's Satan and images of unknowable suffering. All told, both might have been more palatable if accompanied by a few more guitar solos.","Former lead singer of sludge-metal band Acid Bath-- working under his own name for the first time after heading up projects including Deadboy & the Elephantmen-- combines goth, blues, and psychedelia in songs about death and dying.

The music reels from raucous to serene, and the lyrics run the emotional gamut from chaotic families to foreboding weddings to figuring out how to cyberflirt. But even when she bellows a chorus, tells stories out of school about mother-daughter strife, or bites off a lyric about starving to fit into a dress, Bui's bold tone is steady as a rock. Everyone Wore White is Bui's second LP, following her 2004 debut This Is How I Recover. Bui has been compared to Kristin Hersh, partly because they're both women who tear it up on guitar. But her writing and her fretwork-- equal parts punk, blues, piss, and a pedestal to stand on-- hew closer to those of J. Robbins in Jawbox and Burning Airlines, or, considering her gift for tunes, maybe Heart. Her fierce guitar, matched by cellist Jenny Petrow, creates soaring melodic hard rock with engrossing sincerity-- as Bob Mould has proven, you can't b.s. a cello. Credit Aloha's T. J. Lipple for the drum work and the stellar production, which translates her intensity to record without losing its beauty or nuance. In the tradition of her hometown of Washington, D.C., she's made a punk-bred record where the guitar is loud but the tunes prevail. Sometimes the mix poises her too angelically above the fray-- for example, the verse of ""St. Elizabeth's"", before the chorus rages in. And listeners who crave angst might find Bui reserved, although it's hard to picture not being moved by the abused lover on ""Hypnagogia"" who lists her blows-- and explains, ""I can't lose composure."" The most striking performance closes the album: she sings the traditional song ""Qua Cầu Gió Bay"" (""The Wind on the Bridge"") a capella, in a tone so powerful it fills in the meaning that's lost if you don't speak Vietnamese. According to one translation online, it's a song about the things you do on a bridge with a boy that you'll never speak of to your ma and pa. And from the sound of her voice, Bui doesn't regret a thing.","In the tradition of her hometown of Washington, D.C., Bui has made a punk-bred record where the guitar is loud but the tunes prevail.

Situation,Buck 65,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b35dc0084474cd0c20f3/1:1/w_160/6c8d95a6.jpg,2007-11-09 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10883-situation/,Strange Famous,"The Canadian rapper Buck 65 (Richard Terfry) seems uncomfortable staying put. When he began making waves in Halifax, he was a college-radio DJ. Before long his own songs began appearing on playlists. Listeners who heard his rasp and felt the grit in his songs heralded him as the new Tom Waits--as if tragedy had befallen the old one. One moment he's in America, performing witty blues-rap, the next he's in Paris hanging out with Feist. As the talking points began to catch up--this was a border ruffian who flits across the urban-rural musical divide--he was already squirming away. He's now directing shorts and composing film scores. Forward-looking ventures into electronica are on the way. But Situation, by most counts Buck 65's 11th release, is a long look backward. Fifty years, to be precise. He sees 1957 as a once-in-a-century watershed (kind of like 1968), with both the space race and the Beat movement muscling into history. The album even borrows from Allen Ginsberg's counterculture lament ""Howl"" with Buck 65 deadpanning, in his smoke-singed growl, the iconic words: ""The best minds of my generation were destroyed by madness."" Little tributes to the period seem to rain chaotically over the canvas, only to be reordered into Buck's suave collage of rhyme and reference, equal parts Ginsberg and Wikipedia. Vibrant as the cut-and-paste may be, Buck 65's monotone radiates fatigue, not exalted world-weariness. It doesn't help that he unfurls his wordy sentences in the same, bored rhythm. Adding a little energy, producer Skratch Bastid's splashing, piston-like breakbeats keep the songs from inducing sleep. But Situation's ""return to drums"" aesthetic can work against the songs, too, because it seems both emptily nostalgic, old-school for the sake of being old-school, and anachronistic, given the early 1980s snares hardly fit the late 1950s allusions. It can't justify itself. There may be pianos (""1957"", ""Ho-Boys"") and guitars (""The Rebel"", ""The Outskirts"") but they are mostly subdued to the boom-bap. This sound marks a shift not only from the atmospheric mopefest 2005's Secret House Against the World, but from Buck 65's Lynchian, country-fried magnum opus, Talkin' Honky Blues. Indie rappers have a habit of bellowing sermons at their audiences. Buck 65 takes a less direct approach. He lets loose at 2007 by showing that many half-century-old absurdities and anxieties haven't left us. America remains as sexually Puritan as ever, we're reminded, while the threat of annihilation still seeps into everyday life. He also makes his points through role-playing, inhabiting a two-bit pornographer on ""Shutter Buggin'""-- where bondage pin-up Bettie Page is the subject (well, the object)-- and a vice-squad relic on ""Spread 'Em"". The points aren't always coherent, but they are always vividly wrought, full of mischief but touched by sadness. His best role, the dreamlike tale of a Travis Bickle in the making, ""Mr. Nobody"" reveals Buck 65 at his most poignant and, yes, grown-up. An album full of these character sketches-- with their gray areas and their slow-burning, cinematic arrangements-- would have made an astute and intimate work of social commentary. Instead the argument buckles not only under the weight of references, but also the tired flow and beats.

The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust!,Saul Williams,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b360ea9e61561daa6aa8/1:1/w_160/c1c166c7.jpg,2007-11-09 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10885-the-inevitable-rise-and-liberation-of-niggytardust/,Fader,"There's two novel ideas at work behind this album, but only one of them's getting much attention. Trent Reznor has been pretty upfront recently about his general disdain with the way the music industry works, encouraging concertgoers to share his music and going public with his irritation at the cost of his own CDs. It became apparent once Reznor parted ways with Interscope that he'd be looking for a new business plan that would circumvent your garden-variety industry bullshit. All it took to set a solid-enough precedent was Radiohead's pay-what-you-want model for In Rainbows-- after that, the ""try it for free; pay $5 if you like it and you get to download higher-quality audio files"" plan for the new Saul Williams album The Inevitable Rise and Liberation of NiggyTardust! was enough to get some attention all by itself. But the other novel idea, being overlooked in lieu of the distribution plan, is the album's stylistic approach. Saul Williams, despite being more of a straight-up poet than an MC, is one of those rare artists who justifies the notion of a hip-hop/rock interchange in a post-nu-metal world. His aggression is focused, pointed, and self-aware enough to avoid falling into temper-tantrum emptiness, and it's backed by music that focuses on the aesthetic slipperiness of heavy rock's capabilities. After 2001's Rick Rubin-produced Amethyst Rock Star and his self-titled 2004 record (featuring guest spots from Zack de la Rocha and Serj Tankian), it isn't a shock that Williams paired up with Reznor for this new album-- especially considering Saul's opened for Nine Inch Nails on more than one tour over the last couple of years. But to hear Williams' firebrand rhetoric about black identity delivered over an album filled with punk and industrial undercurrents-- and to hear Reznor infuse those undercurrents with moments of hip-hop inspiration ranging from Southern bounce to straight-up Public Enemy tributes-- is eye-opening. As for whether it results in an entertaining record, well, that probably depends on whether you like to be less comfortable going out of an album than you are coming in. There's plenty about the production for NiggyTardust! that makes it initially accessible-- opening track ""Black History Month"" makes like a drumline facing off against skyscraper subwoofers; there's a touch of Timbaland gone malicious in the supple but abrasive electro-bounce of tracks like ""The Ritual"" and ""Break""; there's even a semi-faithful cover of U2's ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" stripped down to the rhythm and augmented with flashes of buzzing synth. But those moments don't sustain or define the album as much as the anxious, creeping-tension moments do; apparently Trent put together the bulk of NiggyTardust!'s beats with the ingredients he left out of Year Zero for not being immediate enough. The slow-grower songs, like the Boards of Canada soundalike ""No One Ever Does"", the sleepy, minimalist, dying-808 pulse of ""Raw"" and its clangy, semi-organic counterpart ""Skin of a Drum"", mostly act as rhythms for Williams' voice to ricochet off. And even when the production gets intense (the post-rock-vs.-Neptunes clamor of ""Convict Colony""; the classic Downward Spiral-isms of dirge ""Raised to be Lowered""), Saul's voice still acts as the dominant instrument-- wailing, murmuring, jousting sneeringly with his own overdubbed voice, and even veering fascinatingly close to Reznor's own stylings; credits notwithstanding I'm still not 100% convinced it's not actually Trent singing on ""Banged and Blown Through"", which attests to Williams' versatility as a singer. In a sort of simultaneous downside and necessity, Williams' lyrics tend to be a bit opaque and evasive, dodging the straightforwardness that many of his ideas demand even if his voice shapes them into something heavier. Sometimes, they're too busy asking questions to account for all the possible answers: PE homage ""Tr(n)igger"" brings up a familiar but crucially unnerving theory (""would Jesus Christ come back American/ What if he's Iraqi and here again?"") only to drop it after a disorienting barrage of unclear ""where will you be when the revolution starts"" rhetoric. Then there's tracks like ""Black History Month"" (""I'm taking my spot, nigga, I ain't afraid to be me/ Sometimes I find it very hard to be/ Who? Me"") and ""Scared Money"" (""I swear, I used to pray to change back the year/ When niggas spoke of motherships with space helmets for hair/ Well, now what have we here? Thugs and poets, ah yeah/ What we seem to have in common is we're common as air"") which address the need to find a place for the foreign and the unreal in a hip-hop culture concerned with regionalism and realism. The songs, however, have so many layers of language that the core message is a bit hard to grasp. Yet making the listener work doesn't necessarily make for a bad record, just a challenging one, and since NiggyTardust opts to leave the easy answers in the margins, its more resonant lines skew toward the kinds of uncomfortable accusations and introspective examinations that are both difficult and important to mull over. Yeah, the pricing's fair, but it's not the five bucks you have to worry about-- it's your full attention. It might be harder to focus on this record than it is to actually put down money for it; but to get anything out of it, you've got to pay into it.","This Trent Reznor-produced record is following the In Rainbows price model, but just as importantly is the work of one of the few artists who can pull off the hip-hop/rock interchange.

The Virginian / Furnace Room Lullaby / Blacklisted / Fox Confessor Brings the Flood [Bonus Disc Edition],Neko Case,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1075e6ef959693200cb/1:1/w_160/e48b97b2.jpg,2007-11-09 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11628-the-virginianfurnace-room-lullabyblacklistedfox-confessor-brings-the-flood-bonus-disc-edition/,MintMint,"It's rare that any artist gets her studio discography reissued all at once, but such is the case with alt-country belter Neko Case. Mint Records is reissuing her debut, The Virginian, which it originally released in 1997; the Vancouver-based label also put out her early records with Maow as well as side projects the Corn Sisters (with Carolyn Mark) and, yes, the New Pornographers. In addition, U.S. label Anti- is reissuing last year's Fox Confessor Brings the Flood, as well as two of her previous albums, 2000's Furnace Room Lullaby and 2002's Blacklisted, both of which were originally released by Bloodshot Records. Of the four albums, only Fox Confessor gets any bonus material-- a sampler disc with one new track and four old ones, which reinforce the retrospective aspect of this set. Neither Anti nor Mint is simply reselling Case's music; instead, in an unintended partnership, they're repackaging her as an established career artist, one whose previous efforts deserve your attention as well as your money. Generally considered the redheaded stepchild of Case's canon, The Virginian is an eclectic collection of original material and covers that hews closely to the alt-country model of the late 90s, with two country-swing numbers that haven't aged particularly well (""Honkytonk Hiccups"" and ""Karoline"") and some sparsely arranged ballads that have (""Jettison"" and the title track). Covering songs by Loretta Lynn and Ernest Tubb, Case takes vocal cues from Lynn Anderson, Kate Pierson, and all those punk singers she emulated in her previous punk bands. Her rollicking cover of the Everly Brothers' ""Bowling Green"" and her 10-story take on Scott Walker's ""Duchess"" feature some of her highest-flying vocals, the kind so bold and surefooted they sound almost too easy, like anyone can do it. Modest but punchy even ten years later, The Virginian retains much of its feisty charm, but Case's subsequent albums would abandon this joyful musical release for darker matters and lonelier sounds. In this sense, The Virginian is a useful complement to Anti's re-releases, because it shows not only how far Case has come in 10 years, but what was lost and what was gained along the way. Furnace Room Lullaby (which is, incidentally, the only Case album that hasn't been reviewed previously on this site) sounds weightier than its predecessor, each song touched by personal tragedy. ""Whip the Blankets"" and ""Mood to Burn Bridges"" are rare rave-ups that feature the road-tested Her Boyfriends and a fierily defiant Case, but as fast and as fun as these songs are, they're propelled by a peculiar desperation that streams through every song, even the breezy ""No Need to Cry"" and the Tacoma-loyal ""Thrice All American"". This sense of unspecified loss culminates on side one with ""Twist the Knife"", which showcases Case's close dynamic with Her Boyfriends, and on side two with ""South Tacoma Way"", a tearjerker that eloquently evokes the aimlessness that follows deep grief. Case's startlingly soulful performance and the songs' lyrical specificity make Furnace Room Lullaby both a fiercely local album and her most satisyfing collection. If Furnace Room Lullaby sounds inspired by real heartbreak, then Blacklisted considers death as an abstract concept, a nocturnal entity that haunts interstates and plane crashes and demands moody music with few hooks. Dropping Her Boyfriends from the bill, Case wrote almost every track herself-- in fact, the only songs she doesn't get sole credit for are the two covers. This new development is important, as it signals a shift in her music from country-soul numbers with concrete imagery and more-or-less traditional structure to less defined songs with impressionistic lyrics and even bleaker themes. On ""Deep Red Bells"" and ""Lady Pilot"", Case intently fashions new mythologies from the Pacific Northwest soil, a fascinating project that serves these songs well. However, with Calexico (and some of her former Boyfriends) accompanying her with just the right amount of eeriness, Case's songs ramble repetitively or cut off abruptly. Blacklisted is unsettlingly open-ended in a way that demands multiple listens but lacks the pay-off that Furnace Room Lullaby so easily achieves. Despite their notably different approaches to the same source material, Blacklisted and Furnace Room Lullaby seem intrinsically linked, right down to their covers depicting Case as a ravished victim of some unspoken violence (now rendered in digipak form instead of so-yesterday jewel cases). Neither of these reissues contains bonus material of any kind, and although there's a wealth of obscure Case releases from which to draw such enticements (including her home-recorded Canadian Amp EP), there's something reassuring about their austerity. These albums will someday deserve deluxe, deeply researched, multi-disc editions, but for now these reissues preserve the works in their original state, with no inferior tack-ons to diminish the impact of those final notes on those final songs. In this foursome of reissues, only Fox Confessor gets a bonus disc, which has five tracks but only one new song-- ""Behind the House"", which appeared in a different form on Live from Austin, TX earlier this year. Despite its classification as a demo, the song sounds wholly developed even at this reportedly early stage, with a one-two drumbeat and tremolo guitar underscoring her reverb-swathed vocals. ""Behind the House"" is a spiritual sister to ""Deep Red Bells"" and especially ""Star Witness"", a Fox Confessor stand-out whose fatalistic tone and lucid lyrics evoke car-crash death scenes like half-formed memories. There's an intriguing rustic-goth tone to Case's country, a murky twilight mood that draws from the soulfulness of Lullaby and the weirdness of Blacklisted and here is perfectly executed by her backing band, which includes the Sadies and Calexico. The album's sparkliest bauble, however, is Garth Hudson's piano, which curlicues throughout ""Margaret vs. Pauline"" and the rumbling gospel ""John Saw That Number"". Despite Case's fearless performances on ""Dirty Knife"" and ""Maybe Sparrow"", Fox Confessor often pours on the atmospherics too thick, giving it a truncated, unfinished feel too similar to Blacklisted. It is an album with more great moments than great songs, capping the first decade of a career that promises to have many more of both.",,7.3,
Randall of Nazareth,Randall of Nazareth,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3275e6ef959693223ec/1:1/w_160/fcded77a.jpg,2007-11-08 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10822-randall-of-nazareth/,Drag City,"Randall of Nazareth was made with a cold: During two of the eight tracks that comprise the debut from singer-songwriter Randall Huth, there's at least one sniffle just before a verse starts. Even while he hammers a wall of notes from a dulcimer to begin late-album reverie ""The Way"", he coughs inches away from the microphone. It's all left on tape. Details like this confirm what sort of album Randall of Nazareth is-- one made while Huth was on holiday from his regular power trio, Pearls & Brass, following tours behind Drag City debut The Indian Tower. He recorded these eight songs at home in Nazareth, a modest eastern Pennsylvania town that claims early Moravian heritage and, fittingly, Martin Guitars. The album has pockmarks, like those sniffles and that cough, pre-song movement and mid-song whistling, dropped instruments and false starts. From a production standpoint, Randall of Nazareth is cared for, but just barely. Randall of Nazareth, though, largely avoids the hit-or-miss indulgence typical of solo projects, from Skip Spence and Lou Barlow to Ryan Adams and Seth Olinsky. Pearls & Brass is a loud, brazen, twisting guitar-rock band, so the temptation for Huth to lose self-awareness or control surrounded by the quiet of his voice and guitar would seem high. But Randall of Nazareth is conscientiously modest. The eight songs here hold their 30 minutes well, solos mostly shirked for songs that stay their course and generally strong melodies serving as reliable compasses. Seven of the eight songs center on Huth's steel-string resonator guitar, and their flourishes are consistently minimal but effective, serving to decorate without distracting. Chimes trickle over the snappy brandishes of ""Climbing Trees"", and mandolin sweeps down over the clutched blues of ""Living in Candles"". On ""The Way"", Huth sings over static dulcimer repetition. It's the record's most ethereal track, but he minds his melody, offering a shape to hold by stepping up and down a scale very quickly. Indeed, holding on is largely what Randall is about. Huth is sharing a personal malaise. As though building an album-length extrapolation of ""I Am the Cosmos"" from the most basic elements, Huth sings of hard times borne of loneliness: The opening track finds Huth burying his head in the sand, shaping an escapist ethos appropriate for a record like this. He's retreating dire circumstances like the winter wind that blows against the splinters in his shins on the second track, or his problem with ""staring at black walls"" and avoiding ""the sun for several months"" on the subsequent track. Drug references creep through, but they mostly indicate the needle-thin brink between survival and death. While exploring that line, Huth balances technical ability (this is some of the best picking indie rock's claimed in a while) with genuinely skewed flourishes. Like Pearls & Brass-- who shifts the sounds of Led Zeppelin and Blue Cheer-fueled rock into unlikely rhythmic patterns-- Huth of Nazareth takes the familiar form of solo bandleader and twists it slightly: His neuroses don't translate into lack of restraint, and the songs bend the lessons of Leadbelly, Robert Johnson, and John Fahey into melodies that are familiar and beckoning but, fittingly, always kind of distant. It's a perfect feeling for the brilliant ""Ballad of a Sorry, Lonely Breaking Man"". Huth sings, ""My closest friend/ But I can't bear to hear your name"" over a sweet bit of finger-picking that uses the same undulating motion as Devendra Banhart's early albums. His echoing, doubled vocals come smeared slightly, inviting a hum-along instead of outright singing. After all, it's his problem, his song, his album. Luckily, over a steady, springing bassline at record's end, he realizes he's ""never let you down."" That is, he's healthier than the lot of this careful mess.","Randall Huth, on holiday from his power trio Pearls & Brass, largely avoids the hit-or-miss indulgence typical of solo projects as he crafts modest songs featuring his voice and steel-string resonator guitar.

The World Is Yours,Ian Brown,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b31eea9e61561daa6a34/1:1/w_160/d51dd021.jpg,2007-11-08 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10814-the-world-is-yours/,InterscopePolydor,"Ian Brown is now nearly 10 years into his post-Stone Roses solo career, and he still sounds like he hasn't left the late-90s. Despite a few good tracks scattered here and there, the music he's made on his own has frequently felt more obligatory than inspired, borrowing emotional audio signifiers from his proto-Britpop and placing them alongside lyrics that balance arrogance, cheap sentiment and politics too vague to count as protest. On this, his fifth solo outing (apart from a remix disc and a ""best of""), he's stuck in one gear the whole time on a set of lumbering songs oversoaked in strings, whose job seems to be to say, ""Listen to how majestic and meaningful these songs are."" He's titled the album The World Is Yours, by which he really means ""the world is mine,"" as related on the opening title track. The song begins with some noodling strings and Brown enters with the lines, ""As a young boy / Daddy used to tell me stories,"" the payoff being that his father always told him, ""the world is yours,"" and that he came to believe it. One would think that Brown would relate a few of his father's stories in the rest of the song, but he instead just strings together about a dozen dog-tired clichés while the music does the same. ""Sweet Children"" centers on Brown's wish that he had a house with 10million rooms that he could open to the ""street children"" before going all Vivaldi with fluttering strings in the middle. It's great that Brown wants to save the children, but the sophomoric lyrics read like the diary entry of an 8th grade girl the night after her social studies class discussed Darfur. With the strings and choir, it also comes across as self-important in much the same way as Michael Jackson's quasi-messianic 1996 BRIT Awards performance that was famously broken up by Jarvis Cocker. Because the melodies he's come up with aren't much to write home about, most of these songs rely too heavily on hackneyed lyrics to work their way into your head. On ""Illegal Attacks,"" Brown actually addresses Iraq and Afghanistan in an unusually specific protest, but he diminishes the impact of what he's saying by using Moveon.org oversimplifications like, ""These are commercial crusades/ They used a terror charade to get paid,"" and pleading for ""soldiers [to] come home."" The song does have the msot interesting string part on the album, though, using the cellos to good rhythmic effect. All of this comes over an incredibly uniform backing. Apart from the strings, the general formula is for the live drums to be augmented with a little programming, and for little bits of keyboard to jab into the mid-tempo arrangements now and then. That's pretty much it. It sounds good-- Brown's detached, wispy/gritty voice is pleasing as ever, and I like a pop string arrangement as much as the next guy-- but it doesn't add up to much in the end. To put it another way, this is an album I wouldn't feel compelled to turn off if it was playing, but it's also not one I'd feel compelled to put on again after it finished.

Through the Panama,Sightings,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b357ea9e61561daa6a9b/1:1/w_160/a1f1933a.jpg,2007-11-08 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10878-through-the-panama/,Load,"In the dictionary of noise music, accessibility means betrayal. Though fans in many subcultures guard their outsider status, in noise this goes beyond garden-variety elitism. The musicians seem to have a bona-fide philosophy: They don't want you to access their songs, so much as they want their songs to access, through blasts of sublimely violating force, you. And for a certain demographic-- walled spiritually inside mall-laden suburbia or blocks of cubicles-- brutality can mean liberty. The Brooklyn trio Sightings made their name with brutal records and performances that had the ineffable aura of performance art. Loud didn't quite capture it. Four albums in, on 2004's Arrived in Gold, the band's boredom with the noise dogma of volume for volume's sake-- or for the scene's intellectuals, volume as existential statement-- was beginning to show. So they imbued their art with No Wave's seizures and sharp angles, with dance rhythms, clearer mixing, and subtly shaded dynamics. Through the Panama, their sixth album, follows suit. A mischievous bit of wordplay opens the show, as ""a rest"" blurs into ""arrest."" Attention to these distinctions, to little gaps and instabilities, is what separates the old Sightings from the new. A wall of sound left intriguingly half-built, the paranoid ""A Rest"" falls neatly into the next track, ""Debt Depths"", the sound of that wall, a nightmarish mosaic of feedback, crumbling into dust. Start to finish, the album's sequencing plays with these tensions. Awash in tribal drums and guitar squeal, suggesting human sacrifice taking place in a junkyard, ""Certificate of No Effect"" embodies the old Sightings sound. Then the bleakly pretty ""Degraded Hours"" comes from the opposite angle. Mark Morgan's multitracked whisper blows over distant pianos and cavernous throbs, and in its soothing simplicity, it feels strangely hopeful. Between these poles lies the title track, a slow-motion explosion of screech and shriek. The song might invoke old Sightings, but it lacks the nervous swagger of ""Perforated"", which fits themes of transformation into a quintessentially No Wave groove. Quieter, but revealing a debt to the same era, ""The Electrician"" recasts the Walker Brothers' lush, post-punk 1970s psychodrama as an apocalyptic tale in three acts: hush, blast, hush. The mix lends gravity to each element, from guest-starring Matt Sweeney's chords to Morgan's speak-sing. On par with Samara Lubelski's craftsmanship on Arrived in Gold, the production handiwork of Andrew W.K., the noise stalwart turned avatar of abandon, allows every sound to shine while preserving the grimy, low-gloss vibe. Without the Dadaist shards of language, without any human voice, the instrumental ""Black Peter"" evokes a world of machines. We are left mesmerized by the ballet mécanique: the robotic stomp, the shimmying bass line, the slight crests and troughs and hints of melody. The band's been crafting these deceptively chaotic scenes all along, we slowly discover. Sightings may action-paint their canvases with viscous, theatrical brushstrokes, but it's the countless, cunningly placed scrapes and flecks that make Through the Panama vibrate with meaning and real menace.","This Brooklyn trio made their name with brutal records and performances that had the ineffable aura of performance art, but here they imbue their noise with No Wave's seizures and sharp angles, dance rhythms, clearer mixing, and subtly shaded dynamics.

Smith EP,Tokyo Police Club,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b348b1335d7bf169a57f/1:1/w_160/bb236817.jpg,2007-11-08 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10856-smith-ep/,Paper Bag,"Oh, what a coy temptress is this Tokyo Police Club. With only about 20 minutes of released material under their belt, the band's snappy post-punk's generated a tidal wave of well-deserved hype, not to mention a juicy record deal with Saddle Creek. And as the indie world collectively holds its breath for the TPC full-length, they first punch us in the gut with the Smith EP, a three-song, eight-minute release that could pass for a free iTunes preview. That's not to dismiss these Paper Bag-era odds'n'sods as mere detritus-- they're too finely tuned for that-- but what a disappointing time for these guys to clean out their attic. After debut EP A Lesson in Crime sweetened the twitchy keyboard/guitar melee of bands like Les Savy Fav and Enon into a more accessible sound, those two bands have seemingly returned the favor on recent releases Let's Stay Friends and Grass Geysers...Carbon Clouds, each ranking as the most straightforward albums in their respective band's career. Now, some fans fear TPC might continue their move to middle-- the Saddle Creek signing was followed by a recent tour with the painfully cardboard Cold War Kids. Remember, though, this is the band that scored a Letterman gig with an oeuvre unable to outlast most people's morning commutes. The Smith EP won't outlast your walk to the bus stop. On EP opener and ""Nature of the Experiment"" B-side ""Box"", TPC once again hits pay dirt with a spring-loaded two-chord assault, an airtight technique most bands would've exhausted by now. Complementing the instrumental tension, bassist/singer Dave Monks' smooth croon cuts through the prickly guitars and squawking keyboard lines, albeit the loud-soft contrast isn't as compelling here as on the track's spectacular A-side. ""Cut Cut Paste"", a bonus track from the vinyl release of Crime, basically trims 45 seconds off the same formula, though features a backwards-sounding keyboard that attests to the band's ability to throw a curveball even on their most watered down numbers. Ultimately Smith doesn't clear up any speculation regarding TPC's forthcoming LP (impressive recent single ""Your English Is Good"" might help there), especially since any fan champing at the bit has already heard this material. Closing the album on a somber note, Monks spills his guts on a piano version of ""A Lesson in Crime"", and with no splashes of guitar or keyboards to obscure his voice, the results are mixed. Whether or not these guys decide to cash in on their potential MTV appeal or strive to refine these frenetic ditties into more nuanced compositions, Smith reveals additional depth in the band's songwriting, even if it is only eight minutes' worth.","Before moving on to Saddle Creek and their long-awaited debut full-length, Tokyo Police Club issue this finely tuned Paper Bag EP.

American Gangster,JAY-Z,by: Tom Breihan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3599d034d5c69bf4cd0/1:1/w_160/2d930fab.jpg,2007-11-08 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10879-american-gangster/,Def JamRoc-A-Fella,"The story goes like this: After seeing an advance print of the Ridley Scott heroin-trade epic American Gangster, Jay-Z found himself inspired. The movie details the story of the Vietnam-era Harlem kingpin Frank Lucas, and Jay saw so many parallels between Lucas's life and his own. Over the course of a few weeks, Jay recorded his own widescreen epic, a concept-album about the rise and fall of a gangster like Lucas, an imagined what-if trajectory for what might have happened to Jay if he'd never left the drug trade. It makes for a good story and a great marketing coup. By attaching himself to a big-budget crime epic, Jay guaranteed himself cross-media presence and positioned himself to regain some of the grimy credibility he'd lost with 2006's Kingdom Come, the would-be comeback that found Jay rapping about brands so expensive most of his audience had no idea what he was talking about. In working to create the impression that he'd sacrificed commerce for art, Jay recast himself as an artist rather than a CEO, a canny commercial move at a time when rappers like Kanye West are outselling CEOs like 50 Cent. As a piece of media-manipulation, American Gangster is dazzling. But as music? Well, as a concept-album, American Gangster is kind of a wash. Over the course of its first 13 tracks, the album loosely outlines the criminal rise and fall we've seen in so many movies: the desperation of youth, the excited early schemes, the slow hard-fought rise, the lavish celebration of that rise, the eventual joyless inertia involved in maintaining that success, the sudden and inevitable descent into a prison-cell anonymity worse than death. That story animates the album, but it doesn't dictate its movements. Throughout, Jay-Z breaks that narrative whenever he feels like it, taking care to force in all his standbys: The sneering aristocratic death-threats, the breezy uptempo party-songs, the (especially forced) for-the-ladies seduction-song. Jay actually corrupts the impact of his own moralistic rise-and-fall story by ending the album with a pair of bonus tracks, ""Blue Magic"" and ""American Gangster"", that trumpet Jay's own triumph over the vast impersonal forces that landed his protagonist in prison. On ""Blue Magic"", he even growls, ""Can't you tell that I came from the dope game?"" like it's a point of personal pride, immediately after he depicted an inevitable criminal downfall. On his wide-scope art-piece, Jay still can't put aside commercial success and relentless self-aggrandizement, even if those twin impulses fuck up his concept. So American Gangster doesn't quite work as a concept album, but it's difficult to imagine the record would be better if that concept had been fully realized and fleshed-out. Jay's evident obsession with the post-Don Imus furor over nihilistic rap lyrics has fuck-all to do with his gangster narrative, for instance, but Jay's willingness to break narrative and address that obsession leads to lines like this one, where he calls out recent rap foe Al Sharpton on ""Say Hello"": ""Tell him I'll remove the curses/ If you tell me our schools gon' be perfect/ When Jena 6 don't exist / Tell him that's when I'll stop saying 'bitch,' bitch!"" The album's story gives it enough structure to feel huge and all-encompassing, but Jay floats in and out of it as fluidly as he switches between the first and second person. And so the drug-dealer story serves an important purpose: It rips Jay out of the royal materialistic old-man haze that ruined Kingdom Come and recalls the titanic, invincible snarl that made him great in the first place. On American Gangster, he's fallen back in love with language, making slick puns and jamming his lines with internal rhymes and vivid, detailed images without letting those devices detract from the emotional punch of his mini-narratives. ""No Hook"" has some of the most complicated rhyme-patterns he's tried in years, but it's all in service of a sad picture of the conflicts of anyone who makes a living doing dangerous, immoral things: ""'Stay out of trouble,' mama said as mama sighs/ Her fear her youngest son being victim of homicide/ But I gotta get you out of here, mama, or I'm [long pause] die [long pause] inside."" (Nobody uses long breathless pauses like Jay-Z; when he's at his best, as he is here, those silences can say as much as his words.) On ""Roc Boys (And the Winner Is)"", the buoyant and celebratory ode to financial success, Jay thanks every device and corrupt institution that made his rise possible: ""The Nike shoebox for holding all this cash/ Boys in blue who put the greed before the badge."" On ""Blue Magic"", his wordplay is so dense that it can take multiple listens to parse: ""Blame Reagan for making me to a monster/ Blame Oliver North and Iran Contra/ I ran contraband that they sponsored."" (Maybe I'm dumb, but it took me a while to realize that the second of those lines ends with the exact same four syllables as the next line's beginning.) On ""Fallin'"", the song about the dealer's comeuppance, Jay sounds like he's spent a lot of time thinking about the fate he avoided: ""Come January, it gets cold/ When your letters come in slow and your commissary's low."" And on ""Ignorant Shit"", a Black Album outtake revisited and revamped here, Jay positively relishes the contradictions of rap, a genre where every artist theatrically proclaims himself to be more real than everyone else: ""Actually believe half of what you see/ None of what you hear, even if it's spit by me/ And with that being said, I will kill niggas dead."" Musically, American Gangster is lush and spacious. The sampled voices of Al Green and Marvin Gaye float through the record like ghosts of Jay's past, sweetly offering encouragement like benevolent angels. Jay's handpicked lineup of producers keep his voice grounded in thick, organic globs of 1970s soul. Diddy and the Hitmen, the reunited production who gave old Bad Boy albums their flamboyant elegance, turn in five tracks on the album, and their work drips with ambition. On album-opener ""Pray"" they outfit Jay with churning strings, screaming guitars, cinematic sound-effects, and a histrionic gospel choir; the horns, windchimes, and rolling drums of ""Sweet"" are almost exhausting in their richness. But not all the production is that warm and languid. On ""Success"", Jay and guest Nas rant paranoically over No ID's disorienting storm of organ-wails and murky, off-kilter drums. On ""Ignorant Shit"", Just Blaze layers up a furious storm of tinny synths and guitars, giving Jay's shit-talk a trashy ""Miami Vice"" veneer. And ""Hello Brooklyn 2.0"", built from an old Beastie Boys track, is a stark corrective to all those florid harps and violins: all booming bass and skeletal handclaps, Jay sounding more at home than guest Lil Wayne. When Jay taped his episode of ""VH1 Storytellers"" in Brooklyn last month, he kept comparing tracks from the album to moments from The Godfather and Scarface. American Gangster isn't really about Jay's own memories, and it's certainly not about Frank Lucas. Instead, it's an album about Jay's mythic legacy, his place in a pantheon of larger-than-life outlaws. Problematically enough, it works because it reconnects Jay with the verbal and musical eloquence that allowed him to escape from an outlaw's life. If it took a big Hollywood movie and a half-baked concept to get him back to that, then thank God for big Hollywood movies and half-baked concepts.","Inspired by the Ridley Scott crime epic, Jay-Z's quickly-made drug kingpin record isn't as conceptually tight as he'd have liked, but it rips Jay out of the royal materialistic old-man haze that ruined Kingdom Come and recalls the titanic, invincible snarl that made him great in the first place.

Hera Ma Nono,Extra Golden,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3179d034d5c69bf4c7c/1:1/w_160/10a1e7ec.jpg,2007-11-07 06:00:05,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10808-hera-ma-nono/,Thrill Jockey,"Trekking to Africa for a bit of extra musical flavor has long been one of the more dubious traditions in Western pop, with the results too often no better than hauling back some exotic souvenir or ornament. Extra Golden, however, is no opportunistic in-and-out cultural exchange. The group is in a lot of ways an extension of Golden member Ian Eagleson's Ph.D. research in Kenya, where he studied that country's benga music. There he hooked up with Kenyans Otieno Jagwasi and Onyango Wuod Omari and invited fellow D.C. Golden member Alex Minoff along for the ride. The results, captured on Extra Golden's debut Ok-Oyot System, sounded like a bona fide collaboration. Alas, Otieno Jagwasi passed away before the album's release, but that only redoubled Extra Golden's efforts to keep the music alive. And it did take some effort, too. U.S. tour plans were almost scuttled before Barack Obama's office intervened and helped get the group members visas (Obama and his people have since helped other African acts get to the States as well.) That hurdle crossed, Eagleson, Minoff, Omari, and Jagwasi's replacement Opiyo Bilongo (plus a few more friends) convened in Pennsylvania to make a new album. Ok-Oyot System, released in 2005, was recorded quickly in a rundown Nairobi nightclub. For Extra Golden's second album Hera Ma Nono (the name translates to ""Love in Vain""), the group had the same porta-studio but just short of a full week, plus all the usual studio tools. Predictably, things are a touch slicker, but only a touch. Thankfully, the disc retains the down-to-earth vibe of its predecessor despite the dual luxuries of time and better equipment. Even better, the communal environment clearly heightened the collaboration. Unlike Ok-Oyot System, Hera Ma Nono credits all songs to the band, as opposed to individual band members, and no doubt the results sound more cohesive as well. The album starts with ""Jakolando"", sung by Onyango Jagwasi in tribute to his late brother, the gently funky pulse switching gears around the four-minute mark to something a little more elegiac. But Jagwasi's ""Jakolando"" vocals, recorded back in Kenya, are pretty much just a cameo. The band handles the rest of the singing, taking turns on lead but all chipping in at one point or another. ""Obama"" is a jovial dance number (thanking the U.S. senator for his help) that gives way to a dramatic fuzz-guitar solo denouement. ""I Miss You"" is like a Nairobi country ballad, while ""Night Runners"" (sung partly in English) initially recalls the polyrhythmic swing of the Meters before shifting to a more buoyant groove driven by interlocking guitars. ""Street Parade"" is the first track on the album to feature lead vocals from Eagleson, and, along with ""Brothers Gone Away"" (and as with his most direct contributions on Ok-Oyot System, like ""It's Not Easy""), it recalls 1970s singer-songwriter rock in the mold of rootsy globetrotter Ry Cooder. That's hardly a bad thing but perhaps not the best reference in this context. Fortunately the 11-minute ""Love Hijackers"", sung by Bilongo, and the title track, sung by Omari, end the album on a more African note. Not that the album, and Extra Golden as a whole, don't go a long way toward making distinctions between ""African"" and ""American"" irrelevant, but it's Nairobi that courses through Hera Ma Nono far more prominently than, say, Washington, D.C. In fact, the closer the disc threatens to come to home, the more you hope it gravitates back to Kenya, clearly its spiritual and musical home. In an ideal world, other similarly inclined acts with their eyes and ears toward Africa will follow Eagleson's and Extra Golden's lead back to the source.","The second album from the U.S./Kenya Afropop hybrid thankfully keeps the emphasis on Africa, with ideal results.

Well Deep: Ten Years of Big Dada Recordings,Various Artists,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b31dc0084474cd0c208a/1:1/w_160/e4617ed0.jpg,2007-11-07 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10813-well-deep-ten-years-of-big-dada-recordings/,Big Dada,"It might be going a bit too far to claim that Big Dada has an identity crisis, but as independent labels go, you can't entirely pin a single style to them. ""Underground rap"" is about as close as you can get, and even then, that's a nebulous term; it could cover anyone from avant-garde abstractionists to club-friendly grime offshoots. But there doesn't entirely seem to be such a thing as a readily identifiable Big Dada sound, and given how split the roster tends to be in another, equally important sense-- the geographic one, between the U.S. and the UK-- it almost makes the whole idea of a label compendium seem kind of disorienting. Well Deep: Ten Years of Big Dada Recordings attempts to reconcile those contradictions in the guise of an anniversary collection, which, at the very least, means you're almost guaranteed to love and detest some of the selections here equally. Being a London-based label does dictate a certain side of Big Dada's identity a bit, and it's no coincidence that the more accessible artists on the label tend to be British. There's Roots Manuva, whose well-aging dancehall-inflected 2001 hit ""Witness (1 Hope)"" still sounds like the label's (and pre-grime UK rap's) standard-bearer, benefiting from his sharply-spit patois and featuring one of the sickest assaults of subwoofer-abusing low-end in the last ten years embedded in that wobbly bassline. (Unfortunately, 1999's moody, trip-hop-styled ""Movements"" and 2005's balloon-squeak annoyance ""Colossal Insight"" don't represent him quite as well.) Ty gets four cuts here, and between his forceful smoothness and the digitally sleek future-neo-soul bent to the productions on his tracks, he sounds a bit like a technologically-advanced UK Okayplayer envoy. And even though Well Deep exhibits Big Dada's tendency to pass over straight-up grime in favor of borderline, classification-ducking groups like New Flesh and Lotek HiFi, their release of Wiley's Playtime is Over earlier this year gives them a chance to showcase one of the genre's pivotal artists; as familiar as ""50/50"" might be to fans already, the inclusion of Xxxchange's twitchy synth-symphonic remix of ""My Mistakes"" is a good move. But while Big Dada tends to play towards approachable futurist boom bap on the British side (and the French side; TTC are slick and hooky on the 8-bit throb of ""Dans Le Club""), the American groups represented here are both further out there and more sonically diverse. Many tracks lean towards the backpacker side of things: there's the brilliant smart-assery of poet Mike Ladd, who delivers a couple acts of cultural sabotage for his defenders-of-rap concept group the Infesticons (the Company Flow-assisted ""Night Night Theme"" and Saul Williams' anxious turn on ""Monkey Theme""), anticon pseudosupergroup cLOUDDEAD bring their nasal, unnerving brand of slow-motion decay rap (""Physics of a Bicycle"" and the Boards of Canada remix of ""Dead Dogs Two""), and Busdriver waxes logorrheic on the thrash-paced bop-jazz breakup rant ""Beauty Supply & Demand"" and the manic half-sequitirs of the folk-hop ""Unemployed Black Astronaut"". On the other end of the spectrum is the hipster-by-proxy club-rap contingent, represented by Spank Rock (""Sweet Talk"") and Diplo (""Diplo Rhythm""'s Metroid dancehall and the unremarkable, previously-unreleased circa-04 drumbeat-chopfest ""Now's the Time""). Hearing these two divergent musical movements in such close proximity is strange enough; it's even weirder when you pit the winking throw-ya-hands-up come-ons of ""Sweet Talk"" against ""Fader Party"", a Ladd-produced fast-rap mockery credited to the Infesticon-opposing pop-rap caricature Majesticons. Amidst all that, MF DOOM side-project King Geedorah's trad-underground ""Anti-Matter"" sounds like it stumbled into the wrong party. For all its stylistic multiple personality disorder, Well Deep does cover its uneven ground pretty well, and you have to give the comp a bit of credit for open-mindedness (and a demerit for coherence) when it opts against splitting the two CDs up by style, region or chronology. If Well Deep proves anything, it's that Big Dada does have a singleminded purpose: to prevent underground hip hop from moving anywhere but forward, a restless undertaking that, while not necessarily ignorant of rap's past, just doesn't seem to have a lot of inclination to reference it. If that makes the future look more splintered and baffling than it could be otherwise, that just means they're one step ahead of the rest of us.","London-based Big Dada celebrates 10 years of underground rap and avant-garde abstractionists with a label collection.

Guns Babes Lemonade,Muscles,by: Nitsuh Abebe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3159d034d5c69bf4c77/1:1/w_160/bf2b0a34.jpg,2007-11-07 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10806-guns-babes-lemonade/,Modular,"""Hey Muscles/ I love you/ I want to have your baby."" That's how the last track on this record goes, and there's some chance that by the time you get there, you'll be starting to feel the same way. Figuratively speaking, obviously. One of my favorite old stories about rave-era England is the one where the local toughs-- skinheads, soccer hooligans-- would suddenly appear at parties, loved up on ecstasy and wanting to give everyone a hug. Few of us were there for that, of course, but it's something you can actually hear in the music of that time, which developed pockets of dude-friendliness: more bone-headed energy, more stadium chanting, more everyday-guy stuff. This happens whenever more people start going to parties and dancing, and there's no reason it should always be a bad thing-- some guys somewhere will skirt away from the usual glamour and sexuality of dance music, using their synths to get across rock-bred stuff like pop hooks, party shouting, and songs about girls. Muscles doesn't sound like a bonehead or a tough guy-- not in the least-- and he's definitely not trying to do anything to dance music. But he's part of a long line of that sort of thing, the same one that includes New Order, the Streets, ""Born Slippy"", the ""hooligan house"" of Audio Bullys, or his more-stylish fellow Australians in Cut Copy. That lack of cool, in fact, is important here. Muscles' tracks start off as rough-and-ready bedroom-laptop electro-pop, the sort of thing you might hear at any loft party full of dudes in neon sweatshirts-- but then these tracks drop into huge emotional gestures, from the wet, sentimental synths of trance to the classic buoyancy of house piano rhythms. (It's the opposite of electroclash-- earnest and warm instead of arch and icy.) Neither does he sound like a guy who's trying to be clever, cool, serious, or arty, though he pulls off all four. Mostly, he just sounds like a guy who is PSYCHED, like some kind of dancefloor Andrew W.K. The refrain from the single, ""Sweaty"": ""My hand slipped into your hand! And it was awesome! And you were special!"" Elsewhere, he gets all boyishly emo: A bad run-in with an indie girl leaves him shouting, ""Drive a one-inch badge pin through my heart!"" repeatedly. Very repeatedly. In other words, Muscles has grabbed the rudiments of party music and used them to make a very good shouty-emotional-guy-in-a-bedroom record, of the sort that would otherwise get called totally indie. Those shouts, in fact, are the core of this record, and they give it an emotional range that's not really aimed at floor-filling. The grainy, rave-loving synth programming is pushed into the background by layers and layers of always-harmonized singing, different chants bouncing off of one another in countless directions. And while, over the first few listens, those constant gang-chant harmonies can seem maddeningly samey, they quickly differentiate themselves exactly enough for a 43-minute record-- sometimes they're ecstatic, sometimes nostalgic, sometimes dark; a few actually bear a strange kinship with TV on the Radio. (See: ""Lauren from Glebe"" and ""Marshmallow"".) And when you imagine Muscles singing them in the home studio, you don't just imagine his fist in the air: You imagine him dripping with sweat and punching holes in the ceiling, with all the ridiculous energy of that kid in the light-saber video. You also get a pretty charming tour of Muscles's world. The bubbly ""My Friend Richard"" tackles party management, and lets on a guyish annoyance with VIP lines: ""These people don't care about your health! These people make you stand out in the cold! If Muscles has a party, everybody is invited! You tell me that you're coming, and you leave your house early!"" On ""Ice Cream"", he's coping with threats of violence, and making an anthemic, sentimental hook out of ""Ice Cream/ Is going to save the day."" The biggest bloody heart on his sleeve comes with ""One Inch Badge Pin"", sparked by the aforementioned girl from the Melbourne independent music community, which Muscles is awesome enough to refer to-- without too much irony-- as ""the Melbourne independent music community."" And he really is pretty awesome-- totally enthusiastic, full of good humor and good jokes, endearingly emotional, and generous with hooks. He's good company. A lot of the people who try to inject personal, pop-vocal vibes into this sort of music wind up feeling like they're trying too hard-- attempting to be cool or stylish, or just navigating the distance between dance music and boyish pop in a way that's too self-conscious, too calculated, too audible; you wind up wishing they'd just make proper electronic music and leave the rest alone. Muscles blows past that: He makes party tracks and pours his voice all over them in a way that's unembarrassed, almost puppyish, and not at all hard to like.","Modular's Muscles follows in a long line of everyday guys making party tracks for dancefloors and house parties alike-- think New Order, the Streets, ""Born Slippy"", the ""hooligan house"" of Audio Bullys, or his more-stylish fellow Australians in Cut Copy.

Businessmen & Ghosts,Working for a Nuclear Free City,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b306c0084474cd0c205d/1:1/w_160/c2184e4e.jpg,2007-11-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10793-businessmen-ghosts/,MelodicDeaf Dumb and Blind,"It's been a year since UK quartet Working for a Nuclear Free City issued their self-titled debut. It could've just as easily been a decade-- or a couple of days. That 2006 album's boozily psychedelic dance-rock showed an affinity for such previous Manchester groups as the Stone Roses and Happy Mondays, with block-rockin' beats that might've belonged to the Chemical Brothers, plus Teutonic grooves that aligned the band with the motorik-minded likes of Caribou, Fujiya & Miyagi, and 120 Days. And it wasn't ""nu rave."" Even as electronic acts keep appropriating rock tropes, and guitar bands go on revisiting the post-punk disco, WfaNFC's debut still sounds distinctive. There's an anthemic grandeur unknown to your average Justice- or !!!-wannabes. Also setting WfaNFC apart is their pastoral side, which on this year's Rocket EP brings to mind the woolly, interstellar indie-with-beats of the Beta Band. WfaNFC's debut and half of their EP come together with a mixed bag of previously unreleased tracks on double album Businessmen & Ghosts, their first American release. What made Working for a Nuclear Free City and the Rocket EP so enticing makes Businessmen & Ghosts a worthwhile acquisition, too. The band's best bass-driven dancefloor bangers and stately, textured landscapes are all here, and there are a couple of fresh surprises, too. At nearly one hour and 45 minutes, WfaNFC's latest release is their closest to comprehensive. This isn't an ideal introduction-- it's a bit overwhelming all at once, and the track order has been unnecessarily, incoherently reshuffled-- but at least it's not import price. Though a few extra bucks wouldn't have been too much to pay to have checked out WfaNFC in time for your last New Year's party. When these dudes lean on their rhythm section, their feet don't stray far from their effects pedals. ""Troubled Son"" and ""Dead Fingers Talking"" are as focused on Gary McLure's rumbling guitar distortion and Phil Kay's sci-fi electronic pulses as they are on Ed Hulme's hip-locked bass and softly deadpanned vocals or Jon Kay's drumming (McLure and Kay co-founded the group). New tracks like ""Donkey"" and ""Eighty Eight"" follow suit, while ""All American Taste"" adds echoey strums to another groove-heavy burst of bleating shoegazer guitar noise. When they're not strobe-lighting the dancefloor, WfaNFC weave woozy atmospheres for an intoxicated ride home bathed in subway fluorescent or headlight halogen. ""Rocket"", from the eponymous EP, counts down (and builds up) to an unheard ignition with campfire strums, lilting lead-guitar plucks, refracting keyboards, chugging bass, and Air-y synths. From the debut full-length, ""Over"" templates this approach with bleary harmonicas and a cosmic groove. Tracks like ""The Tree"" or ""Quiet Place"" carve a nostalgic ache out of cracked indie-pop jangle, while ""The Tape"" sets handclaps and spoken-word vocals atop glistening guitar arpeggios. New song ""Asleep at the Wheel"" is WfaNFC at their most surging, with the Edge-like guitar repetitions holding up a sustained plateau. (If you downloaded the album, this track is probably mislabeled.) WfaNFC had displayed plenty of range prior to Businessmen & Ghosts, though they still haven't broken much new ground. Their most startling turn here is the previously unreleased ""Sarah Dreams of Summer"", which opts for maracas, handclaps, and peppy guitars in a song that's halfway between Britpop and Sarah Records, as melodic as it is deceptively melancholic. ""When I look at her/ it feels like I've never been born,"" comes a Revolver allusion wrapped in Beach Boys harmonies. Sure, a few of the latest tunes-- ""Apron Strings"", say, or fleet-fingered ""Nancy Adam Susan (Shatter)""-- tend to drift. As a whole, though, Businessmen & Ghosts is a long-overdue U.S. document of a band that might just be getting really interesting. And no, they don't much care either way about nukes.","The UK quartet's first American release-- which recalls Madchester, Primal Scream, and German-leaning contemporaries Caribou and Fujiya & Miyagi-- is an ambitious 2xCD record that somehow doesn't feel bloated.

Hvarf/Heim,Sigur Rós,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b35413d197565213a90d/1:1/w_160/3bf80f89.jpg,2007-11-07 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11630-hvarfheim/,XL,"A couple of weeks ago, the masochists at NPR posted a video clip of an attempted conversation with members of Sigur Rós, titled ""When Good Interviews Go Bad."" The pauses between question and answer are painfully long, the answers brief at best and completely disinterested at worst. You'd almost think the whole thing was a joke if it were the least bit funny. Surely the Icelandic band isn't a bunch of sour pusses. Neither do they seem particularly antagonistic. But at this point one imagines the only thing tougher than speaking to Sigur Rós about well-trod subjects-- invented languages, Iceland's music scene-- is actually being in Sigur Rós and constantly getting asked questions about music all but designed to speak for itself. The group's sound is so meticulously composed, recorded, and performed it's no wonder it often evinces the same sorts of reactions to its otherworldly beauty, grace, and quiet catharsis. Speaking of the music, it's been a while since anyone's gotten any from Sigur Rós. The group's Takk… was released in 2005, and following a tour things were relatively quiet, at least until a handful of surprise performances earlier this year. It turns out the group was indulging in the tried-and-true rock band placeholder tradition, filming itself for a concert film-cum-documentary, Heima that captures the group in its element at home. Sigur Rós have also bought itself some more time with Hvarf-Heim, a companion compilation of mostly unreleased songs and a brief acoustic set. Sigur Rós seem the least likely candidate to go unplugged, which is one of many reasons why Heim is so remarkable. It's Sigur Rós recast as chamber music, the gorgeously sculpted dissonance of the band's material recast for strings, harmonium and far more tactile instrumentation than the usual bowed electric guitar or thundering percussion. ""Samskeyti"" and ""Ageatis Byrjun"" now sound curiously suitable for Windham Hill, and Jonsi's vocals are warmer on ""Staralfur"" than they are on the fully fleshed album version. Even when he hits the high notes at the end of ""Vaka"" it comes across a restrained counterpart to the kind of volcanic dynamism the group is typically known for. The originally hushed ""Heysatan"" comes off somehow more intimate, emphasizing the power of melody over meaning from a band that already often seems to prefer the amorphous cloak of mystery. The familiar Sigur Rós we all know (and many love) is what's on display over the course of Hvarf, newly recorded versions of three never before released songs and two from the group's pre-breakthrough early days. ""Salka"" dates back to 2002 and supposedly almost made it onto the () album, its beguiling introductory melody hinting at ""O Come All Ye Faithful"" before leading to a typically grandiose string-laden coda. ""Hljomalind"", which the band at one point tagged the generic stand-in title ""The Rock Song"", is indeed more standard issue than what the band usually drums off, sounding a bit like a leftover from the Cure's Disintegration if Robert Smith sang in a falsetto and draped everything in reverb. The band essentially concedes the song's mediocrity on their site, which makes one wonder why they couldn't dust off something better. ""I Gaer"", on the other hand, marks an interesting change of pace for Sigur Rós, comprising a taste of what they jokingly call their ""brief prog-rock excursion."" It's the closest that Sigur Rós have come to the epic Pink Floyd aesthetic some have ascribed to the group, beginning with gently chiming bells before exploding into a full-on organ, guitar and plodding drum maelstrom. It's a bit silly in its pomposity, but no less fun for it, especially from a band usually about as far from fun as an ice storm. The last two songs on Hvarf stretch back to the group's Von era, including the title track, which has grown and changed over the course of the past 10 years. The new version is almost twice as long and far more fleshed out than the somewhat anemic album version, which the band in part attributes to the contributions of the sympathetic chamber outfit amiina and drummer Orri (who came on board after the recording of 1999's Agaetis Byrjun). The new arrangement really brings out a beauty that was only previously hinted at. The new version of ""Hafsol"", on the other hand, not only makes the album version seem like a sketch at best, it actually turns out to be one of Sigur Rós' few honest to goodness anthems, ending in a collision of droning noise and a sprightly string figure before placidly fading like a sinking sunset. It's ten minutes of bliss that should keep the faithful satisfied until the group reconvenes and produces something new, resuming the road to parts unknown instead of dusting off the path that leads back to where they came from.","The companion disc to the concert film/doc Heima, this 2xCD set features two sides to Sigur Rós: new recordings of mostly unreleased old songs and, even rarer and more unlikely, an acoustic set.

Fresh Rot,Mannequin Men,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b31b5e6ef959693223d4/1:1/w_160/3fcda48c.jpg,2007-11-06 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10811-fresh-rot/,Flameshovel,"Chicago's Mannequin Men swear by rock music's most basic essentials; take two guitars, a bass, and drums, mix with intractable sexual energy/angst, and let sit for 18-24 years. The four-piece's sophomore album, Fresh Rot, offers nothing more and nothing less than this rock fundamentalist recipe. With their unpolished assault on hard-to-get girls, crusty establishments, and the 9-to-5 lifestyle, many have slapped the ""proto-punk"" tag on the band, a label accurate only in the sense that these guys don't care to advance the rock genre, they just want to harness the carnal passion that made cavemen start banging things together in the first place. While the widespread Stones and Stooges comparisons fit the bill here, MM's earnest embrace of guitar solos, simplistic riffs and barroom backbeats reflect other less chic, although equally rocking, influences as well. The subtle guitar lick on ""The Pigpen"" smacks of early Tom Petty, right down to the whiney chorus of ""The girls, the girls, the girls/ They wanna do the pigpen."" With their massive drum builds and simple chord progressions, ""Private School"" and ""Pattern Factory"" wouldn't sound out of place in an arena setting, though Fresh Rot's modest production quality's not fooling anyone for the Budokan. Galvanizing frontman Kevin Richard sets the group a few paces ahead of your average garage rock revivalist, his gravelly yelps reminiscent of Frank Black on his more recent, classic rock-steeped material. ""Dead Kids"", a dark, murky rocker, even ventures into Pixies territory, its high-pitched droning riffs and Richard's caterwauling bridge morphing Frank Black's cool croon back into the banshee antics of Black Francis. Despite the vocal resemblance though, MM avoid building up a debt to indie's touchstones-- just a debt to old school rock that most indie bands have already amassed. Proving the band's music not merely a fight/flight reflex, the ethereal ""22nd Century"" cops the Velvets' deadpan two-chord pop, and ""Grapefruit"" sucks the art-school sophistication out of Talking Heads, leaving only Richard's twitchy Byrne-isms and jangly, exotic-sounding guitar. Like occasional tourmates the Black Lips, the Mannequin Men lack innovation, but serve as a nifty quick fix for genuine rock bacchanalia. Sure, they shun the use of any non-traditional instruments or textures, but Fresh Rot's fun in part because it's a garage band attempting to sound way bigger than its clumsy power chords and big, dumb tom-tom fills. Other groups aiming to update raw rock to 21st century standards have ranged from laudable-but-annoying (Cheeseburger) to downright despicable (Louis XIV). Mannequin Men, on the other hand, stick to their bread and butter without sounding self-indulgent or fawning, and if more bands followed suit, this ""retro-revival"" business wouldn't seem like such a pipe dream.","This Chicago band's unpolished assault on hard-to-get girls, crusty establishments, and the 9-to-5 lifestyle rightfully earns comparison to the Stones and Stooges.

It so often happens that these trips down memory lane somehow wind up being remarkably in tune with whatever retro-pop movements might be happening at the time, so it might not be too obvious that this kind of motivation is what drives 15 Again, the first album in four years from dance music vets Cassius (five if you account for the one-year gap it took to cross the Atlantic). After all, it's a French house-pop album that draws significantly from the funk, electro, post-punk, synthpop and techno movements that stretched across the span of the 80s-- that's only something you don't hear every day if you avoid anything remotely resembling current dance music. But here's where 15 Again gets tricky: I couldn't find any specific details as to how old Philippe ""Zdar"" Cerboneschi or Hubert ""Boom Bass"" Blanc-Francard actually are. This means that figuring out the exact period of the album's impressionable mid-teen years is a bit elusive, and that's where we get back to that whole span-of-the-80s thing; any record that starts with a goodbye-seventies Italo-disco/new wave jam (""Toop Toop"") and crests at the end with a four-song block of Phuture/Derrick May/Orbital-style rave fodder is, if maybe unintentionally, just as effective as a roadmap of dance music's decade-long mutation as it is a ""man music was amazing when we were young"" look in the rearview. Maybe more so, since a purer form of nostalgia would do a lot less to disguise or modernize the catalysts that pushed the members of Cassius towards becoming pop musicians. It's easy enough to half-hear the first couple bars of a track on this album and notice the echoes of Paisley Park and the Hacienda, but it's just as easy to streamline this into the present. The acid-house-tinged title track isn't too far off from the kind of rave'n'B that's growing to define the late zero years, only with the breathy, subdued intensity of Gladys Gambie in place of Rihanna. Gambie also sings lead on ""Rock Number One"", where its Princely electro-soul lushness helps push her voice into an understated version of Chaka Khan, but the production is so spotlessly modern-digital that it sounds as much like 3121 as 1999. And while ""This Song"" might split a snarling, bass-heavy, handclap-riddled difference between Blondie's ""Call Me"" and Depeche Mode's ""Personal Jesus"", it also elicits pangs of a somewhat more baffled and recent nostalgia-- hey, remember schaffel? Interestingly, the further it gets towards the end of the 80s and the core of techno, the less it tries to connect with contemporary pop; ""15 Again"" aside, the acid house and Detroit techno homages (""Jack Rock""; ""Cactus""; ""Shame Shame Cherie"") are pretty straightforward-- enough to sound like they came from an album without Pharrell Williams on it. (In this case, that'd be a better album-- Pharrell's awkward environmental-apocalypse crooning on ""Eye Water"" is a low point, and as a remake of 2002's Au Rêve opening cut ""Hi Water"", a redundant one at that.) But some peoples’ mid-teens are more confusing and more burdened with identity crises than others, and that could be enough to forgive this album’s thematic inconsistency: Cassius aren’t just capturing their own youth, they’re reveling in the youthful days of an entire sound-- on a record that a 15-year-old could enjoy.","The first album in four years (five if you account for the one-year gap it took to cross the Atlantic) from the French dance band draws significantly from the funk, electro, post-punk, synth-pop, and techno movements that stretched across the span of the 1980s.

Hungry Beat,Fire Engines,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b318c0084474cd0c2081/1:1/w_160/b86f24ef.jpg,2007-11-06 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10809-hungry-beat/,Acute,"The Fire Engines were barely a blip on the music radar, but for those in the right place at the right time, that small speck was like a bull's-eye. By 1980, Scotland's post-punk explosion was already in full bloom, having birthed Orange Juice and Josef K. Right in there with them were the Fire Engines, but unlike their erstwhile peers, the short-lived group existed to burn bright and fast and, inevitably, to burn out. It's music of the primitive ""we-can-do-it-too"" school, and as such some 25 years or so later it's easy to understand the impact it had on other aspiring bands. Indeed, Hungry Beat, a collection of the groups formative releases, arrives with testimonials from Primal Scream's Bobby Gillespie and Franz Ferdinand frontman Alex Kapranos, whose band recently coaxed the Fire Engines into the studio and back onto the stage. While Primal Scream and Franz Ferdinand are quite different from one another, one can see the respective appeal of the Fire Engines' sound. In the case of the former and fellow fans the Jesus and Mary Chain, its ragged chaos certainly resonated. In the case of the latter, it was the high-strung naff funk undercurrent that probably connected first. But even taken on its own terms, Hungry Beat is a shambling blast, as exciting as its members were clearly excitable. The disc collects the group's entire first and sole album (the perfectly named Lubricate Your Living Room), the A's and B's from the Fire Engines' three singles, and a handful of alternate takes. The last are perhaps a funny inclusion, considering how little the Fire Engines sound like the kind of band that bothered with such niceties as ""takes."" At any given second, each song sounds like it's either about to fall apart or explode, and you can practically hear the band smiling at the prospect. ""Candyskin"" and ""New Thing in Cartons"" sound like the Fall having a happy day, the massed vocals and strings of the former a novel method of overcoming the song's lo-fi environment. ""Meat Whiplash"" goes absolutely nowhere and does a great job doing it. ""Get Up and Use Me"" (covered by Franz Ferdinand on the split they later shared with the Fire Engines) is all adenoidal no wave cowbell skronk, replete with unembarrassed false start (mysteriously, the song's alternate take runs longer, faster, and doesn't include the fuck-up). It's ""Big Gold Dream"" that plays up the jittery dance elements that you can hear in half of indiedom (even if most of indiedom has never heard these guys before), but the apex of Hungry Beat is a seven-minute ditty called ""Discord"" that offers a relentless one-chord funk fix. The song fades out with a few drums fills and screams, but you can just as easily imagine another 10, 20, 30 minutes of music not captured on tape. At seven minutes it's long enough to lock into a groove, but one can only imagine the dance floor possibilities had the thing got longer. James Murphy, for one, certainly did. Recall that the Fire Engines got a shout out in his hilarious 2002 breakthrough hip parade ""Losing My Edge"". Now that this music's back in print, fans can finally hear where at least some of that edge came from in the first place. And as we all know now from that song, Murphy's never been wrong.","One of Scotland's forgotten post-punk pioneers, the Fire Engines are compiled to make a case for the hip company they keep alongside Orange Juice and Josef K.

Little Kingdom,Citay,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b341c0084474cd0c20c6/1:1/w_160/1a384064.jpg,2007-11-06 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10850-little-kingdom/,Dead Oceans,"The largely instrumental psychedelic pop-rock group Citay-- led by San Francisco guitarist Ezra Feinberg-- started their career on the cred-propping Important imprint with a self-titled debut half-full of somber sounds. Two albums later, Little Kingdom foregoes the melancholy, its eight tracks built with hearty strumming, wordless choruses, and ascendant synthesizers. Made by Feinberg with eight friends including Fucking Champ and fucking great producer Tim Green and Tussle drummer Warren Huegel, Little Kingdom is all grins and winks and exaltations, gloriously embossed with shimmering solos and high-times harmonies. Only ""Former Child"" starts somberly here, foreboding tones appearing through steady acoustic patterns. But six minutes later, it's Chariots of Fire-triumphant, cymbals snapping over the back of a three-guitar climb. Like the rest of Little Kingdom, it feels great, a quality that's sure to get Feinberg and his gone-to-California ease dismissed as a hippy making spacey background music. That's sort of the point. Little Kingdom is about letting go, about finding meaning in the small yet resourceful. The four tracks with lyrics all end with resplendent ""Ahh"" choruses, signs of resignation to difficult questions: On the title track, Feinberg sings about waking and writing a to-do list. He needs to listen to ""Crazy on You"" and find love, but he only asks the day to make a little crown for his Little Kingdom. Opener ""First Fantasy"" finds contentment in being lost in space and time, and ""On the Wings"" mirrors that sentiment with ""Maps of my days show all the messy ways/ My mind is a stranger with directions."" When Feinberg sings these songs, his voice is always more than his own, backed by harmonies or bolstered by effects that make him seem a little bigger than a guy commanding any guitar he touches. Feinberg's Little Kingdom has room for others. By extension, Little Kingdom is a multifunctional record, the sort of music that sits well at work through small speakers or on city streets through earbuds or at a party through a proper system. Its holistic sound is largely passive, dipping only to respectable lows and peaking above anything more than a breezy bustle just twice in nearly 45 minutes. Every track builds naturally: Like a meticulous oil painting, ""A Riot of Color"" rises one sheet at a time, starting with an acoustic guitar, then adding spry mandolin, sustained electric notes, and a second electric guitar that dances around the first like a moth flirting with fire. Bass and keyboard eventually settle in, just as the acoustic lead begins its slow descent. The sounds fall away without fading away, disappearing in time to reveal the next track, which reveals the Citay dogma: ""Friends are like lovers but they're cooler."" Little Kingdom follows this model of easy-going inclusion: Feinberg has his influences, but over two albums, he's continued to distill them into something his own, something that's lush and layered without being overly dense or didactic. The result sounds a little like a lot of things, and there's something here for most everyone. The comfortable acoustic hum of ""First Fantasy"" sounds vaguely like the first song on the first Aqueduct record, and the mandolin-guiding ""On the Wings"" recalls ""Find the Cost of Freedom"". And if that's not Jerry Garcia stepping everywhere in tricky little intervals on ""A Riot of Color"", Feinberg must have spent the last year moonlighting with Dark Star Orchestra. Those are limited interpretations, of course, and you'll have your own. They'll all be valid, too, even if your instinct reads something like, ""Sounds like some goddamn hippy."" Once again, that's the point.","Ezra Feinberg's typically instrumental psychedelic pop-rock group follows a model of easy-going inclusion on its latest and best album, a record gloriously embossed with shimmering solos and high-times harmonies.

Friend EP,Grizzly Bear,by: Ryan Schreiber,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Founder</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b352b1335d7bf169a597/1:1/w_160/0b8b1fe9.jpg,2007-11-06 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10871-friend-ep/,Warp,"It was only last fall that Grizzly Bear released their Warp Records debut, Yellow House, but the album feels much older. An impeccably crafted psychedelic folk record, it drifts from one dream-like passage to the next. Its lyrics draw on typical relationship fare, but the delicate instrumentation is otherworldly, evoking the pastoral scenery of antique storybook illustrations. That kind of careful attention to sonic detail isn't just a rarity in independent music right now-- it's practically anachronistic. I revisited Yellow House recently because something about Grizzly Bear's Friend EP had made me curious: Although many of the new EP's tracks are credited as re-workings or alternate versions of Yellow House tunes (or of songs from the band's demo-esque debut Horn of Plenty), almost none of it sounds familiar. The tracklist suggests it's just your average collection of odds and ends, but it's a trick: Of the four older songs that Grizzly Bear re-arrange on Friend, three are so far removed from their earlier versions as to bear only the faintest connection to their origins-- and the one that isn't, ""Shift"", is improved so dramatically that it acquires a second life. In fact, ignore the three inconsequential covers from Grizzly Bear's indie rock contemporaries and what you have is a very well-disguised, 31-minute mini-LP of newly recorded (and largely newly written) material that makes ""Knife""-- Yellow House's height of pop accessibility-- sound formless by comparison. The schizophrenic appearance of Friend's tracklist makes it difficult to relay how the record hangs together as a unified piece, or detail the radical alterations that take place within its songs. But because these traits are what make the disc more than just a budget-priced Yellow House add-on, I'll risk looking like Grizzly Bear Fan #1 and go straight for the play-by-play: 01. ""Alligator (Choir Version)"" -- New recording (featuring Beirut and Dirty Projectors)
A segue of sorts on 2004's Horn of Plenty, the original ""Alligator"" amounted to a little more than a home demo. In that skeletal form, the song consisted only of a tiny, chiming keyboard and a Spiritualized-like vocal melody sung timidly by founding member Edward Droste. It also clocked in at under a minute-and-a-half. Here, the song is dramatically fleshed-out, decelerated, and detuned, gaining tremendous weight and conviction-- not to mention an additional four minutes. Extended through a series of cacophonous build-ups and releases, and an epic bridge in which ethereal vocal harmonies give way to imposing elephant-call horns, crashing cymbals, and fluttering piano, the song finally draws to a restful close that bears no similarity at all to its humble beginnings. 02. ""He Hit Me"" (Crystals cover) -- New recording
I've always hated this song. Since it was first recorded by the Crystals in 1962, ""He Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss)"" has been retread to death as an ironic staple of anyone trying way too hard to be subversive. Although the shock value of its lyrics (""He couldn't stand to hear me say/ That I'd been with someone new/ And when I told him I had been untrue/ He hit me/ And it felt like a kiss"") remain its only remarkable quality, it's continually dusted off and paraded around by those who don't know any better (Courtney Love, the Motels), and those who ought to (Spiritualized, Grizzly Bear). Fortunately, I was able to work past my biases and hear how Grizzly Bear reshape the Goffin/King flop as liberally as they do their own material: Writing in their own psych-drenched passages, the band reimagines the song's bouffant-haired innocence as a baroque-pop experiment redolent of the Zombies, the Hollies, or the Left Banke. 03. ""Little Brother (Electric)"" -- New recording
Though roughly the same length as the Yellow House version, Friend's ""Electric"" is written almost from scratch. Now a thundering pop powerhouse, it shows Grizzly Bear at the absolute peak of their present powers. Eviscerating the song's earlier structure, ""Little Brother (Electric)"" revisits just one of the original sections, building everything around it-- including its stunning, explosive fireworks finale-- from the ground up. Here, Grizzly Bear transform from purveyors of delicate fairytale psych to steamrolling rock juggernauts, resulting in the most immediate, accessible, and concrete track in their current catalog. 04. ""Shift (Alternate Version)"" -- New recording
""Shift""'s first incarnation was Horn of Plenty's stark highlight, standing firmly on its beautifully austere melody. And because it's the least modified song here, it provides the disc's best illustration of the band's growth as both arrangers and musicians. Only with this version's sizable improvements are the original's weaknesses revealed. At first a tinny, abrasively lo-fi recording, the song's dreary pacing was a slog. But here, ""Shift"" trades its icy plod for fireside warmth. Better paced and saturated in natural reverb, the song thaws out and blooms in Friend's most gorgeous moment: a newly appended eight-part vocal harmony cascading over guitars and pianos. 05. ""Plans (Terrible vs. Nonhorse: Sounds Edit)"" -- Remix
Throwing us for a loop, this 1:37 palate-cleanser-- a collaborative remix between Grizzly Bear's Chris Taylor (aka Terrible) and ambient/noise artist Lucas Crane (aka Nonhorse)-- runs in the opposite direction from Friend's other material: Rather than rearranging Yellow House's pop-friendly ""Plans"" for maximum accessibility, they electrocute it. Using its peripheral sound effects to create a dissonant tangle of flute sounds, plucked banjo, and raw white noise, the song becomes a joking piss-take on the EP's overarching concept. 06. ""Granny Diner"" -- Previously unreleased
A perfect example of Friend's album-like sequencing, ""Granny Diner"" fades in from the static of the previous track. Opening with a drifting instrumental passage and ending with a radiant Abbey Road-like song fragment that falls somewhere between ""Sun King"" and ""You Never Give Me Your Money"", ""Granny Diner""'s deadpan absurdist lyrics transcend their mundanity to become genuinely affecting through Droste's sincere, defeated vocals. 07. ""Knife""(Covered by CSS)
08. ""Plans"" (Covered by Band of Horses)
09. ""Knife"" (Covered by Atlas Sound)
The Friend EP's only weakness, this three-song segment finds Grizzly Bear's camaraderie getting the better of them. Though the disc benefits commercially and promotionally from the band's decision to afford their peers an equal opportunity in reworking Yellow House material, it sells itself short as a worthy successor. Standing in stark contrast to Grizzly Bear's own reinventions, these curiosities only serve to disrupt Friend's otherwise seamless, cohesive flow. As for the covers themselves, CSS turn in a competent electro-pop reading of ""Knife"" before Band of Horses utterly derail the record with a brutal Disney-ized bluegrass rendition of ""Plans"". Deerhunter's Bradford Cox, recording under his solo alias Atlas Sound, fares best: Taking cues from Panda Bear's lovely Person Pitch, his reverb-drenched take on ""Knife"" sends breezy vocal harmonies over chiming, unidentifiable instrumentation, breathing celestial new life into the band's most ubiquitous song. 10. ""Deep Blue Sea"" (Daniel Rossen Home Recording) -- New recording
Loosely based on an age-old folk traditional, the Grizzly Bear singer/guitarist's ""Deep Blue Sea"", along with ""Little Brother (Electric)"", marks Friend's peak of broadened accessibility. Let this loose in a Volkswagen commercial and there's no turning back. A signifier of how much headway the band has made over the past year in the way of perfect, focused melody, the sleepy acoustic lullaby gently tucks in Friend and turns out the light. 11. [Hidden Bonus Track]
Crashing in shortly after ""Deep Blue Sea""'s pacific close, Friend's hidden bonus track is a jolting, last-minute surprise. A collaboration between Grizzly Bear and Beirut's Zach Condon, the raucous, fast-paced instrumental is one part Morricone spaghetti-western, two parts Sublime Frequencies field recording. The most staggering and left-of-center experiment from either band, the track sounds colossal despite its 83-second runtime. It also demonstrates the envelope-pushing Grizzly Bear can inspire, and how far they can travel outside their comfort zone without getting lost. Then again, that's largely what Friend as a whole establishes: More than a willingness to share their spotlight with like-minded pals, the title evokes a strengthening artistic bond between four forward-looking musicians who, as this disc makes easy to forget, found each other just three years ago. That an EP of this nature would showcase such an extraordinary leap forward in conviction and virtuosity is practically unheard of-- after all, these things are typically treated as commercial dustbins for outtakes and leftover scraps. But Grizzly Bear is a different beast, and in putting the same care and devotion into this project as they would any other, they've shown that the title applies not just to their musical allies, but to their fans as well.","The tracklist suggests it's just a collection of odds and ends, but that's a trick: Actually a well-disguised 31-minute mini-LP of newly recorded (and largely newly written) material, Friend marks Grizzly Bear's greatest leap forward yet, transforming them from purveyors of delicate fairytale psych to steamrolling rock juggernauts.

Make Sure They See My Face,Kenna,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b316c0084474cd0c2079/1:1/w_160/2adff34f.jpg,2007-11-05 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10807-make-sure-they-see-my-face/,InterscopeStar Trak,"No doubt about it: Kenna got a raw deal. With support from such unlikely bedfellows as Fred Durst and fellow Virginia Beach high school friend Chad Hugo of the Neptunes, the Ethiopian-born former Kenna Zemedkun crafted a catchy and unquestionably commercial debut in 2003's New Sacred Cow, an in-retrospect prescient fusion of rock, new wave, and pop. Yet despite the buzz surrounding the spooky single ""Hell Bent"" and its creepy video (fashioned from Mark Osborne's animated short ""More""), the album got bumped and bumped and bumped until its release was practically an afterthought, a stillborn flop and instant pop culture casualty/artifact. You can read all about it in Malcolm Gladwell's book Blink, which dedicates a chapter to Kenna illustrating how impulse decisions can raze expectations. The second-guessing of one higher up basically kneecapped the singer, pulling the plug on his well-paved ascent just like that. Four years later, Kenna's on a new major label, but his second album Make Sure They See My Face hasn't fared much better. Originally scheduled for release over the summer, the album was delayed, leaving Kenna hanging when he opened for Nelly Furtado on her tour, supporting an album that, as far as anyone knew, didn't exist. Then, as if to twist the knife, the album got bumped again. And a couple of more times, too. What's so amazing is that, once again, Kenna's music seems perfectly suited to the current music environment. It's catchy enough to get played on the radio, moody enough to charm brooding wallflowers, and arty enough to click with the cognoscenti. He's got some street cred, thanks to his relationship with the Neptunes, but he's also got nerd appeal. And getting shout-outs in the notes is a notable cross-section of supporters: Mike Shinoda, Bono, Dave Gahan, Justin Timberlake, ?uestlove, Michael Stipe, Nas, and more. So will Make Sure They See My Face get Kenna thanked in some future stream of shout-outs alongside such famous peers? Doubtful; so far Kenna's been more about setbacks than breakthroughs. Those potential breakthroughs are here, though. The thick Neptunes synths and clipped beats of ""Out of Control (State of Emotion)"" pair well with Kenna's latter day Cure-like melody and a huge chorus. ""Loose Wires/Blink Radio"" and ""Say Goodbye to Love"", two songs co-credited to Pharrell Williams, are bottom heavy cyber-funk, striking the usual Neptunes balance between high-end and homebrew. Most of the other tracks pair Kenna with Chad Hugo, and it's interesting to isolate what the quiet Neptune brings to the proceedings. Hugo's technique is strikingly in sync with Kenna's aesthetic on ""Baptized in Blacklight"" or ""Wide Awake"", goth-tinged new wave that emphasizes how much both acts like Linkin Park and a bevy of r&b acts (like Rihanna) owe to early 1980s synth-rock. It's on the rock end of the spectrum where Kenna hedges his bets a bit too much. While clearly synthetic, much of Make Sure They See My Face bends over backwards to sound in-your-face organic, with big, live-sounding drums and guitars that vie with the synths for room at the fore of the mix. Frankly, it all gets to be a bit much, especially since songs like ""Baptized in Blacklight"" and ""Static"" show what Kenna can do with a little more space in his music. Admittedly, subtlety probably wasn't first on Kenna's agenda, considering how much time he's spent on the sidelines, against his will. The dude wants to be heard, to be sure, and he's got something to prove, too. But sometimes a little bit of silence makes the bigger noise. Make Sure They See My Face is overdressed to impress when easing up may have been the best way to ease back into the public consciousness.","After a series of tough breaks, Kenna returns with a would-be breakthrough boosted by production from his pals and longtime supporters the Neptunes.

And should the recorded results convey a multiplicity of sounds, audiences are ever-likelier to respond with shuffle-minded tolerance rather than accusations of artistic schizophrenia. In another era, the shifts and leaps throughout Brought to You by Nebraskafish, the debut album from Omaha-based Capgun Coup, likely would have taken place over the course of several records. Instead, this document of three scant years of existence and two of songwriting represents a warp-speed compression of evolving sonic guideposts and changing aesthetic concerns, encompassing under its restless banner the rarely-reconciled likes of indie-folk, sound collage, politicized punk, and streamlined guitar pop. Debut albums are often scattershot affairs, but Nebraskafish exhibits all the focus of one of those ground spinners you set off on the 4th of July. The press materials emphasize Capgun's lack of a broad rock-knowledge base (""not the most well-versed students of rock music,"" says the first sentence of the one-sheet), which almost feels like an attempt to discourage a reading of the group as willfully haphazard collector geeks, painting them rather as a bunch of earnest kids joyfully flitting around from one exciting new musical ethos to the next. To be fair, a good chunk of the record falls within the confines of the hysterical-voiced ramshackle indie-pop proffered by the likes of the Unicorns, Phosphorescent, and Neutral Milk Hotel. Capgun don't yet convey nearly the emotional resonance of these acts, but they almost make up for it with an irreverent sense of humor (tossed off lines like ""beat you good-night"" on ""Elephant of Surprise"" and ""oh my God he's got the phattest ride"" on ""Social Security Number""), as well a fondness for sex talk (the giddily lustful ""Adorable Doorsteps"" and self-explanatory ""Blood, Sweat and Sex""). Admirable in intent but regrettable in execution, the band also occasionally tries to inject this formula with punk-blur rhythms (""Huck Finn"") and political fervor (""Uh Huh""), despite lacking adequate command of either discipline. Luckily, Capgun Coup's sonic nomadism pays off in plenty of other places. Folk and even countryish digressions bring them a measure of success on ""Oh My Mod"" and ""Bobby Chops and the Do-Gooders"", but it's the full-on pop immersions ""Fucked"" and ""My Tears Cure Cancer"" that truly steal the show. Evincing a superbly tight tunefulness on these songs, Capgun evoke the likes of Weezer and the Beatles, and the momentary focus on more conventional songwriting sounds more powerful surrounded by ragged loose ends and unhinged expression. Subsequent records are likely to find Capgun Coup winnowing their source material and concentrating their artistic reach. Perhaps we'll see these precocious grab-baggers absorbing their pop, punk, and folk lessons into something more sonically seamless rather than simply abandoning them altogether.","Omaha band's debut mixes indie-folk, sound collage, politicized punk, and streamlined guitar pop.

Red State,Gowns,by: Mike Powell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b31113d197565213a89f/1:1/w_160/e0acc863.jpg,2007-11-05 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10803-red-state/,Cardboard,"Almost none of the songs on Gowns' drone-folk album Red State take place outside. The issue here isn't preference of location, but inertia: Moving becomes both physically difficult and psychologically unappealing when you're on a tremendous amount of drugs. On the Mountain Goats' We Shall All Be Healed, John Darnielle explored the same drag: ""When we walk out in the sunlight we tell every we know it hurts our eyes/ When the real reason we don't like it is that it makes us wonder if we're dying."" Red State is, like We Shall All Be Healed, an album about people so unbelievably narcotized that they're barely cognizant of their surroundings. But fully grasping reality isn't the goal of most vision-seekers; when Erika Anderson reads off the roll of toxins in their system on ""Fargo"", she's not scared or even proud, she's bemused. And when she wheezes a minute later that ""The light that poured in through the window was golden"" in a crappy basement room in South Dakota, well, that's her way of saying hello to heaven. Gowns' music is serially unstable: Both Anderson and Ezra Buchla wheeze like they have knife wounds in their stomachs, the band's synth patches fail to spread into full drones, and its clattering percussion (especially on the album's centerpiece, ""White Like Heaven"") never settles into a groove. But the catastrophe is strategic; it accentuates a feeling of possibility-- for as often Gowns might have a wreck, they might have a revelation. In an era where indie's fetishes have been for composure, discretion, muscle, and nice shoes, Gowns' agenda-- to make a porno about confusion-- is radical. On the process of making Red State, Anderson wrote, ""When you listen you can tell that it could have only been recorded in a shit-ass meat-packing city in the Midwest where people shoot crank mixed with grape Kool-Aid and the grocery checkers don't even know what tofu is and all there is to do is get shit-faced at the bar and ask everyone how their kids are doing."" And you can tell. Fragile people make bad decisions. There are places in this country cursed by boredom and bad weather. Of course, Buchla, Anderson, and drummer Corey Fogel see what they want to see (or what the drugs point their characters toward). This makes them good artists and potentially horrible journalists. Still, for all the romance and theatricality of their visions-- drug freaks are nothing if not indulgent in their compellingly insane hunches-- Gowns' stories end up sounding like grisly reportage. Red State concludes with ""Advice"" and ""Cherylee"", the former a sampled television speaker talking about the difficulties of addiction over a slow fade of distortion and piano, the latter morphing from uncertain noise into a ballad about recovery, Anderson moaning, like she's at church, ""You've gotta stare into the mirror till you name this disease/ You've gotta write down all the symptoms even though it's obscene."" Television and mirrors: two of the scariest things found in almost every American home.","Like those on Mountain Goats' We Shall All Be Healed, the songs on Gowns' dark, trembly, electronics-laden folk album are about people so unbelievably narcotized that they're barely cognizant of their surroundings.

In fact, the first half-minute would be entirely blank if not for the slow approach of a lone, distant whirr. But once the band announces itself with a huge, reverberating crash, the album rarely returns to such quietude. Sprinting through eleven tracks of orchestrated chaos in a breathless half-hour, HEALTH mixes the bombastic pound of Boredoms, the skewed structures of Deerhoof, the tribal thump of Liars, and even the synth squirts of Black Dice and Excepter. What keeps HEALTH from being an unqualified success is that the group evokes all of the above reference points a little too closely. That's especially true in regards to the Boredoms and Liars. HEALTH's penchant for dramatic percussion, cresting noise, and ghostly vocals make some tracks sound like those two groups dueling loudly in an empty, cavernous amphitheater. On ""Courtship"", Eye-worthy screams melt into Angus Andrew-like moans over trance-inducing drums, while ""//M"" starts with symphonic blasts before drifting into ethereal chants, then slamming back into cacophonous percussion. But being able to call to mind such stellar groups, and, more importantly, do them justice, are not exactly easy tricks. Besides, HEALTH execute their noisy rants and sharp stomps with such precision that even their most generic tracks are impressive. Despite all the in-your-face clatter, the group also excels at small accents and mild surprises: take the chiming guitar chords in the middle of ""Crimewave"", the robotic noise at the end of ""Tabloid Sores"", the grainy textures inside the melting breakdown of ""Zoothorns"". While none of those sounds shock given what's come before, each deviates just enough from the other, as the band finds tiny variations inside steadfast repetition. HEALTH's sound starts to slip interestingly off its hard-earned course during the album's last three tracks. ""Glitter Pills"" is a stoic dance piece with canned drums and handclaps, like a sleep-walking version of recent Black Dice, while ""Perfect Skin"" and ""Lost Time"" are both slow, hypnotized marches. Here, HEALTH sticks to simple, unvarying rhythmic lurches beneath sky-reaching vocals that suggest Animal Collective at 16rpm. As earlier in the album, the reference points here are clear, and HEALTH at times meld them into their own wholly singular work.","The self-titled debut by L.A. quartet HEALTH mixes the bombastic pound of Boredoms, the skewed structures of Deerhoof, and the tribal thump of Liars.

Big Change: Songs for FINCA,Various Artists,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b34f9d034d5c69bf4cc2/1:1/w_160/bbeb0264.jpg,2007-11-05 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10869-big-change-songs-for-finca/,iTunesFINCA,"For a few years now, actress Natalie Portman has been traveling to impoverished countries to promote the Foundation for International Community Assistance (FINCA) Village Banking Campaign, a microcredit organization dedicated to providing financial services to the world's lowest-income entrepreneurs so they can create jobs, build assets, and improve their standard of living. Now Portman has taken her activism in a slightly different direction, curating the iTunes-only charity compilation Big Change: Songs for FINCA, which features 16 old and new tracks from Beirut, Tokyo Police Club, Rogue Wave, Antony & the Johnsons, and Vetiver. Certainly everyone involved in Big Change means well, but even the best of intentions cannot compensate for what is essentially a dull collection of songs. The fact that a song by Portman's My Blueberry Nights co-star Norah Jones-- ""Broken"", from the album Not Too Late-- fits so well into this tracklist should tell you a lot about the type of music Big Change emphasizes: sensitive singer-songwriter types. The result is a compilation with more lulls that excitement. Tom Brosseau's self-satisfied ""Plaid Lined Jacket"" is actually about a homeless guy with a new-old coat, which puts it in an unenviable lineage with Phil Collins' ""Another Day in Paradise"". Two tracks later, Brett Dennen's ""Ain't No Reason"" and Sean Hayes' electro-lite ""Turnaroundturnmeon"" slow the playlist's momentum to a halt, and neither Thee More Shallows' ""Oh Yes, Another Mother"" nor Angus and Julia Stone's ""The Beast"" can jumpstart it. These guys and their guitars aren't the Nick Drakes of our time-- they're the Dan Fogelbergs, which means some day we may look back on these songs and cringe. In the meantime, Big Change creates a staid atmosphere where artists like Antony & the Johnsons and Wooden Wand-- as well as Devendra Banhart and M. Ward, both of whom donate low-key exclusive tracks-- sound overly earnest and polite, stripped of their eccentricities and drained of personality. Too little too late, the electric guitar on Rogue Wave's ""How We Landed"" sounds like a ray of light breaking through the clouds. There are some relatively adventurous choices on Big Change-- which, at $7.99, with proceeds going toward an anti-poverty organization is still worth your money, if not your full attention-- such as the blog-pop opener ""Be Good"" from Tokyo Police Club, whose handclaps and fast tempo actually benefit from the oppressive strumming of the acts that follow. Curumin's fuzzed-out ""Tudo Bem Malandro"" provides some much-needed rhythm to Big Change, and Bjorn Yttling's new mix of the Shins' ""Australia"" moves James Mercer's vocal melody further to the forefront and nicely fragments the music, as if he's singing along to the noise from his neighbors' apartments. Best of all is Beirut's new ""My Night with the Prostitute From Marseille"", which forgoes Zach Condon's favored detuned brass band accompaniment for chintzy synths, which evoke a garish decadence that complements the lyrics, the nature of which you can guess from the song's title. This sort of musical tinkering is largely absent on the well-meaning compilation, whose earnestness is reflected in its musical conservatism.","Curated by actress Natalie Portman, this charity CD features work by the Shins, Devendra Banhart, Beirut, M.

Couples Therapy EP,The Glass,by: Liz Colville,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b300ea9e61561daa6a08/1:1/w_160/a0408708.jpg,2007-11-02 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10787-couples-therapy-ep/,Plant Music,"The Glass kicks up the dust of recent bands like Black Rebel Motorcycle Club on the first song of this EP, ""Mad at You"". Someone absurdly called this record ""metal"" in a glowing web review, probably because of this first track. Apart from the dreadful repetition of the lyric, ""Only one reason we're mad at you,"" this could be a less sexy cover of !!!'s ""Must Be the Moon"". It's a flitting, sparks-flying, and fist-pumping song, but the context is annoyingly understated. What could the band really be referring to, and could they at least give us a clue? Instruments can be voices, inferential in their illumination of what the singer is on about, but here, they're just as brain-dead as the words. The New York group, often compared to the Rapture, suffers from a penchant for dance-rock jams that sounded better four years ago (or 24). Heavy bass work, which is not so much noodling as rudimentary scale exercises, prevents the sultry hints of new wave created by ""Fourteen Again""'s vocals from really sinking in. The repetition of the line-- you guessed it-- ""fourteen again"" convinces you that only electro-house and its cousins should be permitted to bathe in such monotony. The Glass tries too hard to create something emotive here, but the music doesn't really fit anywhere; you can't dance to it, and when listening alone, it's fuel for feeling a bit hopeless, either about life or the future of music. The best comes last: in a damp, anemic drawl, ""4 Bytes"" closes out the seven tracks with wah-wah guitar and a wandering, vertiginous pattern of glittering electronics. This soothing departure from the shin-kick rhythm of the majority of the songs nearly saves the entire EP: it's a small return to the band's earlier two releases, and itjourneys homogenously without dulling the senses. The only rival to ""Bytes"" is the pleasantly cloudy ""Green Leaves"", which garnishes its thundering bass line and feathery alto vocals with soaring fake strings and a simple electric guitar that settles down for a twinkle of peaceful decorative effects. Still, the longevity of such a track is questionable, especially with a nonexistent chorus and no hint of any emotion more powerful than longing.","New York dance-rock outfit returns with a jittery, sullen seven-track EP that sort of rocks and doesn't really dance.

American Hearts,A.A. Bondy,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2f3c0084474cd0c203e/1:1/w_160/b0faeb42.jpg,2007-11-02 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10774-american-hearts/,Superphonic,"The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse ride through the first two tracks on A.A. Bondy's solo debut, American Hearts. The third track, ""Black Rain Black Rain"", recounts a personal plague, and on the fourth, ""Rapture (Sweet Rapture)"", he sings about, well, you know: ""I don't want to talk about Jesus, I just want to see his face."" Beset with demons but daring the Almighty to appear, Bondy has clearly forsaken the rock crunch of his former band Verbena-- which, despite their one-time hype, turned out to be a house built upon the sand-- and has reinvented himself as a southern preacher type, steeping blues-folk sermons in Biblical imagery and seeing fire and brimstone on the horizon, LOVE and HATE tattooed on his knuckles. And yes, American Hearts can get a little heavy-handed, and yes, using ""upon"" instead of ""on"" (as in ""like a ghost upon the breeze"" or ""six riders upon the ridge tonight"") isn't fooling anyone. On the other hand, there's a dark gravity to this album, as if Bondy is carrying a heavy burden through a Civil War picaresque: American Hearts is an unfolding tableau of hell on earth as seen by a weary set of eyes and described with a troubadour's guitar and an obsessive's mastery of form and musical history. Those are blues line repetitions on ""How Will You Meet Your End"" and ""Killed Myself When I Was Young"", and they press the unanswerable questions and the doomsday imagery. That's actually a rag he's playing on ""Vice Rag"". That's New Orleans on ""Rapture (Sweet Rapture)"", conjured with Bondy's bleakly concise lines ""you see that levee it's bound to break/ Put the children in the boat."" And that's Bondy reclaiming Christ as a peacenik on the title track: ""If your God makes war, then's he's no God I know,"" he sings, hinting at the Dylanesque protest made obvious by the harmonica solo, ""'cause Christ would not send boys to die."" Not everything along Bondy's journey is so stark and angry. He hangs with a backing group called the Band of Ghosts and stops in at barrooms and dance clubs, looking for anything that might restore hope. On ""There's a Reason"", he sounds like a hungry Ryan Adams, as the Band of Ghosts play a rickety slow number for all the doomed lovers: ""The love that's tearing you down,"" goes the wistful yet resigned chorus, ""is the love that will turn you around."" Still, it's the ambience that makes the song: Listen closely and you can hear the faint caws of a crow in the background, not a studio trick but a happy accident of recording in a rural New York State barn. In other words, God not only created the birds, but put them in the song and didn't ask for a co-producer credit. Even so, listening to American Hearts in its entirety, it's difficult to tell whether or not Bondy is sincere about his theological obsessions or if he's just playing them out as musical device. But that ambiguity, never resolved, turns out to be one of the album's most intriguing qualities. Sure, he's looking deep into his record collection, but who can blame Bondy for drowning himself in the past to escape a terrible present?","Though at times heavy-handed, there's a dark gravity to this album from the former Verbena singer, who now seems reborn as a southern preacher type, steeping blues-folk sermons in Biblical imagery.

Kings of Electro,Playgroup and Alter Ego,by: Andy Battaglia,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b30cb1335d7bf169a529/1:1/w_160/55b3169e.jpg,2007-11-02 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10797-kings-of-electro/,Rapster,"It turns out, by order of happenstance, that an ideal way to commune with the time-stamped sounds on Kings of Electro involves running on a treadmill with a small screen at eye-level showing a muted cable broadcast of Revenge of the Nerds II. The scenario couldn't be more 1980s, or less cerebral. Suffice it to say, the Revenge of the Nerds movies have not yet been seized upon by cineastes with discerning tastes. Then again, it's easy to imagine some deluxe-edition DVD coming out and making a compelling case for the cultural import of everything from the films' proto-Computer Age depiction of nerds to the period-faithful inscription on Booger's favorite T-shirt: ""Who farted?"" So it goes too with Kings of Electro, a 2xCD compilation of sounds that have already been historically revived. It doesn't count as a revelation at this point to survey how crucial a role 1980s electro plays in contemporary music of all kinds, but it proves revelatory to measure the profound power of the curatorial process when meted out by the right minds. For his part, Playgroup leader Trevor Jackson counts as one of those people: He's figured highly in the resurrection of electro as a genre and a sound, both with his own production work and as the impresario behind his erstwhile label Output Recordings. For the Playgroup half of Kings of Electro (the other disc was compiled by the German duo Alter Ego), Jackson focuses on electro as it sounded in its time of origin. The mostly 80s tracks he showcases tend toward the minimal and the raw, with a shared streak of that special kind of goofy naiveté that plays out in movements too young to worry about propriety. The sole objective of Whodini's ""Magic's Wand"" is to explain how a new thing called a ""rap attack"" differs from more familiar maladies of its day. (A counterpoint vocal from a choice call-and-response volley: ""She said rap attack, man, not heart attack!"") In another highlight, over ever-shifting mechanical bongos, Tilt seems to confuse the governing rules of video games with those of pinball. It's the kind of stuff that signals an era when an order to ""give the DJ a break"" still played as a precociously clever pun, when generous bass-lines bumped under delicious drum-sounds as natural and organic as a box of Gobstoppers. The second disc moves up in time. Making sense of their own roots in house and techno, Alter Ego focus more on latter-day extrapolations that redress electro as an idea more than a sound in-and-of itself. Highly technical tracks by Plastikman and Robert Hood skew as studious and austere appreciations, while the monumental 2-step garage anthem ""Doom's Night"" (by Azzido Da Bass) churns over a walloping beat that couldn't have been imaginable to a vintage electro act with a name like Dynamix 2. The Alter Ego disc is less electro than ""electro,"" with quotation marks that play more like serious tributes than signs of winking appropriation. It's an important distinction to draw in a current time when any and all history seems ripe for revisiting-- it's also a healthy measure of how resilient electro sounds on a compilation that works to bind the literal and the lasting.","A 2xCD compilation mixed by Playgroup (former Output Records owner Trevor Jackson) and Alter Ego pauses to consider what we mean when we speak of ""electro.""

BBC Radio 1: Established 1967,Various Artists,by: Nitsuh Abebe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b349ea9e61561daa6a7f/1:1/w_160/75b6970b.jpeg,2007-11-02 06:00:02,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10859-bbc-radio-1-established-1967/,Unknown,"The Hot! New! Acts! of today are enlisted to cover 40 years of radio favorites. (Each artist was assigned a year, and tasked with interpreting one of its top 20 hits.) Can I just admit up front that I have a soft spot for silly stunt-casting compilations like this one? For bad compilations in general? If you're over a certain age, this one might seem borderline offensive, like it's actually trying to suggest that the random mid-level favorites of the present are a serious match for 40 great years of pop-music history. If you're very, very young, it'll mean the awful discovery that your hip rock favorites are ready to pay homage to the same songs you're always asking your dad to quit humming-- and that they don't even sound good doing it. But that's precisely what everyone's after here: a kind of reality TV show for the UK music family, where people embarrass themselves, reveal themselves as terrifically unimaginative, or display talent and humor in the places you least expect it. It's too bad the used-CD dollar bin is a thing of the past, because it's in those racks, years down the road, that these kinds of comps sound best: There is nothing more fun than listening to forgotten second-stringers dress up old chestnuts in the Hot! New! Styles! of a half-decade ago. But wait: you don't tell your dad to quit humming these songs, and that's exactly why the bulk of the songs on these two discs is almost unlistenably banal. They're heavy on the UK's popular NME-approved mainstream ""indie"" acts, who tend not to be people with particularly broad talents; much as in the 1990s U.S., knocking out a catchy post-punk guitar song can still get you action over there. Listening to McFly take on the Jam's ""A Town Called Malice"", or Editors run through the Cure's ""Lullaby""-- or the Raconteurs do ""Teenage Kicks"", or Kasabian do ""Too Much Too Young""-- you get a grand reminder that rock music has not changed nearly enough over the past few decades: These guys are beholden to this music, and can do nothing beyond energetically recreating it, exactly as it was, and probably on the same vintage 1960s guitars. And those still turn out to be the solid ones. The New Yorker critic Sasha Frere-Jones recently wrote an article wondering why today's indie acts don't take more inspiration from African-American music: The sheer must-hear horror of the Stereophonics camping up Hot Chocolate's 70s funk hit ""You Sexy Thing"" might scare him off the question. The bar-band mess the Fratellis make of ""All Along the Watchtower"" sounds like the worst Rock'n'Roll Hall of Fame induction ever. Even the rock/pop collisions I had high hopes for-- Klaxons covering Blackstreet's r&b hit ""No Diggity"", Maxïmo Park doing Timberlake's ""Like I Love You""-- come up lame: You listen to them give it an honest, tasteful shot and then safely decide you'll be fine never doing that again. The Gossip's by-numbers discopunk version of ""Careless Whisper"" develops some heat by the end, and yet never gets as interesting as even Limp Bizkit's nu-metal version of ""Faith"". But credit goes to Hard-Fi for matching the Vegas bombast of Britney Spears' ""Toxic"", and to the Pigeon Detectives for the grand, straight-faced perversion of choosing a Huey Lewis tune. It's the actual pop acts that fare best here, working as they do with production teams who have this sort of work as part of their job descriptions in the first place. In among tracks it's hard to imagine lots of these acts even dropping as B-sides, Kylie Minogue turns in a version of Roxy Music's ""Love Is the Drug"" that could just as easily have been her next single-- or an old one, what with ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"" being awfully ""Love Is the Drug"" in the first place. Amy Winehouse does ""Cupid"" (per Johnny Nash, but you'll think Sam Cooke) in a Jamaican rocksteady style that's all Alton Ellis; the listenability quotient goes through the roof. And one wishes the people behind this set would have traded out at least a couple more indie losers for electronic acts, whose music has gone places in the past 30 years, and who turn in most of the fun here. A weird streak of unfortunate reggae touches leaves lots of the rock bands on here sounding like a two-dollar Police tribute, but Mika and Armand van Helden actually turn ""Can't Stand Losing You"" into a hissy, scraping, electro-house gem. And Groove Armada hazy take on Madonna's ""Crazy for You"" is one of too few tracks that offer-- duh-- an interesting new take on the original. Irony being uncool these days, there's actually not much in the way of entertaining piss-takes: The most ironic thing here, in fact, turns out to be the totally earnest, straightforward cover the Streets' Mike Skinner gives Elton John's ""Your Song"". (Either that or Robbie Williams singing ""Lola"", which seems rather like he's being ironic about himself.) More disturbingly, hardly anyone goes in for reinventions-- there is a dutiful straight-arrow awards-show vibe here that seems set on embarrassing anyone who's ever claimed that pop music is subversive. When one of the farthest-afield appearances is Just Jack reconfiguring the Cardigans' ""Lovefool""-- not exactly a sacred old cow to tweak-- some kind of imagination deficit is clearly happening. And when the Kooks play Ace of Base's ""All That She Wants"" exactly the way you'd think they would-- even though you've barely followed who the Kooks even are-- it gets worse: For what good reason do so many of these acts seem like they're trying to slip by unnoticed, tasteful, boring? We have watched a beatboxing American Idol contestant do more drastic song reinventions in a week than some of these pros attempt. And yet there's something fun about listening through this, and not just because it feels like Ricky Gervais might pop up on backing vocals at any moment-- it makes for one amazing morning, especially if you're the sort of person who listens to too much music that's self-conscious about being ""good."" Besides, for a lot of us in the U.S., the UK pop world really is like some kind of strange reality show to check in on now and then-- amazed by seemingly fictional pop stars like Natasha Bedingfield, wondering how every third band with a half-decent rock song gets to act important (even if named something like, say, ""the Kooks"", evidently because ""the Wiggles"" was taken), marveling at how this Bizarro Pop Universe can so seldom get any traction in our homeland press. (Plenty of Americans will scan the tracklist of this set and be confused by both sides of the covers: ""Who the hell are Razorlight? Why I have I never heard any 80s hit from any Paul Young, and why does James Morrisson sound so good covering it?"") American trainspotters of that universe may have a lot more fun with these discs than Brits who have to be surrounded by such stuff constantly: Somewhere between hearing the Streets' Mike Skinner pull a possible Biz Markie on Elton John and noticing Lily Allen starting to sing oddly like Harriet Wheeler from the Sundays, you actually do start chuckling over how strange and silly and human the whole enterprise of music is. Whether or not that's enough to make up for hearing Keane play ""Under Pressure""-- a track that puts a critic like me in that position where you tell people ""You have to smell this, it smells horrible""-- is an open question.","BBC Radio 1 celebrates itself by asking the hot bands of today (you know, Razorlight, Calvin Harris, Paolo Nutini) to cover the hits of yesteryear. Also involved are the Raconteurs, Lily Allen, Klaxons, the Streets, Foo Fighters, and Kylie Minogue.

Mirrored is also Battles' best record to date, and probably more enjoyable than almost any (mostly) instrumental rock record-- math-rock, nu-prog, all obscurely tagged and ultimately undefinable subgenres-- since Tortoise's Millions Now Living Will Never Die. But it also represented prog's worst tendencies: To be overwrought, grossly testosterone-fueled, and occasionally unaware of its own tedium. For as many who felt like Mirrored was their revelatory rock moment of the year, there were those who found it just plain alienating (oddly, they seem to be people with no objection to the winding ornaments of, say, Marnie Stern or Joanna Newsom). Compaion EP Tonto+ takes on its title track as well as another Mirrored song, ""Leyendecker"", plus a DVD which features videos for ""Tonto"" and ""Atlas"". So, it's ""Tonto"", four times, over 34 minutes: The Mirrored version, a live version, and remixes by the Field and Four Tet. Pairing Battles with the Field, while a nice nod to indie cache in 2007, is a thick-headed musical conceit: Battles' music lies in the collision of details, and even though the Field quilted a record from millisecond snippets, he kept the source of each stitch largely anonymous. The result of this pairing seems uncomfortable, and further soured by the context of Battles' original. Four Tet fares better, strait-jacketing the beat into something more house-oriented, which-- when paired with the song's guitar melody, here taken up by a rumbling synthesizer-- helps realize the song's deeper, more sinister potential: country-disco. But then, with just three minutes to go, he lets the air out and turns to something we've all heard before, about 15 minutes ago: More of the original. ""Leyendecker"" also appears twice-- once as a live version, once as a DJ EMZ remix featuring Joell Ortiz. The latter should be proof enough that Tyondai Braxton deserves some session work hammering out vocal hooks for commercial rap, but it also indicates that Battles aren't actually funky. At all. Then again, that's of little relevance, quality-wise-- part of Mirrored's greater gesture was a kind of stiffening, a movement toward the big and blocky, and that doesn't sit nicely within a hip-hop context. As a consumer, it's hard to know what Battles want to do with Tonto+. The remixes are alright, and nearly all of the DVD, which features videos ""Tonto"" and ""Atlas"", can be seen online (even if the low-res compression of YouTube clips can't do them nearly the justice they deserve). Tonto+ doesn't really extend the life of the record-- what singles do anymore?-- but it's also worth noting that Mirrored, which only came out five months ago, isn't in need of an appendage.","One of the year's best rock albums now has a companion EP-- complete with remixes from the Field and Four Tet, as well as a contribution from Joell Ortiz and a pair of videos.

I Created Disco,Calvin Harris,by: Marc Hogan,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Senior Staff Writer</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b30d13d197565213a896/1:1/w_160/2bba9d77.jpg,2007-11-01 05:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10798-i-created-disco/,ColumbiaAlmost Gold,"The creation of disco was one of its most exciting phases. In New York in the early 1970s, you could go to the Loft and hear David Mancuso play anything from the funky Spanish rock of Barrabas to the soon-to-be B-boy breaks of Babe Ruth's ""The Mexican"". Over at the Gallery, Nicky Siano might've been spinning the Bahaman rhythms of ""Exuma, The Obeah Man"" or the soulful storytelling of Bill Withers' ""Harlem"", alongside such Philadelphia Sound standards as MSFB's ""Love Is the Message"". Other innovators-- Larry Levan, Tom Moulton, Walter Gibbons, Arthur Russell, and more-- also helped define disco without limiting it to the most common definition. All that's not to point out that Calvin Harris didn't create disco, because, duh. He didn't create electro-house, either, but in a year full of cranked synths, proud hedonism, and Daft Punk, the UK music-buying public has decided to befriend the Scottish producer and singer-songwriter. At only 23, Harris enjoys the kind of Cinderella success story that recently drew British reality TV audiences to singing cell-phone salesman Paul Potts: After a move to London failed to provide a job, Harris went back to stacking supermarket shelves in his hometown of Dumfries until a MySpace page brought major-label executives a-calling. Harris has since scored two top 10 UK singles and recorded with Kylie Minogue. James Murphy shouldn't worry about losing his edge just yet. DFA's dance-punk figures prominently in Harris' cheeky full-length debut, I Created Disco, which peaked at #8 in the UK this summer and recently arrived in America. So do the Daft-punk'd electro-house of fellow Scottish producer Mylo and the same ""borrowed nostalgia for the unremembered 80s"" that inspires Montreal/New York electrofunk duo Chromeo. Trouble is, Harris has only one move, and it's not even convincing. But it's all in good fun, supporters protest-- sorry, not enough fun, and stop bogarting that stash. Oh, sure, plenty of great music can be superficial. I Created Disco mistakes superficiality for greatness. There's very little variation between (or even within) tracks: a vapid vocal hook usually repeats over a simple bass groove and drum programming, with kitschy falsetto and synths, either zapping or distorted. Boringly often, there are boilerplate references to drugs: ""Drug-taking at my place,"" Harris boasts matter-of-factly on latest single ""Merrymaking at My Place"", which repeats ""my house"" enough times for LCD Soundsystem's Murphy. Nearly as often, there are equally perfunctory references to the opposite sex. On previous single ""The Girls"", Harris follows the Rolling Stones' ""Some Girls"" template about as regrettably as Louis XIV did on 2005's ""Finding Out True Love Is Blind"", except with Scottish attempts to sing like Murphy singing-uh like Mark E. Smith-uh, instead of American attempts to sing like Marc Bolan. ""I like them Asian girls/ I like them mixed-race girls,"" Harris explains. I'm usually just outside of Barstow in the album's neon desert when the first single, ""Vegas"", kicks in. It's got both drugs and girls. I know this because Harris sings, ""I've got my drugs, and my stuff, and my pills (when I go to Vegas)/ I've got my girls and my boys and my girls"". In a blind taste test with follow-up UK hit ""Acceptable in the 80s"", four out of five of coke heads would make the choice of a new generation-- though there isn't much difference between the two tracks other than the words in Harris' apathetic vocals. Between the singles, I Created Disco is padded with repetitive, frequently instrumental tracks. Reassuringly, the guy at least seems to have a sense of humor; the spoken-word title track makes it clear he's only goofing about disco-creating and possibly everything else. The problem is, he's not particularly witty, or, even with knowledge of his overnight success story, remarkable. Witness ""Colours"", which over-extends Harris' tired 80s obsession by suggesting you wear neon instead of black-and-white. When Harris ventures into a wah-wah slow jam on ""Love Souvenir"", the slight reprieve is appreciated, even though it ultimately turns into another four minutes of aimless looping. Finale ""Electro Man"" suggests the young artist might one day reimagine himself as an urbane, Hot Chip-style romantic. Still, it's not sophistication Harris requires, necessarily. The fatal flaw of I Created Disco isn't that Harris works with a style he didn't create, it's that-- after a 2007 in which LCD Soundsystem matched Murphy's head for hips with heart, when Justice rendered synths metallic and Simian Mobile Disco made them child's play-- Harris reduces pop's limitless possibilities to one-joke self-parody, his youth his most distinguishing characteristic, an unremembered yesterday always more vibrant than today. You know ""Crank That (Soulja Boy)"", lately the biggest American single? That dude was born in the 90s. The kids really are coming up from behind.","Calvin Harris didn't create disco, duh. He didn't create electro-house, either, but in a year full of cranked synths, proud hedonism, and Daft Punk shows, the UK music-buying public has decided to befriend the Scottish producer and singer-songwriter.

"100 Days, 100 Nights",Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3019d034d5c69bf4c5e/1:1/w_160/ec75a8bf.jpg,2007-11-01 05:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10789-100-days-100-nights/,DaptoneWorld's Fair,"From the first notes of 100 Days, 100 Nights, it's apparent that Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings are in a different mood than the one they were in when they made their first two albums. Where Dap-Dippin' and Naturally were full-on heavy funk workouts that perfectly captured the spirit of early 1970s soul, this record draws more of its feel and atmosphere from late-60s Motown. It may seem like a fine distinction, but it results in a slightly smoother, more refined record that nonetheless bursts with raw emotion and stinging grooves. The opening swirl of horns sets up the darker, airier vibe right away, settling your ears into the sound before the rhythm section kicks in and Jones drops in with her powerful, gospel-trained voice. Jones shows her Augusta, Georgia, roots at the song's mid-point when she pulls a classic James Brown move, calling on the band to slow down and give her time to think, a command they dutifully obey. Among the biggest keys to the Dap-Kings' success is that Jones is a fantastic singer, a masterful soul vocalist in the best tradition of Etta James, Bettye Lavette, and Irma Thomas. She can wail when she needs to, has access to a gentle falsetto when the song requires it, and has impeccable control, with a full-throated tone that grabs your attention. Jones isn't a fresh-faced youngster imitating her heroes, either-- she was at it in the 70s, singing backup on funk and disco records while seeking her own big break, but moved to gospel in the 80s when her style fell out of favor. In between her early career and her revival in the mid-90s, she worked as a prison guard and also did armored vehicle security work, and she brings the same tough, no-nonsense approach those jobs require to her music. The band, and lead composer Gabriel Roth (aka Bosco Mann) in particular, has a firm understanding of the material they're channeling. This is not pastiche-- it's soul music that came along about thirty-five years late. The production is so spot-on it's like a time warp, and drummer Homer Steinweiss inhabits his decades-old beats so thoroughly he makes them feel fresh again. You get the sense of musicians in a room together, and the horns blend in the air of the studio before ever reaching the mixing board. This music is a throwback for sure, but it's so uncontrived that it doesn't come off like one. Jones and the boys have grown quite well into their spot at the forefront of the old-school soul revival, ahead of fellow travelers like the Poets of Rhythm, Lefties Soul Connection, Nicole Willis, the Budos Band, and Amy Winehouse, who's become the movement's commercial and tabloid face. They follow their muse across the soul map, cutting a sublime Motown groove on ""Tell Me"", jumping on a nasty funk vamp on ""Nobody's Baby"", slowing things down for a burning southern soul ballad on ""Humble Me"", and going back to Jones' gospel roots on the jaw-dropping closer ""Answer Me"". Anyone with a taste for old funk and soul will love this record, from the most dusty-fingered crate diggers to kids who just like what they hear on the oldies station. They may not be doing anything especially new, but Sharon Jones & the Dap-Kings are the very best at what they do, and they've made another excellent album.","Band's third album of convincingly vintage-sounding soul is slightly smoother and more refined than its predecessors, tending to evoke late-1960s Motown rather than early-70s r&b.

Worried Noodles,David Shrigley,by: Marc Masters,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3405e6ef9596932241e/1:1/w_160/c2e1c926.jpg,2007-11-01 05:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10848-worried-noodles/,Tomlab,"""I like...a certain amount of personality, which is perhaps a bit quirky,"" said visual artist David Shrigley recently, discussing his personal aesthetic. ""I like that word very much, 'quirky.'"" Embracing that term is a rather bold move, since ""quirky,"" like ""edgy"" and ""hip,"" has by now passed from meaningful adjective into tired cliché. It's a buzz-word more likely to pop up in an ad exec's sales pitch than in a substantive discussion of art. But quirky is an apt word for Shrigley's work, both in its purest sense-- i.e. idiosyncratic, peculiar, unpredictable-- and its more hackneyed connotations. In Worried Noodles, a book of Shrigley lyrics released by Tomlab in 2005, his words and drawings are spare and child-like, yet often strange and disturbing. Their naïveté can be quirky in the worst sense, as in ""Blackcurrant Jam"", a mundane declaration of what jelly tastes best, or ""Joy"", a crude celebration of how great insanity must be. But most of Shrigley's lyrics take simple ideas and add odd, funny turns. Though not as rich as the work of, say, Daniel Johnston or Edward Gorey, Shrigley's verse evokes both of those truly quirky artists. Worried Noodles' ratio of good and bad quirkiness stays intact on Tomlab's updated edition, which adds two discs of music created for Shrigley's lyrics by 39 bands. (Shrigley himself sings on one track, backed by Tussle; his ties to the music world include directing videos for Blur and Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy and providing cover art for Deerhoof's Friend Opportunity.) Interestingly, the success of each song is independent of how good each Shrigley lyric is. Grizzly Bear's take on the aforementioned ""Blackcurrant Jam"" is subtle and reverent, finding modest poignancy in Shrigley's flat verbiage. Whereas ""I Saw You"", Shrigley's smart ode to social awkwardness, is smoothed over by the bouncy melody and half-spoken chants of YACHT. What ultimately distinguishes the hits from the misses on Worried Noodles is how much quirkiness the bands themselves bring to Shrigley's words. Because most of the acts can themselves can be called quirky, each contribution threatens to overflow with cuteness. But the majority of bands keep things subdued, adding touches of character without piling contrivances onto these potentially precious pieces. In many cases, acts find meaning that Shrigley's words alone don't quite convey. James Chadwick and Christopher Francis make understated folk songs out of Shrigley's short verses, while Psapp marries ""Sad Song"" to an distant keyboard figure, and ""No""-- whose lyrics are almost completely made of its title-- becomes a hypnotic chant in the hands of Franz Ferdinand. In fact, many find mantras in Shrigley's repetitions: Scout Niblett coolly repeats ""ding dong"" in ""The Bell"", and John Shankie's a cappella ""A Song"" see-saws like a nursery rhyme. The finest pieces marry the bands' personalities to Shrigley's peculiar voice. Liars' ""Panic Button"" is a whirring mess of tribal drums and speeding noise, while Max Tundra captures the goofiness of Shrigley's dialogue in ""A Truce"" by giving one side of the conversation to an electronic chipmunk. The two strongest unions are the most eerie: R. Stevie Moore's echoey declarations on ""Live in Fear"" are both soothing and creepy, and the disturbing ""The Pretty Girl"" becomes even more insidious when mouthed distantly by Casiotone for the Painfully Alone. The only failures come when bands resort to forced cleverness: Islands drag the aforementioned ""Joy"" down even further, adding pseudo-wacky music to the inane verbiage, while on ""Show Me the Way Things Work"" the Curtains' plinky piano and arch vocals try too hard. But such missteps are infrequent considering the project's length and scope. Though many of the bands fall into the same stylistic range, the set rarely gets tiresome. One wonders what might happen if Tomlab were to make genre-based sequels, perhaps with hip-hop, metal, or folk. It's probably best that we'll never know, but it's a testament to Worried Noodles' potency that such ideas are even worth imagining.","Visual artist David Shrigley has a book of his lyrics set to music by 39 artists over two CDs; among those featured are Liars, Grizzly Bear, Franz Ferdinand, Hot Chip, David Byrne, Final Fantasy, and Dirty Projectors.

"Twilight & Ghost Stories / Between Them, A Forest Grew, Trackless and Quiet",Chris SchlarbI Heart Lung,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2f413d197565213a86c/1:1/w_160/d2542218.gif,2007-11-01 05:00:01,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11912-twilight-ghost-stories-between-them-a-forest-grew-trackless-and-quiet/,Asthmatic Kitty,"""Four years ago, I was a sleeping ghost at home,"" begin Chris Schlarb's liner notes for his first solo album under his own name. Though he's released records of solo electric guitar music as Xn, it makes sense that he'd use his given name for this one, as Twilight & Ghost Stories is a very personal album that helped pull him out of one of the lowest ebbs of his life. It may seem odd to make a personal album with about forty collaborators, but Schlarb has managed the trick in the way he's skillfully arranged each person's contributions to form a meditation on solitude. Twilight began months into a period of involuntary seclusion for Schlarb, when he recorded a rainstorm off the cuff. Beginning with the environmental recording, he formulated a plan to secure snippets of music from dozens of people he knew (and a few he didn't) and arrange them into something singular. He certainly managed to do that. Sufjan Stevens (who plays some piano) is the biggest name on the record, but his appearance isn't terribly relevant to the album's overall success. In fact, no single collaborator makes or breaks it-- the sum of their work is much greater than the parts. The rainstorm recording makes recurring appearances as the 39-minute piece progresses (split into shorter tracks, seemingly more for reference than anything else), traveling from idea to idea with the same ease that conversations will begin with one topic and end with a disparate one. A bit of drifting on-the-black-keys piano, a confident burst of jazz horns, a brief organ figure, a chord sequence that sounds like sunrise, a pool of layered voices, someone speaking in a monotone, even a shambling recording of Tom Abbs playing tuba, drums, and upright bass at the same time-- these all make appearances, and all find their way into the overall thread of the piece with surprising ease. Schlarb is also half of I Heart Lung-- he plays guitar, while Tom Steck plays drums-- and wears a few other hats as well. He runs the interesting Sounds Are Active label and is a central member of the Create (!) free-form music collective (the extra punctuation is part of their name), not to mention the fact that he's a busy sound engineer. I Heart Lung's new album, Between Them a Forest Grew, Trackless And Quiet, is something of a between-meals snack for fans, being drawn from four separate live performances, one with an extra member sitting in on clarinet and sax. The I Heart Lung album, understandably, doesn't have the same emotional or atmospheric weight as its counterpart-- live recordings often don't convey those well. Judging from this record, you never know quite what you're in for at an I Heart Lung show-- the performances range from free jazz skronkery (""Lycanthropy"") to roaming ambient pieces (""Maleem Ya Maleem"") and frenetic rhythm'n'drone workouts (""Moving Through Color II""). Steck's drumming is able to stay focused while also including a great deal of embellishment over the top, and the contrast between his active style and Schlarb's long, arcing notes is the band's key strength. Open-ended improvisation is the common guiding principle, and though the musicians are skilled, many tracks wind up as intriguing journeys without destinations. It's interesting to hear two such different sides of one musician at once (and that's of course not to discount Steck), one with surprisingly broad appeal for a single-piece ambient record and another more challenging and abstract. Twilight is a unique and remarkably universal record, and one that offsets its projected loneliness with a great sense of warmth. Indeed, it's perfect for listening to in the very circumstances that birthed the concept, when you're alone with the weather, wondering what to do. Between Them, A Forest Grew works best as a teaser for I Heart Lung's capabilities, a take-away for people who've caught them live, or as a solid record for fans of free improv.",,7.2,
Smoke,White Williams,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2ddea9e61561daa69cd/1:1/w_160/749c9bbb.jpg,2007-11-01 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10754-smoke/,DominoTigerbeat6,"Getting the full picture of Joe Williams' debut LP Smoke means making your way past the horrifically gaudy cover image to the production credits inside. There, after Williams' own writer/composer/engineer listing, is the name of the cover model, followed by credits for hair, makeup, ""hookah prop design,"" and of course, ""art."" Williams, it is made clear, rolls as thick as the exhalant that gives his debut its name. That aesthetic emphasis has landed Williams an opening gig for the recent electro-populist double-bill of Girl Talk and Dan Deacon. But while his tourmates get sweaty with the crowd as they tap away at their electronics, Williams keeps a cool distance. His songs are thin and languorous, with impeccable influences and the sort of calculated disaffection that comes from an MFA in design and a good weed connection. His attitude and vocal timbre have earned him comparisons to Beck, and that's more than fair: As glassy, nonchalant dance music, Smoke could be Midnite Vultures Redux: Something for the Blunted. Mostly, though, Williams is a groove-obssesser working through his influences, and doing it with enough restraint and creativity to work them into his songs, leaving the showiness to his cover models. Smoke’s signposts form a coherent musical worldview: ""In the Club"" is T. Rex's ""The Motivator"" at 16 rpm, ""Going Down"" and ""Route to Palm"" work in the 1970s West African guitar colorations that Dirty Projectors, Vampire Weekend, and Islands have been exploring lately, ""New Violence"" hurtles forward with a motorik bassline, and opener ""Headlines"" plays like a bubblegum version of Brian Eno's ""Baby's on Fire"". Even the umpteenth barely-augmented cover of ""I Want Candy"" feels like a distillation of the record's love for veneers. Smoke's fondness of surfaces doesn't stop at the level of rhythmic appropriation, though; Williams takes an observational approach to lyricism that recalls early Roxy Music's tongue-in-cheek take on the glamourous life. In ""Headlines"", he crafts a series of slow motion scenester dioramas like ""Climb all you can/ It's a killer stake/ We'll hang from the branches/ While the mayor dances/ In the headlines."" ""In the Club"" tightens its focus, observing, ""Trashy dancing baby got inside for free/ She's got the basement wrist/ She do the snow-blow twist."" Like his predecessors, Williams doesn't distinguish much between style and peril; the middle of Smoke features ""New Violence"", ""Going Down"", and ""Danger"", which view impending menace as a necessity for sophistication. Williams' ostensible depthlessness, like that of his forebears, is itself only a façade, and Smoke offers plenty to discover across repeated listens-- particularly the way in which he tweaks his own voice, melting and reshaping it like the models' Technicolor ""tears"" on the album cover. This tendency toward sonic self-mutilation underscores the most appealing aspect of Williams' persona: Underneath the mannerisms is a shy kid, too timid to force his will on his audience in the manner of his tour mates, content to watch and comment from the margins. Appropriately, then, a streak of dark nostalgia murmurs just beneath the glitzy exterior of ""The Shadow"". Williams remembers ""driving toward collisions in our heads,"" ""burning buildings and the rivals that we had,"" and ""wailing widows and the moments that we bled,"" and in the process giving some context to that hard-to-forget cover image: fashionable high culture as a sad, grotesque fantasy.","After successful tours with Dan Deacon and Girl Talk, White Williams issues a debut album layered with impeccable influences-- including Roxy Music, Beck, and T. Rex-- and a sense of calculated disaffection.

Jack of Diamonds,John Phillips,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2605e6ef959693222aa/1:1/w_160/5c12db29.jpg,2007-10-31 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10644-jack-of-diamonds/,Varese Saraband,"The cut-out bins, used record shops, and studio vaults are cluttered with ""lost"" albums, but not every lost album is a lost classic. Still, the idea of the lost album-- some secret talisman long forgotten or overlooked-- is an irresistible hook. Here's something, it goes, that so few people have heard that it practically doesn't exist. Or better yet, here's something that only a select few will ever even understand. Not that John Phillips is your typical elite fare. As a member of the Mamas & the Papas, he's been heard and loved by millions, and he's part of the very fabric of American folk and rock history. But thanks in no small part to huge quantities of drugs, Phillips fell off fast, and for most of the 1970s on up he wandered wasted and restless, his sole commercial success a co-write credit on the Beach Boys' unctuous ""Kokomo"" before dying of heart disease in 2001. Phillips has too storied and sordid a history, but his solo work falls into the realm of ""lost"" albums. But sometimes lost music is lost for a reason. Phillips' legendary sessions with Mick Jagger, Keith Richards, and Mick Taylor, once they saw the light of day, largely sucked. Yet Phillips' 1970 debut John, the Wolfking of L.A. fit the bill perfectly, resonating upon recent reissue with a new generation of hipsters in tune with the album's lazy and suddenly fashionable California rock vibe. Wolfking was the epitome of the California album, so laid back and effortlessly pretty it often seemed like making the album was the happy byproduct of days and nights wading into the water and partying out on the patio overlooking the canyon. Jack of Diamonds is a different creature entirely, which comes as no surprise: It's cobbled together from various early 70s sessions to approximate what might have been a second album. These songs weren't lost so much as left largely unused, especially as Phillips moved on to Hollywood work and testing the limits of the human body. So consider Jack of Diamonds something of a ""found"" album, recreated from bits and pieces left behind like breadcrumbs pointing the way. That's OK. The Wolfking reissue was half unreleased material itself. But Jack of Diamonds is no Wolfking. ""Devil's on the Loose"" is a fun start, but you can practically hear Phillips losing his focus, the funky wah-wah and (literal) vibes not enough to disguise his rough and ragged vocals. It's the dark side of Cali rock quickly showing its ugly head, especially as it gives way to the middling yacht rock of ""Mister Blue"". By ""Black Broadway"", we've entered dubious and shitty demo territory, listless even by the standards of listless run-throughs. Fortunately, Jack of Diamonds ends, if not on an up note then at least on a less squirm-inducing one, drawing from a diverse bevy of sources for a final salvo of bonus tracks, including ""Last of the Unnatural Acts"" and the jaunty ""First and Last Thing You Do (Holland Tunnel)"" from Robert Altman's Brewster McCloud soundtrack. But hopefully this inglorious posthumous mess marks the end of the Phillips archaeological dig, as the law of deminishing returns makes trying to craft lost classics from leftovers a losing proposition. ""Too Bad"" and ""Marooned (Double Parked)"" might have been fun at the time, blown out on whatever Phillips had around to stuff up your nose, but here they're go-nowhere bores whose inklings of good ideas never seem to go anywhere. In the hands of pros like Steely Dan, ""Jack of Diamonds (Me and My Uncle)"" might have worked the way Phillips approaches the song here (others, like the Grateful Dead and Judy Collins, have had better luck with it). The rest of the album peters out as a patience-trying chore, not full of lost album gems but full of piffle like ""Yesterday I Left the Earth"", the kind of song people try to lose and leave behind.","Cobbled together from various early 1970s sessions, Jack of Diamonds approximates what might have been the King of Cali-rock's second solo album.

Ward. He's also collaborated with everyone from unsung lo-fi folkies from Indiana to Jason Lytle of Grandaddy. Even with Field's long history, you can jump in right here with Soft Pow'r, a completely self-contained and accessible work that is more austere than many of his records but no less affecting. For all his prior collaborative work, this album sounds very isolated. The quiet acoustic opener ""Scuby"" sets the tone for the rest of the brief and understated record, just Field's voice and guitar with subtle additions like the muffled drum loop and few scattered, idle notes of piano. There's no shortage of precious singer/songwriter records in the world, but Field's voice is distinct and has both tenderness and quiet authority. When he double-tracks his voice, he actually thinks about it, as ""Scuby"" has one deep, sonorous, and flatly-intoned line anchoring another sung in a high register that sounds full of yearning. They meet on a few goose-bump-raising moments before the chorus, together creating a sort of layered resignation. These are the kinds of small shades of quiet longing that typify the record. It's that quiet authority that saves the more mundane sentiments of tracks like ""Gone Again"", which repeats the simple phrase ""miss you so much"" again and again but never becomes overly precious or maudlin. While the songs that add a bit more piano and drums and reach for a less ephemeral strain of soft-rock, like ""Warming"" or ""Free Bird"", have Field straining his delivery somewhat, it's mostly just impressive how much he does with so little. Even the languid, rhythm-free ""Saturday"" sounds like it could have been made up on the spot, but Field's intonation still arrests the attention. Given its uniformity, it helps that Soft Pow'r straddles the line between album and EP with just seven tracks. Short albums are nothing to complain about, especially ones as consistent as this. It won't change your life, but it just happens to be a successful change in tone and another worthwhile album in a catalog full of them.","This short, sweet, and mostly acoustic offering is more austere than many of bandleader Kyle Field's prior records but no less affecting.

Fill Up the Room,Saturday Looks Good to Me,by: Liz Colville,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b230c0084474cd0c1f27/1:1/w_160/b55658e3.jpg,2007-10-31 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10600-fill-up-the-room/,K,"Fresh off the Polyvinyl boat, Saturday Looks Good to Me release Fill Up the Room, their seventh full-length album and first on K Records. Finally the array of comparisons critics have made regarding this band is to be found in its entirety on the same release. The moody crescendos and meanderings of Fred Thomas' voice cut slices of Stephin Merritt; the shimmying guitars on ""Money in the Afterlife"" suggest the dance-rock quirks and pop romances of Vampire Weekend, BOAT, and the Brunettes. These great discrepancies of mood and genre slant are welcome as standalone pieces and contributions to the band's already hodgepodge oeuvre. So as a collection, the album is fitful and pleasantly disconcerting, a far cry even from July's Cold Colors EP, which was a wintry aperitif to this full-length's sweet, sultry, and dimly sentimental refreshments. Gone is the muddled production of SLGTM's accomplished singles collection Sound on Sound: here are close-set guitars, warm and furry vocals, and best of all, fully intelligible, wise and realistically poignant lyrics. ""When I Lose My Eyes"", with an accomplished melody of flits of speedy, echoic guitar, warm washes of sustains, and rhythmic twists, paints an actual scenario-- grounded, concrete, and heavy-- after a long instrumental intro. Thomas sings wistfully, ""Me and my best friend/ Sleep without any clothes/ With books on the bedspread/ In languages no one knows/ All the windows are open/ All of the low lights glow/ And we flood all the rooms of our homes/ 'til we float/ And wash out to the street down below."" The heady mix of plugging guitars in the left channel and powerful drums in the right soon gives way to a lighter two-step rhythm, string quartet, and more than a little hint of SLGTM's sometime collaborator Ted Leo, whose sheer single-handed guitar power is aptly appropriated here. The vocal-free exit, rife with thumping drum rushes and strummed monotony, pulls the song to a weighty vocal climax of soaring whines-- so the song is worth a whole paragraph. The rest of the album owes a lot to opener ""Apple"", which borrows more from the band's earliest influences, particularly the carefree narratives and expressive vocals of 1960s rock, which are here turned into a boldly romantic vocal swoon: ""I could fill up the room/ With these things/ I've been thinking about you."" It forces optimism about the rest of the album and recalls the sensitive, enveloping atmosphere of Menomena's latest, which took us on a retreat where rock songs could be bold and heartfelt missives. Later, indebtedness to Stuart Murdoch may nauseate some listeners on ""Peg"", but when paired with any other track on the album, Thomas' voice is easily understood as more expressive than one track allows-- each song gives a glimmer of the inflections he will give it elsewhere, as with the whiny, brassy yelps of the simple guitar-pop song ""Money in the Afterlife"". Some of the songs stutter and stumble, though they're actually the opposite, rhythmically speaking: The clap-happy ""Edison Girls"" is precise and danceable, but it drawls too heavily in Southern reflections by the electric guitar and Thomas' rhyming adorability is overdone. Betty Marie Barnes' one vocal contribution to this album is the disappointing ""Hands in the Snow"", a light, fluffy, precisely metered B&S tribute. Enveloping the handful of dull middle songs on the album is aching opener ""Apple"" and exit track ""Whitey Hands"", which experiments with a kind of homemade dulcimer, more organic hand claps, and Thomas' voice, which swoops and soars around a beautifully understated rhythm. It's yet more confirmation of this band's overstuffed toolbox-- confused, perhaps, but ultimately rewarding.","Pop-rock fusionists release their seventh full-length and first for K Records, harnessing the disparate lo-fi and 1960s rock influences they've explored in their career thus far.

As thrilling as most of Vitalic's recorded material is, it's not exactly nuanced. Given that Vitalic's best songs-- tracks like ""La Rock 01"", ""Poney"", and ""My Friend Dario""-- are quick-hit adrenaline rushes that build and crest with the dancefloor in mind, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that the best way to present them live is to turn the volume up and cordially step out of the way. Since Arbez doesn't have the technical aptitude or the layering sensibilities of your average techno DJ, nor the desire to mash up his tracks with anyone else's, that's pretty much exactly what he does. All things told, it's the right way to play it. Arbez might be crude, but if the reactions of the crowds I've seen him play to are anything to go by, he's definitely effective. A live album, though-- that's another thing entirely. Forgetting for a second that Vitalic has only one full-length record to its name and that the easy availability of free mp3 bootlegs of DJ sets has largely rendered the live electronic album a gratituous and pointless gesture, what in the world made anyone think that Vitalic's live show was interesting enough, purely as a listening experience, to warrant its own release? Well, it's not. While they might sound a bit brighter and pulse a little harder, there's ultimately nothing significantly improved about these songs on Live. If anything, this recording detracts from a lot of the material; for some inexplicable reason, Arbez has made the aesthetic decision to insert the audience's reactions high in the mix. The end effect is similar to watching a sitcom with canned laughter; each subtle shift in the audience's mood is so front and centre that you end up feeling like you're being prompted to respond in kind. (And the less said about the weirdly incongrous football chants that pop up from time to time, the better.) Of course, the sugar rush nature of Vitalic's best tracks mean there are some thrills to be had here; the goosebump-inducing buildup to ""La Rock 01"", for example, is one of those rare moments where Live works in spite of itself. Ultimately, though, as a listening experience, it's a tough sell. Without the communal feeling that comes from standing in a crowd of people and the visceral thrill that comes from having these songs blasted at you in the context of a physical space, what's the point? Your guess is as good as mine.","Despite one album to his name, the easy availability of free mp3 bootlegs of DJ sets, and the relatively greater rewards of mixes, Pascal Arbez has decided to issue a live CD.

In the time since, Kevin Barnes has embraced electro beats and glam-rock decadence, and Of Montreal have risen to that odd plateau of notoriety called ""indie famous."" I'll admit to being more ambivalent than most about the band's latest direction. While the Of Montreal of yore still traded in serpentine melodies and breakneck chord changes, their frenetic overstatement often served as a Wizard of Oz-style front for charming understatement. Of Montreal's new sound is more immediate and holistic, but part of me misses the bizarro tension of their older work. The funny thing is, listening to If He Is Protecting Our Nation now is leading me to a newfound appreciation for Of Montreal's more recent recordings. As an odds-and-ends collection of alternate versions, covers, and toss-offs originally released as a tour-only CD, Our Nation lays bare the limitations of the band's initial bag of tricks. For all of its kee-razy bells and whistles, the band's fractured indie pop wasn't all that versatile, and could be kind of unbelievably obnoxious when lacking in focus or direction. Opener ""My, What a Strange Day With a Swede"" is labyrinthine and hyperactive as expected, but lacks the strong melodic sensibility of Barnes' best work. In the absence of a memorable hook, the band's stylistic tics can be jarring. ""Inside a Room Full of Treasures a Black Pygmy Horse's Head Pops Up Like a Periscope"" (whew!) is a subpar example of the dramatic, carnivalesque compositions that Of Montreal perfected on Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies: A Variety of Whimsical Verse, though a reference to Cat Power's Chan Marshall at least makes for an awesome ""WTF?"" moment. And a ""beatnik"" version of Coquelicot's ""Mimi Merlot"" is little more than a half-minute goof. The sarcastic histrionics of ""There Is Nothing Wrong With Hating Rock Critics"" missed me the first time around, but it's actually one of the more entertaining songs on the album, simple in its construction and hilarious in its execution. ""Girl from NYC (Named Julia)"" builds from a solo acoustic intro to a satisfying full-band bridge, but the song itself is far from Barnes' best. Indeed, If He Is Protecting Our Nation betrays a much-of-muchness about Barnes' off-kilter melodic wizardry that never really surfaces on any of the band's proper full-lengths. Throughout Of Montreal's life as a band, Kevin Barnes has excelled at unconventionally catchy and cleverly constructed songwriting. Such songs don't write and arrange themselves, and even Of Montreal's most chaotic moments rarely come off as half-assed or unconsidered. Much of If He Is Protecting Our Nation, however, seems hopelessly underdeveloped, most songs happening upon a handful of good ideas but failing to follow through on them. Now on its second re-release, If He Is Protecting Our Nation is just as inessential as ever.",,5.3,
Hideout,Film School,by: Ian Cohen,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b32a9d034d5c69bf4c9c/1:1/w_160/e8c48f37.jpg,2007-10-30 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10824-hideout/,Beggars Banquet,"If you've got some electrical engineering experience and a desire to get rich quick, here's my advice: Invent the Loveless effects pedal. You could pretty much charge whatever you want for it; while a few button pushes at the Sam Ash are all that separate you from getting the tone of Dimebag Darrell or whoever the DOD Grunge module is supposed to emulate, would-be Kevin Shields still go on Creation-style spending sprees to get anywhere near his sound. You're guaranteed brand loyalty as well, if Hideout is any indication. With an almost charming defiance, Bay Area foursome Film School are long on whooshy, gliding guitar lines and short on a whole lot that can distinguish them from the dozens of bands doing the same exact thing. While they sometimes get lost on a walking tour of the greyer expanses of indie's past two decades, at the very least they sound like they have a map. I'd think that giving your record a pitch-perfect 4AD title like Hideout and hiring a bassist/sparingly used co-vocalist named Lorelei is evidence enough of that, but it extends to their instrumental approach as well. ""Lovesong""-ish single ""Two Kinds"" has hangdog open chords ringing in the key of dejection (I believe it's A minor) over downstroked bass riffs, while ""Compare"" combats the temptation to dismiss Film School on the count of crafting songs that would probably fall apart in an unplugged setting. Building from dot-matrix delay hits and a grainy drum track, it unfurls into clarion guitar sounds that recall the canyonesque outro to Tears For Fears' ""Shout"" by way of Interpol's ""Untitled"". Where Film School falters is in their sense of pacing. Opener ""Dear Me"" has a flat but emphatic vocal hook, but whatever bracing qualities it has gets lost over five minutes of clanging, formless chords. Over the span of Hideout, it's becomes a widespread issue of sequencing as well. Whenever Film School build momentum, it gets squandered on chorus pedal instrumentals as useless as your average blowjob skit and tracks that become pruned after soaking in pools of murky watercolors. ""Florida"" seems dingy, rainy, and boring, while it's hard to tell what's a worse foundation for ""Sick Hipster Nursed By Suicide Girl"", its title or its overly rigid melody. As indicated by their name, there's something overly academic and mannered about what Film School do. At the very least, it's managed to get them higher-profile opening slots with acts like the National and Silversun Pickups, but that's the problem: Film School seem suited for an ""opening band"" purgatory, professional enough to provide 30 minutes of milling-about music, but unlikely to ever steal thunder from groups divisive enough to be loved.","With an almost charming defiance, Bay Area foursome Film School are long on whooshy, gliding guitar lines and Kevin Shields impersonations.

Population,The Most Serene Republic,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b30fb1335d7bf169a52f/1:1/w_160/0e583425.jpg,2007-10-30 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10800-population/,Arts & Crafts,"In a tug-of-war match, the Most Serene Republic could give fellow Arts & Crafts-men Broken Social Scene a run for their money (and members), but the two are far from evenly matched in the studio. Although TMSR were the A&C label's first non-Broken Social Scene-related artists, the new collective is awfully similar to the old: Both blow up private bedroom ballads to marching band proportions and play up a revolving-door policy for vocalists, creating less an impression of an indie rock than a utopian commune town meeting. Clocking in at almost an hour-- and pulling out even more tricks and toys than TMSR's debut, Underwater Cinematographer-- Population shows growth in the sense of size, but not so much in quality. As unfair as the ""band nerd"" stereotype can be, the Most Serene Republic practically define it. While Broken Social Scene or Stars barely break a sweat on their mid-tempo rockers, tracks like ""Sherry and Her Butterfly Net"" or ""Solipsism Millionaires"" run themselves ragged, piling on mounds of stop/start verse breaks and vocal parts over melodies not strong enough to serve as a foundation. Luckily, Population's setbacks are occasionally overshadowed by its strengths: When its cerebral power is firing on all cylinders, a sleeping giant is nudged awake. Opener ""Humble Peasants"" almost single-handedly vindicates the criticism aimed at the band's plentiful instrumentation, using mostly wind and string instruments to evoke the orchestral, pastoral imagery of one of M83's digitized epics. Although the full band setup is fertile ground for life-affirming tunes, the Republic avoids easy heartstring-tugging on ""Battle Hymn of the Republic"" and ""Career in Shaping Clay"", two detached art-rock tracks that, like the Dismemberment Plan or early Les Savy Fav, serve up backhanded tributes to emo. Still, these few highlights can't redeem the fact that listening to Population feels like a war of attrition. Compared to similarly intricate albums like Caribou's Andorra or Sunset Rubdown's Random Spirit Lover, Population feels like a quadruple-stacked Big Mac instead of a four-course meal. Rather than cleverly weaving in and out of melody lines and utilizing diverse dynamics and rhythms, the Most Serene Republic cram distorted drum fills and brass leads into songs that lacks the ideas to justify the bombast.","Like Broken Social Scene, the Most Serene Republic blow up private bedroom ballads to marching band proportions and play up a revolving-door policy for vocalists.

In the Vines,Castanets,by: Brian Howe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b32e5e6ef959693223fc/1:1/w_160/55d95322.jpg,2007-10-30 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10828-in-the-vines/,Asthmatic Kitty,"Broadly defined, In the Vines is an indie-folk record. Indie-folk is a crowded genre, perhaps because of its accessibility-- a decent, appropriately weathered voice and a cheap acoustic guitar are all you really need to get started. The combination is so timeless that you can get by while skimping on songwriting bonafides and originality. Overachievers like Iron & Wine, Richard Buckner, and Smog wreck the grade curve, but say this for the second tier: Even the blandest autumnal fingerpicking makes for a comforting, off-handedly pleasant atmosphere. Ray Raposa's gothic Americana resides in an indistinct region between the stand-out stars and inoffensive also-rans of his genre. He's not a Bill Callahan-caliber lyricist, although he has his moments: ""So it's going to be sad and it's going to be long,"" he sings against the slinky, sinister riff of ""Rain Will Come"", ""and we already know the end of this song."" The lyric bundles up Raposa's definitive traits-- the reedy, hard-edged voice spitting terse omens; the obsession with death and departure and inevitability-- while sounding alluringly creepy in a veil of reverb. But if In the Vines isn't a record that impresses at the level of individual songs, neither is it something you throw on in the background and forget about. Try, and you'll be emphatically reminded: About halfway through the previously sparse ""Rain Will Come"", terrible peals of noise rip through the track and don't relent until it ends, as if the troubadour has wandered into a metal shop. The essential samey-ness of these loose, creeping country and blues tunes makes them negligible as units. This is an album's album, magnetic over the long haul, as Raposa's careful, nuanced tension between placidity and chaos accrues force. The songs tend to be anchored by percussively struck strings and Raposa's even-tempered, stealthy singing, but they're filled out to roiling-thunderhead proportions with soul-noir brass, E-bowed drones, boozy slide guitar, damaged blues licks, stilted mechanical percussion, and corroded free-jazz mutations. Careful songwriting touches abound: On ""Sounded Like a Train, Wasn't a Train"", an inexorable death-march, his voice bleeds into an echo effect that loops and fades, and the gotta-leave-this-town dirge ""The Night Is When You Can Not See"" is enlivened by trills of barrelhouse piano. Booming, vaguely ceremonial drums spruces up ""Strong Animal"", which employs an obscurely troubling woman-as-beast metaphor remindful of Smog's ""I Break Horses"". Between the compass-less drones and convulsive rackets are plenty of respites, sometimes whole songs of them: ""This is the Early Game"" is a weary trail song with languid brushed percussion, and ""Westbound, Blue"" is trad-friendly blues about longing for the country from the confines of the city. The strongest sense that attends Castanets' music is of stasis-- the arrangements are plodding and often inert, and they vary only in their finest details from song to song or album to album. This stasis dovetails perfectly with Raposa's lyrics, where departure, not destination, is always the point, yet always unattainable.","Ray Raposa's gothic Americana remains obsessed with death and departure and inevitability on his latest Asthmatic Kitty release.

I'm Not There OST,Various Artists,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3395e6ef95969322412/1:1/w_160/788ed270.jpg,2007-10-30 06:00:01,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10841-im-not-there-ost/,Sony,"I'm Not There is director Todd Haynes' third music biopic, after Superstar in 1987 and Velvet Goldmine in 1998. In each of those films, the main subject-- the celebrity at the center-- has been altered or is somehow absent: Superstar recounted Karen Carpenter's death from anorexia with only Barbie dolls, which continually prevents it from being officially released. The Velvet Goldmine traces David Bowie's rise and fall throughout the 1970s, but the singer threatened to sue and refused to license his songs. So Haynes took even more liberties with the story, which involved aliens, assassins, and an ongoing affair with Iggy Pop. By all accounts, I'm Not There, his new film about Bob Dylan,continues this sort of meaningful absence, casting six actors to play the folk singer in various stages of his life and career (essentially the same thing), and literalizing the mercurial nature of his identity. Likewise, the soundtrack for I'm Not There casts 29 singers to re-create that singular voice in all its permutations and variations, with surprising results. Dylan and his music have become so ingrained in American pop culture that it's easy to forget what a weirdo he was, personally and musically. Drawing from a folkie predilection for overstatement, he wrote tons of verses per song, in oblique and impenetrable metaphors, words collapsing upon words, barbed with inside jokes, private accusations, and masked characters. He sang these songs in a nasal voice that became more and more of a defense mechanism as the years went on, suggesting a self-conscious lapse into self-parody. Culling songs from his legendary albums as well as from obscure bootlegs, I'm Not There covers nearly every fabled aspect of his career: his earnest folkie beginnings, his electric post-Newport days, his conversion to Christianity, his 80s nadir, and finally, his current status as an eccentric éminence grise. In taking such a broad sampling of songs, I'm Not There persuasively argues that each phase is as important and potentially rewarding as any other. Because Dylan wrote such dense and distinctive songs, covering his work necessarily involves as much impersonation as interpretation. In fact, the best songs on I'm Not There are the ones where the artists seem to be having a great time being Bob. Chan Marshall mimics his cadences on ""Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again"", and her pronunciation of the world ""mama"" is one of the album's best moments. Craig Finn sings ""Won't You Please Crawl Out Your Window?"" with a chuckle in his voice, as the Hold Steady relocate the song to the Minneapolis streets of Separation Sunday. And Stephen Malkmus, who gets a whopping three tracks, gives some of his best and weirdest performances since going solo. The cast of I'm Not There is admirably diverse, mixing relative newcomers like Karen O and Mason Jennings with veterans like Willie Nelson, whose despairing ""Senor (Tales of Yankee Power)"", from 1978's Street Legal, is a good argument for a full-length collaboration with Calexico. Roger McGuinn's voice has aged considerably over the years, but he sounds both surefooted and surprisingly tender on ""One More Cup of Coffee"", another perfect match with Calexico. And Richie Havens' uniquely jumpy energy jolts ""Tombstone Blues"", surpassing mere imitation and ratcheting up its wordy tension. Perhaps it's a testament to the potency of his peculiarities-- rather than to the strength of his convictions-- that Dylan's songs are so successfully coverable in so many different styles. They're challenging undertakings, but possible, inspiring varying degrees adventurousness in some artists and reverence in others. Despite a stellar backing band (including members of Sonic Youth and Television), Eddie Vedder's ""All Along the Watchtower"" sounds just like every other version of the song and Mason Jennings can't do anything with the iconic ""The Times They Are a'Changin'"" other than render it faithfully. It's a crazy, mixed-up world, though, when Jack Johnson's medley of ""Mama, You've Been on My Mind/A Fraction of Last Thoughts on Woody Guthrie"" has more smarts and soul than Sufjan Stevens' ""Ring Them Bells"", which begins as a fairly uninspired cover but sails off into a tediously overwritten coda that strains patience and good will. But that's really the only truly objectionable track on this long album, which sounds much better on your stereo than it did on paper. With so many different types of musicians contributing to these 34 songs, I'm Not There could have turned out like so many inconsistent and forgettable tribute soundtracks-- listened to once or twice, then shelved for eternity-- but instead it plays like a real album, focused on the music and leaving the myth to the movie.","The soundtrack to Todd Haynes' unorthodox Bob Dylan biopic casts more than two dozen artists-- including Stephen Malkmus, Sufjan Stevens, Jeff Tweedy, Cat Power, Sonic Youth, and Yo La Tengo, among many others-- to re-create the singer's singular voice in all its permutations and variations.

Anthology,Can,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a112b1335d7bf1698178/1:1/w_160/f8e601b7.jpg,2007-10-30 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10844-anthology/,Mute,"Can's music is all around you, even if you've never actually heard it. The band has had such a deep impact on rock and experimental music that it's impossible not to have heard something that bears its fingerprints. Can were as unlikely as they were influential: Holger Czukay and Irmin Schmidt, both students of early electronic and serial composer Karlheinz Stockhausen, and the latter an associate of Fluxus musicians LaMonte Young and Terry Riley; Jaki Liebezeit, a drummer who'd made the rounds of Europe's free jazz scene; and Michael Karoli, a young guitarist who happened to be a student of Czukay. These four musicians would remain the core of Can for most of the band's life. It doesn't look like a recipe for a rock group, but that's probably why the music they made was so unprecedented. Aside from Stockhausen, their influences ranged from ethnic field recordings to jazz to the elemental funk of James Brown to Frank Zappa, Jimi Hendrix, the Velvet Underground, and Pink Floyd. They made free improvisation and tape editing their basis for composing, building songs around Liebezeit's repetitive, driving percussion parts, which allowed the other members plenty of room to roam without getting lost. It was intellectual but funky-- serious music that was also fun and interesting. Though they'd initially intended to make ethnic music a central part of the band's sound, the members found themselves more and more taken by psychedelia and quickly came to sound more like a true rock band. They recruited African-American sculptor Malcolm Mooney to handle vocals. As a singer, Mooney was a decided amateur, but he was intensely creative and totally unshackled by any conventional sense of what a rock vocalist was supposed to do. His most inspired performances bordered on psychotic, emphasizing rhythm and interacting with the instruments as though he were one of them. Mooney's time with the band was limited-- he was only a member from 1968 to 1969 and again for a brief period during a late 1980s reunion-- but he still made a lot of recordings with them, and he features heavily on Anthology. The quintet recorded its first album, Prepared to Meet Thy PNOOM, in 1968, but it was flatly rejected by every record label they approached, so they returned to the studio, recording with a very basic two-track setup, and produced Monster Movie, which became their debut in 1969 (PNOOM finally came out in 1981 under the title Delay 1968). Three of Monster Movie's four tracks appear here on the first disc, sounding as fresh and ferocious as ever. The Velvet Underground-inspired ""Father Cannot Yell"" was the first Can song, and it features Mooney's motor-mouthed, rhythmic vocal low in the mix, with Czukay's bass right next to it. ""Outside My Door"" is ripped open by distorted bells, and the 20-minute ""Yoo Doo Right"", edited down from an hours-long jam, points toward the stripped-down future funk that characterized Can's classic early-70s output. Mooney wasn't part of that lineup. His instability was part of what made him great, but it was also what made him leave the band and return to the U.S. on the advice of a psychiatrist in 1969. In search of a new vocalist, the band found Japanese wanderer Damo Suzuki busking outside a café and invited him to join. He performed with them the same night and proved to be a perfect fit. Lyrics had always been secondary to the sound of the voice in Can's music, but Suzuki took this to a new level, often reducing his vocals to the most apt syllable for the moment. He joins the funky crunch of ""Halleluwah"", from 1971's masterful double LP Tago Mago, with a series of rhythmic ""da da""s, and it's impossible to imagine anyone singing anything else over it. ""Halleluwah"" is one of the songs that benefits most from the superb remastering treatment given to all of Can's output in the last couple of years. The song's militaristic drum pattern and staccato bass line hit like a hammer now, and the mix on every song is exceptionally clear, with none of the hiss and murkiness that plagued early CD issues of Can's albums. The band continued to develop its bracing, improvisatory style on Tago Mago, 1972's Ege Bamyasi and 1973's Future Days, piecing together its albums from edits of massive jam sessions in much the same way that Miles Davis and Teo Macero pieced together Bitches Brew and On the Corner at roughly the same time. Each of those albums is well-represented on Anthology, though ""Vitamin C"" or ""Sing Swan Song"" would've made a better, more representative selection from Ege Bamyasi than the short edit of the chaotic ""Soup"" that appears here. (EB's ""Spoon"", one of Can's most accessible songs, is included.) Oddly, the two tracks from Future Days are sequenced in the middle of the second disc. ""Moonshake"" is perhaps the most prototypical example of the minimal, rhythmic style that came to be called motorik, with its metronomic drum pulse and guitar parts that obediently serve the rhythm. The lack of chronological sequencing is likely due to the fact that so many of Can's best songs are quite long, often stretching past 15 minutes, but it also means that any listener who starts here will have a tough time hearing their progression from album to album. Suzuki left the band in early 1974 after getting married and becoming a Jehovah's Witness, and the remaining members were unable to find a suitable replacement. Schmidt and Karoli assumed vocal duties for 1974's underrated Soon Over Babaluma, only represented here by the spooky, methodically rhythmic ""Dizzy Dizzy"", which features Karoli's gypsy-ish violin part. Soon is a complex, melodic, and strange record that deserves a higher standing in the band's catalog, and it also effectively marks the end of the band's classic period. That isn't to say they didn't make good music afterward, but nothing they recorded had the sheer innovative and primal power of their first six years of work. Apart from the two Future Days tracks, the second disc focuses on the band's late output and early outtakes, with one track from Delay 1968 and a fairly absurd five selections from Unlimited Edition, a compilation of previously unreleased tracks from 1968-1975 that, while full of interesting material featuring both Mooney and Suzuki, is really a fans-only release. What the second disc does do with its 17 tracks is convey a good idea of the wide range of styles Can covered. Delay's early Mooney track ""Uphill"" is a chugging, intense song covered in spastic fuzz guitar and one of the punkest things they ever did, while ""I Want More"", from 1976's Flow Motion, is post-punk before punk even happened, anticipating the keyboard-driven new wave of the Human League and the dancefloor-friendly sound of A Certain Ratio. It even became an international hit. Former Traffic members Rosko Gee and Rebop Kwaku Bah joined the band for its final two albums, 1977's Saw Delight and 1978's Can. Gee took over the bass duties from Czukay, who focused on sound effects, noise generators and shortwave radio on Saw Delight and finally left the band over personal disagreements that descended to a true low when band members began unplugging each other on stage. The self-titled album would be their last. There is some interesting music on these albums, which feature a combination of frenetic percussion and slow, ambient textures that still sounds somewhat unique-- even when they weren't at their best, Can were capable of breaking new ground. The band's last hurrah came a full 10 years later, when the original quintet lineup reunited for Rite Time, an album that has an interesting sonic character-- the way the backing vocals are layered and compressed, for example, is neat-- but you have to be a die-hard fan to get too far into this stuff. Certain artists are represented just fine by their most-loved songs, but Can isn't one of them. A 2xCD career anthology does a good job of presenting Can's astounding versatility, but it's best to hear the full albums, and if you like the first disc of Anthology, you'll want to get all of them.",,8.8,
"With My Left Hand, I Raise the Dead",Doveman,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2ffb1335d7bf169a50f/1:1/w_160/fdf63028.jpg,2007-10-29 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10786-with-my-left-hand-i-raise-the-dead/,Brassland,"The second album by Doveman (aka Thomas Bartlett) is just as hushed in tone as his debut, but instead of coming off as lush or opulent, he now sounds terse, minimal, and even cagey-- There's nothing that's ""easy"" listening about With My Left Hand, I Raise the Dead. The layered drone of ""The Sunken Queen"" opens, only adding a few idle plucks of banjo and barely scratching the drums while Bartlett whispers deliberately over the hum of organ. Minutes later, we get a drumbeat, and the song drags its dying husk towards some sort of release, like an exhausted full-band blowout following a rave-up we never got to hear. Fans probably expect it by now, but all the songs are driven by the sparse, intermittent piano and whisper of Bartlett, over which his other players always tread gingerly. There are a number of untitled instrumental interludes here, almost as many as there are proper tracks. Some of these nameless sections might be even more rewarding than the songs, like when the weightless piano dirge of ""Tender Mercies"" bumps against the chilly wails of the fourth track. The latter then offers an apt buildup and a striking juxtaposition against the deliberate picking of ""Sunrise"", a song with a delivery so precious it might break to pieces if one were to blow on it hard enough. From near-industrial drones to reverberating keyboards to incompetent blues and fake rain, there are many unexpected textures on the record, none of which threaten to raise their voice any louder than Bartlett's. Some listeners may tire of the relentlessly mannered songs, but Bartlett is a strong enough performer to carry it-- or at least, he keeps everyone on his own muted level. It's just a shame there are so many interesting and unpredictable textures in the interludes, while the songs are all rather uniform in tone and instrumentation. In that way, With My Left Hand seems like decent EP or short album alternated with a lot of atmospheric-- if well done-- in-studio navel-gazing. Bartlett seems to want to play with texture as much as he wants to write a melody, though the ""real"" songs rarely reflect this. ""Tender Mercies"" does so only because it splits the difference, with Bartlett's piano and voice only coming around the two-minute mark, preceded by intermittently struck keyboards, drums that barely keep time, and banjo that ever-so-carefully creeps up to outlining a melodic theme. A pared-down remake of ""Chasing Clouds"", from Doveman's debut The Acrobat, is as concrete as things get, with a 4/4 strum and a horn part that actually provides a sort of counter-melody, and even some strings at the song's close. It's a track with not just atmosphere, but purpose, a sense of direction. But its late appearance on the record is simply leading up to ""Ghost"", the clear centerpiece of the record. It's a sharply melodic song, with a curveball B-section that's one of the album most memorable moments. Still, while it's worthy of the buildup, it requires some endurance to make it this far. The later songs on the record are more varied, and often stronger: ""Fireworks"" adds additional instrumentation and a little bit of volume, and ""Happy"", especially, applies all the lessons of the interludes to a layered and immersive ballad. The background track for ""Secrets"" is dazzling, mixing the glistening scrape and pluck of strings into a watery, late-night-by-the-lake feel. Unfortunately, increased texture in the latter part of the record does nothing to change the tone of the songs. With My Left Hand is certainly carefully sequenced and meant to be listed to as a whole, brave enough not to frontload its best tracks in favor of bringing the listener on a sort of journey as the record floats in and out like a fog. As to whether it all holds together...well, yes, if you're patient. But the payoff is ultimately slight.","Second album by Thomas Bartlett builds on the hushed melancholy of his debut, but also shows an increased interest in texture, as proper songs alternate with varied instrumental interludes.

Necessary Evil,Debbie Harry,by: Sara Sherr,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2fa13d197565213a87b/1:1/w_160/fdf63028.jpg,2007-10-29 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10780-necessary-evil/,Eleven Seven,"Deborah Harry was the quintessential punk frontwoman: platinum out front, jet black in the back, wit as sharp as her cheekbones, strong enough for CBGB's bathrooms, yet gentle enough to hang with the Muppets. Without her, there'd be no Madonna, Gwen, or Lily Allen, and the Misshapes kids wouldn't know how to pout in pictures. As iconic as she was fronting Blondie, her solo work has never been as consistent. Instead of albums, Harry's best moments often come in singles, soundtracks, or cameos, such as her cover of the Castaways' ""Liar Liar"", from Married to the Mob, ""Rush Rush"", from Scarface, or mugging with Iggy Pop on ""Did You Evah"", from the Cole Porter tribute album Red Hot + Blue. And that's the key: Harry works best as a collaborator. But sometimes, even the best collaborators aren't always the right ones, like the Nile Rogers-produced Koo Koo that strangely fell flat. Necessary Evil, her first solo album in 14 years, sets up an interesting scenario: it's Harry's three-decade musical journey through punk, dance, hip-hop, world music, and jazz, as well as offering a rare perspective from a non-Botoxed, 63-year-old woman in the rock world. The Rolling Stones will be singing about sweet young things when they're 100, but when Liz Phair dared to broach the topic of sex as a late-30s divorced mom, her former fanboys cried foul. (That the songs themselves weren't all that great is another matter). But Harry's not your mom's mom. The fiercely independent, still-single Harry approaches themes of love and intimacy as sources of strength and weakness, and when she reveals her rarely seen vulnerable side, it's an act of bravery. ""Two Times Blue"", the soaring first single, cheekily says it all, ""Well maybe, I could've been better. Yeah, maybe I've been kind of bad."" The bulk of the songs, co-written and produced by New York City production team Super Buddha (Scissor Sisters, Rufus Wainwright), are in the dance-rock template of Blondie's ""Atomic"", with some soft-focus acoustic numbers and string-drenched ballads like ""What Is Love"" and ""If I Had You"". Like ""Rapture"" and Fab Five Freddy, there's another tribute to a rapper, a celebration of Lil' Kim on ""Dirty and Deep"". In ""Charm Alarm"", a duet with the Toilet Boys' Guy Furrow, Harry refers to him as ""a dainty jewel hooked on a chain, a souvenir of some other time,"" but she could be talking about herself. Harry's voice has improved with age, dropping to a lower, huskier tone that's both menacing and sexy. It's not until the last few tracks that Harry finds her best collaborator-- naturally, it's former Blondie bandmate and paramour Chris Stein-- on the hypnotic groove of ""Jen Jen"", which loops an African work chant, and ""Naked Eye"", which uses tattoos as metaphors for romantic histories. ""Your ink can't rub off on me, but yet you mark me easily,"" she sings over tribal drums and Middle Eastern guitar lines. Necessary Evil's chilling closer is ""Paradise"", a seemingly gentle ballad backed by the Jazz Passengers' Roy Nathanson and Bill Ware, where Harry ethereally meditates on a suicide bomber's last thoughts of ecstasy. It's here, on this quiet song about a troubling subject, that Harry finally finds her place.","On her first solo album in more than a decade, Blondie's iconic frontwoman offers rare perspective from a 63-year-old woman in the rock world.

Environ Maiden,The Capstan Shafts,by: Matt LeMay,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2fdea9e61561daa6a02/1:1/w_160/d5d803f9.jpg,2007-10-29 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10784-environ-maiden/,Rainbow Quartz,"Up until very recently, Dean Wells was something of a mystery. Having released six shockingly consistent home-recorded full-lengths as the Capstan Shafts, Wells had yet to play a single live show, release a photograph of himself, or even maintain his own MySpace page. Was he a crazy recluse? Hideously disfigured? Cthulhu? For all the speculation among a small cabal of internet nerds (myself, admittedly, included), it turns out there was never really any mystery at all. Chalk it up to the inherent strangeness of the information age-- a musician like Wells only seems enigmatic and suspect at a time when access to an artist's personal information is considered a god-given right, and many bands seem more interested in online self-promotion than writing songs. It's sad that this should mark him as such an anachronism, but Wells is a true pop craftsman, working regularly and diligently on his music and not particularly concerned with the trappings of self-promotion. No wonder his songs are among the best being written today. While Environ Maiden will likely be Wells' entry into the world of indie rock at large, the album itself reflects no such change. Largely comprised of older tracks (including some from 2006's The Megafauna Undermined), Environ Maiden is firmly in keeping with Wells' tradition of excellent, prolific, and understated indie pop. While not quite as stunning as 2006's Euridice Proudhon or the more recent Her vs. the Sad Cold Eventually, Environ Maiden makes a strong case for the louder and scrappier side of Wells' recorded output. Perhaps the most striking difference between Environ Maiden and its predecessors is its length; Environ Maiden consists of 29 short, fuzzed-out and hook-filled songs, and is the only Capstan Shafts albums to clock in at over 35 minutes. And while nothing on the album reeks of filler, this quantity of homespun recordings can be daunting. Thankfully, Wells opens Environ Mainden on its most promising and inviting note; opener ""Right on the Malthus"" is likely the strongest track on the album, and one of Wells' most fully realized songs to date. ""Sincere as a Windchime"" uncannily recreates the acoustic guitar sound from the Guided by Voices fave ""Awful Bliss"" to great effect. And the jaunty ""The Origin of Rain"" touches on a shocking number of hooks in its scant 34 seconds. Other songs require a bit more effort to parse: ""Flip Cup Casualties"" initially comes off as flat and half-assed, but reveals a handful of surprisingly catchy moments on repeat listen. There is a much of muchness to Environ Maiden's sound by the time you get 15 or 20 songs in, but the latter part of the record is not without its gems. ""The Ballad of Kid Butane"", ""The Complete History of Greenland"", and ""Drop Dead Innocuous"", which Wells played in sequence at his first ever live show, make for a particularly action-packed three-and-a-half minutes. Album closer ""Northern Me!"" shows Wells growing substantially as an arranger, and is host to what could be his most expressive vocal performance yet. Lyrically, Environ Maiden continues to establish Wells as one of indie pop's best writers. Across the board, Wells' lyrics are characteristically clever, self-effacing, morally ambiguous, and slyly suggestive. Opener ""Right on the Malthus"" describes a patch of sky as viewed over a girl's shoulder: ""The natural place for the sky to rest/ Is her left shoulder just above the breast/ And below her earlobe that insists on being chewed/ By someone who never should've got their teeth into you."" The line between clever romantic observation and simpering romantic cliché is a fine one, and Wells continues to navigate it masterfully, approaching his subjects with wit and insight but never sabotaging himself with sarcasm or ironic distance. At first, I was disappointed that Wells wasn't using Environ Maiden and the wider exposure it seems set to give him as a chance to showcase the best songs in his repertoire, as Guided by Voices had done with Propeller. But therein lies one of the greatest differences between Pollard and Wells; whereas Pollard always sported a ""fuck-you-I'm-gonna-be-famous"" attitude, Wells seems much more interested in the process of recording than in its potential rewards. Indeed, with a solid seven albums under his belt, Wells is forging a stylistic niche that goes far beyond his well-documented GbV fetish. Whether he sticks with the solo 4-track approach or finds a band and a studio, his songs will always sound like Capstan Shafts songs. And, if his output thus far is any indication, they'll always be pretty damned good.","The long-mysterious and beloved Dean Wells prepares for his close-up by stepping into the world of live performance and issuing another record of understated Guided by Voices-like indie pop.

Likeness,Charalambides,by: Matthew Murphy,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3385e6ef95969322410/1:1/w_160/fdf63028.jpg,2007-10-29 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10840-likeness/,Kranky,"Likeness, the latest album from the stalwart Charalambides duo of Tom and Christina Carter, serves as a handy illustration of the conundrum that eventually catches up with such hyper-prolific acts. With a history that now spans 16 years and somewhere upwards of 20 full-length releases, Charalambides have long since reached the stage where every new recording must be first considered as an addition to their larger body of work, rather than as the separate universe unto itself that each album seems designed to be. As with the bulk of the duo's previous work, Likeness strikes a savvy balance between tradition-based songcraft and open-ended psych-folk expression, with the basic tracks spontaneously composed in the studio and later augmented with layers of spectral overdubs. And, as per usual, the album appears during what has been yet another busy season for the duo, with Christina appearing on Thurston Moore's Trees Outside the Academy, and Tom fresh off various collaborations with the like-minded Robert Horton, Michael Shannon, and Christian Kiefer. These abundant projects have each served to advance the duo's brilliant and largely unparalleled trajectory across the American underground. But they have also found the Carters traveling musical and spiritual territory that they've already criss-crossed time and again, whether under the Charalambides name or their own. As a result, Likeness too often finds itself occupying a nettlesome middle ground that will likely prove too alien for newcomers, and too familiar for longtime fans. The primary twist in Charalambides' strategy for Likeness is that the album's lyrics are largely derived from the traditional, public domain American songbook of the 19th and early 20th centuries. (It's the same strategy, incidentally, that has also served Jackie-O Motherfucker well on such recent albums as Flags of the Sacred Harp.) Since lyrics have rarely been particularly central to Charalambides' music, this makes for a subtle but intriguing variation, especially in contrast to Christina's frequently wordless vocalizing on past works such as 2003's Unknown Spin or 2004's Joy Shapes. Hence, on such tracks as the opening ""Uncloudy Day"" or ""Saddle Up My Pony"", familiar and/or evocative lines like ""Saddle up my black mare/ Gonna find me a fair shake/ In this world somewhere"" bubble up through the ether like half-buried memories. Christina is in marvelously clear voice throughout, and is particularly effective on the melodic, multi-tracked plea ""Do You See?"" and the relatively straightforward electric blues of ""The Good Life."" Meanwhile, Tom's guitar frequently takes on a darker, harsher tone than is his usual, and his playing on the hard-driven ""Saddle Up My Pony"" skirts close enough to VU-inspired rock that one can't help but wish they had taken the final leap and added a full rhythm section. Elsewhere, the Charalambides' many virtues are unable to overcome what can seem dull and directionless material. The plodding ""Uncloudy Day"" sets the traditional hymn's words across a pair of repetitively lapping chords, as Tom's guitar searches fruitlessly for further entry into the song's melodic tides. Likewise, the overlong epic ""Memory Takes Hold"" sluggishly drifts apart in a manner that is neither as immediate as the warm psych-country of last year's A Vintage Burden nor as sublime and transformative as Joy Shapes. Throughout the album, Christina has reconfigured traditional lyrics into inspiring, if rather abstract, protest songs. Yet this quiet activism can seem somewhat superfluous for a group whose very existence has always cast them as an oppositional force, one with a true counter-cultural spirit to which Likeness provides another interesting chapter but too few plot twists to truly succeed as a stand-alone volume.","Tom and Christina Carter's latest album strikes a savvy balance between tradition-based songcraft and open-ended psych-folk expression.

Unknown Pleasures / Closer / Still,Joy Division,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929a1859d034d5c69bf29a4/1:1/w_160/d8401b8a.jpg,2007-10-29 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11624-unknown-pleasurescloserstill/,FactoryFactory,"Rock history is jammed with messy, stupid, and tragic ends to promising starts-- plane crashes, overdoses, gunshots-- but Ian Curtis' death is still striking. Sometime early on the morning of May 18, 1980, Ian Curtis, at the age of 23, watched Werner Herzog's Stroszek, played Iggy Pop's The Idiot, and hung himself in the kitchen. It's easy to say, in retrospect, that people should have seen it coming. His marriage was falling apart, his epilesy was worsening, and at their most uplifting, his band's lyrics set new benchmarks for melodrama, paranoia, and depression. ""This is the way, step inside,"" intones Curtis at the start of the group's posthumous sophomore release Closer, an album title whose double meaning imparts almost as much menace as the fact that Curtis already sounds like he's singing from beyond the grave on the sepulchral lead track ""Atrocity Exhibition"". On the other hand, Joy Division's popularity was on the rise. The group was about to embark on a U.S. tour with the Buzzcocks. A month after Curtis' death, ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" would become the group's first hit. And unlike such dead-before-their-time predecessors as Nick Drake and Chris Bell, Ian Curtis was a bona fide star in the making whose impact was already being felt throughout the underground, and whose presence was being picked up on by such prescient mimics as Bono. ( ""A Day Without Me"", a single from U2's 1980 LP Boy, was allegedly inspired by Curtis' suicide.) And then there's the music, a conflation of tribal primitivism and sophisticated art-rock that set the template for those twin poles of post-punk. A lot of credit goes to eccentric producer Martin Hannett, and it's the production-- not Curtis's well-parsed words or the band's suddenly ubiquitous biopic cachet-- that benefits most extensively from cleaned-up deluxe reissues of the band's two utterly essential albums, Unknown Pleasures and Closer. Simply put, the group's debut full-length Unknown Pleasures, released in 1979, sounds like little that came before it. At its most familiar, it vaguely approximates the cold claustrophobia of Iggy's The Idiot or David Bowie's Low, but from the first notes of ""Disorder"" on, the music is almost as alien as its iconic cover art. It's one of the most perfect pairings of artist and producer in rock history, but that shouldn't undersell the band's input. Joy Division, like many of their Manchester peers, were inspired by the DIY anti-ethos of the Sex Pistols; they just didn't know what to do with it at first. So, shaped and prodded by notorious provocateur Hannett (who would turn the heat in the studio down low enough for everyone to see their breath), the group embraced space, ambience, and an imposing austerity. It's noteworthy how many songs on Unknown Pleasures fade in like something emerging from the shadows. It's also worth noting how heavy songs such as ""Day of the Lords"", ""New Dawn Fades"", ""Shadowplay"", and ""Interzone"" are, while sinewy anthem ""Disorder"" and the discordant anti-funk of ""She's Lost Control"" are glorious anomalies in both their precision and concision. Closer is even more austere, more claustrophobic, more inventive, more beautiful, and more haunting than its predecessor. It's also Joy Division's start-to-finish masterpiece, a flawless encapsulation of everything the group sought to achieve. The hypnotically abrasive ""Atrocity Exhibition"" leads to the relentless yet somehow still economical ""Isolation"", the group more capable in its playing and confident in the arrangements. The dirge ""Passover"" implies that the band is every bit aware of its morbid power, while ""Colony"" marks a return to the heavy riffage of Unknown Pleasures. Then, after such an auspicious start, Closer really clicks into gear. ""Means to an End"" is death disco before the fact, buoyed by a surprisingly rousing (and wordless) chorus. ""Heart and Soul"" is a remarkable collision of atmosphere and minimalism, the stuttering drum beat, synth and Peter Hook's melodic bass lead linked to one of Curtis' most subdued performances. ""Heart and soul,"" he sings, as the stark instruments intertwine and twist together. ""One will burn."" ""Twenty Four Hours"" briefly tries to pry free from the album's looming inevitability before ""The Eternal"" and ""Decades"" draw the music back down and the listener back in to Curtis' world. ""The Eternal"" is the bleakest thing the band ever recorded, and if ""Decades"" comes off a relative respite in comparison, the lyrics quickly quash that idea. ""We knocked on the doors of Hell's darker chamber,"" moans Curtis. ""Pushed to the limit, we dragged ourselves in."" The re-release of the collection Still is a little more frustrating, especially considering the singles collection Substance-- the only single disc on which you can find ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"", ""Atmosphere"", ""Transmission"", as well as several early tracks, some of Joy Division's most beautiful and brutal work-- is not included in this slate of reissues. (Perhaps the assumption is that older fans already have the awesomely comprehensive Heart and Soul box.) Still, originally released in 1981, a month before the surviving Joy Division members issued their first New Order album, Movement, is a ragged, enigmatic coda, an uneven odds-and-ends collection of lost tracks that fills in some gaps in Joy Division's history and legacy. Yet for a band that recorded so little, it's hard to quibble with the availability of more, especially when that means such songs as the actually uptempo ""Ice Age"", ""The Kill"", ""Glass"" (B-side to ""Digital""), the metallic ""The Sound of Music"", and the immortal ""Dead Souls"". The rest of Still is Joy Division live, for better and for worse-- captured mostly at the group's final appearance in Birmingham High Hall. Most notable is the presence of ""Ceremony"", eventually issued as New Order's first single. As tempting as it may be to project parallels with Joy Division's near-future incarnation as New Order, they're really not there, at least not beyond the most vague and nascent of stylistic precursors. As the band progresses, more synths make their way into the soundscape, and Peter Hook's bass creeps higher and higher, but there's otherwise little from Joy Division that ports over to New Order (though in a pinch, ""Decades"", which concludes Closer, could be the missing link between Power, Corruption and Lies and a track like ""Elegia"" from Low-Life). In true ""deluxe"" fashion, each of these reissues is packaged with live disc that, while hardly pristine recordings, serve an important purpose. In fact, the furious sets documented-- 7/13/79, 2/8/80, 2/20/80-- prove that, free from the constraints but also the polish of the studio, Joy Division could be a decidedly aggressive beast. In these recordings, their chilly veneer melted away with visceral guitar slashing, Hook's no-nonsense bass, and Stephen Morris' spastic drums. The group also proves itself ruthlessly effective despite the conspicuous lack of proficiency. In the studio, Joy Division and Hannett could meticulously craft the album, note by note. Live and unleashed, they were undeniably powerful-- especially Curtis, whose Mancunian Jim Morrison croon fills each respective hall with foreboding-- but also pretty sloppy (it's no wonder the surviving members of the band later hitched themselves to drum machines and sequencers). Yet the live sets are vital reminders that these purveyors of almost indomitable gloom were also human. Lest one forget, these were just young men caught up in the excitement of punk. They covered ""Sister Ray"" and ""Louie Louie"". They tried out then-new songs and trotted out staples for their growing legion of fans. They were making it up as they went along, and to an extent, still are. Only Curtis knows how the story really ends, and he's not talking.","Tied to a film-related renewed interest in the band, Joy Division's three formative, formidable works get cleaned up and reissued in deluxe form.

Misbegotten Man,People,by: Aaron Leitko,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2fbea9e61561daa69fe/1:1/w_160/01e2ca44.jpg,2007-10-26 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10781-misbegotten-man/,I and Ear,"Dense, informed, and academic, Misbegotten Man, the sophomore record by Brooklyn's People, is sort of the indie-rock equivalent of a senior thesis paper. And it's about that monotonous. The carefully scripted chaos of guitarist/vocalist Mary Halvorson and drummer Kevin Shea might be an excellent representation of accumulated knowledge, originality, and creative thinking, but listening to the album all the way through can be an exercise in patience more arduous than trying to read Jacques Derrida during an earthquake. Album opener ""Urban Fable # 1: The Accidental Ruin of a Romantic Populist"" pretty much sets out the syllabus for the entire record. Halverson picks out slanted David Grubbs-style atonal guitar patterns and croons quavering melodies that expertly oscillate in and out of pitch. Meanwhile, Shea's technical yet schizoid drumming spills all over the song like an upended drawer of pots and pans, recalling his work as a member of wobbly non-free-jazz-pioneers Storm and Stress. The rest of the song finds the duo sprinting through a series sharp dynamic twists and turns, shifting from quietly warped melodies to spastic breakdowns every 30 seconds. There's nothing wrong with some stumbling Raincoats meets Art Bears-style avant-weirdness, but every song on Misbegotten Man-- from ""Biomimicry of the Social Body"" to ""The Phantasmagoric Energetics of Our 4-Legged Forbears""-- is cut from this same ragged cloth. Each shambling composition squats around the same tempo and follows a similar predictably unpredictable structure. After a few songs, Shea's ADD drumming even loses its punch, as one clattering syncopation becomes indiscernible from the next. The lyrics are where People come off at their most textbook-driven and tedious. ""And genetic cues rebut proximal answers/ Despite the partisan dialects inscribed on our DNA,"" sings Halverson on ""Eyeball Balls Reporting Faster than the Speed of Sounds"". Generally penned by Shea, People's words are harder to decipher than a page from Marlon Brando's diary at the turn of the 1980s. It's difficult to put a verse like ""Fixed entropy on the surface bolsters nationalism like a frozen fantasy"" to even the most malleable music, and at their most laborious moments, People sound like an economics professor lecturing on top of a James ""Blood"" Ulmer record. But you can't dismiss People just because they're weird. The duo's quirks give them a unique and mischievous identity that's more interesting than, say, your average group of eyeliner-sporting three-chord lookers. After a few listens you may even find yourself empathizing with People in their plight as intellectual musicians operating in a medium that usually thrives on, well, being kind of dumb. But you can fault People for being a bit of a one-trick pony, serving up one consciously sloppy and oblique art ballad after another.","Second album by technically proficient Brooklyn duo with art-rock leanings puts a verbose and intellectual spin on dense, spasmodic musical structures.

Once Upon a Time in the West,Hard-Fi,by: Stuart Berman,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b308ea9e61561daa6a16/1:1/w_160/1fa65fdc.jpg,2007-10-26 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10795-once-upon-a-time-in-the-west/,AtlanticNecessary,"You couldn't throw a review of Hard-Fi's 2005 debut, Stars of CCTV, around a room without hitting a Clash reference (because, you know, they liked dub too). And the title of the sophomore release from Staines, UK's second most famous export, well in line with the punk legends' penchant for big-picture statements and American outlaw iconography. However, Once Upon a Time in the West proves to be a throwback not to 1979, but 1997. It's a year that a recent Onion AV Club feature claimed was as canonical as 1967-- what with watershed albums by Radiohead, Sleater-Kinney, and Elliott Smith, among others-- but in the realm of UK pop culture specifically, the memory is more bittersweet: On the one hand the year delivered one last gust of bluster before the Britpop bubble burst (Oasis' Be Here Now, The Verve's Urban Hymns); on the other, it represents the fleeting (if ultimately failed) promise of electronica becoming the new rock music (Prodigy's The Fat of the Land, Chemical Brothers' Dig Your Own Hole). Hard-Fi sound like a time capsule from this particular moment in British pop: pitching every song to the bleachers at Wembley, open to electronic rhythmic enhancements and, more often than not, over-inflated with a sense of conviction and self-belief even when the lyrics don't rise above simple soapbox sloganeering. Frontman Richard Archer famously told the NME this year that he's more interested in challenging the likes of Eminem in the American Top 40 than Razorlight in the UK indie charts, and to their credit, Hard-Fi's music is bereft of any Brit colloquialisms that might limit their appeal to the isles. But their staunch determination to make music for the masses means that Once Upon a Time in the West sounds like it was put together through focus-group consultation. Eclecticism may be the antidote to stagnation, but Hard-Fi have a way of blurring their myriad inspirations-- be it dub, ska, Madchester, gospel choruses, modern r&b, or string-swept Britpop balladry-- into compact but ultimately non-descript songs that move neither body nor soul: ""I Shall Overcome"" jacks the clipped acoustic riff to JT's ""Like I Love You"", but any libidinous tension is sucked out by a portentous chorus that slathers on heavy synth and string effects for extra gravitas; while the album's other overt nod to contemporary dance culture, ""We Need Love"", is schaffel-techno minus the sleaze, which sort of defeats the purpose. Underscoring the album's generic feel are Archer's easy targets: 9-to-5 slave drivers (""work till you die/ that's what they teach""), television (""the new religion"") and politicians (""they never listen""). Hard-Fi are a much more enjoyable proposition when they resist the urge to colour their world with such broad strokes, as on plaintive piano ballad ""Help Me Please"", and the uncharacteristically upbeat soul-pop jaunt, ""Can't Get Along (Without You)"". But the band is rarely encumbered by such bouts of humility. Halfway through the opening ""Suburban Knights"", Archer has already launched a pre-emptive strike against the haters: ""To all these people who criticize us/ we're only saying what we see with our own eyes."" Unfortunately, his wide-angle vantage overlooks the fact that, for an album that rails against the doldrums of sedentary suburban living, Once Upon a Time in the West is pretty dull itself.","The UK band follows its Clash-referencing debut with a record that proves to be a throwback not to 1979, but 1997: Here the group finds itself pitching every song to the bleachers at Wembley, open to electronic rhythmic enhancements and over-inflated with a sense of conviction and self-belief.

The Dream Merchant 2,9th Wonder,by: Nate Patrin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b304c0084474cd0c205a/1:1/w_160/a6eb2916.jpg,2007-10-26 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10791-the-dream-merchant-2/,6 Hole,"If you're over 30 and jaded, there's a good chance your favorite producer in the hip-hop game right now is 9th Wonder. Being part of that particular demographic isn't necessarily a requirement for enjoying his best work, however-- particularly Murs' Murray's Revenge, Jay-Z's Black Album sleeper track ""Threat"", the temporarily-shelved Jean Grae collab Jeanius. (It probably helps a bit for Little Brother's The Minstrel Show, though.) 9th's main strength is taking the heavy soul-jazz boom-bap vibes of prime Pete Rock and updating them just enough so that they evoke 1992 instead of sounding like remnants of that age, and considering he does the bulk of it with Fruity Loops and a modest budget, the results are frequently impressive. But often times, 9th's music exists not just as art but as a preservationist impulse-- one to soundtrack true believers' longing looks backward. ""To tell you the truth I didn't have that 18-year-old in mind,"" he told artofrhyme.com in a recent interview discussing The Dream Merchant 2. ""I had my peers in mind. I'm 32 and my peers range from everybody from 28 up to 39. So that was the sound or whatever I wanted to go for."" The presumption that a teenager wouldn't be interested in a record like this is emblematic of Dream Merchant 2's problems. It's a record that spends most of its length preaching to the converted, complacent in the idea that evoking years past in a deeply personal and nostalgic way is enough to sustain an album rather than simply providing a starting point to elaborate on. Best-case scenario, you get tracks like the Mos Def/Jean Grae/Memphis Bleek cut ""Brooklyn in My Mind"", which picks up the mantle of the Crooklyn Dodgers super-crews of the early- to mid-1990s and comes up with a pretty strong and multifaceted borough-rep anthem, or Camp Lo's punchline-rich ""The Milky Lowa"", an update of LL's classic breakfast food metaphor track ""Milky Cereal"" (""'cause I'm all Vita-Man, blast o' Willie Dynamite/ Spill some cash soon, or your ass Kaboom!""). But all this early 90s-style rap traditionalism results in a limited palette, and the longer Dream Merchant 2 drags on the more it starts to border on the tedious-- not all of which can be placed on the producer's shoulders. I could be reading too much into the regressive throwback root of this album's problems-- 9th Wonder's production tends to blur into itself after a point, but a lot of these MCs would still be slack if they were rapping over Timbaland or El-P or whatever other out-there antithetical futurists might cross your mind. Ironically, it's the closest Dream Merchant 2 comes to a big-banging club track, ""No Time to Chill"" (featuring a brief reunion of Little Brother with the estranged 9th), that proves to be one of the bigger disappointments; everything Phonte and Big Pooh have got going for themselves lyrically here gets negated by a hook so cliché it comes across as an afterthought (""It's time to live and a time to die/ It's a time to laugh and a time to cry"" -- oh, come on). And Saigon's verse on ""Saved"" has one of the sorriest excuses for attempted political insight since Dead Prez claimed robbing pizza delivery guys was an act of revolution on ""Hell Yeah"". I know GLBT rights aren't much of a priority in rap but ""how the black woman the number 1 catcher of AIDS/ And we all know that bullshit spreaded from gays"" is pretty damn ignorant. And the lesser-known artists on this comp mostly fail to attach any distinct personality to their unfamiliar names; you can only hear so many bargain-basement Big L soundalikes tout their lyrical credentials on some tell-don't-show shit and order haters to fuck off with the same midtempo like-crunk-never-happened delivery before you start going crazy from deja vu. I hear hip-hop aging on this record, but I don't hear it growing up.","Early 1990s-style rap traditionalism colors a record complacent in the idea that evoking years past in a deeply personal and nostalgic way is enough to sustain an album.

Oblivion With Bells,Underworld,by: Mark Pytlik,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b331b1335d7bf169a553/1:1/w_160/de3bec8d.jpg,2007-10-26 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10830-oblivion-with-bells/,ATO,"Even though its been 12 years since ""Born Slippy (Nuxx)"", Underworld will probably always live in the shadow of its biggest and most exhilarating song. That's a compromise many big-hit bands must make in exchange for the right to soldier on, and to their credit, Underworld have gone about their post-lager lager years admirably. Rather than try to recreate the magic with a procession of anthemic retreads or barnacle themselves hopefully onto some fashionable new sound, they've used various extracurricular activities to quietly expand their scope. This began with 2000's live CD/DVD Everything, Everything, an ambitious and generous multimedia package that was obviously a labor of love rather than a label cash-in, and has continued in various other areas. Throughout the years, the band has issued a series of free digital releases under the umbrella title The Riverrun Project, they've scored films for directors Anthony Minghella and Trainspotting's Danny Boyle, and they've maintained close ties to dirtyradio.net, the online radio station they helped build. In an interview with Mixmag last month, singer Karl Hyde gave every indication there was even more cross-media stuff-- such as free downloads, book releases, and online TV programmes-- still to come. But while Underworld obviously haven't been lacking for inspiration over the past decade, their musical output has flagged. Where Everything, Everything and the subsequent departure of longtime member Darren Emerson should have set the table for the next phase in their career, the record that followed-- 2002's A Hundred Days Off-- was a bloodless, by-the-numbers affair that suggested they were limping indifferently to the finish line. Although it's been heartening to hear their subsequent admission that that record left something to be desired, skepticism is probably the deserved default mode when it comes to Underworld circa 2007. Sure, the more fully-formed Oblivion With Bells marks an improvement over A Hundred Days Off. The fact that its artwork so closely resembles that of their 1993 breakthrough Dubnobasswithmyheadman (which, along with 1996's Second Toughest in the Infants, has held up tremendously well with time) is no happy accident; Oblivion plays like a conscious attempt to invoke the sprawling glories of their early 90s heydeys while still nudging their sound forward. In some ways, they succeed. Where a lot of their early 90s, dance culture-reared contemporaries have struggled with the album format, the rock-oriented Underworld have always thrived. Even with less-than-compelling material, you always got the sense that they had a firm grasp on how to write and structure music for the long-play format. Oblivion With Bells is no exception. It builds, sustains, and recedes with the same expert touch that defined the band's early records. When Underworld are on, they sound great. First single and opening track ""Crocodile"" blends sunny, trancey synth arpeggios with a grinding rhythm and a big chorus; the subtly shifting ""Beautiful Burnout"" recalls some of Second Toughest's best moments in the way it moves deftly between movements; and the gently percolating ""Glam Bucket"" suggests that Hyde and the boys have been listening to a bit of Border Community. Unfortunately, though, while they sound brighter and more alive than they have in a while, their default mode still leans a little too heavily on Hyde's increasingly silly beat poetry and the kind of unashamedly booming drums that haven't sounded exciting since, well, 1997. From the cringeworthy ""Ring Road"" (which, Primitive Radio Gods fans, sounds distressingly a heck of a lot like ""Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth With Money in My Hand"") to the brokedown Dave Gahanisms of ""Boy, Boy, Boy"", a little too much of Oblivion With Bells is mired in weird alt-rock/trip-hop crossover no man's land. Was it really reasonable to expect any more from Underworld? Maybe, maybe not. At the very least, Oblivion With Bells has enough interesting things going on to suggest that Underworld haven't fallen as far as, say, the Chemical Brothers. But if the band's really half as ambitious as Hyde intimates, that shouldn't be nearly enough.","Underworld offer their second album since the departure of longtime member Darren Emerson-- and first since their lone misstep, 2002's A Hundred Days Off-- and it improves on its predecessor and recalls their early 90s sound.

Load Blown,Black Dice,by: Marc Masters,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b32b9d034d5c69bf4c9f/1:1/w_160/4869b43e.jpg,2007-10-26 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10825-load-blown/,Paw Tracks,"Officially, Load Blown is the fourth album by Brooklyn's Black Dice. But since it contains the band's final single for DFA (a three-track 12""), their first for Paw Tracks (a two-song 12""), and five cuts from an EP released simultaneously with Load Blown, it's really more a singles collection than an album. That may seem like trivial semantics, and these 10 tracks hang together well regardless. But the fact that they were created separately and originally intended for individual consumption gives Load Blown more immediacy and straight-up power than any previous Black Dice full-length. Nearly every cut here gets right to the point, jumping into simple rhythmic and sonic ideas with little delay, then grinding away devoutly at those basic elements, adding accents and building momentum along the way. There are few stretches of the kind of wandering exposition heard on other Black Dice records, which usually cropped up when the band pushed a track past the 10-minute mark. Those moments often produced inspired music, and surely the band hasn't abandoned them. But it's fun to hear Black Dice go straight for the jugular throughout the aptly-titled Load Blown, and hit the mark every time. In that sense, the album sounds like an expansion of band member Eric Copeland's recent solo effort for Paw Tracks, Hermaphrodite. That record built sunny loops from bouncing rhythms and semi-melodies, and so does Load Blown, with a wider, more open sonic palette. ""Kokomo"" uses repeated yelps and street-shaking bass bombs to lead a round of sonic jumping jacks, while ""Toka Toka"" weaves chirping squiggles into dancing circles, akin to the cartoon-ish audio experiments of Raymond Scott. Such bright-eyed swing is something Black Dice began to drive toward on their last album, 2005's Broken Ear Record. Here, however, almost every second is fueled by buoyant, even catchy energy. Not that Load Blown is a delirious joy-fest, but even its darker pieces have an insistent pulse. The cutting beat of the hip-hop-ish ""Gore"" gets crashing and abrasive, but still hypnotizes. Later, the album's noisiest track, ""Bottom Feeder"", creates a shiny rainbow out of harsh blasts and babbling vocals. But the best tracks, like the skipping ""Drool"" and the vocal beat-box collage ""Manoman"", constantly sway and rise, recreating the head rush of a childhood ride on a schoolyard see-saw. Despite the shift toward a more immediate brand of sonic invention, Load Blown is no radical departure. It's simply a new take on Black Dice's idiosyncratic mix, where attention to detail, openness to possibility, and intuitive senses of rhythm and timing all collide. Four albums and 10 years into their career, the band continues to pursue the detailed tweaks and disciplined practices required to master a craft, and Load Blown confirms they're well on their way to some kind of creative black belt.","Culled from singles for DFA and Paw Tracks, as well as five cuts from an EP released simultaneously with Load Blown, the Brooklyn band's fourth official LP is really more a singles collection than an album but it hangs together well regardless.

Gettin' Gone,Matt Valentine and Erika Elder,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2eeea9e61561daa69ec/1:1/w_160/72876e8c.jpg,2007-10-25 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10769-gettin-gone/,Ecstatic Peace,"Gettin' Gone is Matt Valentine and Erika Elder's Neil Young record. That's not to say that the Massachusetts couple-- guitar-playing, dog-owning, unison-singing hippies who, at least in song, seem as happy as any couple ever could be-- hasn't invoked Young before: Rather, their consistently tightening blend of folk, blues, rock, and improvisation has long owed debts to Young. The country sweetness of their last record for Ecstatic Peace!-- last year's Green Blues-- loosened the strings on something like Young's front-porch music, resulting in a delirious, near-perfect travelogue that was a little like the Crazy Horse of Ragged Glory recording Harvest Moon the next day on no sleep and strong weed. But Gettin' Gone is their Neil Young record: That is, every move they make-- from the brittle, Old Black electric guitar fuzz that opens and the omnipresent Shakey falsetto of Valentine to the quiet, surreal introspection that shapes its best moments-- is a winking nod to Young's sizable, rangy catalogue. Also, their dog, who is credited in the liner notes with bells, is named Zuma. In theory, then, Gettin' Gone could be perfect. Valentine and Elder are both strong, unorthodox guitarists capable with electric and acoustic arrangements, and their music's often been defined by that conscious looseness that Young listeners know so well. They've got friends-- here, J Mascis, Sunburned Hand of the Man's John Moloney and Ron Schneiderman, and an excellent pedal steer guitar player named Doc Dunn-- capable of lending a hand to that aesthetic. But Gettin' Gone lacks much vision or discipline, and-- over its 13 tracks and 65 minutes-- variegated snapshots from Young's career drift or drive in. It's an exhausting listen, a tribute to a worthy idol that often forsakes the talent of its makers in favor of proving it can cross Young's ""great divide."" Opener ""Susquehanna (Sole Art Trample)"" staples the theme of Young's nature paean ""Country Home"" to Zuma's electric grit, but ""Day and Night"" breathes emotional unrest through acoustic bodies, much like ""Heart of Gold"". On ""Home Comfort"", Valentine moans through what Young would call ""a geographical-emotional love song."" The acoustic guitar's low string buzzes in that late Young manner, and Valentine, on the brink of losing it on the road, laments, ""I always wanna look inside your eyes."" Its unhinged opposite-- ""Colaed Out"", which drags Samara Lubelski and guitarist Willie Lane into the mess-- proves that MV & EE know that Young wrote ""Mr. Soul"" and collaborated with Sonic Youth. But that doesn't make it memorable or even that good. Gettin' Gone seems so busied borrowing concepts and guitar sounds and vocal styles that it foregoes songwriting. And, if you're at all familiar with Young's catalogue, the moods MV & EE create (something they have done well hitherto) feel entirely secondhand. But Gettin' Gone does offer one glimpse of a mature, refined band capable of taking the Young (with some of the Band) paradigm and making it fit anew: ""The Burden"", which falls from the rocky cliffs of electric opener ""Susquehanna"" like a down feather, nods along a sweet, pensive progression, Elder and Dunn casting spectral lap and pedal steel rays beneath Valentine's voice. It's a rumination on the younger days, when they've been ""Down that road before/ Set some bars on before."" ""But I still love you, even when it pours,"" Valentine offers as reassurance. It's an exquisite, fragile track that shoots up in flames when Valentine bends an Ethan Miller solo from his guitar. As for the next three tracks, good luck.","Latest from Massachusetts-based improv folkies Matt Valentine and Erika Elder finds them paying homage to Neil Young, not entirely successfully.

Even in the Midst...,Ahleuchatistas,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2deea9e61561daa69cf/1:1/w_160/6dd63b29.jpg,2007-10-25 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10755-even-in-the-midst/,Cuneiform,"We live in an era where most music is painstakingly produced-- the recording studio is an instrument, and the sound of a record can be as important as (or even more important than) the songs it's built around. It's not the first time it's happened in popular music's long history, and of course the studio focus has led to tons of great music. But I tend to notice when an artist (or at least a non-jazz artist) rejects heavy production and makes a record that's just instruments, recorded as basically as possible, playing with few add-ons or tweaks. That's what this Asheville, N.C., instrumental trio has done on every one of its records. The single-minded commitment of their approach borders on stubbornness, but it's produced three good albums in the past, and you can now add a fourth to the list. Even in the Midst... at times takes a more measured approach to the tangled phrases, sudden turns, and flailing dissonance by which the band has defined itself-- think of what the Magic Band might have sounded like on Trout Mask Replica without Captain Beefheart at the helm. As in the past, the band not only eschews post-production, but most live effects as well. Bassist Derek Poteat coaxes a few funny tones from his instrument, but guitarist Shane Perlowin left all the pedals at the guitar store and gets by solely on his choice of notes and chords. Drummer Sean Dail keeps to his basic kit, doing most of his work on the snare, hi-hat, and some very tightly tuned toms. The band's core dynamic stems from the way they ride the line between tight, odd-metered groove and outright chaos, and the divide between disunity and unity gives the first track, ""...Of All This"", its structure. It opens with a series of splintered phrases that sounds about like a bird's nest looks. Then it trips some sort of wire and all three members lock into a breakneck martial/Martian rhythm that carries into a series of guitar phrases that, if isolated, might not sound out of place on a Byrds album. ""Cup of Substance"" is only 56 seconds long, but it's a thrashing thrill for all 56 of them. ""K-Bit"" has an excellently tense build-up in the middle, this time constructed as much from its chord progression as from the band's speed and dissonance-- the outro is one of the band's most melodic moments. The band fails rarely, but where they do, they fail in two ways: In a couple of places, when the band seems to want a challenge, the music becomes somewhat overcomplicated and it becomes easy to lose the thread; there are also a few moments where the payoff for following the disjointed passages simply isn't powerful enough. These moments usually invade a track briefly, only to be superseded by something that works better. There's also something of a familiarity factor creeping in, given that their approach has remained fundamentally the same since day one. Indeed, for all its qualities, Even in the Midst... is Ahleuchatistas' least bracing album so far. It's still possessed of many moments of beauty and mayhem, though, and in joining those moments together with their sense of composition, they've made a record that a lot of fans of complex yet unadorned instrumental music will find rewarding.","On album number four, this Asheville, N.C., trio offers technically complex instrumental rock executed without studio fussiness.

"Hello, Avalanche",The Octopus Project,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2f2b1335d7bf169a4f8/1:1/w_160/caf6245b.jpg,2007-10-25 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10773-hello-avalanche/,Peek-A-Boo,"Even before the MySpace community voted them their favorite band to open up Coachella last year, the Octopus Project showed real potential to connect with today's increasingly tech-happy music listeners. Unlike, say, Radiohead or Wolf Parade, bands with a bleak, often anti-technological stance despite their significant use of machine textures, this Austin instrumental act creates music sounding completely at peace with Earth 2.0. No wonder they've enchanted MySpace, the blogosphere, and any other demographic that communicates online much more frequently than in person-- they're cyberspace's ultimate guilt-free party band. The album that netted them this buzz was their second, 2005's One Ten Hundred Thousand Million, which harnessed several indie idioms en vogue at the time without sounding derivative or self-conscious. Their sophomore effort calculated the least common denominator between disco-punk, laptop pop, and Nintendocore. At the drop of a dime, a stoic new wave drum'n'bass dirge could slouch into a Bubble Bobble jam, the electronic mêlée no more threatening than a pixilated Mario brother. Since then, the Project has directed their attention to the nooks and crannies instead of rummaging through more genres, their expansion more vertical than horizontal. Opener ""Snow Tip Cap Mountain"" gently lays the groundwork, building over soothing xylophone and theremin parts until the next track, ""Truck"", explodes with the tectonic-moving force of a Broken Social Scene anthem. While One relied on superhuman displays of instrumental expertise (a tactic these virtuosos were totally up for), Hello, Avalanche never requires the players to carry too heavy a load. As a result, we get intricate electro-fugues like ""Black Blizzard/Red Umbrella"" or ""I Saw the Bright Shinies"", tracks that require multiple listens to parse and fully appreciate. This musical matrix avoids sounding painted by number, however, thanks in large part to changeups like the acoustic-tinged ""Upmann"" or fractured faux-Frog Eyes piano ballad ""Vanishing Lessons"", just two examples of Hello's willingness to drastically depart from the Project's default sound. At times, the euphoria swells so suddenly you can't help but feel let down when no vocals enter to articulate the moment. Eventually, even the band can't hold back. Soothing closer ""Queen"" finds them breaking their vow of silence, cooing a beeping laptop lullaby that tucks the album in to bed. Despite its calm nature, the song only titillates the listener further, showing flashes of what this modest instrumental group could become. Miraculously, the Project's somehow managed to remain loyal to their digitized style (and fanbase) while also subtly growing into a more multi-faceted unit, not at all reliant on simple 8-bit or post-punk tropes, but mind-numbingly fun nonetheless.","Since their 2005 breakthrough One Ten Hundred Thousand Million, these electronics-loving Austinites have further refined their sound.

Hourglass,Dave Gahan,by: Nitsuh Abebe,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b32d5e6ef959693223fa/1:1/w_160/973d9a9f.jpg,2007-10-25 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10827-hourglass/,MuteVirgin,"This has presumably been a strange and exciting decade to be a member of Depeche Mode: Seven years during which dark, blustery electro-pop has come back as a mainstream force, especially in their native UK, and sometimes in exactly the terms they were supplying it 15 or 20 years ago. They've noticed this, surely. Perhaps it's why, after sidetracking into a minimal, techy sound on 2001's Exciter, they ran right back to blaring, grainy bombast on 2005's Playing the Angel. And perhaps it's why, after a solo debut that differentiated itself from DM by putting a guitar up front, singer Dave Gahan has veered back toward the drama you expect of him. The problem is that while Hourglass has Gahan sounding a lot more assured and competent as a songwriter, it's also too much what you'd expect of him. Holed up in a New York studio with Depeche Mode's touring drummer and guitar player, he's constructed a Pro-Tooled set of dark rock grooves and electronic buzzing that won't shock anyone who's heard him or his band since, say, Songs of Faith and Devotion-- it's tasteful, professional, and as sophisticated as you'd expect from veterans. But it's also the kind of rote music that has very little purpose on its own. It's the kind that needs a very good singer-- and a very good songwriter-- to give it a reason to exist. Gahan isn't that guy right now, and his presence here seems as rote as the music. He's addicted to the grand, prophetic register he's been singing in for years now, but he's not so good these days at making it seem like there's a reason for him to stay in that place. Lyrics about religion and self-doubt may be Depeche Mode's stock in trade, but none of them necessarily support the sinister breathing and chest-beating drama Gahan goes for-- drama that seems awfully routine here, like a product he's manufacturing. It's a feeling that infects a lot of the tracks here, among which even the better ones can be too transparently professional, faultless but inessential. ""Endless"" looks to recapture the 00s with a minimized glam beat, the same T Rex shuffle that's put acts like Goldfrapp on the charts-- but Gahan seems to be copping his hook from Depeche Mode's ""I Feel You"", and all the sensual atmosphere he's pumping out feels more like branding than substance. The single, ""Kingdom"", sounds limp and listless, a big melody in a song that feels like it came out of a box. The tracks here that actually surprise-- the ones that take risks, jump out of the realm of expectations, or at least push Gahan's usual persona to the point of self-parody-- just wind up underlining the lack of spark in the songs around them. ""Deeper and Deeper"" is great precisely because it's so potentially embarrassing: Gahan is growling, play-acting a little monster, anteing up and putting something in the game. It's too rare of an occurrence here, and a little more of it would have provided much better context for the tracks-- ""Down"", ""Miracles"", ""Saw Something""-- where Gahan does what Gahan does perfectly well. It's possible to give albums like this a sense of risk and vigor, as proven just a couple months back by another 80s-alternative mainstay, someone Gahan has surely sat next to in a whole lot of record collections: Siouxsie Sioux burst out with exactly the same kind of deep, dark, guitars-and-electro solo pop record, and it was packed with all the verve this one's missing. I don't doubt that those who have followed Gahan and Depeche Mode for years will find things to like in Hourglass and enjoy hearing him continue to struggle with the topics he and his lyrics always do; he's eloquent and interesting, and I have no doubt that he's feeling every word and note here. But I'm guessing that for most, on this record, hearing Gahan feel it will be as exciting as watching any other professional perform the task he's a pro at, whether it's chopping down trees or rebuilding car engines.","Depeche Mode singer issues a Pro-Tooled set of dark rock grooves and electronic buzzing that, although lacking any element of surprise, finds his songwriting assured and competent.

All Hour Cymbals,Yeasayer,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3145e6ef959693223cc/1:1/w_160/fa63b9ec.jpg,2007-10-25 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10805-all-hour-cymbals/,We Are Free,"Over the past few years, a few of the most talked-about indie bands have been those making music with an ahistorical sense of mythic drama. TV on the Radio, Celebration, Grizzly Bear, and Animal Collective, among others, have been variously and inventively appropriating rock'n'roll's roots in ritualistic sounds, working toward individual aesthetics that merge mutual appreciations for surface and tradition. By and large, they draw upon ideas of the pre-modern (multi-part harmonies and chants drawn from religious rites, a fixation on the unseen power of the natural world), and express them through ultra-modern forms (synthesizers, electronic textures, heavy echo). Perhaps unconsciously, these groups are working in the shadow cast by the late 1970s and early 80s collaborations between Brian Eno and David Byrne, primarily My Life in the Bush of Ghosts and the Talking Heads albums Fear of Music and Remain in Light. By surrounding Byrne's rural preacher impression on ""Once in a Lifetime"" with angelic new age synthesizers and ethereal harmonies, for instance, the duo pulled an affective charge from seemingly incompatible elements. The co-presence of Byrne's anxious sermonizing, a West African rhythm section and Eno's stylish ornamentation signified not only the spiritual transformation of Byrne's character, but also an important shift in pop’s approach toward its own past along with non-Western forms of music. Brooklyn's Yeasayer are the latest entry to this group of Byrne disciples, and one of the better bands to put a new spin on his polyrhythmic convulsing. The band gained recognition earlier this year for their fantastic first single ""2080"", possibly because of its sonic similarities to Midlake's buzzed-about 2006 single ""Roscoe"". Both share a woozy, woodsy ambience, but where ""Roscoe"", set in 1891, was nostalgic for a rustic world, Yeasayer gazes ahead-- and not optimistically. ""I can't sleep when I think about the times we're living in,"" Chris Keating sings, continuing, ""I can't sleep when I think about the future I was born into."" After two preternaturally smooth choruses, the band lives up to its name. All new age elements temporarily vanish, and the group breaks through into communalism. The sudden, fervent ""yeah yeah!"" pulls from the same crowded Anglo-ethnic trough as the Arcade Fire, Animal Collective, and Danielson, and establishes the band's own link between the ritualistic and the futuristic. All Hour Cymbals, the band's LP debut, is packed with similar moments of pan-ethnic spiritualism, filtered through walls of echo and layers of gossamer synth. The album opens on ""Sunrise"" with a gospel-tinged a cappella vocal that wouldn't sound out of place coming from TV on the Radio's Tunde Adebimpe and adds handclaps and austere piano. The mix is gently, gradually taken over by a droning synthetic ambience and Keating's vocals, which express his desire to merge with nature. The song's falsettoed chorus is then fleshed out with a vague Far Eastern vibe, that same sense of foreign tension reappearing later in ""Worms"". This sense of apprehension lends the album a dramatic flair, best realized in ""Forgiveness"", which-- while reclaiming the synthetic handclap and keystroke incantation for the band's unnatural revival meeting-- calls into question the time-honored tendency to appropriate religion for personal gain. Guitarist Anand Wilder sings: ""I've come to beg for forgiveness/ So forgive me,"" yet after pleading that ""I've tried to teach by my doing, your undoing"" he admits, ""But my time will be your ruin."" Elsewhere, ""Germs"" augments its earthly paranoia (""What's hurting me when I breathe/ Perhaps it's just the mold on the ceiling"") with a sonic mood somewhere between Celtic and Balkan, and ""No Need to Worry"" is a buzzing cathedral of dread, its title only serving as an attempted calming influence. The peak of All Hour Cymbals' tangible sense of unease, the pummeling ""Wait for the Wintertime"", is Yeasayer's Black Sabbath moment, transforming their chants into a dark, persistent march. Although it's not clear whether the song is the band's own origin myth, about the apocalypse, or both, the lyric, ""On a cold day, you can walk forever/ On a cold day, nothing's gonna stop us,"" is charged with dread, only bolstered by the atonal saxophones in its climax. There and elsewhere, Yeasayer channel both a dystopian science-fiction sensibility and deep appreciation for the natural world, employing a wide, international range of sounds. The result is a unique form of indie rock world music that resists stepping into the essentialist, ethnocentric traps consistently tripped by high-minded hipsters.","This Brooklyn four-piece follows its fantastic single ""2080"" with a debut packed with similar moments of pan-ethnic spiritualism. Like Midlake, Grizzly Bear, and Animal Collective-- who have all recently re-shaped tribal, primitive sounds into ultra-modern forms-- Yeasayer channel both a dystopian science-fiction sensibility and deep appreciation for the natural world.

War Elephant,Deer Tick,by: Andrew Gaerig,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2f1b1335d7bf169a4f5/1:1/w_160/62c1ea72.jpg,2007-10-24 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10772-war-elephant/,Feow,"There is plenty about Deer Tick's debut album, War Elephant, to suggest that frontman John McCauley has seen more than his 21 birthdays. The gruff pipes, languid alt-country arrangements, and tears-in-his-beers lyrics-- ""Maybe I'll see better days/ But I'm not so sure I will,"" just two songs into his debut album-- all point towards a sagely source. Consider that McCauley has spent the previous two years touring, has collaborated with Jason Anderson and Jana Hunter, and now has his own band; it's tough to fathom just what makes him unsure of better days. This isn't to needlessly drag Deer Tick into the endless pissing contest that is authenticity in country music, just to note that McCauley is a bit of an old hound, a lithe songwriter with a black lung and a bad liver. On War Elephant, he sets his old ways against a meld of country and alt-rock signifiers, one appropriate for his age but only occasionally a fit for his songwriting. Though ostensibly an alt-country act, no amount of Telecaster bends or fiddle breaks are going to disguise Deer Tick's indie-rock core: McCauley, in both composition and performance, owes more to the Shins, Modest Mouse, and early Bright Eyes than he does even to halfway country acts like Uncle Tupelo. Overdrive pedals get stomped and larynxes strained, and War Elephant is probably the better for it: when McCauley crushes too hard on traditional tunes-- ""Spend the Night"" mimics Hank Williams' ""Hey, Good Lookin'""-- he acquires an unpleasant kid brother-ness. McCauley works best in abbreviated stretches, and about half of War Elephant stays under the three-minute mark. His voice is a nasal, corroded squeak that finds a pleasant middle ground between gargling water and Eric Bachmann on the heels of a good melody. This happens frequently enough throughout the first half of the album. The opening trio of ""Ashamed"", ""Art Isn't Real (City of Sin)"", and ""Standing at the Threshold"" roll amicably, McCauley's angst still couched in gallows humor and clever phrasing. ""There's gotta be some old recipe/ 'Cause I gotta get drunk I gotta forget about some things"", he sings jauntily on ""Art Isn't Real (City of Sin)"". ""These Old Shoes"" is sort of adorable, marrying all manner of dilapidated transports-- trains, cars, kicks-- to yelping promises, a shuffling snare beat, and buoyant electric piano. ""Dirty Dishes"" and ""Long Time"" are at worst grungy heartbreaks worthy of Wednesday night Fox teen-dramas. Unfortunately, McCauley too often abandons his slim songcraft in favor of bloated alt-rockisms and hammy genre exercises. ""Sink or Swim"" and, most egregiously, ""Christ Jesus"" plod on towards anguished, big-rock finishes, and McCauley has neither the fire nor the legs to carry them. ""What Kind of Fool Am I"" closes War Elephant sourly, a paean to 1950s vocal balladry whose piercing string arrangement can't mask McCauley's ruinous Tony Bennett impression. It's a fitting end, one that showcases McCauley's pining for experience he doesn't have into the teeth of a modern musical lineage, a contrast that takes more than his cask-aged lyrics to reconcile. The resultant head-butting makes it pretty easy to figure what kind of fool McCauley is: a young one, of course.","The 21-year-old singer-songwriter John McCauley leads this band on its debut album, which demonstrates influence from both the alt-country and more straightforward indie rock spheres.

But unlike most video game tie-in soundtracks, its relation to NBA 2K8's actual in-game music is largely tangential, aside from the fact that the two compilations both share a new vocal reworking of J Dilla's Donuts track ""Lightworks"" featuring Talib Kweli and Q-Tip. Maybe it's for the better, since your average Stones Throw act feels more suited to the freewheeling retro-funk atmosphere of a game like NBA Street Vol. 2, with its ""T.R.O.Y.""-themed old-meets-new-school vibes and its cartoonish arcade-style Maravich-to-Garnett alley-oops; it's just too out there for a glossy next-gen simulation like 2K8. But after two still-fresh Chrome Children collections, the first of which was released almost exactly a year previous to Zombie War, is it all that necessary to have the third album in the space of 12 months that basically boils down to being yet another label sampler (and that's not even counting their actual 2007 label sampler)? Well, B-Ball Zombie War's got novelty going for it, at least in one respect: The artists you might expect to stand out on this thing mostly spend their time coasting. ""Lightworking"", the aforementioned ""Lightworks"" remix, is a bit of a letdown: Kweli sounds buried under Dilla's busy moog-exotica industrial film burble and raps like he's just rattling off vaguely word-sounding syllables, while Tip's comparative vocal clarity only makes the scattershot ADD incoherence of his lyrics (culture vultures/golddiggers/requisite video game metaphor/etc.) that more clear. MF Doom fans clamoring for more Madvillainy will have to settle for a brief, unsurprising verse on ""Mash's Revenge""-- he doesn't sound nearly as thematically and creatively constrained as he did on, say, The Mouse and the Mask, but his internal rhyming and truism-tweaking seems uncharacteristically forced, even if it's frequently funny (""sell a bear trucker doo-doo/foes go to hell in a seersucker muu-muu""). And even if Madlib still sounds pretty good on autopilot, the sparse mumbling on ""The Wigflip"" and the straightforward breakup-song verses on Quasimoto track ""Hydrant Game (Jaylib Remix)""-- both Dilla-beat tracks, like the other aforementioned songs-- don't entirely seem to match their production's energy. But just as some of the marquee names surprise here by phoning it in, it's also a bombshell to hear some of the MCs that listeners might've previously written off just straight-up shining: between MED's firebreathing performance on the Just Blaze-produced ""Break It Down"" and Guilty Simpson's wise-ass battle-hustler turns on ""Make It Fast"" and ""Mash's Revenge,"" there's a couple back catalogues I'm going to have to go back and reevaluate-- were these cats always this good and it just wasn't obvious until now? But Zombie B-Ball War isn't entirely as cut-and-dried as that lazy stars/fiery b-teamers scenario might make it seem. A couple known vets like MC Percee P and turntablist J. Rocc bring their A game, and Madlib does have his share of highlights, dropping a short but sick headknock-soul instrumental (""Trouble"") under his Beat Konducta guise and teaming up with newcomer Karriem Riggins as Supreme Team for the shapeshifting opener ""See (Suite)"", which rides on three drastically different, equally dope beats in four minutes. And you can't blame the big names for the fact that the CD goes downhill fast after about 34 of its 58 minutes: While ""Lightworking"" is the only rap track on the comp that you could really call substandard (Niko & DJ Babu's ""Now You Know"" gets a pass because, c'mon, the kid's four years old), the dance-party turf of the compilation's latter third gets into some dregs. It's an interesting novelty to hear NWA castoff Arabian Prince lay down some circa-1984 electro for ""Professor X Saga"", but Dam-Funk's lounge-synth groove ""Sidewayz"" goes from three minutes of smoothness to five minutes of tedium, and a couple synthpop atrocities by Baron Zen and James Pants make Beck at his neon-encrusted Debra-serenading goofiest sound like Otis goddamned Redding. Sitting through all this at the compilation's end is like having to deal with the inevitable cheap-ass 4th quarter comeback computer opponents of NBA Jam, stealing all your balls and blocking all your shots to kill your momentum.","Compiled by Peanut Butter Wolf, this video-game tie-in doubles as the latest in a long line of Stones Throw state-of-the-label comps. Talib Kweli, Q-Tip, J. Dilla, MF Doom, and Madlib are among those featured.

Sologne,Loney Dear,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2f0b1335d7bf169a4f3/1:1/w_160/70d86d8c.jpg,2007-10-24 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10771-sologne/,Dear JohnRebel Group,"Loney, Dear, aka Emil Svanängen, is finally getting a commercial foothold in America. After whetting our appetites with Loney, Noir, his fourth record, he gets a U.S. release for another rustic variation on sugar-sweet Swedish pop, a song cycle named Sologne, France's pond-mottled approximation of Walden. A sort of refuge from the city, Sologne neatly fits the album's mood of willful naivete and olden-day romance and dreamy solitude. Thoreau via Sweden via Sub Pop? The welfare state's Bright Eyes? The formulas come close, but they can't quite encompass Loney, Dear's vision of richly layered, souped-up folk. On a mixtape, the Svanängen's sweet nothings would flow seamlessly into, frankly, anything by their labelmates the Shins. Yet Svanängen isn't crafting the tender poetry of suburbia. Instead, his album begins in an unabashedly pastoral mode, squeezing the dimensions of a rolling-hills epic into ""The Battle of Trinidad and Tobago"", which unfolds, in three-and-a-half minutes, like a cleverly abridged take on ""And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda"". Hailing from the countryside of Svanängen's imagination, ""A Band"" and the syncopated ""Le Fever"" have the same rural airs. But even Thoreau slogged back to the metropolis. Svanängen returns for closure. Like one of the high-tech ballads in Belle and Sebastian's catalog, ""The City, The Airport"" skips along with the Scots' trademark blend of energy and ennui, racing below a wilderness of melody. Delicate, always on the verge of shattering, Svanängen's whisper echoes the trembling falsetto of Stuart Murdoch, when he chants ""the city, I don't want another life that's killing me,"" lingering on the vowels. The smoky sax and flimsy keyboards lend the song body without sacrificing its intimate, homemade feel. In these long goodbyes to urban emptiness, the swell of emotional momentum, as more and more sounds suavely drop into the mix, marks Sologne as a marvel of lo-fi artistry. Obviously Svanängen knows how to mount a crescendo. (Everyone who heard ""I Will Call You Lover Again"" and ""Carrying a Stone"" from Loney, Noir will remember this.) If the closing song ""Won't You Do?"" is this record's soothing denouement, then ""I Lose It All"" works as the climax, a hunk of ice that snowballs into a hurtling boulder, as pianos tumble upstage, distortion buzzes downstage, snares shuffle, and the whole kitchen sink overthrows an unassuming drums-and-strums arrangement. Track after track, Loney, Dear coaxes drama out of these songlets, trading the spartan rawness of the usual do-it-yourself fare for a brilliantly compact sense of spectacle. He wraps the ups and downs of a whirlwind romance into tiny packages. You're left hungry, fully certain that 34 minutes-- let alone five-- will never be enough of this very, very good thing.","Second U.S. release from Emil Svanängen is another rustic variation on sugar-sweet Swedish pop, and it carries both a willful naivete and dreamy solitude.

Some Things Just Stick In Your Mind: Singles and Demos: 1964 to 1967,Vashti Bunyan,by: Mike Powell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2d09d034d5c69bf4c16/1:1/w_160/81c9f903.jpg,2007-10-24 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10742-some-things-just-stick-in-your-mind-singles-and-demos-1964-to-1967/,Fat CatDicristina,"Vashti Bunyan has only released two proper records in nearly 40 years, which affords listeners at least two minutes to consider their titles: Just Another Diamond Day and Lookaftering. The first is a statement about blissful passivity-- reasonably vogue in 1970 for singers with acoustic guitars-- but it's also about time as circular or never-changing. There's a pun in 2005's Lookaftering: To care, to look after, but also to consider in retrospect, to look at something later. She makes nostalgia and rumination sound like a limitless process; in a Vashti Bunyan song, imagining what the past would look like from the future is the closest you get to a description of the present. For all the zealous praise her music inspires, Bunyan's original intention was, in her own words, ""to break into the charts as a girl with a guitar and a sad little love song."" Some Things Just Stick In Your Mind (out on DiCristina in the U.S. and Fat Cat in the UK) is a compilation of singles recorded in 1965 and 66 for Decca and Columbia with Rolling Stones manager and producer Andrew Loog Oldham, a string of demos from the same period, and the full reel-to-reel of her first studio recordings from 1964-- a collection of those ambitions. Some of the orchestrated sides are decent, in a dippy, swingin' way (the Jagger-Richards collaboration ""Some Things Just Stick in Your Mind""); one is absolutely wonderful (""Winter Is Blue,"" both versions); others are appallingly bad (""Coldest Night of the Year"" is like Spinal Tap doing Sonny and Cher). Even though it's a pretty middling selection, it's an essential angle to Bunyan's portrait. She's said in various interviews and notes, in her gentle way, that she doesn't think of herself as a folk singer. And even the barest demos here really sound like demos, not just unkempt roughs of fully formed songs. Though most of her music has a serene, rural quality, she never romanticized remoteness, telling Pitchfork in 2005 of ""winter-long mud and damp dogs"" and how housework ""pains"" her. She didn't move to farms in Scotland and Ireland because it was more wondrous or lovely or romantic, but because she'd considered herself a failure and figured her lot in life was to bear kids and keep quiet-- projects she expresses a bittersweet ambiguity about in the lyrics to Lookaftering. Despite the distortions that came with her maturity, this collection indicated that Bunyan's subjects have always remained the same: love, time, and the way love works over time. Just Another Diamond Day's sense of remove, though, was so profound that it's hard to imagine her anticipating anything, especially human contact. Lookaftering's ""Feet of Clay"" would've been a heartbreak song in 1966; in 2005 she wrote it as an acquiescence, a lover watching from a kitchen window as someone departs, an ode to the future in general, not any one in particular.
*
Diamond Day* and Lookaftering felt like they could've been separated by as little as a month. What sets these songs apart is disposition. Bunyan hadn't yet needed to figure out the secrets of time; how to traverse it or compress it. Ironically, the world must've seemed bright to her in 1965; in 1971, it must've seemed drab. And because nobody really expects-- or aspires to, I guess-- belated cult appreciation, Vashti Bunyan lived for about 30 years thinking she'd made some sort of mistake with Diamond Day. There's an allure to these adolescent pimples-- compounded by knowledge of the music she went on to make-- but it's more in service of capitulating a myth, to seeing a story and a trajectory, than to the music itself.","DiCristina collects Bunyan's singles recorded in 1965 and 66 for Decca and Columbia with Rolling Stones producer Andrew Loog Oldham, a string of demos from the same period, and the full reel-to-reel of her first studio recordings from 1964.

Shotters Nation,Babyshambles,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3205e6ef959693223e0/1:1/w_160/d5a1f345.jpg,2007-10-24 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10816-shotters-nation/,Parlophone,"Most people would typically advise against buying into-- and therefore encouraging-- any excuses a drug addict might make for his problem. But when it comes to entertainers, this stops no one, and nowadays rehab entrances and exits are timed and presented with the glamour of a red-carpet premiere. And then, of course, there's Pete Doherty. The past few years have seen the ex-Libertine craft a public persona purposefully based on an unending public display of his private habits, his illness fed by the incestuous echo-chamber that is the British entertainment press. By all accounts, Doherty has emerged as a virtousic performer of crack and heroin addiction, prone to such casually grotesque displays as squirting a syringe at a television camera. On Shotter's Nation, his second release with post-Libertines outfit Babyshambles, he resumes the more traditional kind of performance-making which actually earns him a paycheck. He cuts straight to the chase on the album's first track, describing his lifestyle of being famous for drug abuse: ""Carry On Up the Morning"" opens with the couplet, ""In the morning, where is all the pain/ Same place as the fame, straight to the head."" The song's resigned distance sets the scene for Nation, as Doherty sets out to take stock of his current situation. That situation takes the form you might expect; Nation's songs don't often deviate from sketchy, self-loathing ruminations and regrets for past mistakes. On the first single, ""Delivery"", the title parcel comes ""straight from the heart of my misery."" On ""UnBiloTitled"", Doherty actually seems temporarily rejuvenated after delivering the self-loathing screed, ""You think that you love me/ Why don't you fuck off,"" and the second half of the song takes flight as a result. The ""French Dog Blues"" lyric ""All you ever wanted was a 60 dollar bag/ And a cheap limousine,"" is taken from an anti-coke Ian Brown song, and it deals with the groupie-populated life of a constantly partying celebrity, much like ""Side of the Road"" recommends ""Don't get surrounded by people you hate."" Notions of Shotter's Nation as some sort of a return to form for Doherty are off-base, mainly because even with backed by the more talented and more responsible Carl Barat, he's never bothered himself with shape. The Libertines were a total mess, sure, but at least they were an invigorating mess, powered by a relentless youthful energy that inexorably leads to extended hangovers. For Doherty, Babyshambles are the musical realization of that hangover, and his half-hearted compositions back it up. ""Delivery"" cribs the riff from ""You Really Got Me"" like a freshly-formed high school band, ""Crumb Begging Baghead"" is an organ-laced Nuggets retread, and for some reason, ""UnstookieTitled"" sounds like a sleepy, backwards version of R.E.M.'s ""Seven Chinese Brothers"". As for ""There She Goes"", we can just say that lounge-y swing-jazz isn't the sort of shape that suits Doherty. Nation is saved from being a total failure at its close, with ""Deft Left Hand"". The song begins with a strangely lilted take on the ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" riff, then layers a quietly anthemic guitar line atop it. Lyrically, it's probably a good bet to assume the refrain ""I will lay down and die if I can't lay by your side"" refers to Kate Moss, the Nancy to Doherty's Sid; even if it doesn't, the song represents the only occurrence on Nation where Doherty regains his focus, expressing passion instead of simple bitterness. In the end, maybe Nation can serve as an object lesson for rock aspirants seeking to play a little too hard in lieu of doing their work: one often-overlooked side-effect of profound addiction is the creation of boring, self-absorbed art.","On the second release from his post-Libertines group Babyshambles, Pete Doherty writes what he knows: bitterness, self-pity, and general apathy towards his own exhausting public displays of drug addiction.

Fire Escape,Sunburned Hand of the Man,by: Grayson Currin,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2d6ea9e61561daa69be/1:1/w_160/582c0afb.jpg,2007-10-23 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10748-fire-escape/,Smalltown Supersound,"Fire Escape is technically a Sunburned Hand of the Man album featuring Kieran Hebden-- aka Four Tet-- as group member, mixer, and producer. But that's an oversimplification: Hebden served as a curator and facilitator, inviting his former tourmates to record for four hours in London's Exchange room. In the studio, he directed, suggesting configurations, themes, and moods and letting Sunburned (eight strong, with two Vibracathedral Orchestra members and Hush Arbors' Keith Wood) route his requests through its haze-and-clamor sensibility. Hebden took the sessions, chopped them into bits, and made ""his vision of a Sunburned record."" John Moloney, Sunburned cofounder and drummer, has called Hebden ""the biggest music fan I've ever met."" And, ultimately, Hebden's enthusiasm for sound and shape turns the risky Fire Escape-- essentially, an attempt to add definition to a band whose sound is all about avoiding it-- into one of the more evocative albums in either artist's canon. If any quality defines every Hebden album-- from his high school band Fridge and the most billowing Four Tet to his questionable collaborations with jazz drummer Steve Reid-- it's utter zeal for sound and its shapes. If that seems intentionally ambiguous, it is: Hebden is as vested in accepted genres and forms as he is in the aleatoric moments (mistakes to some) that he can throw at them. Remember that Hebden put soul hooks over mosquito samples as Four Tet and electro-shocked big, swinging grooves on Steve Reid's Spirit Walk. Here, he's working with a band that's seldom been concerned with ""correct"" theory for its improvisations. He mixes the band's best moments, then, with its conspicuous imperfections. Shocks of sound from pedals with errantly turned knobs or shorting cords serrate the playful rhythm of ""Triple, Double, Everything"", and sheets of guitar squall smother an Afrobeat thrum during ""Nice Butterfly Mask"". ""Captain Knowhere"" pins bursts of laughter beneath a growling drone. Fire Escape, though, is not about delineating the mistakes Sunburned makes. Rather, it's about Hebden twisting those aberrations into unexpected textures, something Sunburned's done for most of their career with drums made of junk and guitars acting like tie-dye. But, relative to the bulk of the band's catalogue, Fire Escape is sturdily built and thoroughly composed. Most of its tracks are hitched to definite grooves and/or melodies. Even 15-minute sprawl ""The Wind Has Ears"" climbs with purpose, Hebden easing colors-- rattling percussion, ramshackle piano, muffled yowls, and sporadic electronics-- into a steadily widening smear. Indeed, Hebden builds from Sunburned's raw sound in a way that suggests he's less interested in the band's open-ended catharsis than he is the variable streams that shape it. Fire Escape never seems limited in the shapes it can take, and that was always the promise of a collaboration between these bands. The title track hustles with Neu! systematics, mechanical rhythms darting over and under washes of feedback and distortion, while ""What Color Is the Sky in the World You Live In?"" sounds like a collaboration between Ash Ra Tempel, Charlemagne Palestine, and Sir Richard Bishop. Irresolute piano and indeterminate percussion wend through a bobbing, psychotropic bassline. Over 49 minutes, dub, dance, noise, post-rock, and even house rhythms make cameos, spun into a sprawling web with the élan of a DJ commanding a band capable of making anything it can imagine. In short, Sunburned Hand of the Man-- mixed by Kieran Hebden, a guy in his late 20s still high on what Leonard Bernstein calls ""the joy of music""-- sounds exactly like you hoped it would: eclectic, interesting, and unapologetic.","Here the ramshackle folk/improv collective-- eight strong, with two Vibracathedral Orchestra members and Hush Arbors' Keith Wood in tow-- work under the direction of Four Tet's Kieran Hebden, resulting in their most focused album yet.

"People Take Warning! Murder Ballads & Disaster Songs, 1913-1938",Various Artists,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2cd5e6ef95969322362/1:1/w_160/94df52da.jpg,2007-10-23 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10740-people-take-warning-murder-ballads-disaster-songs-1913-1938/,Tompkins Square,"Times are tough. Times are always tough. But times used to be much tougher. A recent report noted the global rise of the standard of living, and the U.S. stock market keeps hitting all-time highs. Even if the relative prosperity of America is tempered by the troubling observation that, contrary to the usual positive economic indicators, life isn't getting much better, life in general doesn't seem that bad. Every so often, though, we get a glimpse of what once was and what could very well be again. The precarious, precipitous housing market leads to talk of recession, which inevitably brings up depression. The Hurricane Katrina humanitarian disaster provided an alternate-reality view of the United States as Third World nation. The resolution of the United Auto Workers strike settled the weight of thousands of jobs bobbling in the balance. The death toll and number of wounded in Iraq and elsewhere creeps upward, reminders of a time when sacrifice was compulsory, not voluntary. Yes, times are tough, but times used to be absolutely terrible-- rife with starvation, disease, extreme poverty, and senseless death. As relative prosperity continues unabated, perspective predictably fades. People Take Warning: Murder Ballads & Disaster Songs, 1913-1938 provides that perspective with three discs of abject misery, songs about misery, miserable people, and the miserable things they've done or that were done to them. It's the epitome of a bad trip back in time, and a riveting collection of musical snapshots capturing a country teetering on the edge of the abyss, looking down, and singing songs about what they see. Titled ""Man V. Machine"", the first disc focuses on songs of train wrecks, plane crashes, and the odd car accident, and features lot of songs about the Titanic, in particular. The other two discs are titled ""Man V. Nature"" and ""Man V. Man [And Woman, Too]"", respectively, and tackle just what their names imply: natural disasters and good ol' fashioned murdering. It's harrowing and horrifying stuff, but there's a twisted element of rueful humor to this set, too. ""If it bleeds, it leads,"" goes the cynical journalism saying, and these horror stories, drawn from headlines, serve much the same purposes as the tabloids, providing tales of loss you can't turn away from. It's also a little like the scene of the accident on the side of the highway, with traffic slowed to a near halt so that everybody can get a good look, as if they don't already know what they're going to see. You generally know what you're going to get here, too, but just because it's familiar sounding hardly means it's full of household names. The set inevitably includes a few songs from such usual suspects as Son House and Charley Patton, as well as often anthologized tracks like Kansas Joe and Memphis Minnie's ""When the Levee Breaks"". There are also plenty of well-known subjects, like the infamous Old 97 train, conductor Casey Jones, the doomed Tom Dooley, and the reliably murderous Stack O'Lee. But there are countless surprises as well, like ""El Mole Rachmim (für Titanik)"", a song that stresses how much the great ship's sinking resonated with recent Eastern European Jewish immigrants. Music like this has always been the province of obsessive collectors, and it will probably always remain that way. But there's no question that having this music packaged together by experts and fans beats scouring estate sales for fragile 78s. Whether beautifully packaged (like the astounding gospel collection Goodbye, Babylon), thematically organized (the fun medicine show soundtrack Good for What Ails You: Music of the Medicine Shows 1926-1937), or both (the still essential Anthology of American Folk Music, which, lest one forget, really was once just part of one man's collection), it's still remarkably powerful and moving all these years-- but really not that many-- later. As Tom Waits puts it in his introductory essay, ""The scratches on the 78s sound like the ocean in a shell, and the songs are riding inside across time.""","Life got you feeling too good? This 3xCD box set containing songs ripped from the headlines of the day is packed with death, reminding us of when life was really, truly terrible.

Two Sevens Clash: The 30th Anniversary Edition,Culture,by: Mike Powell,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2b4c0084474cd0c1fdd/1:1/w_160/23fb42f7.jpg,2007-10-23 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10716-two-sevens-clash-the-30th-anniversary-edition/,Joe GibbsJoe Gibbs,"For all its Biblical heft-- the title was taken from a Marcus Garvey prophecy about chaos erupting on 7/7/77-- Culture's reggae classic Two Sevens Clash, like Funkadelic or gospel, took suffering as a means for uplift. Re-sequenced from its original running order, this 30th Anniversary Edition opens with ""I'm Alone in the Wilderness"", which singer Joseph Hill does appear to be, for about 20 seconds. The minor key screws up to major, and the second time Hill claims solitude, he's joined by Albert Walker and Kenneth Dayes; Robbie Shakespeare's guitar nods in repose with the rootsiness of a Band record; wet organs drone in the background; an electric piano punctuates Hill's exultations; Sly Dunbar clacks along on drums like their bejeweled rickshaw. The goal here-- not to lose sight of what already feels like heaven on earth-- was deliverance: ""I'm alone with Jah almighty."" And not only are there nine more songs, but they're as impossibly ecstatic as the first. Hill understood that true redemption probably takes better root in collectivity, so a handful are calls for inclusion: ""Get Ready to Ride the Lion to Zion"" (the lion appears! and he roars!), ""Calling Rastafari"", and ""Black Starliner Must Come"" (referring to Garvey's back-to-Africa dream). But Rastafari were caught between Babylon and a hard place, and Hill doesn't let his kin get too comfortable, slyly reminding them on ""Pirate Days"" that ""the Arawak was here first"" (and that Zion's pretty far off). Though it's considered a classic of roots reggae-- a late-1970s style focused on Rastafarian teaching, social distress, and political injustice-- Two Sevens Clash generally sounds a lot brassier than most of the records in its category. The rhythms, if not always dance-oriented, are springy and uptempo, the harmonies are major, and Joe Gibbs's production is bright (contra, say, dub's intoxicant muddiness). And Hill is ultimately the catalyst reveling in the middle, a wily, lemony voice, never shying away in melody or delivery, never letting harsh reality cancel out his hope, but never pretending things are any less miserable than they actually are. The title track was released as a single in March and became so massive that when July 7th arrived, businesses closed, the military perked up, and, reportedly, most people stayed indoors. Not that the year had been a party up to that point: the country experienced a growth in the first decade after 1962's independence, but it had slowed so drastically by 1977 that the International Monetary Fund arrived in May. In economic halt, the country played host to the usual mix of violence, anxiety, and unrest. But Hill yawps about the impending doom with zeal that sounds more like anticipation than fear. He's feeling great because he's goin' to see his lord, and one glimpse of heaven's good nuff to tut-tut the fears of any of god's reverent children wandering this hurt world-- we would've called it ""apocalypse""; Hill called it ""glory day."" Culture was signed by a subsidiary of Virgin (with the help of Johnny Rotten-- Two Sevens Clash was considered a classic amongst the punks), and Hill performed around the world until his death last August. That July 8th came never mattered.","A devoutly Rastafarian vocal group led by Joseph Hill, Culture released this, their debut album, in 1977; enshrined in the canon as a roots-reggae classic, the record has been reissued in expanded form with a new running order.

Follow the Lights EP,Ryan AdamsThe Cardinals,by: Stephen M. Deusner,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3215e6ef959693223e3/1:1/w_160/ee8710e3.jpg,2007-10-23 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10817-follow-the-lights-ep/,Lost Highway,"Poor Ryan Adams' press still reads like it did four years ago, perpetuating the idea that he's a scruffy-haired, shaggy-dog troubadour with loads of ambition but no direction, a prodigious pen with no internal editor. Every onstage incident is reported as a ""fit,"" and people still wonder if he's dating Parker Posey. But Adams has changed. Possibly. As Marc Hogan commented in his album review earlier this year, Easy Tiger is Adams' most consistent and concerted effort since 2001's Gold. Perhaps no longer confident that fans or passersby will follow him down just any avenue, Adams has focused his songwriting and settled down with a band, the very capable Cardinals. His new sound draws equally from the lite country he made with Whiskeytown and from the Grateful Dead noodliness the Cardinals brought to Cold Roses. Sheryl Crow dueted on the first single from Easy Tiger, a sure sign that Adams was making a go of it commercially. But he wasn't selling out so much as finally getting his head in the game-- which is just what armchair detractors had been advising him to do for years. Such modesty and straightforwardness suit Adams well, nowhere more so than on Follow the Lights, a satellite EP orbiting planet Tiger. In a sense, however, this is the Cardinals' record, with Adams graciously stepping aside as if to make up for not giving them cover billing on Easy Tiger. It's easy to see what Adams sees in his group: It has the range to follow him anywhere-- from punk to alt-country to nu-Dead to Starbucks rock-- yet the band focuses his creative energies in one direction instead of letting it spray everywhere. Offering a jumbled chronology of their ongoing collaboration, Follow the Lights contains a few new songs, bonus tracks from previous Cardinals albums, at least one worthwhile do-over, and an Alice in Chains cover that's only evident as such if you look at the liners. The halting acoustic arrangement on ""If I Am a Stranger"", from Cold Roses, creates a lonely space for Adams' heartbroken lyrics and Heartbreaker vocals, which recapture a little of the twang of his earlier material. The piano-lead ""Dear John"", which Adams co-wrote with Norah Jones and originally appeared on the Australian edition of Jacksonville City Nights, showcases his easy harmonies with Cardinals guitarist Neal Casal. Nowhere is the backing band's impact more evident than on ""This Is It"", a salvage of a track from Adams' spectacular 2003 disaster Rock N Roll: The Cardinals abandon that album's Strokesy bluster for a sweeter, scruffier sound that enhances the song's hook and showcases Adams' adaptable songwriting. They don't fare nearly as well, however, on ""My Love for You Is Real"", which is as forgettable as its title suggests. The song ends with an instrumental coda that lets the band stretch out but doesn't give them a lot to do. What should be a big moment is just a transition to ""Blue Hotel"", which sounds cleaner than the version on Willie Nelson's Songbird but lacks his elegantly rough-hewn vocals. Best of all is the title track, which sounds as good as anything on Easy Tiger, with Jon Graboff's pedal steel draping over a delicate melody and a strong hook assaying Adams' tender imagery: ""Follow the lights that line the streets connecting telephones,"" he sings, his voice fuzzing out at the edges to give the song a strong dreampop quality. ""Follow the lights from house to house and they will lead you home."" Perhaps this newfound sense of focus-- this (gasp) professionalism-- is just a phase, like new wave was in '03 or godawful hardcore was in, um, that same year. Rewriting industry rules to suit your own disposition-- releasing as many damn albums as you please, playing whatever style suits your fancy, rapping on your web site, flipping the bird at the rock norm-- is certainly admirable, but in Adams' case, the spectacle often overshadows the music. As Easy Tiger suggested and Follow the Lights proves, Adams sounds best when he's going strictly by the book.","On this new EP-- which features a few new songs, bonus tracks from previous albums, at least one worthwhile do-over, and an Alice in Chains cover-- Ryan Adams continues the more honed, focused work that he and his backup group, the Cardinals, began with this year's Easy Tiger.

Preparations / Interregnums,Prefuse 73,by: Ryan Dombal,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Features Editor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b3229d034d5c69bf4c8e/1:1/w_160/21c3ce14.jpg,2007-10-23 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11622-preparationsinterregnums/,Warp,"Guillermo Scott Herren's many aliases-- Prefuse 73, Savath & Savalas, Delarosa and Asora, Piano Overlord to name a few-- make it easier for him to organize wav files on his laptop but, as counter-intuitive as it may seem, the self-imposed categorisations could be holding him back. Now, when he releases a Prefuse 73 record, it's supposed to sound like a Prefuse 73 record-- blips, bleeps, bap, mood, and a couple of friends offering rhymes and/or production flourishes. In a way, the multiple monikers make Herren a slave to expectation. Such is his plight, from the next-Shadow heights of 2003's One Word Extinguisher and Extinguished: Outtakes to the overcrowded mainstream-baiting blunder Surrounded by Silence to the automatically forgotten pseudo album Security Screenings, the producer has largely squandered his Extinguisher love with a series of missteps and diminished retreads. I was ready to deem the numbingly characteristic Preparations another so-so step in the same direction, but then I listened to the album's ""bonus disc,"" Interregnums, which isn't a Prefuse album (or a Savath album or a Delarosa album...) and is all the better for it. First thing: Interregnums (def: a gap in continuity) is a bonus in the sense that it's an unexpected benefit, but it is not a bonus in the sense that it's a shameless collection of unworthy ephemera used to sucker loyal fans. In fact, Interregnums is six minutes longer than Preparations. The disc finds Herren in full-on composer mode as its 15 lush suites do away with all the flashy cut-and-paste sampling theatrics, leaving us with a grandiose version the unavoidable melancholy that permeates most of his best material. It's Gil Evans' cool crossed with John Williams' sentimentality and the tortured soul of Endtroducing... and it's a welcome surprise. Interregnums' swelling orchestrations were apparently borne out of the string-laden pieces originally prepared for Preparations. But while they're buried underneath the typical micro-programming and airy organs on that album, Interregnums fleshes them out into flowery instrumental ballads anachronistic in their sweet sadness. For all his break beat panache, Herren has always marked his Prefuse albums with considerable bleeding heartbreak (see: emo-glitchers like the unmistakably overcast ""Storm Returns"" off Extinguisher or Surrounded's stop-start hip-hop lament ""Now You're Leaving""). On Interregnums, such wrenching sensations are exposed, embellished, and expanded upon. ""The Last"" throbs quietly like a leftover instrumental from Björk's insular masterpiece Vespertine. Meanwhile, ""Let It Ring Ensembles"" utilizes a saintly choir and emergency broadcast bleats to recall Sigur Rós trapped between earth-ending crescendos. Herren tracks his tears with lavish silent movie strings that all but write their own screenplay-- ""Thorough Light"" sweeps with star-gazed longing and the near-seven minute ""Spacious and Dissonant Part 2"" applies the same Prefuse-style ADD beat making technique to grand emotionalism, swinging from playful to eerie to depressive like so many French art films. With its overt melodrama, the disc can occasionally fall into soap opera-soundtrack territory but, more often than not, its luxurious textures aptly convey its desires. Oh yeah, the actual new Prefuse 73 album called Preparations. Starting things off with a 31-second intro featuring diced vox and a queasy, uncertain atmosphere, Herren could be forcing a comparison to the similarly ignited Extinguisher. But instead of segueing into a blistering kiss-off like ""The End of Biters - International"", we get ""Beaten Thursdays"", a Prefuse-by-numbers groove that bumps along inoffensively before petering out. While there's nothing outright embarrassing on Preparations-- no mismatched collaborations or fast-forward-itching Beans guest shots-- there's little that holds up aside Herren's most accomplished work. Gone is the humor and anger that sometimes livened the Extinguished discs, replaced with a relentless mid-tempo ambivalence. ""I Knew You Were Gonna Go"" hints at something deeper than a shoulder shrug with its see-saw lilt and closing vocal sample of a bygone version of Jimmy Webb's ""Do What You Gotta Do"", and ""Smoking Red"" takes decent advantage of the talents of indie rock's most furious drummer, Battles' John Stanier, but they're exceptions. Even at 46 minutes, Preparations is wearying; it's the same Prefuse tricks once more, with less feeling. If Herren had integrated the Prefuse qua Prefuse Preparations with the riskier, more rewarding Interregnums, he would've ended up with a double-album hodge-podge not unlike label mate Aphex Twin's fascinatingly bipolar Drukqs. As is, though, Interregnums will be considered the lesser disc due to its unfortunate ""bonus"" status, which is a shame because it trumps its predictable sister CD in almost every way imaginable. In a Pitchfork news interview from earlier this year, Herren hypothesized about his upcoming release: ""I feel like half the kids that buy it are just going to throw [Interregnums] away and keep [Preparations]."" He should be emboldened to know it might just end up the other way around.","Prefuse 73 aims to recapture some of the goodwill squandered since the next-Shadow heights of his 2003 LP One Word Extinguisher and its companion piece, Extinguished: Outtakes, and he manages to do so thanks to a bonus disc.

Grimwood,Michael Yonkers,by: Andrew Gaerig,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2d35e6ef95969322371/1:1/w_160/ab104c93.jpg,2007-10-22 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10745-grimwood/,self-releasedself-released,"Plenty of ink was spilled in 2003 when Minneapolis psych-rock wunderkind Michael Yonkers' 1969 debut Microminiature Love was rescued from collector hell. While the reissue of his first album received all the attention, his second, Grimwood, remained in limbo. Recorded in 1969, Grimwood originally materialized in 1974, after label frustrations scattered Microminiature's original band, and treatments for a 1971 warehouse accident left Yonkers all but crippled. The album is the residue of those years, a soft-focus folk record with tiny avant-garde tendrils. Be dubious of anyone proffering Grimwood as a more personal Yonkers record. Though it wholly abandons the athletic fuzz of his debut as well as his nascent lyrical protestations, the album erects stockades and gathers provisions for a Midwestern winter. There is plenty of tragedy-- during ""Sandcastle"", Yonkers and a lover first laugh at, then are overtaken by, an army of crabs-- but the album is less a product of inner torment than of a dark, eager intelligence. Yonkers delivers his tragicomic illusions with chaste folk constructions and the remnants of his frazzled explorations strained over top. Oscillating tones threaten to overtake sloth acoustic guitars on ""Lonely Fog"" and ""162"". Echo-chamber apparitions hijack the final minutes of opener ""Damsel Fair and Your Angel"", while a flange pedal is abused and discarded by ""Tripping Through the Rose Gardens"". On Grimwood's longest and best track, ""The Day Is Through"", Yonkers plays tag with a druggy horn before breaking into improvised nonsense: they go ""Dee de dee/ Da dooda do do/ Ah whooooooo"", Yonkers and the horn both. Grand fun, even if these departures mask the fact that well over half of Grimwood slugs along without accent. Capable only of a sober, Leonard Cohen-tenor, Yonkers needs those noisy little foils. Without them, he languishes dryly, his voice blending into his strumming for extended stretches of ""And Give It to You"", ""Sunflower"", and the title track. Even at its gossamer best-- ""The Big Parade"", ""The Answer""-- his pipes threaten parody of Renaissance fair bard-ism. Grimwood, a rainy and consternated affair throughout, offers a brief glimpse at an alternative. The opening seconds of ""The Day Is Through"" are a disarming studio accident, an aborted take of Yonkers and pals goofing off. ""[Stoned laughter]...Brain? Brain, are you there?...[Giggling]...Let's get down to business."" Contrast this with Yonkers' eccentric reputation, including the appropriately baiting cover art: he is jovial and in good company. Microminiature's exultations bought Yonkers all the legend he would ever need; a few years later, catastrophe would rob him of it. Yonkers was playing with house money in 1969, though he couldn't have known it. Grimwood is his searching, frustrated consolation prize.","This reissue of Yonkers' 1974 sophomore album follows four years after his equally obscure 1969 debut, Microminiature Love, made its CD bow; where the latter leans toward psychedelic rock, Grimwood is a soft-focus folk record with tiny avant-garde tendrils.

Oracular Spectacular,MGMT,by: Eric Harvey,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b2e45e6ef95969322387/1:1/w_160/e92ec432.jpg,2007-10-22 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10761-oracular-spectacular/,Columbia,"On the first song on their debut record, MGMT let us know how they got here. The rock song-as-origin myth is nothing new-- from ""Who Do You Love"" through ""Immigrant Song"", to ""We Share Our Mother's Health"" and Kanye West's ""Big Brother""-- and ""Time to Pretend"" situates itself in that canon. Emerging initially from a viscous electronic fluid, the song quickly takes shape as a bombastic electro-glam number about rock star dreams. Accordingly, it's cheesy and clichéd, but also thick with sarcasm: Before the first chorus, MGMT sing nostalgically about having models for wives, moving to Paris, and shooting heroin. The kicker, though, is in the title itself. Knowing that the Almost Famous notion of stardom doesn't exist anymore (if it ever did), the duo of Andrew Vanwyngarden and Ben Goldwasser  realize they're ""fated to pretend."" It's a charming idea-- making a career out of fantasizing-- and on Oracular Spectacular, they not only accept their playacting destiny, they demonstrate that, just maybe, it's a path more people should take. MGMT find kindred spirits in Muse and Mew by dressing their melodies in the fanciful trappings of 1970s British prog, but unlike their contemporaries the duo also weaves in lessons from disco, new-wave synth-pop, and early 90s Britpop. The understanding that youthful innocence is a potent force-- a theme first established in ""Time to Pretend""-- continues throughout the record. Instead of the ""Knights of Cydonia"", though, MGMT fights ""Weekend Wars"", ostensibly an ode to the fictionalized childhood battles that treat backyards as independent colonies in need of conquering. The gentle, chiming melody and effete vocals of ""The Youth"" recall Sparks or Queen at their most restrained moments, and ""Kids"" comes across as an inspirational dance anthem for playgrounders. Most impressive on Spectacular is Vanwyngarden and Goldwasser's ability to dabble, with the shared understanding that whatever they do is Big. ""Pieces of What"" is an unexpected acoustic guitar piece, but it's delivered like an outtake from Suede's Dog Man Star. ""4th Dimensional Transition"" augments its cavernous psychedelic vocals with a jacked-up BPM count, and on ""Electric Feel"", MGMT pull off lithe, falsetto electro-funk surprisingly well. There's not much to the song aside from a Barry Gibb vocal and limber bassline, but within the context of the rest of Spectacular, it makes perfect sense. In fact, so does the duo's current tour pairing, as the openers for Of Montreal. Kevin Barnes' emergence as an icon of theatricalized electro-glam seems the ideal toward which the duo should strive. They're still young, of course; they've got plenty of time to figure that out.",,6.8,
The Modern Tribe,Celebration,by: Joe Tangari,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b31ab1335d7bf169a53b/1:1/w_160/17e51d00.jpg,2007-10-22 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10810-the-modern-tribe/,4AD,"Celebration is the latest band featuring Katrina Ford and Sean Antanaitis-- a duo who've also co-led Jaks, Love Life, and Birdland-- and this group, rounded out by drummer David Bergander, is their most refined and controlled yet. That's not to say the music is restrained or simple (it's neither), but it is sophisticated and wears its eccentricities naturally. This is the second Celebration album, and it's a mellower affair than the first, spacing out the blasts of tweaked prog-punk with a clutch of slower songs. This slightly more sedate approach means that Ford's vocals are less crazed than before, though she still gets her tics in. If anything, her amazing skill as a singer is more noticeable here than ever before, because she's so controlled most of the time, using her range of bizarre vocal tricks for accent or effect. She has a voice deep enough to confuse your impression of her gender, but also hits some terrifying high notes, most notably on ""Fly the Fly"", where she completes a crescendo with a piercing, precisely controlled wail, leaving the listener to contend with the album's best guitar part and a locomotive beat. Actually, it'd be nice if her voice were given more space to roam in the mix. This is an album with virtually no silence, and there always seems to be an organ filling in a spot that could have been emphasized with a well-considered lack of noise. The trio is augmented by Nick Zinner of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs and all of TV on the Radio, whose David Sitek is back in the producer's chair. That makes sense: Celebration is what it might sound like if those two bands merged. It's questionable whether much of the extra sound on the record was necessary, because the album's constant fullness makes it harder to latch onto its best moments. It can also obscure Bergander's fantastic drum work, which shies away from conventional rock beats in favor of crazy-armed patterns that drive even the slowest tracks. The best songs overcome the excess with kinetic energy and memorable arrangements, such as ""Hands Off My Gold"", which makes good use of a thrusting sax, slotting it into an electronic, tribal beat. Tunde Adebimpe provides creepy backing vocals that poke above the ever-present organ. As much as I've tried to listen to the lyrics, they tend to fly right by without really sticking, as I find myself alternately too wrapped up in the actual sound of Ford's singing and the often distracting fullness of the arrangements. At its best-- that is, when it focuses on high-velocity post-punk, such as on ""Pony"" and ""In This Land""-- this is an addictively weird and convulsively captivating record. At its worst, as on the slogging, dirge-like ""Tame the Savage"", it's unmemorable and overstuffed. It's now up to the group to locate a balance between the musical dynamics they've mastered and the sonic dynamics that still elude them.","This 4AD group's second album, produced by TV on the Radio's David Sitek, features appearances from TVOTR and Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner. That makes sense: Celebration is what it might sound like if those two bands merged.

Pride,Phosphorescent,by: William Bowers,"<span class=""authors-detail__title"">Contributor</span>",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929b31f9d034d5c69bf4c86/1:1/w_160/7dc83a3c.jpg,2007-10-22 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10815-pride/,Dead Oceans,"Matthew Houck’s adoring fans occasionally find themselves conscripted into straw-sheriff roles, bound to struggle against the mob justice of Inspector Bloggit followers who'd charge him with petty theft just because he seems aesthetically connectable to other dignitaries within his cosmic art-folk / mystic alt-country / slowcore-gospel idiom. The Neutral Milk Hotel comparisons that his work used to attract were inexplicable to this typist's ears-- wtf, because he also lived in Athens? And yes, now that he claims Brooklyn, one can detect-- in three songs-- a flirtation with those post-Animal Collective poles of, y'know, elliptical ethereality and raucous tribalism in his approach to song structure and performance. Sure, a few acts do consciously cannibalize others' textures, but we hype-machinists too frequently commit the fallacy of assuming that soundalikeness equals influence or translates as aping. Try this at home: Play a guitar and sing, and odds are, now that so many of our psyches are plumb awash in multiplicities of bands, you're going to innocently/organically ""sound like"" somebody else, unless you're, I don't know, David Thomas Broughton. If in the past Phosphorescent's work contained moments that could be received as echoing Sparklehorse, Tindersticks, Clem Snide, Low, downbeat Flaming Lips, the Pacific-pastoral K Records stable, and the Joe-Henry-curated Jesus' Son soundtrack's commingling of soul, spirituals, oldies, and faux-ldies, well, good for humanity. But the Will Oldham thing: yeah. And Pride continues that tradition on all fronts. First, the cover photo is difficult not to perceive as an homage to Oldham's Days in the Wake, itself a Jandek homage. And the lion theme, even if it's based on Houck's hair-encircled face: consult Oldham's ""The Lion Lair"" (since citing the Sage Francis team-up ""Sea Lion"" would be rash). The yelping, howling, abstract title track: consult Oldham's ""Come a Little Dog""-- from Days in the Wake, no less. Speaking of canines, this album's ""Wolves"": consult Oldham's ""Wolf Among Wolves"" and Superwolf. Houck's voice warbles exactly like mid-career Oldham, one of his old songs even used a Days in the Wake song title (""All Is Grace"") as a lyric, both performers abuse further animal metaphors, both frame songs as prayers, both feature lackadaisical-verging-on-catatonic overdubs, and both include female singing as flesh-out fodder. Most damningly, Pride was preceded (and upstaged) by a kickass Daytrotter session featuring arrangements and production that strike me as aiming for the throat of Oldham's greatest 4-song EP, the Kramer-helmed The Mountain-- the two closing songs of which Houck already mimicked in terms of lyrics and inflection on his last full-length's ""South (of America)."" The above paragraph: FOOLED YOU! Could have kept going, too, through more Phosphorescent-discography lyrical and vocal similarities with Lost Blues and Western Songs, even milking the strangely touching syllabic nonsense of Houck's Aw Come Aw Wry and Oldham's All Most Heaven, but this ""review"" would have then topped 2,000 words. I also could have faked an equally dubious/convincing chunk about Iron and Wine, down to the hirsuteness, biblical dabblage, EP supremacy, and the titles of Beam compositions such as ""Lion's Mane"" or the new album's, um, ""Wolves."" My point: I don't put much stock in Jungian collectivity, but nobody gets to monopolize this archetypal shit. Oldham and Beam were both called copycats of their ancestors when they dawned, and 'tis time to afford Houck the respect that their work has since earned. OMFG all three of 'em use the same chord progressions AND mention the (planet-dominating) ocean a lot! OMFG, I think I hear traces of Pride's awesome guestlist in Phosphorescent's music, too! That'd include Nat Baldwin, Annie Palmer, Jana Hunter, Liz Durrett, Dirty Projectors, and Castanets in the conspiracy! So: stunning, stand-alone album. Except that the reportedly high-school-marching-band-inspired version of ""A Death, A Proclamation"" here-- while more interesting than anything recently by, say, Will Oldham-- doesn't hit the heights of the wailed, piano-solo-assisted Daytrotter arrangement. Same goes for ""Cocaine Lights"", despite its being a fine comedown un-anthem on par with classics by Kris Kristofferson or Neil Young, every chronicled gesture precise (the ""blood clicking"" and face-covering) and every phrase beautiful (the partner-in-a-slip and the ""showy amen""). Pride romanticizes the burden of touring (""Even in these dirty clubs counting 1-2-3""), but: Live in concert, Houck just dwindles and stumbles. Over multiple shows, I've only seen him confident once, when right in front of the stage, I redneckfully started a shoving match with a former bosom chum turned consummately annoying townie who insisted on yammering loudly to someone gullible enough to suffer him and who made fun of my investment in the show after asking him to be quiet or move back five fucking times. Houck put his hand on my head like a guru, and to an even less worthy arrangement of a requested ""Cocaine Lights"", smirked and repeatedly crooned, ""Where is the love?"" The love is in Pride's lyrics, which escape the shackles of their occasional poetic flourishes to be unmysterious and self-explanatory, totally broken and totally vulnerable, and therefore unique. The speakers' partners are pretty much anchors, and the crack in Houck's voice: a mournful yodel. These voices would have us believe that they mean to repair the relationships they're in: ""Tell me where you've been and I will tell you where I've been/ It will all be okay."" But seductive statements of faith in resurrection are eventually outweighed by aftermath-odes; these speakers prefer loss. The listener gets the sense that they don't even miss a singular individual but a composite of squandered loves, Frankenmates formed in minds that crave impossible partners, even while retroactively full of promise: ""O love, the one day I tarried too far and I never came home/ O love, I always carried your heart married deep in my own."" And even the internet doesn't have room for me to gush over the Beach-Boy-haunted, vocal-drone stuff.","This is the latest from Matthew Houck, and though he still sounds a hell of a lot like Will Oldham, his blend of harmonies-and-drone with delicate folk-pop is a perfect autumn sound.
