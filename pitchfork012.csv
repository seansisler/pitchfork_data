qhnnnl,Dianogah,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd9cea9e61561daa773b/1:1/w_160/af072f91.jpg,2008-11-03 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12363-qhnnnl/,Southern,"The last time Dianogah released an album (their third), they were expanding their aesthetic palette to encompass more than the two-bass, no-six-string post-rock niche that was their modest claim to fame. The differences between 2002's Millions of Brazillians and their earlier work, however, was merely a matter of degrees. Even with the inclusion of different instruments besides bass and drums (including good old-fashioned guitar) and the contributions of some fellow Chicago scenesters (including members of Tortoise, the Coctails, and Rachel's), what sounded just fine on a song-by-song basis congealed over the course of the album into the same amorphous, thundering muddle as their previous releases. Dianogah's tracks often seemed better suited for a more traditional rock-band alignment, which did neither the songs nor the group any favors. In that light, their newest album, qhnnnl, is a pleasant surprise. Whether the six-year hiatus was planned or simply a matter of circumstance, it's done Dianogah's songwriting a world of good. The album metes the group's more expected offerings-- like the obliquely titled [and, as all tracks here, uncapitalized] instrumental ""i like juice in a shark suit"" and album opener ""oneone""-- with a few well-spotted curveballs. One early departure comes in the form of ""a breaks b"", a track that sounds like business as usual until guest vocalist Stephanie Morris steps in to duet with lead vocalist Jay Ryan, and Andrew Bird's violin adds an uplifting lilt to the chorus. No doubt Bird's presence will be the draw for most consumers, and his contributions are certainly worth the price of admission (especially in the case of ""andrew jackson"", where he takes center stage). That said, the moments where Morris adds her two cents are equally integral to the album's success. Her understated vocals-- reminiscent of Stars' Amy Millan at times; see ""sprinter"" for proof-- add a plaintive sweetness and much-appreciated contrast to the group's bass-heavy M.O. In comparison, the helping hands of keyboardist Mark Greenberg (of Coctails fame) and guitarist Billy Smith (whose band, Hubcap, features Dianogah's Ryan on bass) aren't as readily noticeable. They both contribute whoopin' and hollerin' to barn-burner ""you might go off"", though, which sounds like something Peter Prescott would gladly co-opt for the next Mission of Burma record. It's not a track one would have expected from the Dianogah of years' past, but it's a definite sign that the group has more than a few tricks up its sleeve.","Featuring contributions from fellow Chicagoan Andrew Bird, as well as members of Tortoise, the Coctails, and Rachel's, Dianogah return after a six-year hiatus to prove they still have more than a few tricks up their sleeve.

Hearts & Daggers,Miss Murgatroid and Petra Haden,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd9dea9e61561daa773f/1:1/w_160/49ffa12e.jpg,2008-11-03 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12365-hearts-daggers/,File Under: Music,"How many claims to fame does any one person really need? In Petra Haden's case, you can start with her father, legendary bassist Charlie Haden, and continue with her stints in that dog., the Rentals, and the Decemberists, among other notable acts, right on through her other works (session, solo, or otherwise) including her awesomely virtuosic a cappella recreation of The Who Sell Out. Somewhere down the line of Haden's accomplishments was her 1999 collaboration with accordionist/ photographer Alicia J. Rose, aka Miss Murgatroid, with whom she released the overlooked and/or forgotten Bella Neurox, a disc of accordion, vocals, and violins tailor made for the twee, quirky, and weird. And now, nearly 10 years later, Petra Haden and Miss Murgatroid have returned in tandem with a sequel, Hearts & Daggers. Christine Shield's album art doesn't exactly raise expectations for the disc. It's a panoramic depiction of a sort of Children's Crusade in retreat, dejected kiddies following a trail of discarded crowns and scepters away from a burning castle, with cute little cats cuddling by their feet. It's a red flag warning that Hearts & Daggers may basically be the musical equivalent of just that sort of notebook doodle, the soundtrack to a dramatic play put on by precocious kids that, whether by accident or intent, dips deep into the well of ancient madrigals and other Renaissance Faire fare. Except that against all odds, the results aren't nearly as precious as that description might make them appear. For starters, Miss Murgatroid and Haden are hardly show-boaters, preferring to enlist the more understated characters of their respective chosen instruments. Both players also have a keen ear for evocative arrangements that toe the subtle line between song and curious assemblage. The way the pair approach ""Fade Away"", for example, is as equal parts shanty, pop tune, and Laurie Anderson-style minimalist deconstruction. Even if it lacks the compelling visual counterpart it so clearly demands (in the form of, say, a modern dance piece or a pretentious student film), it's still a winning composition. Besides, isn't that what imaginations are for? Elsewhere, ""Baroque Lullaby"" toys seamlessly with both classical and folk idioms, a sweet audio frolic akin to such playful chamber groups as the Penguin Café Orchestra but minus the barrier of aloof intellectual distance, while ""See Me See Me"" and ""Something's Wrong"" similarly straddle the difference between pop and Pops (in the orchestral sense). ""Ballad for Anne Bonney"" and ""Another Day"" show off such a firm grasp of the power of contrasting tones and complementary harmonic motifs that they further belie any lingering suspicion that Hearts & Daggers is some sort of navel-gazing frivolity. No, what makes the disc feel so special despite its relative insignificance is the seriousness with which Haden and Rose take these mini-symphonies, each of which resonates with its own distinct identity despite sharing the same (very) few ingredients. There's a simplicity and innocence at work here that smartly surmounts whimsy to achieve something harder to pin down. Essential? No. Vital? Hardly. But no doubt were you to come across the two blissfully performing at a subway stop, you'd gladly toss a few bucks into the hat and ride home happy and content with the decision as you hum to yourself a few lingering, mysterious melodies.","The second collaboration between Miss Murgatroid (accordion player Alicia J. Rose) and the busy Petra Haden (formerly of the Rentals, the Decemberists, and more) is a beguiling collection of mini-symphonies more moving and less precious than the conceit might initially imply.

Of Great and Mortal Men: 43 Songs for 43 U.S. Presidencies,"J. Matthew Gerken, Christian Kiefer, and Jefferson Pitcher",by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdb65e6ef959693230f9/1:1/w_160/fffe1011.jpg,2008-11-03 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12386-of-great-and-mortal-men-43-songs-for-43-us-presidencies/,Standard,"Politically and musically, it's the perfect time for Of Great and Mortal Men, a 3xCD anthology on which  J. Matthew Gerken, Christian Kiefer, and Jefferson Pitcher write songs for each of the 43 U.S. presidents. Tomorrow, of course, marks the symbolic end of an interminable election cycle that began in earnest with Barack Obama and John McCain's speeches at their parties' 2004 conventions, and has since permeated all corners of American life. Indie rockdom itself is more than ripe for this sort of endeavor, in which the civic-minded children's theatre of Sufjan Stevens' Illinois is blended with currently popular sounds of sepia-toned Americana. Obama announced his candidacy in Lincoln's hometown, while McCain compared him to Herbert Hoover: If there were a time for a folk song about Benjamin Harrison and the tariff flap, it's now. More importantly is what this collection represents: When the electorate is seemingly more engaged with battleground states than, well, real-life battlegrounds, it's important to consider, as Of Great and Mortal Men does, that the dominant narratives we're given are woefully incomplete stories. Though it goes against every fiber of my critical being, I have to award this project significant points for effort. It took shape as Gerken, Kiefer, and Pitcher's effort to write 14 songs in 28 days for the fawm.org website, and quickly expanded to writing 42 songs during February 2006, saving our current leader for last, and with the promise of a new song for tomorrow's victor (we'll hope there's not a line about the Supreme Court or whatever Diebold is calling itself these days). The trio brought in dozens of collaborators to flesh out the demos, and the collection's most recommendable trait is its variety of tone-- from the post-rock muscle of the James K. Polk entry (assisted by Austin band Monahans), to the shaggy Crazy Horse riffing on the second Grover Cleveland piece, which follows the banjo-folk first effort. Rosie Thomas lends a jazz-inspired vocal to the Jimmy Carter number ""A Great Beam of Light"", and James Jackson Toth adds sepuchral ambience to Kiefer's Lincoln portrait, on which he pulls lyrics from his two inaugural addresses and Gettysburg remarks. Indianapolis-based Standard Recording Company packaged the final set with an booklet (hardback would have been much better, but also no doubt prohibitively expensive) containing lyrics and original commissioned artwork for each President, but that's not all: There's a blog as well, which includes production narratives and even advice for educators seeking to use the collection in the classroom. All this would be as worthless as a yard sign on November 5 if the music weren't good, and for the most part, it is. This isn't the Capitol Steps, folks: True to its name, Of Great and Mortal Men underscores the fact that even the most lionized American political icons are made of flesh and bone, subject to strange fates and prone to making massive mistakes only visible in rearview mirrors. Many of these songs are imagined deathbed confessionals masking clever historical revisionism: Kiefer's George Washington, who elementary school history tells us never lied, divulges that ""those dumb asses believed me,"" while a trumpet solo by Cake's Vincent DiFiore lends a nice touch of Colonial ambience. Califone was brought in to arrange and perform Kiefer's ""Such a Marvelous Dream"", in which Ronald Reagan recalls his term in office as a movie role through the haze of dementia, and they also lend a surreal soundscape to Andrew Jackson's defense of his Native American ethnic cleansing: ""And I did it and they stood in the way of God's whole plan."" Bill Callahan's signature baritone is perfect for historical storytelling, and his performance on the John Tyler song ""In Hindsight"" is one of the collection's finest. The music on Great and Mortal is solemn but never blandly reverent, and frequently detours into harrowing territory. Pitcher's approach to John Quincy Adams is as stark as his Ralph Stedman-influenced watercolor in the booklet: ""The icy water runs through the night and awaits my warm skin. Before the rising sun, I will bare all and enter the Potomac."" Magnolia Summer contributes accordion, violin, and lap-steel to the surprisingly uptempo William McKinley offering, written from the perspective of his anarchist assassin, who asserts, ""Let Emma Goldman be the judge of me."" Pitcher allows a distant voice to recite reconstituted notes from one of William Howard Taft's aides, recounting the mundane horrors of the President missing a golf outing due to contracting gout. Xiu Xiu's Jamie Stewart contributes eerie vocals to the collection's chilliest number, a stark post-Great War narrative seemingly written from the perspective of a veteran. New York singer-songwriter Reid Maclean gets the collection's most resonant line, written by Pitcher about bachelor James Buchanan, whose presidency ended in 1861: ""A war it will come to bury lonely me"". The most successful works here are those that stay in an impressionistic pocket, eliding too much detail and staying off the soapbox. Gerken is the most frequent transgressor in this regard, using cited quotations like a term paper (from his Harding song: ""'An army of pompous phrases, moving across the landscape, in search of an idea,' said Bill McAdoo""), and drawing tenuous connections to the current moment, like noting that Martin Van Buren's wife was ""scrubbed from existence in an early attempt to create history simply with talking points"". It should be noted that one of the record's best moments, however, does deal with decidedly non-political material. Called ""Zinger"", Kiefer's ode to James Madison is a tongue-in-cheek, Sufjan-esque paean to First Lady Dolly, now ""known to every sticky fingered chubby from sea to shining sea."" A bit like ""Zinger"" feels exceedingly appropriate at the current moment, as do Gerken's blog-like minor polemics. We're staring down the most important election in a generation, and are exhausted because it's also the most widely documented and thoroughly narrativized, with a film about our current president in theaters before he leaves office and voters asked to make decisions about the next leader of the free world based on hockey-coaching résumés, the words of would-be plumbers, and a candidate's middle name. Bush II has frequently noted that his term in office will be vindicated by historians a century hence, but here's hoping that Kiefer, Pitcher, and Gerken's mini-biography figures into that story: ""We don't need the strength of the world's great minds. We'll just say we're right"". Crowdsource this: Whether the trio's final entry is about a frequently downed pilot who married rich or a skinny half-Kenyan who mines rhetorical gold is crucially, in the end, up to us.","On this 3xCD anthology J. Matthew Gerken, Christian Kiefer, and Jefferson Pitcher write songs for each of the 43 U.S. presidents. Among the many guests are Bill Callahan, Califone, and Xiu Xiu's Jamie Stewart.

Live: Hope at the Hideout,Mavis Staples,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdb7eb335119a49ecf23/1:1/w_160/4f1f6b9a.jpg,2008-11-03 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12387-live-hope-at-the-hideout/,Anti-,"However tomorrow's presidential election turns out, Barack Obama's candidacy is itself a victory. That's what Mavis Staples-- a longtime social justice warrior who marched alongside Martin Luther King, Jr., and soundtracked, with her Staples siblings and father Pops, the civil rights movement-- would likely tell you. Releasing a live album of freedom songs on this election day is a deliberate gesture, but maybe a more nuanced one than people might expect. Staples (like a lot of us), may fervently hope for an Obama win and would probably be the first to enumerate the items remaining on the civil-rights task list, but the gospel/R&B/pop legend has always favored King's peaceful progressive-Christian theology that privileges the ""good news"" over the agitating, even when good news is scant and there's plenty to agitate about. Sounding like a charismatic preacher, Staples frames her performance for the audience, ""We've come here tonight to bring you some joy, some happiness, inspiration, and some positive vibrations! We want to leave you with enough to last you for maybe the next six months"". The crowd that converged on Chicago's cozy, laid-back Hideout this past June are enthused, but polite (and probably a bit awestruck), as she launches with gusto into protest-era standard ""Eyes on the Prize"". For its well-mannered, highly expectant air, it could be an Obama rally. Subdued audience aside, Staples-- even at 69-- is a geyser of ferocity and depth. Her voice gets a little grizzly performing ""Wade in the Water"" in the sub-basement of her (already low) natural range, and she requests crowd participation to bolster her understandably weary pipes on finale ""I'll Take You There"", but her energy is gobsmacking. Following a raucous rendition of ""Freedom Highway"", which the three-piece band plays as a runaway bus on a rural road, culminating in much cymbal smashing and jubilant howls, Staples apologizes, ""I get so all up into it. You know, when the spirit hits you, you've got to move!"" But Staples is no saint. In contrast to her demure, choir-backed performance on 2007's superlative studio album We'll Never Turn Back, she sounds lusty and provocative over ""This Little Light""'s scruffy guitar riffs, veering often in the same phrase between outrage and ""joy-- joy, joy, joy!"" ""Light"" and blues moaner ""Down in Mississippi"" support-- like most great R&B-- he tenet that the sacred and secular, spiritual and carnal aren't mutually exclusive, and that passion is passion whether exercised as faith, anger, love or lust. Considering that these days Staples' fans probably include just as many of the godless as the church-going, her knack for translating religious experience makes her music ecumenical and inclusive unlike, for example, much contemporary Christian rock. That said, probably the most overtly religious number on her setlist, ""Will the Circle Be Unbroken"", a traditional song closely associated with the Carter Family-- and the first Pops taught his Staples brood to perform-- receives the Hideout audience's warmest embrace. Throughout the performance, Staples' band and trio of backup singers are ideal support players-- tight, professional, and mostly unobtrusive, never threatening to upstage Staples the way some of Ry Cooder's (admittedly spectacular) Never Turn Back production fireworks do. Of course, Staples has never been one of those velvet roped-off divas. If Live: Hope at the Hideout captures something her studio work doesn't, it's her approachability, her genuine audience rapport. Like all the great politicians, Mavis Staples has a gift for the common touch.","Releasing a live album of freedom songs on this election day is a deliberate gesture for Mavis Staples; it's a well-deserved one, too, capturing the longtime social justice warrior's ferocity and approachability.

The Sound of the Smiths,The Smiths,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdb5abf31b7dc7155fe6/1:1/w_160/15f5fe1c.jpg,2008-11-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12385-the-sound-of-the-smiths/,Rhino,"The Smiths' discography is small and already well-compiled. In fact, collections that emerged during the band's lifetime, like Louder Than Bombs and Hatful of Hollow, are more or less part of the group's canon. So while it's slightly baffling that a really good one-volume introduction hasn't appeared yet, it's not exactly frustrating. Does this release do the job? The first disc is fine, containing most of the band's singles and a few key album tracks. The second is messier: Halfway between a rarities collection and a deeper investigation of the group's work, it doesn't satisfy on either level. B-Side mavens will wonder where minor tracks like ""I Keep Mine Hidden"" are, while new fans hoping to hear a band at their peak won't bother coming back to pleasant spacefillers like ""Oscillate Wildly"". And with each disc sequenced chronologically, The Sound... ends up telling the same story twice. The story in question is one of the oldest of all: When you've built your art around loneliness and exclusion, what do you do once you find a mass audience? The Smiths' career halves into a kitchen-sink era and a vaudeville one-- in the former, the lives Morrissey sings about are greyer and more limited, the action more realistic, the frustrations rawer. In the latter, kicked off by the music-hall intro to ""The Queen Is Dead"", the misery is exaggerated into archness, the loneliness played more for laughs. The divide isn't absolute-- second single ""This Charming Man"" is as wry and sprightly a record as they ever made; latterday B-Side ""Asleep"" as dark a one. But in general, the early Smiths are a starker proposition: There's a gulf between the band who made 1983's keening ""Jeane"" (""How can you call this a home/ When you know it's a grave"") and the band on 1987's jaunty, frivolous ""Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before"". That's not to say the group got worse. Morrissey's great contribution to pop is a mode of flamboyant loneliness, and it took a while for that to evolve and peak. My favorite Smiths period is the batch of singles around The Queen Is Dead-- the singer in thrillingly confident form, slipping nimbly between the roles of martyr (""Bigmouth Strikes Again""), spokesperson (""The Boy With the Thorn in His Side""), doomsayer (""Panic""), and kindly advisor (""Ask""). The point of the Smiths isn't that their songs were miserable or that their fans were alienated, it's that they showed how to turn the misery into a weapon, a rebellion, a strength, a pose. In this their wildly successful inheritors have been mall-emo teen idols like Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance, bands who've blazed a Morrisseyesque trail into a more traditionally pop demographic. There are two big problems with performing misery, though. First, it's easy for it to set into self-parody. By the time the group split, singles like ""Girlfriend in a Coma"" were setting these alarm bells off-- frothy, fun, but nowhere near as striking as the band's best work. Secondly, it really helps if you have the star power and natural charisma of Morrissey: Bands with less of a frontman could find themselves in a trap, glamorizing a loneliness they could have fought. Your reaction to the Morrissey cult of personality is still likely to determine your reaction to the band as a whole-- grotesquely unfair on guitarist Johnny Marr though that is. It's thanks to him that everything the Smiths did is worth hearing, even when his lyricist is having an off day. His range and ambition as a composer widened through the band's life, and his contributions remained consistently stellar-- from the liquid joy of ""This Charming Man""'s giddy intro to the mock-stately chill of his picking on ""Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me"". His iconic, shuddering phased guitar riffs on ""How Soon Is Now?"" are the reason that track remains the band's best known. Listening to The Sound of the Smiths-- a project overseen by the singer and guitarist-- though, it's Morrissey who still makes an impact. There remains the cold-water shock of their early records-- the rainswept romanticism of ""Hand in Glove"", the double-bluffing whimsy of ""Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now"", and the heartbroken empathy of ""William, It Was Really Nothing"", perhaps their saddest song of all. More than anything, the compilation rehabilitates the band's anger. From ""Still Ill"" through ""Nowhere Fast"" to ""Panic"" the record is full of manifestos, masked by bravado or comedy but with a thread of bloody-minded rage running through them nonetheless. When Morrissey finds a specific target, it results in the band's fiercest music: ""The Headmaster Ritual"" is a thrillingly venomous treat, but Morrissey's agonized howls of ""No, no no!"" on a live ""Meat Is Murder"" are as uncomfortable as intended. If you sympathize, you might find it cathartic; if not, you might think it over-the-top-- a miniature of reaction to the group in general. Morrissey's gestures of refusal aren't especially principled, or philosophical-- they seem to come from a more primal, contrary place: an instinctive comic repulsion towards modernity and its trimmings, a cackle of despair at a world getting shabbier by the day. A very English impulse, this, flailing at a weakening country-- though he emerged in an era where even comfortable conservatism was being shredded, Morrissey is really a piece from an earlier jigsaw puzzle. As their sepiatoned singles sleeves hinted, the Smiths are the pop band England had failed to produce in the late 1950s when the post-war generation was making a spiteful mark on every other artisitc discipline-- poetry, theatre, film, literature. Better late than never.","They're on a very short list of the greatest bands of our time, but do we really need another compilation? This new two-disc introduction, overseen by Johnny Marr and Morrissey, makes its case.

Fucked Up Friends,TOBACCO,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd9f5e6ef959693230c5/1:1/w_160/528c0a1a.jpg,2008-10-31 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12367-fucked-up-friends/,Anticon,"Tobacco is the pseudonym of Tom Fec, architect of the reclusive (and frequently masked) Pittsburgh psychedelic pop outfit Black Moth Super Rainbow. Known for a tendency towards the peculiar (he recently made a mix for XLR8R.com entitled Songs To Get Killed in the Woods To and is rumored to produce tracks somewhere deep in the Pennsylvania forest), Tobacco employs old-fashioned electronic instrumentation such as analog synths and tape machines to create the hallucinatory sounds behind BMSR and his eponymous solo recordings. On Fucked Up Friends, his first companionless LP, Fec puts those toys to use for an effort that veers from his fulltime group's sunny-but-warped electronica and creeps towards a darker brand of instrumental hip-hop. Displaying a knack for forceful beat-driven arrangements that were absent on BMSR's accomplished Dandelion Gum, Tobacco shows here that he can pull off capable leftfield hip-hop, but as an album, Fucked Up Friends lacks focus and variety. On a large majority of the record's 16 tracks (roughly five too many), Tobacco offers only slight variations on the same formula: bend analog synths into twisted melodies and set those atop puddles of tape hiss and clattering, lo-fi boombox beats. It's an intriguing approach that yields a few great songs, but because of the glut of similar material, these standout tracks tend to get lost in a neutralizing fog of sameyness. Fucked Up Friends is at its best when Tobacco lets his beats thump hard, like on mechanical opener ""Street Trash"", which combines gritty ghettoblaster thuds with an industrial, engine-revving groove. Halfway-point overachiever ""Berries That Burn""-- a track that starts on a stolen Boards of Canada astral hum before blasting off with aggressive drum patterns and pitchy siren synths-- also succeeds because of its beat-centric methodology. Friends' lone collaborative contribution comes courtesy of Definitive Jux rapper Aesop Rock-- as always, he's equal parts cleverness and eccentricity-- who lends rhymes to ""Dirt"", another strong cut. While the duet show offs each musician's singular talents, ""Dirt"" also brings into question the album's dearth of guest lyricists elsewhere (""Hawker Boat"" is one of several tracks begging for an MC). Most frustrating, though, is Friends' excess weight; Tobacco seems unwilling to excise material that doesn't contribute to the record's overall vision. ""Hairy Candy"", for instance, is a perfectly decent track, but despite a finger-snapping rhythm, it's virtually identical to the psychedelic stuff on Dandelion Gum-- down to the vocoder-ed chorus. Meandering late-album tracks ""Little Pink Riding Hood"" and ""Tape Eater"" siphon energy away from earlier, stronger material and test the listener's patience with lazy Air-like lunar synths. Utterly pointless ""Get My Nails Did"" and ""--"", meanwhile, comprise just 16 seconds of total album time and seem to exist only for their kooky track names. Ironically, these lackluster songs help to conjure an image of what a better Friends could have been-- namely a shorter LP or a potent EP keeping only the good bits. It's also surprising that Tobacco didn't consider a full-album collaboration with Aesop Rock or invite an assortment of visiting rappers to try on his beats as a traditional hip-hop producer might. Any of those records would have likely garnered more fan interest and provided a more compelling bridge to the next BMSR full-length.","Member of Black Moth Super Rainbow makes his full-length debut, displaying a knack for forceful beat-driven arrangements while hewing closely to his main gig's sound.

Missiles,The Dears,by: Matthew Solarski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd99c0084474cd0c2d2d/1:1/w_160/e1d7f6e7.jpg,2008-10-31 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12359-missiles/,Dangerbird,"If the Dears sound a little deflated on this, their fourth full-length offering, they certainly have that right. The creation of Missiles coincided with (and, it has been suggested, led to) the departure of five-sevenths of the band's most steady and successful lineup thus far. And while surviving Dears (and husband and wife) Murray Lightburn and Natalia Yanchak have since assembled a new seven-piece ensemble, the mounting list of ex-Dears on Wikipedia coupled with the Montreal act's relatively brief existence practically has these guys shifting at a Fall-like pace. Quite a feat for a band that sounds so composed on record and isn't fronted by Mark E. Smith. What's more, Missiles marks a new relationship with yet another record label-- Silverlake, California-based Dangerbird-- meaning the Dears have parted ways with Bella Union abroad and, in these parts, Arts & Crafts, a label not exactly known for artist turnover. Given all this-- plus a few reportedly less than perfect tours and a succession of breakthroughs that never quite happened-- it comes as little surprise that Lightburn began a recent e-newsletter to fans announcing the new record by admitting ""This could have been a message saying that the Dears is over."" Well, the Dears are here to stay for now, and to their credit, they've managed to turn any misgivings they might have about setbacks over the years into their most consistent, and, in a number of ways, most accomplished release to date. It's not without its snags-- we'll get to those-- but Missiles is the sound of the Dears finding their footing again, picking their heads up, wiping their eyes, and pushing forward. And while by no means a knockout comeback, it's a record about coming back, at times hesitant and unsure, but frequently all the more engaging for it. Its thesis, as it were, is right there in the group backing vocal on opening track ""Disclaimer"": a repeated invitation to ""Come back."" Musically, the Dears stay on point on Missiles. They've long excelled at atmosphere, and the tag ""cinematic"" stuck early and has since become adjectival shorthand for the band's sound. It applies here as well, though the group's sense of cinema feels more refined on the whole on the new record. Gone are the days when the Dears would tarnish a perfectly good song with an overcooked outro (see ""Never Destroy Us"" off No Cities Left) or indulge in multi-part epics seemingly for their own sakes. Instead we get subtler touches: the dappled string bits on ""Lights Off"", the brief spray of static that serves as a bridge between ""Meltdown in A Major"" and closing slowburner ""Saviour"", and all sorts of well-employed keyboard embellishments. Even the children's choir-- a red flag-raiser if there ever was one-- is put to great use on that closing track. Sure, it's a pretty obvious move, but how better, sonically, to signify starting over? This newfound restraint sometimes works against the Dears, however. Missiles is a record largely without proper choruses, instead favoring songs that unfold gradually-- a linear approach rather than a cyclical one. Yet with a running time of nearly an hour, this means several tracks that meander and a couple crescendos that feel undeserved. Elsewhere, on ""Dream Job"", Lightburn sings, ""I know that sounds familiar/ 'Cause we've heard it all before,"" and that's certainly true later on ""Berlin Heart"", with its vocal melody too close for comfort to that of Radiohead's ""No Surprises"" (the same track is further hindered by a banjo that sounds out of place). Yet the overall sound on Missiles is, simply put, inviting. That's seldom more evident than on ""Demons"", a multi-part mini-epic that crams just about everything people love about the Dears into exactly five minutes, suggesting these guys may still have that knockout in them. On, then, to the real snag. Like pretty much every Dears record before it, Missiles is hampered to a significant degree by a number of full-on WTF lyrical moments. Aching ballad and title track ""Missiles"" takes on the difficult subject of racism, but any weight it may carry is abruptly shattered when Lightburn describes the song's antagonist as ""cool as a cucumber."" On ""Lights Off"", Lightburn declares, ""Do us all a favor/ Admit the defeat,"" one of several instances where a syllable is awkwardly shoehorned in in deference to a song's meter. And you'd be hard-pressed in any context to defend a line like (from ""Crisis 1 & 2"") ""It's a suicide mission that has us by the balls."" Youch. These ill-advised lyrical moments can be perplexing and occasionally frustrating given the amount of care manifest in the Dears' music, but in a strange way they speak to the band's major non-musical strength: an earnestness decidedly lacking in today's indie landscape. It may be that Lightburn values honesty and straightforwardness above all else in his songwriting, even if that means the occasional cliché or corny conversational turn of phrase. And while there's still no excusing the ""balls"" line, overall even these lyrical shortcomings make a certain sense in light of the record's mood and theme. Indeed, anyone who has been down but decided to pick up again can probably relate: restoring any shattered dignity can wait-- it's all about getting on your feet first. And so, flaws aside, things are looking up for our Dears for the moment, something Lightburn seems to affirm by declaring, ""There will be a next time"" on ""Saviour"". But even if this should prove the final Dears release, it's a fitting farewell: a bittersweet march, slow and steady, off into the twilight.","Don't call it a comeback per se, but the Dears have managed to turn any misgivings they might have about assorted setbacks over the years into their most consistent and inviting release to date.

Fortune,Callers,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bda65e6ef959693230d1/1:1/w_160/bc30514c.jpg,2008-10-31 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12372-fortune/,Western Vinyl,"In a better world, Sara Lucas would have an orchestra behind her-- maybe the tastefully mordant strings you'd hear on a 1960s murder ballad, say, or a Nick Drake album-- to enrich the cracks in her complex voice. Or she'd front a ferocious rock band, exercising those mighty lungs in front of stacks of amps. But on Callers' Fortune, she has just one steady partner. And while guitarist Ryan Seaton provides varied and distinct atmospheres for each song, the backdrops remain spare: room sound colors the mood, and Lucas moans like she has nothing left to sing to. Fortune is barebones, opening with a quick haunter (""Valerie""), followed by a brittle blues that starts: ""I love you/ More than is right."" The loose waltz staggers to the tune of Seaton's staccato guitar, and you can almost hear Lucas staring daggers at a telephone that's not ringing. But this is one of the most desultory tracks: while it's mostly a ballads album rooted in folk and blues, Fortune is also eclectic-- a distant cousin of collaborations like Rustin Man or even Susanna and the Magical Orchestra, where two principals capable of anything try to stretch their reach without shaking off a cozy, morose mood. Each song gets a different setting, from the precise and lush classical guitar on tunes like ""In Blighted Gold"" or the woeful volume pedal on ""Debris"". The atmospheres are strong, and the songs are solid. ""More Than Right"" stands out for its tune and its stumbling tempo, and ""Rone"" has the makings of a memorable, ""Shenandoah""-esque folk song, with its long, languid melody and exquisite pairing of guitars. ""Fortune"", one of the few songs with a rhythm section, makes a powerful setting for Lucas' yearning wails. Other tracks are incidental or merely lovely: their eclecticism keeps Fortune from finding a flow, and ""The Upper Lands"" sticks out as the lone smolder on the album. I waited until the end to mention that Lucas and Seaton hail from New Orleans. They met at a café there, and Lucas has sung and taught around the city. Around the time of Katrina, they moved to Rhode Island, where they recorded Fortune, and then landed in Brooklyn. In songs like ""Debris""-- an exquisite ballad of almost on-the-nose despair-- it's easy to read a connection to Katrina. But this isn't music about one tragedy or one tragic life: it absorbs those particulars to reach and heal a bigger hollowness. Upon listening to Fortune in the car on one of those days last month when the global economy looked like it was going to collapse, I actually had to shut it off because it got to be too much. And of course, that's meant as high praise.","While it's mostly a ballads album rooted in folk and blues, Fortune is also eclectic, as guitarist Ryan Seaton provides varied and distinct atmospheres for each song and Sara Lucas moans like she has nothing left to sing to.

Alight of Night,Crystal Stilts,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdb15e6ef959693230ee/1:1/w_160/38efd942.jpg,2008-10-31 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12381-alight-of-night/,Slumberland,"Every time Brad Hargett mumbles ""existence"" or ""resistance"" on ""The Dazzled""-- track one of Crystal Stilts' debut LP, Alight of Night-- I hear ""market systems."" I'm also pretty sure he mentions exchange rates in ""Prismatic Room"". And I swear that morose, deadpan voice crawling out of ""Spiral Transit""'s sonic swamp is desperately trying to communicate something about business buildings housing holy banks and manufacturing messiahs. Oh, wait: Hargett does actually sing that last bit. So obviously I'm seeking a tonic for the Global Depression ulcer gnawing my gut, anything on which to project and deflect my own fears that it's the end of the world as I know it. Lucid name aside, Crystal Stilts hold up a convenient dark glass. But really, it's a mistake to get hung up on the band's lyrics-- real or imagined. In the tradition of self-titled tracks, ""Crystal Stilts"" does seem to want to say something about their origins and strategic plan. The chorus, ""We're courting dreams/ We're snorting dreams/ Distorting dreams/ Recording dreams,"" surfs waves of gnarly Pacific Coast riffage and gleeful garage organ. But you need a lyric sheet to get even that far, and like their Brooklyn cohorts in Vivian Girls (drummer Frankie Rose's former gig), Crystal Stilts invest little in discrete motifs, neat narratives, or relatable emotions, preferring instead fog-machined setpieces of non-specific mope and gloom. ""Crystal Stilts"" is, in fact, the band's sunniest song. More-typical fare is the punningly titled ""SinKing"" with its chaotic, runaway train rhythm, discordant chordage, and doomed (but also intentionally humorous, surely) cries of ""Sin king/ sinking"", or the blunt, emphatic ""Bright Night"", that scans like a paranoid midnight odyssey to an impossibly distant sunrise. ""Bright Night"", along with five others, appeared earlier this year in more primitive form on the band's self-titled EP, a release that probably made a stronger-- or at least, more concise-- case for Crystal Stilts' disheveled pop. Alight of Night, put out by the recently awakened Slumberland, enjoys a more relaxed vibe and adds a couple keepers to the band's catalogue. But its best songs-- ""Crystal Stilts"", ""Departure"" (originally ""Converging in the Quiet""), ""Shattered Shine""-- are carry-overs. And the long-player packs some less-appealing filler: ""Verdant Gaze"" and ""The City in the Sea"" perform too literal a reading of the Velvet Underground's drony numbers, with dreary results. Since we're on the subject of influence, the band makes no pretense to originality. Hamish Kilgour's public benediction wasn't essential to solving the Crystal Stilts/Kiwi pop equation, and it's a pretty sure bet that Psychocandy bridged the temporal distance between the original girl groups and the band's utilitarian beats. Also, as much as I hate to encourage the Interpol curse, Alight of Night is lousy with Joy Division. It's not just Hargett's dolorous baritone or word-associative post-industrial rumblings, but also the Hook/Sumner-like bass/guitar pas de deux that render many of Crystal Stilts' songs surprisingly amenable to awkward, self-conscious foot-shuffling. If the worst you can say about an album is that it's derivative and harbors a few ho-hum tracks, that ain't much in the liability column-- particularly when said album is stocked with so many good-to-great songs. Crystal Stilts make terrific use of their recycled material, appropriating favorite forebears' brooding moves (and their richly endowed signifiers), and contributing their own deft hooks and stealth energy. ""Departure"" would be an unlikely anthem most seasons, but in this autumn of our discontent its single-minded, breathlessly chugging bass, no-bullshit beats, elegiac keys, and chiming guitar raising the melody above the muck... it's perfect. ""Departure""'s the song you reach for when you want to party like it's 1929.","Like their Brooklyn cohorts in Vivian Girls, the Kiwi pop-loving Crystal Stilts invest little in discrete motifs, neat narratives, or relatable emotions, preferring instead fog-machined setpieces of non-specific mope and gloom.

4:13 Dream,The Cure,by: Nitsuh Abebe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdb013d197565213b5cc/1:1/w_160/9b07e82a.jpg,2008-10-31 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12380-413-dream/,Geffen,"I can sympathize with Robert Smith. By all accounts, the process of making a record grows more grueling and frustrating with every passing year-- leave alone the headaches of making one under a name as closely watched as the Cure's. There are administrative hassles, label dealings, producers and directions to decide on, and the personalities and egos of an entire band to manage. These things can be draining-- they can eclipse the love of making music that gets people to start bands in the first place. And most people, by the time they hit Smith's age, have reached a level of perspective and maturity where they're not about to bash their heads against walls over anything that's not really, really important; they're more interested in doing the work that makes them happy and comfortable. This seems to be the position Smith has come to. He's described the band's last recording stint as ""the most intense and difficult three months that I have spent with other people who I thought I knew""-- three months that produced ""the most fraught album I've ever been involved in."" (Both claims that, considering the rest of this band's biography, are really saying something.) He's changed his methods accordingly. For 4:13 Dream, the group has been reassembled as a four-piece, and optimized for a comfortable live-band feel-- filled with people Smith can happily ram through his songs with. He's also joined up with producer Keith Uddin, who's taken a no-frills ""live"" approach to the band's sound. Smith-- and the band's press agents-- say this has been invigorating, that the Cure has stripped back to an unfussy rock band in a studio, bringing out all the happy creativity that might have been hemmed in by all those headaches and difficulties. Certain buzzwords keep popping up around it all: rawness, energy, spontaneity. And across the length of the six-minute opener, ""Underneath the Stars"", it's tempting to believe the hype. Uddin gives the band an immense, spacious sound-stage, with dense trails of reverb shooting out behind guitars and vocals, and the group fills it happily, sounding unclenched, loose, energetic, and elegant. The same goes double for the closer, ""It's Over"", which has the Cure sounding as convincingly frenzied as it has since parts of Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me. A few songs in, though, I can't help but notice a problem with this. Two songs appear in a row, ""Freakshow"" and ""Sirensong"". The former is the sort of track the Cure would once have turned into something creepy or yowling, somewhere between ""Lullaby"" and ""Hot Hot Hot!!!""; the latter's a gliding romance, something like ""A Letter to Elise"" or ""One More Time"". And yet the free-wheeling, unstudious approach of this album leaves them sounding curiously similar, more or less abandoning one of the things that's made the Cure so legendary: This is a band that has always been fantastic with atmosphere, able to make single tracks stand alone as incredible aesthetic experiences of their own. This is a band that has thrived on mood and detail! But listening to 4:13 Dream feels like something else-- it's like listening to a rangy, carefree live recording of songs that exist in much more specific forms on a record somewhere back at home. You stand in Uddin's arena enjoying that show, but the songs that pour out aren't reflecting off the crisp album tracks you loved before you arrived-- in some cases, they're reflecting off modes from the band's back catalog, prompting you to fill in details based on where you know the band might once have taken this music. Before you object, let me assert that this isn't just a problem for people overly beholden to the Cure's past; there are times when it seems to be infecting the songwriting itself, which can feel as loose and blurry as the performances. Obligatory bursts of dark drama aside, this is one of the band's happier records, and it hits its peaks two-thirds of the way through, with a string of lilting pop songs. But for a ""pop"" record, a lot of tracks here seem poorly framed, even half-baked, as if Smith's ""spontaneous"" approach-- his attempts to capture the raw energy of his demos-- have kept him from putting as much attention into the organization of his songs, the flow of the parts, the clarity of the melodies, the ludicity of the lyrics, or even the firmness of the ideas behind them. Which is really something, given that Smith wrote two albums' worth of songs for this record: Is it possible he's reinvigorated his creativity by letting himself be a bit slapdash, by not focusing long enough on any one of those tracks? The great saving grace, of course, is the one critics are duty-bound to mention-- the fact that even a slightly doughy Cure record, one that doesn't entirely play to the group's former strengths, still only descends to the level of a fairly good album. (If the Cure were debuting today with this record, they'd be celebrated for Smith's voice, still incredible, alone.) There are memorable songs here, from the gorgeous refrains of ""The Hungry Ghost"" to the dizzily happy ""This. Here and Now. With You""; there are times when they break out the wah pedals and whip up storms with an infectious happiness. The only problem is that the rambling approach that let Smith get these things out has kept the results from being all they might have been.","The Cure regroup as a four-piece, optimized for a comfortable live-band feel, under the baton of modern rock producer Keith Uddin to attempt to capture a raw, invigorating sound.

Summer Palace,Sunny Day Sets Fire,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd935e6ef959693230ab/1:1/w_160/db7047ce.jpg,2008-10-30 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12354-summer-palace/,IAMSOUND,"For a band comprised of geographically disparate members releasing their first album, Summer Palace shows that Sunny Day Sets Fire know their emotional and sonic niches well. Granted, there's plenty of space to explore between the infinitesimal and the impossibly huge, and there's not much untrod ground in songs about love and nature, but at its best, Palace showcases the band's skill at making small things-- like Mauro Remiddi's mouse-like voice-- rise to meet the enormity of their surroundings. When it goes astray, though, the record reflects the inherent danger contained in the band's name: What begins as simple radiance can spread beyond control if not properly contained. Palace's muscular, hook-laden jangle-pop underscores its pervasive romanticism, in both senses of the word. First, the definition with a capital ""R"": Like a chipper Ralph Waldo Emerson, Remiddi seeks to escape the confines of modern life and revel in the simple, solitary joys of the outdoors. On ""Stranger"", he wants to take a walk, to see ""how it feels to be alone,"" and he notes in ""Wilderness"" that, in order to comprehend nature, one must ""start to see differently, like the painters do."" ""Teenagers Talking"" and ""Lack of View"" both deal with falling down. In the latter, it's occasioned by ""hurricanes and thunders""; in the former, it's a possible outcome of embarrassment. The anthemic ""All Our Songs"" also contains the line ""everyone's scared to fall,"" but the song marks Palace's easy transition to the interpersonal definiton of romance, while keeping one eye on the external surroundings. Over rumbling drums, Remiddi sings, ""May the darkness in me be the light in you,"" with a melismatic falsetto emphasis on ""light."" He's not the world's most emphatic suitor, though, and ""Smallest Heart on Earth"" veers too close to the Chris Martin/Ben Gibbard realm of overly coy romantic panhandling: ""I don't want to bother you, just look what I found."" Despite a similar sentiment in ""End of the Road"" (""If you don't mind, I'd like to get lost with you""), the song more than makes up for it, detouring from its dark twang into a stop-start ""Apache"" breakdown at its conclusion. Bits of mischief like that happen regularly on Palace, but occasional indulgences (like the six-minute-plus runtime of ""Heart"") push the boundaries of Sunny Day's strengths a bit too far. The mid-record ballad ""Siamese"" grinds momentum to a halt, pushing the already pervasive cuddliness of to the point of patience-testing, and ""Brainless"" is a goofy Polyphonic Spree/Flaming Lips pastiche that doesn't do the band any favors. ""Adrenaline"", a squiggly, hyperactive electronic lament to excess energy, is where Sunny Day should start for album two: It's fine to be overwhelmed and anxious, but take a few deep breaths before committing the resulting ideas to song, lest you recreate those same feelings in your listeners.","The debut album from a band of geographically disparate members showcases their skill at making small things-- like singer Mauro Remiddi's mouse-like voice-- rise to meet the enormity of their surroundings.

White Van Music,Jake One,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd98ea9e61561daa7730/1:1/w_160/d10a66d6.jpg,2008-10-30 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12358-white-van-music/,Rhymesayers,"If reading rap-related internet message boards has taught us anything (aside from how to wildly and inaccurately judge a person's character based on their record collection), it's that you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who'll go to bat for De La Soul, G-Unit, and the rap career of WWE wrestler John Cena in equal measure. But Seattle-based producer Jake One actually did beats for all of them, and the further you go into his résumé, the more confounding it gets: last year alone he contributed beats to Young Buck's thugged-out Buck the World, Lifesavas' conscious-rap concept album Gutterfly and Turf Talk's hyphy hit West Coast Vaccine (The Cure). But can a producer who's that versatile and mercenary manage to come up with an album's worth of beats that coheres enough to give you a one-shot sense of what it is he actually does stylistically? Turns out that he can, if White Van Music is any indication. The good thing about Jake One cultivating such a diverse Rolodex is that he works like he's broken every stylistic and regional niche into its compound elements. The way the beat knocks is priority-- typified by densely-packed drums and thick, skulking basslines-- while everything else he incorporates, from simple piano and synth loops to shards of melodic vocal snippets to heavy funk guitar, is just there to be ushered along by the rhythm. There's enough diversity of mood from track to track-- foreboding gospel soul, spy-flick twang, slow-rolling electric-piano iciness-- but it's all tied together using that elemental 85-95 BPM 4/4 rhythmic backbone that anyone from any scene can rock over. And if you want a litmus test or two, he's brought on a ridiculously wide range of regional voices to prove he can back up damn near anyone's lyrics. This lineup almost looks like the names brought up in an unusually open-minded rap fan's shuffle mode: MF Doom muttering intricately blunted phraseology (""Trap Door"", which boasts the aforementioned 007 vibe) followed up by Young Buck sneering workmanlike death threats (vague David Banner homage ""Dead Wrong""), a lyrical contortionist's field day in an Elzhi/Royce Da 5'9"" Detroit double-feature (the gleaming, brassy soul of ""Glow"") delivered after a slow-spitting showcase for the gravel-voiced hyphy pioneer Keak da Sneak (the sparsely twinkling ""Soil Raps""), Dilla-heir Black Milk and neo-g-funk vet Nottz put together on the same track (""I'm Coming"") just because they were two of Jake's favorite rapping producers. (""Maybe if I wasn't a terrible rapper I would have done a verse too,"" he jokes in the liner notes.) That kitchen-sink approach also makes for a couple inspired team-ups, even if two of the best ones were thrown together after the fact: Freeway recorded his verse for ""The Truth"" in the unfulfilled hopes that Jay-Z and Kanye would show up, and Jake One plugged in a blazing verse from Brother Ali instead; an unused beat meant for Nas (""Oh Really"") got turned over to Posdnous from De La and had a typically smart-assed verse from Slug appended to it. And even if Prodigy's verse on ""White Van"" only lasts about twenty seconds, hearing him on the same track as Alchemist and Evidence means that tenuous connection between Dilated Peoples and Mobb Deep gets a little more solidified. The flaw with White Van Music is that the lineup of lyricists just about guarantees that most heads will run across at least one track featuring an MC they can't stand. But the quality of the beats easily overcomes the somewhat odd novelty of hearing backpackers in close quarters with hardcore rappers, and with each listen it starts feeling more and more natural to have an all-star CD where M.O.P. and Little Brother both have hot tracks. Jake One isn't a household name-- yet-- and his beats might not be instantly recognizable as the work of a singular visionary, but if he can get all these disparate artists under the same roof and come out of it with a consistently enjoyable album, he's pulled off a hell of a feat nonetheless","The versatile producer brings in a ridiculously wide range of regional voices-- Freeway, Posdnous, MF Doom, Little Brother, many more-- as if to prove he can back up damn near anyone's lyrics.

Jeanius,Jean Grae,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdadeb335119a49ecf11/1:1/w_160/3580e229.jpg,2008-10-30 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12378-jeanius/,Blacksmith,"Jean Grae has always been a fascinating if somewhat perplexing presence in underground hip-hop; as an artist and lyricist, she's capable of both traumatic vivid  imagery and lighthearted just-fuckin'-around comedy, quick-witted tongue-twisting and conversational observation, send-you-home-crying battle raps and gripping narrative storytelling. Unfortunately, every time she's seemed on the brink of some major breakthrough, something somewhere gets thrown off the rails. Jean has every right and reason to be as well-known as, at the very least, the Roots and Talib Kweli (who she's collaborated with successfully over the last few years). But for whatever reason-- bootleggers, disillusionment, label jerk-around moves, the industry's inability to properly market a female artist who operates more as a superhuman MC than as a sex symbol-- she's wound up operating closer to the fringes than someone with her experience and skill deserves, wavering between contemplations of retirement and selling 16-bar guest appearances on Craigslist. So it's easy to wonder what things'd be like for her if Jeanius came out as scheduled, way back in 2004, rather than earlier this summer. That's because it's the kind of album you pull out when you want to convince a friend that this rapper he hasn't heard can do all this incredible shit, a potential career-definer that people can turn to when they want to quickly and definitively sum up the qualities of an artist with one easily-recommendable release. Longtime heads have known this for a while now; when the album leaked four years back and subsequently got shelved, it became one of those cause-celebre great lost albums like the Ghostface/MF DOOM Swift & Changeable collab or Q-Tip's original 2006 draft of Live at the Renaissance. When Jeanius finally did drop legit on Kweli's Blacksmith label with little changed but some of the track titles, the familiarity had already set in-- which means this album's had a presidential term's worth of time to establish itself as a contemporary classic. Jean the battler is in top form, and the half of the album where she goes about the business of shit-talking is superb: ""You don't like the way I flow/ 'She needs more emotion, though'/ I'll give you emotion, it's you, holdin' your broken nose""; ""controversy works, and plus I got a pussy/ But even with that, people scared to push me/ Who's a pussy first?""; ""Fuck the hearsay, please, Jean's superior/ Y'all yellow, same color of your bladder's interiors."" But her ability to convincingly go from supreme self-confidence to moments of doubt and personal tragedy reveal what a complete, relatable and human MC she is-- whether it's something like the self-aware battles with her own hard-headed personality traits on ""Don't Rush Me"", or ""My Story""'s harrowing confessional of her post-abortion experiences-- or on ""Desperada"", where she pledges to overcome it all and come out stronger on the other end. Jean's been accused of sounding cold and monotone by dudes who apparently forgot what made slick, collected cats like Guru and Erick Sermon great, but to these ears her flow sounds like a laser-focused, clear-spoken declaration of strength and perseverance. All these emotional facets need a solid, consistent sound to keep them tied all together, and 9th Wonder is at the top of his game here, providing the bulk of Jeanius' production (with a couple tracks from fellow North Carolinians Khrysis and Fatin). At their best, 9th's beats do a good job of carrying tracks without making themselves the center of attention, but here they stand as some of his finest work because of how well he balances between heart-pulsing, head-nod beats and moody, grey-skied atmosphere: the piano/choir loop in ""Don't Rush Me"" sticks with you because it somehow pulls off the trick of sounding triumphant and mournful at the same time, and the way the ""Top Billin'""-in-a-straitjacket drums complement the recurring dubbed-out mournful vocal snippet from the Marvelettes' ""Uptown"" gives ""Billy Killer"" a strong, chilling undercurrent of jealous fury that Jean's lyrics etch into stone. Word has it Jean Grae and 9th are working on a grip of tracks for an upcoming release, Phoenix, and if that album's anywhere near as good as this one, we should finally stop having to ask ""what if"" and move on to ""how far.""","If you first heard this 9th Wonder-produced album from the hottest-spitting woman in rap when it was leaked back in 2004, its commercial release will hopefully remind you how damn good it is.

Festival Thyme EP,...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdac5e6ef959693230e3/1:1/w_160/64e172ef.jpeg,2008-10-30 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12377-festival-thyme-ep/,Richter Scale,"Just as the earliest recordings of ...And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead betrayed a great stylistic debt to the tuneful dissonance of Sonic Youth, their 2002 debut for Interscope, Source Tags & Codes, highlighted another important lesson learned from their alt-rock forebears: How to trade up to major-label patronage without losing your cool. Rather than compromise Trail of Dead's punk-prog grandeur, Source Tags' bolstered recording budget allowed them to fully exploit those dichotomies, coaxing the melodic beauty out of the discord while infusing the band's signature crash-endos with apocalyptic heft. But if the early chapters of Trail of Dead's history defied the usual indie-to-major sell-out script, their more recent history has sadly reverted to the usual clichés: First came the dismissal of bassist Neil Busch (the band's unsung George Harrison/John Entwhistle figure) amid rumors of drug abuse, followed by two increasingly overblown albums (2005's Worlds Apart and 2006's So Divided) that steered the band into ""November Rain"" power-ballad territory and failed to capitalize on Source Tags' momentum. And where Trail of Dead shows used to climax with the orgiastic destruction of their equipment, they were starting to take their frustration out on each other. In the context of this unfortunate decline, the band's fall 2007 tour with ""Metalocalypse"" cartoon thrashers Dethklok would thus qualify as their Spinal Tap/Puppet Show nadir. However, like the breakdown/rebuild structures that figure in so many of their songs, Trail of Dead are positioning themselves for, if not an all-out comeback, then at least a back-to-basics rethink. This past summer saw core songwriters Conrad Keely and Jason Reece playing a handful of shows in a duo format for the first time since the band's initial 1994 formation, while the inevitable parting of ways with Interscope has inspired Trail of Dead to launch their own label, Richter Scale, presumably named for the song (""Richter Scale Madness"") that first introduced the band to the world 10 years ago. But if these developments hint at a return to the slash'n'burn guitar carnage of the band's 1998 self-titled debut, the first Richter Scale release, the Festival Thyme EP, tells a different story. As a preview of the band's as yet untitled sixth album, the four-song EP (available in mp3 and vinyl formats) still finds Keely leaning more heavily on the piano than the distortion pedal, and wild-card singing drummer Reece is once again relegated to a silent-partner role. But at least it shows Trail of Dead can effectively deliver the pomp without the pomposity. Opening track and new-album teaser ""Bells of Creation"" (presented here in an alternate ""machete mix"") is emblematic of the band's transitory state: the verse melody echoes Source Tags' ""It Was There That I Saw You"" and the storming, mid-section surge sounds like another ""Another Morning Stoner"", but the stately presentation (ringing piano chords, martial drumbeat) and whiny, overdriven chorus (""I felt like Saaattaaann..."") are more beholden to the band's recent modern-rock-oriented M.O. ""Inland Sea"" (presented in ""edit"" form) follows a similar piano-ballad-gone-ballistic template but doesn't overdo either part of that equation, as Keely's ascending vocal line nicely complements the song's upward sweep, and the climactic instrumental build feels like a natural product of the song's momentum rather than a grafted-on mid-song detour. Festival Thyme's vinyl version replaces ""Inland Sea"" with an unlikely cover of the Replacements' ""Within Your Reach"", Trail of Dead's second attempt at fleshing out a lo-fi indie-rock classic (following So Divided's take on Guided by Voices' ""Gold Heart Mountaintop Queen Directory""), but arguably the EP's biggest curveball is the its track. Living up to its medieval moniker, ""Festival Thyme"" is a spirited folk stomp that's a close cousin to Sigur Rós' recent handclap-happy single ""Gobbledigook"", and it succeeds where Trail of Dead's recent forays into proggy pop have faltered, favouring a playful, campfire presentation over heavy-handed orchestration. It's too soon to say if the track signals a new avenue for Trail of Dead to explore, or if it's just a one-off lark; Festival Thyme's closer, ""The Betrayal of Roger Casement & the Irish Brigade"", is a typically calamitous instrumental that returns us to the piano-stoked melodrama of the EP's first two tracks, but the gaudy, almost Elton John-like (c.f. ""Funeral for a Friend"") flourishes and phased-out, Eddie Hazel-esque wah-wah noodling are kept in check by an undercurrent of corrosive guitar textures. Grammar buffs will recognize that the song is named after the Irish nationalist who was tried for treason in 1916 and ""hung by a comma"" due to poorly punctuated English law, and perhaps Trail of Dead feel like they too have been judged far too harshly in the court of rock-crit opinion in recent years. If that's the case, then Festival Thyme shows there's still enough fight in them to earn a reprieve.","After two increasingly overblown albums, Trail of Dead are positioning themselves for, if not an all-out comeback, then at least a back-to-basics rethink; as a preview of the band's as yet untitled sixth album, this four-song EP shows the group can effectively deliver the pomp without the pomposity.

Cardinology,Ryan AdamsThe Cardinals,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bda8eb335119a49ecf08/1:1/w_160/9790963a.jpg,2008-10-30 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12374-cardinology/,Lost Highway,"People have been feeling disappointed by Ryan Adams for almost as long as they've been liking him. When his band Whiskeytown leaped to the fore of the then-burgeoning alt-country movement with its classic 1995 debut, Faithless Street, Adams seemed like nothing less than a savior, a recklessly prodigal kid equally informed by punk rock and archetypal C&W.  However, it soon seemed Adams' legendary petulance wasn't some enfant terrible act, but the manifestation of a self-absorbed temperament that has marked his output to this day. It's hard to say whether this penchant for navel-gazing was always lurking inside Adams, or if the combined influences of New York City and minor celebrity produced it. Either way, over the past several years he's recognized his true calling as a quintessential singer-songwriter and subsequently shown himself to be solipsistic in the truest sense of the word. Adams really doesn't seem capable of imagining a world outside of himself anymore, and it's his greatest artistic downfall. His music rarely strives to connect or communicate with other people, and even at its best is exactly only as compelling as Adams himself is compelling. Throughout his career, Adams has always seemed to be more successful the more closely he's hewn to his country roots, whether it be on his acclaimed 2000 solo debut Heartbreaker or 2005's unexpectedly strong Jacksonville City Nights. My guess as to why is that country's narrative and musical strictures keep Adams honest, toeing the line rather than wallowing in the moony murk that has characterized so much of what this too-prolific man has released in the past decade, including his newest effort with his band the Cardinals, Cardinology. Cardinology, like Easy Tiger or Cold Roses or Love Is Hell or you get the idea, is melodically sound, remarkably insular and largely unaffecting. It's all soft edges, and its punches feel like pillow fights. ""Born Into a Light"" is an admittedly solid opener, featuring some nice fingerpicking and evoking a rare sense of community, a generosity likewise echoed in ""Let Us Down Easy"". Unsurprisingly, these are the two songs most noticeably tinged by southern rural musical traditions, in this case an appealingly finessed mix of country and gospel. Early offerings ""Go Easy"" and ""Fix It"" aren't half-bad either, well-sung and fuller musically than much of Adams' other recent material, though it's hard to shake the recognition that even his most sonically vibrant moments are often forced to contend with his whininess. Following those pleasantly modest, Paste-worthy beginnings, however, Adams draws the blinds entirely and Cardinology starts sliding into self-indulgent banality of a sort so pinched and uninviting it makes Conor Oberst seem like Will Rogers (and I'm not even counting the butt-rock red herring ""Magick,"" which makes you wonder what Adams actually hears when he listens to the Rolling Stones or New York Dolls). The dreary ""Cobwebs"" is emblematic of the myopic stuff Adams has been doing ever since he hitched his star to the likes of Winona Ryder and Parker Posey, outfitted with an oh-so-typical reference to 5th Avenue and actually including the line ""if I fall will you pity me?"" The likes of ""Crossed Out Name"" and ""Natural Ghost"" do attest to Adams' reliably solid melodic sense but still come off wrapped up and wearying, while ""Sink Ships"" burns a good line about remembering ""you laughing/ Coming up the rickety stairs"" with a ridiculous central metaphor likening the search for love with filling out a job application. It's just one more reason why Adams shouldn't be putting Cardinology on his résumé.","People have been feeling disappointed by Ryan Adams for almost as long as they've been liking him, and-- although he always seemed to be more successful the more closely he's hewn to his country roots-- here he apes the melodically sound but insular self he displayed on Easy Tiger or Cold Roses or Love Is Hell.

It’s Midnight in Honolulu,Palms,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd8aea9e61561daa7717/1:1/w_160/32b733db.jpg,2008-10-29 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12347-its-midnight-in-honolulu/,Rare Book Room,"Palms are deadly serious. Recent signees to Nicolas Vernhes' Rare Book Room imprint, the avant-pop duo's stock-in-trade is icy minimalism, a grave sparseness that sometimes borders on frightening. Their debut, the peculiarly titled It's Midnight In Honolulu, is Rare Book's second LP release, and it explores these dark tones through the lens of mostly German influences-- repetitive kosmische musik and Kompakt-style electronics, principally-- while looking to simultaneously appropriate vintage art rock of the early Velvet Underground. These inspirations come into clearer focus when one considers the band's geography. Consisting of multi-instrumentalist/singer Ryan Schaefer and vocalist Nadja Korinth, Palms' only two members live with a literal ocean between them. Schaefer resides in New York and Korinth in Berlin. Not surprising, then, that some of New York and Germany's iconic underground acts-- here, Faust and Neu! share the same space with VU-- should provide the template for Palms' sound. Palms at this point are probably too inexperienced to pursue a style with this kind of historical debt. Which might be why some portions of It's Midnight In Honolulu-- a promising record with several gratifying stretches-- come across as stilted and overthought. When Korinth shrieks atop ""Monte Alban""'s pulsating minimal synths, it feels like the duo is aiming for difficulty rather than quality. The same goes for ""Hang Your Head"", one of a handful of rock-leaning numbers. With short bursts of Rid of Me-style aggression, the song also sacrifices its listenability to chase some sense of rawness or importance. Ironically, though, it's ""New Moon"", Honolulu's warmest and loosest track, that provides the album's standout moment. A downright gorgeous song, it drifts like a vessel making its way out to sea, gliding and bobbing amidst a skittering arrangement that brings to mind Wolfgang Voigt's Gas project and standouts from Kompakt's Pop Ambient series. Korinth's vocals are at their most expressive here, sounding not unlike a female version of Sigur Rós' Jónsi Birgisson. Since Palms manage this tender, textural ambience with such ease, it's hard not to wonder why they chose not to explore it further. The bulk of Honolulu's material is less divisive than the tracks outlined above, falling somewhere on the quality scale between the distant poles of ""Monte Alban"" and ""New Moon"". Stylistically, the remaining songs are split almost evenly between frosty electro-pop and sparse VU-style stompers, and Palms are usually able to yield positive results from both methods. The emotive ""Das Lowenfell"" is probably the best illustration of the former approach; the track utilizes military style drums, acoustic guitars, and synthetic flourishes as a canvas for Korinth to paint her gloomy half-German, half-English vocals. Also effective is ""Boundary Waters"", a spooky industrial number comprising rapid-fire beats and siren snatches that takes its cues from dark techno acts such as the Knife. ""End of Term"" and ""Leather Daddies"", meanwhile, represent Honolulu's proto-punk section, and while these songs manage a capable (and often enjoyable) impression of 1960s skronk, it's nothing we haven't heard countless times before. And that's part of the reason Honolulu isn't as good as it could be-- the band seems more interested in modernizing classic records of the past instead of forging its own path. Their cold seriousness also treads much too closely to that ever-perilous point of becoming pretentious. Still, if Palms can manage to let their hair down a bit and locate their own voice, there's no reason this band can't go places.","Recently signed to Nicolas Vernhes' Rare Book Room imprint, this Berlin/New York duo rework underground sounds past and present (VU-style art rock, krautrock, Kompakt-style electronics) into new configurations.

Does You Inspire You,Chairlift,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd90eb335119a49eceda/1:1/w_160/400f2e0e.jpg,2008-10-29 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12351-does-you-inspire-you/,Kanine,"Chairlift's ""Bruises"", the most immediately catchy and memorable song on the band's debut Does You Inspire You, directly suggests its own video treatment. Imagine: an impossibly cute and dying-to-please young girl sets a camera on a tripod in her backyard and does a series of well-intentioned, but ultimately failed tumbling moves to prove her adoration of a significant other. It's almost enough to trump the fact that Apple recently licensed the song for an ad and made their own associations with it, namely a line of Nanos bleeding brightly colored paint. Not quite as cute, but if we use former Pitchfork contributor Nick Sylvester's metric for Apple's aims with ad music-- that it should sound close enough to a familiar iconic song but come at a much cheaper price-- ""Bruises"" works perfectly. At a time when most of us can still summon ""Young Folks"" and (the famously iPodded) ""1234"" from memory, and ""Bruises""-- a whiff of soul, but a stronger aroma of feminine allure mixed with little-girl naïvete-- is a more than obvious choice. Inspire can't match the precious glee of ""Bruises"" over its uneven length, but the trio tries from different angles, toying with several other ideas. They live in Brooklyn and are touring with Yeasayer, so if you guessed ""thick, vaguely Far-Eastern new age haze"" is one of their schticks, you're not too far off. It's put to best use on album-opening ""Garbage"", which sounds like nothing else right now, musically or ideologically. Over an oddly retro-futuristic palette, something like the synth-jazz theme song to a kitschy 1970s detective drama, Caroline Polachek laments the ever-increasing mountains of post-consumer detritus (VCRs, condoms and the like) like she feverishly wrote the lyrics on the way home from WALL-E. Depending on your vantage, the differently alluring ""Planet Health"" could be drawn from two different worlds: The exotic sci-fi realm the title suggests, or the forgotten domain of proudly Orientalist synth-pop group Japan, on whose 1981 album Tin Drum its slap-bass, gong, and what sounds like a high-pitched koto would fit nicely. Polachek proves on ""Garbage""-- a high-concept bit of musical eco-sympathy-- that lyrical subtlety isn't always her first priority, but the ""Planet Health"" line ""I was trained in diversity, in the garden of puberty"" drops a ""Space Olympics""-level of awkwardness into a song that otherwise was losing me in its atmosphere. The title should give enough indication about this particular planet's topography, but to be specific, there exists a ""food pyramid"" and a ""desert of vitamins"" in this far-off world. Other than the Human League-suggesting ""Evident Utensil"" (that utensil, coincidentally enough for rhyming purposes, is a pencil), the rest of Inspire feels distant and thin, with minor songs buried beneath a veil of mystique. Most often, that aura switches from the final frontier, to, well, the frontier. ""Somewhere Around Here"" is ersatz Cowboy Junkies, and ""Earwig Town"" and ""Don't Give a Damn"" nod toward Southwestern twang and straight-up country, but not convincingly. And that's understandable, of course: Chairlift are young and curious, still testing sounds on the way to a unique aesthetic, which parts of Inspire shows they are capable of achieving. While ""Bruises"" proves that a well-done song that sounds like other songs can make people take brief notice, Inspire mostly proves that recycling isn't the only answer.","Brooklyn band whose ""Bruises"" wound up in an iPod commercial debuts with a scattered album that veers from hazy, new age-infused pop to moody Southwestern twang.

Plutonium Blonde / Dream Logik Part Two,The Legendary Pink DotsEdward Ka-Spel,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd8d13d197565213b579/1:1/w_160/7dee9102.jpg,2008-10-29 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12349-plutonium-blonde-dream-logik-part-two/,ROIR,"The Legendary Pink Dots don't just live in their own world-- in a lot of ways, they are their own world. It's a world that doesn't change at the same pace as ours. In fact, it scarcely has changed at all in almost thirty years. While irony is king in the world we're trapped in most of the time, irony doesn't even seem to exist in LPD land. The music is weird and willfully obscure, but it's honestly weird and unpretentiously obscure. It's a neat place to escape to if you're willing to buy into the strange aural juxtapositions and Edward Ka-Spel's r-less enunciation and odd lyrical predilections. ""My learning curve was so acute it formed a perfect circle/ My whole wide world was virtual so I sank back in my shell,"" we hear on the opening lines from ""Cubic Caesar"", giving a fair measurement of the band's collective brainwave. Like many of their records, Plutonium Blonde flows like a stream of unconsciousness, morphing with shocking suddenness from twitching synth patterns and washes of pink noise to, say, a lovely banjo line that accompanies a sing-songy ode to the mailman. Addled sax wanders in and out, the band flirts with a brand of English folk that sounds like the soundtrack for a Ren Faire for Robots, and at the middle of it is Ka-Spel, who sings like a man with the mind of a mystic and the disposition of a child. The most brutal passage on the album is the last portion of ""Oceans Blue"", where barely anything happens at all-- the soft-toned keyboard that plays an intermittent chord is surrounded by silence so dense it's malevolent. This adds up to a whole that can be at once ominous, fantastical, wondrous, and above all unique. If listening to LPD is like visiting another world, listening to Ka-Spel's latest solo outing, Dream Logik Part Two, is like ducking into someone else's mind for a quick pint. Dream logic does indeed seem to be the organizing principle of a record Ka-Spel performs on his own, though he does credit ""Ghosts"" with ""the bits in between"" all the instruments he plays. He credits himself variously with ""broken things"" and ""technological wonders,"" and his dream world produces some weirdly lucid and accessible moments, though these are all surrounded by sped-up alien voices, passages of beatless drift, sour baroque keyboard figures, spoken word bits that sound as though recorded in large, wet rooms, straight, scraping noise, and a paean to a centipede named Cedric wherein the main rhythm is at first supplied by Ka-Spel counting to three in German. Suffice to say, if you're not already a fan of the Dots, this is likely not the place to start, though if you are a fan, have at it. I need to mention the quite astounding artwork for the Ka-Spel disc. It's a multi-panel, book-bound fold-out deal that conceals a slipcase and it's covered in psychotic, psychedelic Bosch portraits by artist Jesse Peper. It is a substantial package to say the least. The Dots artwork isn't nearly as spectacular, but the album is another invitingly strange foray into their singular way of doing things, and one that will undoubtedly please their cult.",,6.9,
Love Is Overtaking Me,Arthur Russell,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bda95e6ef959693230db/1:1/w_160/92942c7b.jpg,2008-10-29 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12375-love-is-overtaking-me/,Audika,"In the four years since Audika began releasing the much-loved but less easy to find music of composer and producer Arthur Russell, his popularity has soared. Particularly striking a chord with a younger generation of musicians, many have enthusiastically championed his progressive and influential sound. In 2007, Jens Lekman arranged the brief but tenderly constructed EP, Four Songs By Arthur Russell, which featured imaginative covers by Joel Gibb, Vera November, and Taken By Trees. Meanwhile, artists including Chris Taylor of Grizzly Bear (who digitally restored and edited Love Is Overtaking Me), St. Vincent, and DFA's James Murphy have effused about their admiration for his distinctively free-flowing, compelling arrangements. As Matt Wolf's perceptive, beautifully shot film, Wild Combination: A Portrait of Arthur Russell, reveals, Arthur Russell quite literally had hundreds of tape reels documenting the material he recorded, from his first compositions in the early 1970s to the very last made in 1991, a year before he died of AIDS in New York City. Love Is Overtaking Me, a compilation of more as-yet-unavailable material created during those two decades, proves to be a valuable insight into Russell's extensive body of work. Most of the 21 tracks on this album have a more traditional singer/songwriter structure than the avant-garde cello compositions and kinetic, jazz-influenced disco for which he has also come to be known. Tracks such as ""Close My Eyes"", ""Oh Fernanda Why"", and the traditional cowboy song ""Goodbye Old Paint"", are strong examples of his connection to folk music and are largely developed on acoustic guitar. A common thread always runs throughout Russell's work and is well represented here: his moving, gentle voice-- and a knack for storytelling that could rival Bob Dylan. On this album, these lovely lyrical details are especially prevalent on songs like ""Habit of You"" and ""Big Moon"", where Russell's sensitivity and sense of humor gracefully anchor the music. Many other great artists at a similar level of Russell's prolificacy have more than enough skeletons in their musical closet, plenty of which would only appeal to the most die-hard of fans. The tracks currently being dusted off in his archive, however, have so far been dependably strong, despite being mostly unfinished tracks of incredible musical variety. Russell himself was rarely satisfied with his results, preferring to move on to the next song rather than dotting the i's and crossing the t's. His creativity, it seems, was pretty much constant. He would work every day without fail, and the songs on Love Is Overtaking Me are a deftly selected microcosm of this brilliant musical world. The compilation features all elements of Russell's margin blurring, from the warm pop of ""Planted a Thought"" and the Modern Lovers-influenced delivery of ""Time Away"" to the stark, cello driven song, ""Eli"", where the vocals and strings seemed to be in a tonal battle, although this brings an urgency to the lyrics (about a lonesome, mistreated dog) and allows them to resonate in the best possible way. At the time of his death, Russell's music had reached only a limited audience outside of his devoted, often high profile connections (he collaborated with Philip Glass, David Byrne, and Allen Ginsberg, among others). Yet his distinctive music has the rare resilience to keep growing, connecting to more and more people because of its extraordinarily contemporary, even timeless, quality. While he was alive, Russell and his relatively small group of listeners were convinced that his music should reach more ears; that it should be able to stretch across the same boundaries that his compositions navigated so elegantly. Now, through the care of Audika and the genuine love of fellow musicians and fans that have recognized his prodigious talent, Russell is finally getting the acknowledgment his honest, powerful, and most remarkable music deserves.","Love Is Overtaking Me, a compilation of more as-yet-unavailable Arthur Russell material-- most of which was born from a more traditional singer/songwriter structure than the avant-garde cello compositions and kinetic, jazz-influenced disco for which he has also come to be known-- continues the late composer and producer's winning streak.

Furr,Blitzen Trapper,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcf6ea9e61561daa75d5/1:1/w_160/f40157ce.jpg,2008-10-29 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12345-furr/,Sub Pop,"Blitzen Trapper's breakthrough album, Wild Mountain Nation (which they self-released last year), caught fire thanks, in part, to its eclecticism and try-anything-once spirit. The Portland, Oregon-based sextet poured twangy Deadhead jams, loose, do-it-yourself Pavement sprawl, muscular Lynyrd Skynyrd riffs, anachronistic synthesizer bursts, and scruffy Band melodies into a rangy collection that was as thrilling for its stylistic alchemy as it was for its infectious good vibes. Precisely what made it so beguiling, however, also made it slightly infuriating: there was no cohesion between all of the diverse yet charmingly shaggy tracks, each one representing a specific sliver of Blitzen Trapper's multiple personalities. It was a gripping mishmash, and it proved that its creators had an obsession with the sounds of the 1970s and a gift for ramshackle melodies. But it left curious listeners wondering who Blitzen Trapper really were. For their follow-up (and Sub Pop debut), the band has narrowed its scope, sharpening their focus, and the result proves they don't need to try so many different approaches when they've found one that works so well. Furr, the band's fourth full-length, finds the six-piece giving in to their Basement Tapes urges. On acoustic tracks ""Lady on the Water"" and ""Black River Killer"", singer Eric Earley offers the most convincing Dylan vocals of this young century. And though the latter-- a gothic fugitive tale of sin, sheriffs, and stolen horses-- is bolstered by an unexpectedly spacey synth line, the former is the sort of sensual, stripped down song that Bob could have performed before he went electric at Newport. The band further pays homage to Mr. Zimmerman with the harmonicas they've spackled onto the title track's folky strummed tale of a wolfman's transformation and the spare, bittersweet piano hymn ""Not Your Lover"" (incidentally, the album's standout track). Blitzen Trapper's more cohesive approach has yielded something that is becoming increasingly rare these days: An essential 13-song LP with no filler. There isn't an extraneous verse, much less a superfluous track here. Though they have more clearly defined their shambolic Americana this time around, they still show great range and unpredictability with their songwriting. The harmony-laden, 40-second pastoral coda to ""Love U"" and the entirety of the drawling, honeyed pedal-steel showcase ""Stolen Shoes & a Rifle"" make a convincing argument that the dominant sound of Sub Pop in 2008 owes more to the country-rock poignancy of CSNY than the label's punk past (see also: Fleet Foxes, Hardly Art's Moondoggies). The first two and a half minutes of ""Love U"", however, are a fuzzy, howling soup of reverberating guitars and jittery drum fills set amidst a molasses-slow dirge. And ""Echo/Always On/EZ Con"" pulls their organic, earnest sound into strange territory, bleeding a ""See The Sky About to Rain""-like piano weeper into a brief, burbling mess of tech sounds that evolve into a funky disco strut. It is those sorts of unexpected flourishes that keep the album crackling with excitement and separate Blitzen Trapper from the rest of the bands that are trying their hands at a similar throwback sound. It would have been hard to follow Wild Mountain Nation with anything as sprawling, expansive, or diverse, so Blitzen Trapper didn't try. Instead, they settled down, focused, and managed to create something even better. This imaginative, heartfelt collection is more intimate than its predecessor, reveling less in boundless stylistic freedom and more in the creativity afforded by structure. Blitzen Trapper are no longer talented jacks-of-all-trades, but a master of one, and Furr is proof that this already-great band gets even better as they define themselves more specifically.","After a ramshackle breakthrough LP, Wild Mountain Nation, Blitzen Trapper narrow their scope and sharpen their focus for their Sub Pop debut, proving they don't need to try so many different approaches when they've found one-- Dylan circa Basement Tapes-- that works so well.

An undeniably gifted, exquisitely mannered young composer/songwriter, Kahane makes meticulously arranged art-pop with a heavy literary bent. It comes as absolutely no surprise that he's worked closely with Sufjan Stevens, as both men approach Americana with academic fondness and are keenly aware of the importance of geography to narrative. In contrast to Stevens' Midwestern mien, however, the Northeast is Kahane's preferred backdrop, which makes him a pitch-perfect sonic representative of the NPR/New Yorker/tweedy East Coast mentality. By extension, Kahane's debut self-titled full-length succeeds and fails in almost exactly the same ways these organs succeed and fail, deserving praise for its intellectual curiosity even as it suffers from arid fustiness and self-regard. Deride tight-sphincter tastefulness all you want, but NPR is an inveterate seeker of stories from out-of-the-way places, and that spirit of tolerance and voracious study informs Kahane's lyrical and musical efforts here as well. ""Underberg"", for example, pays tribute to a beloved old Brooklyn building on the day of its demolition. But instead of taking the long view of its historical relevance, Kahane opts for the rather more poignant short view of its personal significance, reminiscing on when ""In high school we would steal inside at night/ And make out by the glow of a traffic light."" When he broadens his scope, Kahane is equally capable of unearthing the interesting histories of famous names, using ""7 Middagh"" to reflect on the ambivalence of a WWII-era coterie of literary giants that included W.H. Auden and Carson McCullers (or maybe I'm just a sucker for songs that quote from Henry James). From a sonic standpoint, Kahane's restlessness and ingenuity match the precociousness of his words, the album often abandoning pop's expected patterns of build and release with a less-predictable approach that comes closer to musical theatre. An array of instruments are deployed in unique ways, with Kahane using horns, strings, banjos, and drum fills almost as sentient characters, taking opportunity to cleverly doodle along the margins of his compositions with woodwinds (particularly on ""North Adams"" and ""Slow Down""). The problem, then, comes down to delivery. In short, Kahane's earnestness makes Sufjan Stevens look like Gene Simmons. And while he's aiming for something a good deal more arty and highbrow than your usual indie-rock fare, he could stand to learn a few lessons from Stevens about drawing in listeners with popcraft and humanity. Too much of the album feels bloodless, lacking not only humor but also sex, passion, recklessness, and vitality. Kahane is joined on ""Villanelles"" by Nickel Creek frontman and mandolinist Chris Thile, who lends his always-exemplary talents in service of the album's jauntiest, liveliest song. It's true that Kahane projects greater erudition than a pop-friendly guy like Thile. But it probably wouldn't hurt him to follow Thile's example and do things like cover Pavement songs and write instrumental tributes to minor Lord of the Rings characters.","This Brooklyn-based songwriter makes meticulously arranged art-pop with a heavy literary bent; guests include Sufjan Stevens and members of Antony Hegarty's backing band.

Most of the time when someone complains about rap being corny, it's because it's not ""street"" enough, or doesn't take itself seriously, or is otherwise lighthearted-- those aren't signs that something's going to be unlistenable bullshit. Most of the stuff that Solesides-cum-Quannum dropped in the late 90s/early 00s, for instance, was almost completely devoid of anything that could be considered threatening by hip-hop fans' parents-- except maybe the warnings of lyrical destruction. But it was created by MCs who were charismatic, agile lyricists with authoritative voices, backed by DJs and producers who had enough of an ear for funk to counter any potential granola tendencies with the shit that got heads nodding. But damn, the Mighty Underdogs are corny. And that's kind of startling, given their component parts: Gift of Gab killed it enough on the last three Blackalicious albums that his name's still an automatic positive, and Lateef the Truth Speaker has been scarce enough in recent years (Maroons aside) that the opportunity to hear him over the course of more than a dozen tracks should be welcome. Throw in an underheard but promising producer in Headnodic (of Crown City Rockers), and you've got yourself a potential backpacker supergroup. But Droppin' Science Fiction isn't the lyrical throwdown that you'd expect from the voices behind classics like ""You Didn't Know That Though"" or ""The Wreckoning"", unless those voices decided that they could stand to be a lot goofier. This is an unusually awkward record, one that pushes the non-threatening b-boy routine past good-natured lightheartedness into cloying silliness. You could chalk up some of the album's flaws to its gimmicky concept tracks that run on obvious premises: there's the B-movie horror story (""Monster""); the Wild West showdown (""Gunfight""); the outer-space extraterrestrial rocketship arglebargle (""Science Fiction""); the whimsical travelogue (""ILL Vacation""); the she's-hot-but-she's-a-slut sex jam (""Aye""). None of these concepts are new, but making them as broad and schticky as possible brings these cuts down. It's embarrassing to hear Gab try to sound like a grizzled old cowboy or a bellowing mad scientist; he seems to be shooting for a more eccentric take on his usual genial battle-rap style, but he winds up sounding as if he's sitting down to read picture-book stories to second graders. Lateef, meanwhile, just seems out of place, maintaining his usual cool-headed fire-spitting focus while everything around him turns into Velveeta. It might be more tolerable if Headnodic dialed down his production just a bit, but with rare exceptions, it's all elbow-ribbing Muppetry, a frivolous collection of ""Brady Bunch"" funk, and Hanna-Barbera dopiness that makes Danger Mouse's beats on The Mouse and the Mask sound like Liquid Swords. The fact that this dorkiness has enveloped a few usually-on-point guests (MF Doom, Mr. Lif & Akrobatik, DJ Shadow) is unfortunate enough; that it's being perpetrated by two MCs who've been consistently great since the early- to mid-90s just makes it more frustrating. They both still have the ability to string together tight phrases and taut internal rhymes, and on those rare tracks where they tackle more serious material (the Julian and Damian Marley-augmented ghetto lament ""So Sad""; the neglected-love apology ""Want You Back"") or focus on straightforward rapping-about-rapping (""Victorious""), you're reminded why you liked them in the first place.

Way to Normal,Ben Folds,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bda4c0084474cd0c2d49/1:1/w_160/dab85663.jpg,2008-10-28 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12370-way-to-normal/,Epic,"Ben Folds has long attempted to mix unequal parts humor and romanticism. Indeed, sap and smarm have been the principal currencies of America's leading piano wise guy, at least since the pinnacle of Ben Folds Five's commercial success in 1998. Whatever and Ever Amen, the band's best-selling second album, broke Folds into the mainstream through ""Brick"", a tender, regretful ballad about a girlfriend's abortion. Of course, the album's next song and final single, the infamous ""Song for the Dumped"", slammed open, ""So you wanted to take a break? Slow it down some and have some space? Well fuck you, too."" Likewise, on Folds' solo debut, 2001's Rockin' the Suburbs, a song about a woman's dependence on others-- right up to the pallbearers carrying her to her grave-- fails before a number about doing acid and climbing trees and another about Michael Jackson, Quiet Riot, and ""being male, middle-class, and white."" On Way to Normal, Folds' third solo studio LP since Ben Folds Five broke up in 2000, he strives for that same imbalance and juxtaposition, pitting laments about missed opportunities with old lovers and failed communication in otherwise good relationships against quips about slashed basketballs and snide yuppies. This time, though, Folds' humor gets the best of his feelings. He does the whiny white boy thing he's always done yet again. It's just that, as he and we age, that coy condescension bullshit gets less charming than wearisome. On Way to Normal, Folds seems out for everybody: the baristas who only give him free coffee because he's rich, the rich who snub the struggling baristas, the male dog who ran away from him, the female dog who flipped out on the little guy. This go around, the humor only works when Folds directs his derision at himself, namely on the fuzz-bass opener, ""Hiroshima (B B B Benny Hit His Head)"". As for the romance, the love tracks here are surprisingly impersonal and repetitive for Folds, who married his fourth wife between this album and the last. The old allure has soured or staled. Indeed, all too often, the jokes unintentionally fall against Folds here. He issues his grievances with a smart-ass certainty, rarely showing empathy or compassion for his characters or admitting that maybe it's his perspective that's skewed. He seems less interested in understanding others than denouncing them. In the process, he sounds silly, sad, and incredibly smug. He devotes an entire track to scoffing at unconventional healers (the psychic, acupuncturist, and chiropractor) before taking a stab at the yuppy cliques that use them one track later (the Anthropologie chain, coffee drinkers, yoga addicts: all on notice). On ""Brainwascht"", Folds rails against the former friend of an ex-lover who's written an ostensibly shitty one-sided pop song about Folds' faults as a lover. Coupled with ""Bitch Went Nuts"", Folds sounds like the sort of mate who's convinced he's never been wrong. The track opens with an unfortunate parody of The Karate Kid's Mr. Miyagi detailing the reasons relationships fail. Apparently, women dump guys for trivial stuff. He's a bad fuck or a simple douche. Men dump women, though, because, as Folds exclaims, they're crazy: ""The bitch went nuts/ She photoshopped my face/ On to every boy who'd done her wrong."" ""Errant Dog"", which calls a runaway male dog a bitch as Folds indulges his nasty habit of cussing when he has nothing better to do, makes the pianist sound like a dog beater, a litigious whiner, and mostly an asshole. Sure, maybe it's a joke, but-- like much of Way to Normal-- it's just not funny. In all fairness, Folds uses the errant dog simile to describe himself in ""You Don't Know Me"", the album's single and best song thanks in no small part to Regina Spektor's waifish vocal lines. That's only reflective of Way to Normal's other missed opportunities, though. What's most unfortunate about the male, upper-class, and white content of Way to Normal is that it's tied to some of Folds' strongest post-Five compositions yet. Aside from the spoken-word intro, ""Bitch Went Nuts"" is a musical gem, its clangorous piano bounding headlong into a perfect instrumental break. Too bad it's almost impossible to overlook the song's lyrics. Similarly, ""Cologne"" is a gorgeous love song with Reinhold Messner-style strings-- at least until Folds decides to mention the astronaut who drove to Florida wearing diapers. Folds has always been at his best telling stories in his own smirking way. On Way to Normal, the stories sort of make you wish he'd see a shrink already.","On his third solo studio LP, Ben Folds pits laments about missed opportunities with old lovers and failed communication in otherwise good relationships against quips about slashed basketballs and snide yuppies.

Just a Souvenir,Squarepusher,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdaaeb335119a49ecf0c/1:1/w_160/71130f69.jpeg,2008-10-28 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12376-just-a-souvenir/,Warp,"A decade or so ago, Tom Jenkinson-- the disheveled mastermind behind jazz-cum-drum-and-glitch mishmash Squarepusher-- described his music-making process as a sort of technological vision quest, with the end product ""a souvenir of your time in this psychic space."" Looks like it's a sentiment that he's taken with him. Over the course of 11 albums, he's been embroiled in some sort of existential conundrum, if not crisis, as he's attempted to reconcile a background in formal jazz with the manic possibilities afforded by sequencing and sound manipulation. A veritable thesaurus of musical experimentation, Jenkinson has pushed a spitfire chorus of fully formed studies in blending fusion with breakbeats, acid with funk. But whether this litany is meant to be enjoyed or simply admired is up for debate. It's true that his work (and of course his bass and drumming virtuosity) is due respect, but the intersection of his hardcore appreciators (tweaked tech-heads and staid jazz appreciators) might just as soon stroke their chins as develop emotional reactions to it. Just a Souvenir could just bridge Jenkinson's longtime appreciation gap. Heck, it's just about the Squarepusher equivalent to Sgt. Pepper's. Souvenir is ostensibly a concept album, complete with a cockamamie yarn Jenkinson has spun about its woozily constructed device: ""a daydream about watching a crazy, beautiful rock band play an ultra-gig"" centered around a giant neon coat-hanger. Into his vision enter guitars that can manipulate space-time, Eskimos, chainsaws, and Cro-Magnons. At the conclusion, Jenkinson laments that his memory of the scene is his only souvenir-- add a dash of humility, and you've got a title! And although it's 2004's Ultravisitor, with its ever-present crowd samples, that sounds like a live album, Souvenir leaves distinct impressions of an otherworldly rock spectacle. True to concept, the record as a whole sounds more organic than any Squarepusher release dating back, perhaps, to Music Is Rotted One Note-- excepting Souvenir's obvious counterexample in ""A Real Woman"", whose vocoded robot narrator bemoans its cluelessness in the ways of the human female. Jenkinson announces his newfound humanity right off the bat with opener ""Star Time 2"", which sedately re-imagines the track ""Coopers World"" that opened his seminal Hard Normal Daddy. The drill-and-bass salvos that slashed across ""Cooper"" and many of Jenkinson's canvases of old have been toned down or eradicated-- only minimal echoes of the signature Amen Break beat show up, with comparatively little sequenced percussion remaining. Tom still wails on his bass, capably delivering a master class in funky fills, but its delivery through the riffy, frenetic math-punk of ""Delta-V"" and ""Planet Gear"" is most surprising. By recasting his relentless, aggressive textures into rock, he's breathed a curious new life into them, imbuing a sort of alien quality to what in less capable hands could have turned out as reruns of someone else's garage rock or funk-punk. As the languid classical guitar that dots the album brings it to a close, it hits that this 44-minute opus is perhaps more inviting, and more melodic, than anything Jenkinson has done in a long time. It's certainly an easier listen than 80 minutes of Ultravisitor or an hour of Hello Everything. Souvenir, comparatively, is a demure beast of wistful robot voices framing jazz improvisation, alien rock jams evoking the aging belligerence of breakbeats, and pastoral drone backdrops adorned by jerky guitar ballads. But Souvenir isn't just an outlet for nonfans to ""get"" Squarepusher. By abstractly distilling the principles that guide Squarepusher, the record arrives readymade for the chin-stroking die-hards out there to endlessly theorize about the connection between the music maker, the music, and his/its audience.  If indeed music is the only souvenir gained from these trips to the unknown, then this disheveled spitfire, once lost in his little world of glitches and jazz scales, might have unearthed this particular bauble on the journey to meet the rest of us halfway.","The latest Warp Records full-length from disheveled mastermind Tom Jenkinson finds him nudging away from the breakbeats with which many listeners identify him and embracing organic textures on a concept album about a rock band's ""ultra-gig.""

Off With Their Heads,Kaiser Chiefs,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bda0eb335119a49ecef8/1:1/w_160/59dbbb42.jpg,2008-10-28 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12368-off-with-their-heads/,B-Unique,"Kaiser Chiefs have sold millions of records. If you're reading this from the U.S., you might not realize that, even though the group has moved a relatively impressive number of albums in America as well. Stuff that sounds this British usually winds up in the ""cult"" file over here though, and the Kaisers have been no exception. Off With Their Heads is the Leeds quintet's third LP, and although it isn't poised to break the UK group out of Keane/Snow Patrol territory-- let alone Coldplay or Gorillaz-- it recaptures some of the ebullience of their 2005 debut, Employment, after the darker cynicism of the follow-up, Yours Truly, Angry Mob. Their latest approach to winning converts appears to be to make music so ridiculous that you at least have to notice it. Opener ""Spanish Metal"" cuts right to the chase in its first few bars, a hard-rock guitar-and-organ riffs that's so over the top it has to be tongue in cheek. It really is ludicrous, but it's fun, too, and the band balances it with a good verse where the guitars drop out, leaving just the drums, bass, and harmony vocals. There's even finger-tapping toward the end. The other song that most embodies this irresistible ridiculousness is ""Addicted to Drugs"", whose title refrain, alas, isn't sung to the tune of Robert Palmer's ""Addicted to Love"", even though it seems clear they had the song in mind. Instead, the discofied chorus, blue-eyed soul backing vocals, and genuinely funny lyrics practically force you to enjoy it. Yes, there's cowbell. Vocalist Ricky Wilson seems to be having more fun this time out, as on the New Wave-y ""Half the Truth"", which actually has two choruses, the second of which is the punchline: ""I will not lie to you, but I'll definitely only give you half the truth."" I have no idea what they were thinking bringing in Sway DaSafo to rap a verse, but it doesn't work. The other noticeable guest is Lily Allen, who's in on backing vocals on two songs, including single ""Never Miss a Beat"", which seems to be a criticism of anti-intellectualism with its repeats of ""it's cool to know nothing."" The most notable song, though, might actually be closer ""Remember You're a Girl"", which finds the band in new territory with its quiet, minor-key melody and understated backing from the band. It's so divorced from the rest of the record that it almost sounds like a different group snuck their song onto the album. That's not great for continuity, but it is a nice reprieve from the constant harmonies and blasting guitars that make some of the less exceptional songs bleed together. In the end, Kaiser Chiefs are a band of anthems, and this album offers a few clues that they're capable of doing other things when they wish to-- it doesn't seem like an accident that they're named for a soccer club, given the terrace-like audience their songs are built for. It's not all great-- ""You Want History"" can't overcome rhyming ""mystery"" with ""history"" or its leaden coda, for example-- but it is at least as good as their debut, if not just a tick better for its relative dynamic and tonal variety.","The Leeds quintet's third LP recaptures some of the ebullience (and charm) of their 2005 debut, Employment, after the darker cynicism of the follow-up, Yours Truly, Angry Mob.

"Broken Hymns, Limbs and Skin",O'Death,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd9aea9e61561daa7734/1:1/w_160/b5e3219a.jpg,2008-10-27 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12361-broken-hymns-limbs-and-skin/,Kemado,"Like a lot of traditional folk songs, the origins of ""Oh Death"" are somewhat nebulous. It may have been written by Madison County preacher Lloyd Chandler around 1916, but some cite it as yet another early British folk song (also known as ""Conversations With Death"") ported over to Appalachia. The tune has been recorded by the likes of Dock Boggs, Roscoe Holcomb, and, most famously, the Stanley Brothers and later Ralph Stanley himself. It's on the O Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack, and somewhat ahead of the curve, Camper Van Beethoven covered it, too. But where did the song really begin? No one knows. The origins of the band O'Death are a lot less mysterious. They come from New York, among the latest of a long line of traditionalists who look to old-time music as a place to hang their contemporary quirks. They enlist fiddles and banjos to cover the Pixies, sing about murder and mournful mayhem, and add just enough punk energy to convince the cool kids it's OK to listen to mountain music. It's like rural Appalachia, were hillbillies to exchange moonshine for meth. Which they probably have, of course, but that doesn't make this sort of bastardization any easier to take. Affectation is the name of the game on O'Death's third album, Broken Hymns, Limbs and Skin. The disc infuses folk with frenetic intensity, but it's all so over the top that it's hard to take it as anything more than a distraction, like an annoying buzz or a particularly scratchy pair of wool socks. In its defense, however, that's pretty much par for this style-straddling subgenre, which, like ska-punk for example, takes an old-school template and makes it so overblown it practically pops like a balloon. Certainly Greg Jamie, who sings like a Depression-era carnival barker shouting through a megaphone straight into your ear, must realize his pinched, adenoidal style precludes much resonance and pushes the music further toward camp. The rhythm section, too, which juggles junkyard percussion with the hallmark polka beat of hardcore, is so far from subtle that it (literally) pounds out whatever nuance songs such as ""Vacant Moan"" or ""Grey Sun"" might possess. Toss in some de rigueur Eastern European ""gypsy"" nods, and what you're left with is a band hedging its bets by opting for more, more, more rather than relenting to let a little breathing room into the music. The group downshifts a bit with the instrumental ""Leininger"", but the respite is brief. Even ""Angeline"" or ""Home"", both of which begin relatively restrained, can't resist going all spazzy, and in each case one can't help but recall bands such as the Meat Puppets, or even Camper Van, who did this stuff much better. At their best, those bands were both subtle and smart. O'Death, on the other hand, deal almost entirely in broad strokes, which would be more acceptable were the bluster backed up by a stronger or more diverse set of songs, rather than a litany of murder ballad tropes and Americana clichés, magnified and distorted to such a degree that you're left cowed into exhausted submission. That might work on stage, where you can see the sweat flying off the band and get caught up in the excitement, but blasting from speakers it leans a little too close to punishment for comfort.","New Yorkers O'Death punch up their murder ballads and faux mountain music so much it veers on assault.

Doomsdayer's Holiday,Grails,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd945e6ef959693230ae/1:1/w_160/fab81ee5.jpg,2008-10-27 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12355-doomsdayers-holiday/,Temporary Residence,"The quietly prolific Grails have been putting out an album or more a year ever since their first in 2003. Though they are constantly folding new elements into their sound, each record is an enigmatic dispatch from the same basic world. These dudes hail from grey Portland, but they have somehow perfected the art of desert-rock mystery, and if you are currently planning your spiritual pilgrimage to New Mexico, be sure to pack this album along with some of your finest entheogens (the iboga plant, perhaps, or yage) and a copy of Terence McKenna's The Invisible Landscape: Mind, Hallucinogens, and the I Ching. Trust me: you will enter the Rainbow Body before track three. They haven't left the windswept desert of their minds, but over the last two years, Grails have gone from pleasantly trippy to permanently mind-altering. 2007's Burning Off Impurities was a relatively well-lit affair, and since then they've made a steady migration into ever-darker caverns. This year's Take Refuge in Clean Living was the first big step: alongside the usual artfully arranged head-rock, fuzzy bursts of white noise confounded your sense of distance while voices murmured low in the mix and bleeping Morse code floated in and out. Meanwhile, great whooshing atmospherics swept through the landscape like wind pounding a sand dune. On Doomsdayer's Holiday, the haze is even thicker, and the album represents a sort of endpoint to their journey: taking place in utter blackness, it is their most alluring and impenetrable trip yet. It starts with the absolutely towering guitars. On the opening title track, they stagger about like B-movie monsters brought to life, and the song, with its slowly tolling riffs, resembles the sort of portentous intro track usually found on death metal albums. ""Reincarnation Blues"", which follows, features what is by far the most fearsome, monolithic stomp Grails have ever created. When the assault does let up, it is only to let a sawing, plaintive string instrument (likely either a kamancheh or an erhu) sing an otherworldly melody, and the alternation of relentless pounding with eerie interludes sharply evokes the queasy grip of a particularly nasty fever. When the song dissipates, midway through, into nothing but humming, ethereal voices, it inspires the same glassy-eyed wonder as Burial's ""Archangel"". This is Grails' ""heaviest"" album, to be sure, with production assistance from people who've worked with Sunn O))), Faust, and others. But the heaviness doesn't just derive from distorted guitars: the entire album is overlaid with a vague sense of menace. When low voices begin a droning, wordless chant on ""Predestination Blues"", it feels like the awakening of something ancient and decidedly unfriendly.  Even the moments of calm-- the feather-light strumming of ""The Natural Man"", for instance-- take place at such a distance, under such a swirling dust cloud of ambient noise, that they are disquieting. It is only on ""Acid Rain"", the album's closer, when the pall lifts, and it is the most dramatic moment on the album: by simply modulating to a major key and lightening their guitar tones, Grails switch on the lights all at once, and the effect is like emerging from a cave into blinding sunshine: equal parts disorienting and reassuring.","Over the last two years, Portland's quietly prolific Grails have gone from pleasantly trippy to permanently mind-altering, and Doomsdayer's Holiday is their heaviest album yet.

It’s Time!

Singer/lead spazz Arno (first names only with these guys, Beat Happening-style) awkwardly hacks at a guitar unfit for a six-year-old, guitarist Alex gingerly picks out dinky lead lines that sound piped from a ColecoVision, and Jock whales on a single drum and tinny snare like he was Keith Moon-- to call their scrappy, endearing racket ""infectious"" would be underselling it. Seeing them live hits about five different irrational pleasure centers at once, and on record their raw energy is just as palpable. The three years' worth of messy, crayon-scrawled punk singles collected on It's Time!-- each one well under two minutes-- marry the clatter of early Beat Happening and the Modern Lovers to the lovelorn dreaminess of Sarah Records wimps like Another Sunny Day. For these guys, amateurism is a matter of devotion, and they take great pains to reconstruct the innocent illusion of ""hey gang, let's form a band!"" Playing better instruments, or playing their pitiful instruments better, would be traitorous: In this worldview, learning to play properly is, as Lester Bangs memorably put it, a deadening process equivalent to ""the putrefaction of a corpse."" Accordingly, the guitars on It's Time! sound like an aging cassette copy of Count Five's ""Psychotic Reaction"" taped by holding a Walkman up to the radio; Jock's single cymbal receives a bigger workout than a death metal drummer's double-kick; and Arno sings guilelessly and tunelessly about longing, confusion, and being misunderstood. It would be easy to lob some criticism about the artifice involved, or point out the inherent contradiction of paying such meticulous homage to Calvin Johnson's homemade DIY aesthetic, but these guys' sincerity, live or on record, cannot be doubted. Not to mention that their tunes are great; it's hard even to single out the catchiest. Guitarist Alex cooks up maddeningly simple little earworms for every song: Check the ""breakdown"" of ""Baby Don't Do It"" or the stumbling shuffle of ""This Time Next Year"" for prime examples. ""Don't You Know?"" pogos along joyfully on a burbling bassline and coffee-percolator drums, while Arno offers unadorned yearning worthy of Jonathan Richman: ""Please don't say 'oh no don't go'/ Oh don't you know when it's over, it stays that way?"" In case it wasn't clear from the song titles-- nearly half of them end in question marks-- Arno belongs to the grand tradition of lovelorn wusses that includes Richman, Rivers Cuomo, and the Descendents' Milo Aukerman. Thankfully, however, he doesn't seem to carry around these men's internalized rage. Even when he's imploring ""Do you have any feelings at all?"" on ""You Don't Say"", he doesn't sound bitter, just broken-hearted. ""Say what you feel, it's okay, no one will judge you,"" repeated over and over, run the entirety of the lyrics to ""Say What You Feel"", accompanied by a perfect three-note girl-group guitar riff-- you don't get much sweeter or more gently encouraging than that. The lyric serves neatly as a statement of theme for these guys, and indeed for the purest, most inclusive impulses of all early punk rock, which caUSE co-MOTION! summon effortlessly.","Collecting three years' worth of messy, crayon-scrawled punk singles-- each one well under two minutes-- caUSE co-MOTION!'s latest marries the clatter of early Beat Happening and the Modern Lovers to the lovelorn dreaminess of Sarah Records wimps like Another Sunny Day.

"Spectrum, 14th Century EP / Plays to Please EP",Final Fantasy,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bda1abf31b7dc7155fb2/1:1/w_160/c82e5fba.gif,2008-10-27 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12369-spectrum-14th-century-ep-plays-to-please-ep/,Blocks,"Once known mainly as the guy whose string arrangements made Arcade Fire's Funeral sound so damn epic, Owen Pallett has since sprinkled his pixie dust all over the place in the last three years, whether remixing Grizzly Bear and Stars or using his classical training to beef up releases from Picastro, Fucked Up, and Beirut. To top things off, the guy's just as awesome outside the studio, allocating a portion of his royalties to charity organizations, festivals, and struggling acts. Unfortunately, Final Fantasy, his quasi-solo project, hasn't garnered him quite the same name recognition many of his collaborators enjoy. He Poos Clouds from 2006, his solid sophomore effort of string-laden pop, flew under most people's radars despite its catchy melodies and NES nostalgia. And now he returns with two new EPs. Being collaborative projects of a more conceptual nature, the limited-edition Spectrum, 14th Century and Plays to Please provide few clues as to what Pallett's upcoming full-length Heartland might sound like, and their experimental bent likely won't widen his fanbase. The releases do, however, attest to his technical expertise both behind the boards and behind the mic, allowing him to make the most of the source material. Recorded with members of Beirut, Pallett describes Spectrum as a bunch of ""fake field recordings."" Peppered with chirping birds and croaking frogs from an outdoor recording session in Quebec, the songs definitely carry a Disney movie lilt. The askance melody on opener ""Oh Spectrum"" taps avant-garde jazz, and on moving standout track ""The Butcher"", even the meme-checking line ""all their bases belong to us"" cuts straight to the soul. Beirut outfit Pallett's strings with horns, piano, and percussion straight from The Flying Club Cup, and the steel drums on ""Blue Imelda"", coupled with Pallett's forlorn delivery, extend the parallels. Plays to Please finds Pallett arranging and performing the songs of Toronto's Alex Lukashevsky, leader of the band Deep Dark United. Lukashevsky's material, written originally for a more stripped-down setting, owes a lot to pop standards and even classical and opera, elements Pallett is more than willing to play up. Recorded with a 35-piece orchestra-- including Andrew Bird and the Hidden Cameras' Paul Mathew-- the ornate EP sounds built for Broadway, totally isolated from current indie trends. While certainly unique and well suited to Pallett's skill set, the added pomp inflates Lukashevsky’s sparse pathos to the point of novelty. Sure, the graphic lyrics and waltzy rhythm of ""Ultimatum"" resemble a swank Dresden Dolls, but tracks like the Yankee Doodle camp of ""Nun or a Bawd"" or ""Moodring Band""'s emo via Andrew Lloyd Webber balladry just aren't that interesting outside a technical standpoint. So in sum, Pallett takes a sizeable step forward, then whimsically tiptoes back a bit. Spectrum matches the accessibility of He Poos Clouds then, with the help of Beirut's hired hands, offers Pallett's gems in a wider variety of flavors. Plays to Please isn't a stinker by any means, but its six songs feel like a music school exercise, and, no matter how compositionally engaging, they revisit Pallett's occasional tendency to take mediocre ideas and go nuts with instrumentation. Of course, with a creative motor like Pallett's, one's prone to the occasional vagary every so often, and considering we get three or four solid tracks to herald next year's Final Fantasy full-length, who's to complain?",,7.0,
Microcastle / Weird Era Cont.,Deerhunter,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bdeec0084474cd0c2ddc/1:1/w_160/12c1d134.jpeg,2008-10-27 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12360-microcastle-weird-era-cont/,Kranky4AD,"Deerhunter toured with Nine Inch Nails this summer, making a stop at Colorado's famed Red Rocks Amphitheatre. That canyon found the Atlanta noise-rock quintet at a precipice. In the few months prior, Deerhunter had added a new guitarist, Whitney Petty, to replace the departed Colin Mee. Lead singer Bradford Cox had released his debut solo album, Let the Blind Lead Those Who Can See But Cannot Feel, under the name Atlas Sound. The band's third album, Microcastle, and its would-be surprise bonus disc, Weird Era Cont., had both leaked half a year before they were due in stores. Unimpressed NIN fans were writing blog posts comparing Cox to Geddy Lee. Like Trent Reznor, Cox is a classic outcast. But the real question is why Deerhunter aren't opening for Radiohead, as their friends in Liars and Grizzly Bear have done. Admirers and detractors of Deerhunter's 2007 breakout album, Cryptograms, all seemed to agree on one thing: Despite its status as an underground hit, it didn't explore totally new sounds. Radiohead didn't invent krautrock or avant-garde electronic music, either-- let alone UK post-punk, American alt-rock, or the Beatles. Instead, what they've done is use a stunning assortment of shrewd instrumental ideas to express contemporary anxiety and alienation, all in the form of pop songs, on albums conceived to be more than the sum of their parts. Deerhunter don't sound a lot like Radiohead, but they've absorbed the UK rock icons' outlook as fully as anybody. If Cryptograms holds any ""encoded message,"" I argued in a Pitchfork review, it's this: Deerhunter are a pop band. Microcastle/Weird Era Cont. proves me half-right. It sidesteps much of the art-damaged squall of previous Deerhunter records, but it doesn't embrace 1950s and 60s pop as intensely as lead singer Bradford Cox had intimated in early interviews. If Cryptograms brutalized the pop ideal like a guitar-wielding David Lynch, leaving the follow-up Fluorescent Grey EP an exquisite corpse, then Microcastle resurrects it, scar tissue and all. The resulting 2xCD set captures urgent and imaginative songs that reorganize 4AD haze, off-kilter indie pop, crashing garage-punk, forward-leaning krautrock, and hypnotic Kranky ambience into a singular-sounding call-to-arms. Here, the band comes into their own by applying their own inspiringly distinctive, bleakly appealing sensibility to whatever ideas happen to move them. Fist-pumping first single ""Nothing Ever Happened"" shares most of a title with a Pavement deluxe-edition bonus track while sounding a lot like Magazine's more straightforward, hard-charging side. Another standout, ""Saved by Old Times"", pipes in the Black Lips' Cole Alexander for a dual-channel monologue disorientingly reminiscent of the Velvet Underground's ""The Murder Mystery"". (If you play it backwards, Cole namedrops Johnny Cash.) ""I take what I can/ I give what I have left,"" Cox sings softly, as if explaining his musical approach, on ""Green Jacket"", a piano-based track at the center of the album. It's part of the languid song suite that ends the first side of the album's vinyl edition and breaks the disc up much the way ambient interludes divided Cryptograms. Only this time, the lull lasts just 10 minutes, not 20, and even at its least structured it's always more accessible. ""Microcastle"" applies the quiet-quiet-loud structure of the Breeders' ""No Aloha"" to a slack, laconic rumination on starting anew. With treated mbiras, ""Activa"" turns the dream-pop of Cox's Atlas Sound solo work into a nightmare vision of wasted lives. Despite an outsized and often compelling persona, Cox is in some ways absent from Microcastle. The first recognizable voice we hear belongs to guitarist Lockett Pundt, on second track ""Agoraphobia""; Pundt's gentle, repetitive wordplay-- ""Cover me, come for me, comfort me""-- cozies up against sunlit psych-pop (OK, about wanting to be buried alive for someone else's sexual gratification). Bass player Josh Fauver wrote most of ""Nothing Ever Happened"". The guitars are big, bright, and unusually unfucked-with. There's a finger-tapping guitar solo. All credit to Moses Archuleta for the propulsive drums. Deerhunter's slight shift toward directness mirrors, to an extent, the move Liars made with their harder-rocking self-titled album. It doesn't mean Microcastle breaks entirely away from album-unifying concepts. On bell-splashed Cox-Pundt collaboration ""Little Kids"", getting older means getting deader. By Pundt-led ""Neither of Us, Certainly"", it's a fate devoutly to be wished. Cox's 50s and 60s pop influences play a small but significant role, linking the wordless, Flamingoes-esque opener ""Cover Me (Slowly)"" to the warped Everly Brothers waltz of finale ""Twilight at Carbon Lake"". The Beatles' ""Please Please Me"" claimed that ""there's always rain in my heart""; on dynamic single candidate ""Never Stops"", there's always winter. In the end, ""Twilight"" says smell ya later to ""the frozen shit that was in your heart."" If you thought the bonus disc would just be crappy outtakes, then you don't know Cox. Weird Era Cont. is surprisingly great in its own right, allowing Deerhunter to join Los Campesinos! in the two-good-albums-in-2008 club. This record sparkles right from the ghostly noise-pop of ""Backspace Century"" and the jerky dance-punk of ""Operation"". The girl-group bounce of ""Vox Humana"" puts Cox's underrated lyrical skills on full display, while ""Vox Celeste"" throws the neo-shoegaze gauntlet down in the face of the reunited My Bloody Valentine. Reverb drenches Pundt's voice on the luminous ""Dot Gain"". Instrumentals make a fine return, too, ranging from Faust-meets-Animal Collective loops to noise-music drones. ""Focus Group"" is a sweetly chiming Smashing Pumpkins-esque guitar anthem that nearly rivals ""Nothing Ever Happened"" for skewed pop immediacy. The only song that appears on both discs is ""Calvary Scars"", which recounts a boy's willing, public crucifixion. It's a dual theme Deerhunter also explored on their self-titled first album's scrawly post-punk barb ""Adorno"", which mashes up crucifixion and suicide. On Microcastle, ""Calvary Scars"" is an ambient lullaby with mouthlike percussion; Weird Era Cont.'s ""Calvary Scars II / Aux."" is the track's heavier-sounding apotheosis, with an extended coda that's a bit like the live version of ""You Made Me Realise"", followed by a meditative electronic hum that's a bit like... the ringing in your ears after the live version of ""You Made Me Realise"". Or the calm after a cataclysm. There's a clear parallel with Radiohead's ""Morning Bell"", which appeared, in different versions, on both Kid A and Amnesiac. From ""Agoraphobia"" to ""Neither of Us, Uncertainly"" to ""Calvary Scars II / Aux."", sacrifical suicide could be a metaphor for artistic creation. On Microcastle/Weird Era Cont., Cox sacrifices himself-- or at least, his colorful persona-- for the sake of Deerhunter's art. On stage, he really does sacrifice his illness-damaged body. ""I take what I can/ I give what I have left."" From a band who, unlike their peers No Age, have studiously avoided politics, spreading the idea that salvation can be found, or at least glimpsed, in art-- let alone in stupid pop records! That you probably downloaded for free!-- is a politically potent act. Hope. Change. At the very least, a reason not to slit our throats before President Palin decides to nuke the world in 2017.",,9.2,
Dr. Dooom 2,Dr. Dooom,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd9113d197565213b583/1:1/w_160/19997e2b.jpg,2008-10-24 06:00:05,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12352-dr-dooom-2/,Threshold,"Being a Kool Keith fan requires a long memory-- Dr. Dooom 2 is the follow-up to 1999's First Come, First Served, a record released back when Keith had enough juice to share a headline review in Rolling Stone (fun fact: the other three co-leads were the debuts from Ja Rule and Memphis Bleek, as well as Keith's own Black Elvis/Lost in Space). Being a Kool Keith fan also requires a very short memory, since aside from a handful of laugh riots on Spankmaster (""N.B.A."", ""Drugs"") and the Diesel Truckers release that some will swear up and down was a return to form, he's since put out the same exact terrible album nearly every single year. Because it isn't a ream of loosely-related expletives and thinly-veiled threats at OutKast like Matthew, Dr. Dooom 2 isn't Keith's worst album, but it doesn't do a whole lot to break recent trends, as it follows the latter-day Keith format of ""Oh, he's working with that dude again"" (in this case, KutMasta Kurt) and ""Oh, he's using that name again."" And at the very least, he at least sounds in better form, since as recently as three years ago, there was the implication that he'd gone strictly spoken-word. But ""first single""/selling point ""R.I.P. Dr. Octagon"" pretty much confirms how little there is to Dr. Dooom 2 if you're not interested in Keith's particular brand of inside baseball. Not that you'll be able to figure it out from the listless rambling about label conspiracies, but First Come was clearly borne out of Keith's surprising resentment of how Octagon's rhymes regarding chimpanzee acne and Manischewitz mostly caught the attention of Alternative Nation and glue-sniffing skate kids. Think of it as the first three Eminem albums on a exponentially smaller scale. Dr. Dooom 2 doesn't do much to acknowledge the narrative of its predecessor, which is pretty tough to do considering First Come, First Served managed to somehow house tracks like ""Bitch Gets No Love"" and ""I Run Rap"" with the surprisingly introspective ""Leave Me Alone"" under the auspices of a vengeful cannibal who also happened to be the best rapper alive. This being a 21st-century Kool Keith record, 75-85% of Dr. Dooom 2 finds him taking umbrage at artists that have the nerve to do things that might advance their career (networking, free drinks, and athletes seem to be particular hang-ups). For the most part, he just threatens to pee on people, which would be an interesting way to show one's superiority if Keith hadn't be doing some variation of the same thing for about the last ten years. In fact, a passing mention of Carmelo Anthony and a boast that pretty much contradicts the creation of Dr. Dooom (""white people love me like Fergie"") are about the only evidence of Keith absorbing cultural input of the last five years. The record begins with ""Simon"", which boasts oh-so-timely rants about ""American Idol"" before going off on one of Keith's many pointless tangents about the Gap. Other than the embarrassing Monsters, Inc. narrative of ""Run For Your Life"" and ""How Sexy"", which answers the rhetorical question of its title with ""not very,"" that's pretty much all you get. But really, Keith's in a no-win situation. The past two decades of his career have mostly been predicated on criticizing uncreative rappers with left-field disses (""I'm starting to feel like Jimi Hendrix when they covered the story [of] who started rock""), and while not all chart-toppers are inspiring, being a fan of popular rap these days likely means you're likely a fan of Lil Wayne, Ghostface Killah, or even Aesop Rock. Maybe all three. Point is, mainstream listeners aren't exactly struggling with abstract concepts, and while acknowledging the debt he's owed might result in insufferable KRS-One entitlement, it couldn't be worse than Keith becoming increasingly isolated and weird, refusing to gracefully bow out.","Almost a decade after First Come, First Served, Kool Keith dusts off his Dr. Dooom moniker, teams with Kutmaster Kurt, and threatens to pee on some people.

Hirror Enniffer,Mamiffer,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd95ea9e61561daa772c/1:1/w_160/8874a39a.jpg,2008-10-24 06:00:04,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12356-hirror-enniffer/,Hydra Head,"Seattle's Mamiffer are as if Tori Amos went mute and post-metal. Faith Coloccia's piano is at the fore, yet it's grounded in pop simplicity. Behind her keys lie drums, small percussion, strings, acoustic and electric guitars, bits of vocals, and in general seemingly what was lying around. Coloccia's collaborators are labelmates from Hydra Head: three-fourths of angular post-hardcore outfit These Arms Are Snakes, Hozoji Matheson-Margullis of the less contorted Helms Alee, and Aaron Turner of atmospheric metal giants Isis. These players are all unrecognizable here. Despite the oceanic distortion they summon, this is not an aggressive record. Not overtly so, anyway-- the pairing of piano with amplified noises often seems willfully odd. ""Suckling a Dead Litter"" wraps lovely piano ostinatos in industrial whistles and electric bass. Such background abrasions are distracting, but they also add context, relocating piano from its usual cloistered confines to, say, a steel mill. (Swedish experimental group Midaircondo have also utilized such juxtaposition.) There's something delightfully wrong about a red-hot, My Bloody Valentine-esque melody warbling over a naked piano. It's akin to the filmic device of calm foreground action with a catastrophe in the background. Such exploration of depth perception drives ""Black Running Water"". Diversions come and go-- the glassiness of what sounds like strings played sul ponticello; bagpipe-like melodies; reverbed, gunshot-like drums like Mad Professor remixing Joy Division. Yet the piano remains stately, weaving geometric, Michael Nyman-esque patterns. Such weathering of sonic storms makes the piano more poignant. It's frequently gorgeous; the distorted drone in ""Annwn"" hums like a giant vacuum cleaner, above which Coloccia unspools increasingly urgent filigrees. This record's experimentation is both to its benefit and detriment. It's a textural delight, but it's disjointed. The second track is a single tone that gradually expands into a haze of digital friction à la Nadja or the Angelic Process. The final track is a piano-less acoustic guitar/electric bass workout. While well-executed, neither track belongs. Yet such incongruity makes Hirror Enniffer interesting. The record doesn't mandate how to listen to it. Played loud, its distorted bass could blow heads off. Played softly, its piano makes a fine background. (Coloccia recently scored the film The Calm at the Edge of the Sea.) It's refreshing to hear piano stripped of its usual connotations-- vehicle for virtuosity, prop for pop vocals-- and instead presented just as an instrument.","Like Tori Amos gone mute and post-metal, Seattle's Mamiffer-- Faith Coloccia, plus some dudes in These Arms Are Snakes and members of Isis and Helms Alee-- create a texturally delightful record built on piano.

Chrome's On It EP,Telepathe,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd975e6ef959693230b2/1:1/w_160/40772aa0.jpg,2008-10-24 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12357-chromes-on-it-ep/,IAMSOUND,"With only a handful of singles and EPs to their name and a tendency towards frequent genre overhauls, it hasn't been easy to discern exactly where Telepathe is coming from. On their early recordings, the Brooklyn-based group-- which has entertained a rotating cast of contributors around core bandmembers Busy Gangnes and Melissa Livaudais-- aimed for droney experimentalism (typified on 2006's Farewell Forest EP) before trying on a delicate strain of funereal pop for ""I Can't Stand It"", the band's gorgeous contribution to Rare Book Room's Living Bridge compilation. Recently though, Telepathe has drawn inspiration from Hot 97-style club bangers and propulsive techno, and the group's current incarnation represents a shift towards haunted, beat-heavy electro pop. Chrome's On It is an EP that features two new tracks (the title cut and ""Bells"") arranged by Telepathe and Don Caballero's Eric Emm. It serves both as an official introduction to the band's rejiggered formula and a primer for Dance Mother, their long awaited, David Sitek-produced LP set for release in early 2009. The record also offers several remixes of each song by notable knob twiddlers such as Diplo's Mad Decent crew and Frankmusik, and it feels like Telepathe is using the release to drive home the point that, as of now at least, the band is making club music, albeit of the leftfield sort. Both original songs are fascinating and, in many ways, sound like the work of a completely different band than the one that recorded ""I Can't Stand It"" less than a year ago. ""Chrome's On It"" rides elliptical drum patterns and distorted, squeaking synths before co-opting a Cash Money machine-gun beat about a minute in. ""Bells"", meanwhile, sounds simultaneously ghostly and danceable, its pallbearer vocals set apart from a reverse-looped rhythm that still manages to lurch forward. And despite the material's complicated production (dozens of tracks are stacked upon each other in each song), both cuts lend themselves well to reinterpretation, their individual bits easily unglued and re-affixed at different points for different outcomes. ""Chrome's On It"" is remixed here by Mad Decent, L.A. spaz-pop outfit the Mae Shi, and British vocalist/producer Frankmusik. And surprisingly it's the Mae Shi who make the most of the track. Their version fashions a new chorus by chopping Gangnes' and Livaudais' vocals into smaller parts and places them above a high-energy electro-house beat and catchy syncopated drums. For a guitar-based band that specializes in noisy outbursts, it's a very accomplished slice of melodic techno. The disc's ""B-side"" offers re-imaginings of ""Bells"" by electro-funk/post-punk duo Free Blood as well as Bobby Evans, the beatmaker for L.A. hip hoppers Brother Reade. The former's offering is superior, turning the song into a seedy, slow-building dirge with screeching guitars upping the spookiness factor. More than anything, Chrome's On It announces Telepathe's capacity for exciting, eccentric dance music and emphasizes their love of the beat. Judged as a complete entity, the EP only lags because of its self-imposed repetitiveness-- one's patience for consecutive variations on the same template doesn't endure repeated listens-- and a few lackluster remixes. The Mad Decent contribution (which, perhaps tellingly, doesn't have Diplo's name specifically attached to it) is the real disappointment; the track seems unable to decide between worldly ghettotech and subterranean dubstep and never really takes off as a result. I would argue that Chrome's On It would have been more potent (and listenable) had the band decided to trim the fat, keeping only the Mae Shi and Free Blood reinterpretations alongside its two original pieces. But despite this bit of bloat, the best tracks here are quite strong and hint that the anticipated Dance Mother might be as good as we hope it will be.","This EP by the Brooklyn-based Telepathe-- two new songs including the ace title track, and remixes by the Mae Shi, Diplo's Mad Decent crew, and Free Blood-- represents their shift towards haunted, beat-heavy electro pop.

Car Alarm,The Sea and Cake,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcf35e6ef95969322f67/1:1/w_160/dd393d13.jpg,2008-10-24 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12364-car-alarm/,Thrill Jockey,"""Ah, another Sea and Cake record,"" you might think. Which sounds dismissive yet is comforting-- the Sea and Cake are the definition of consistent and singular: They don't sound like anyone else, they're too smart and careful to make a truly bad record, and they're comfortable with existing range of possibilities of the project. So a new Sea and Cake album means you know what you are getting. This is their eighth full-length, and it follows just a year and a half after Everybody, so maybe some people haven't had a chance yet to miss the band. A lot more time separated each of the prior three (The Fawn in 1997, Oui in 2000, and One Bedroom in 2003), after all. Another Sea and Cake record, so soon? But those who followed the band in its early days will recall that the Sea and Cake released their first three albums in just over a year, a run that, looking back, was one of those rare examples of a truly original band overflowing with creativity. Beginning as yet another side project in a Chicago scene that seemed like nothing but-- often great but relatively lesser bands like Shrimp Boat, the Coctails, and (sorry) Tortoise were among their antecedents-- the Sea and Cake were the ideal sorta-pop face of post-rock, as challenging and complex as their peers but a hell of a lot more listenable. Their self-tilted debut, Nassau, and The Biz-- the three records in that first early run-- are stuffed with fantastic songs and brimming with energy. During a decade obsessed with fusion, constantly looking for ways to integrate previously obscure music of the past into something new and fresh, the Sea and Cake hit a vein where the bright guitars of West Africa and the skittering samba of Brazil could mix with jazz, soul, calypso, and more under the umbrella of indie rock. With so much thrown into the pot, the early Sea and Cake enjoyed a flexibility that allowed them to create songs at will, and during that stretch songs like ""Jacking the Ball"", ""The Biz"", and ""Parasol"" sounded both surprising and strangely inevitable. In 1997, the Sea and Cake released The Fawn, a smoother, slicker, and more muted album than its predecessors, and also one that leaned heavily toward electronics. Its sound and approach guided the band during the quiet period of the next ten years, during which they would release the two records that, while still good (there's that consistency again), stand now as their weakest. The problem with Oui and One Bedroom is hard to define since ""coasting"" isn't really a pejorative with this band; their M.O. is such that you want them to coast a little, to float along unencumbered by friction. Still, last year's Everybody showed what was missing from those records, serving as a reminder that melodic invention, a bit more drive, and quirky hooks had central roles on the best Sea and Cake albums. And all those qualities are present on Car Alarm to an even greater degree, making this their best album in over a decade. The album is called Car Alarm and song titles allude to things like ""Weekend"", ""Window Sills"", and ""Down in the City"", all of which could conceivably be combined to sketch out the album's themes, maybe something about modern urban life and escape or something. But that's not the way that singer Sam Prekop's lyrics work. Words seem chosen for their musical qualities first, and there's faith that a stream of unconnected phrases will for each listener add up to something personal that makes sense. And it does indeed work out that way. The mood of the songs isn't driven by content of the words, but by the overall feel, the way the production and arrangements and melodious turns of phrase combine to create pictures in your head. So the chiming acoustic guitars of ""Weekend"", rubbing up against the bright, chirpy keyboard sequence, all pivoting around the careful wobble of Eric Claridge's bass, evokes a brisk pan across a frenetic streetscape. The easy up-tempo chug of ""On a Letter"", with the drums and bass curling around each other for warmth, a guitar break with the relaxed gregariousness of a Jerry Garcia solo, and Sam Prekop jumping up a half-octave to his whispery upper register for emphasis, makes you think, say, of those moments when you feel just on the cusp of something great and are ready to make your move. The uptempo and spacious ""A Fuller Moon"", with its hints of steel drum and bubbly beat, is a great reminder of how effective the Sea and Cake can be when they put together a tune you can easily hum. ""Keep on holding on,"" Prekop sings, but there's never too much at stake in a Sea and Cake song, and that's the way it should be. Theirs is a contemplative sort of music, unapologetically cerebral even as it provides its share of physical pleasures. The sound throughout-- as ever recorded and mixed by drummer John McEntire-- is gorgeous, and a nice reminder of how thoughtful simplicity can still carry a lot of weight. The guitar tone during the brief solo on ""New Schools"", brushed with the kind of glowing distortion that can only come from a vintage amp that's endured a long life in our debased world, is breathtaking, and other subtle touches abound. The minute-long synth pulse of ""CMS Sequence"" that follows ""On a Letter"" reinforces the album's commitment to flow, as its 12 songs in 38 minutes are laid together just so. The trend continues with the closing ""Mirrors"", an abstract but pretty 98-second steel drum instrumental finds the album-- another Sea and Cake record, yes, but one even completists will continue to reach for-- slipping quietly out the door when no one is looking.","The Sea and Cake are the definition of consistent and singular: They don't sound like anyone else, they're too smart and careful to make a truly bad record, and they're comfortable with the existing range of possibilities of the project.

Uproot,DJ /rupture,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bda513d197565213b5b1/1:1/w_160/527158c4.jpg,2008-10-24 06:00:01,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12371-uproot/,theAgriculture,"Jace Clayton (aka DJ/rupture) inspires a special tenor of admiration from music critics because, in addition to crafting literate, reference-rich, and conversational music, he often writes about it just as adeptly. It's not a stretch, if we're honest, to say that he writes about music more skillfully and illuminatingly than the majority of us who have ever done it full-time. He is, to put it bluntly, one of those people who gets it right far more often and in more different ways than your ordinary person really should. Uproot is another one of those instances. In the broadest, most literal sense, Rupture came to rise as a mashup artist, and there are certainly elements of Uproot-- a mix following on the turrets of 2002's Gold Teeth Thief and Minesweeper Suite and 2005's Low Income Tomorrowland-- that find him flexing those muscles. To give him that tag, though, would be a bit misleading; Rupture uses the form to different ends. Folks like Girl Talk, Diplo, and A-Trak use mashups to make superficial connections, or to make people dance, or to be clever, or, sometimes, to be clever-clever. Rupture, as the name implies, creates fissures. He's less likely to rip four bars or a hooky lyric from something as he is to extract its mood in total; he's less interested in creating fleeting moments than he is in creating large, interweaving tapestries. Because his source material is generally pulled from dubstep, ragga, outré hip-hop, found sounds, and other indigenous musics, those tapestries can often sound political. Clayton has such a global, democratic ear and such a knack for soupy unease that it's difficult not to hear his mixes, at least partly, as commentary pieces. Even when, as is the case with Uproot, his mixes veer on the neatly manicured side, they still ultimately feel combustible out of the box. While Uproot feels every bit as purposeful as those earlier mixes, it achieves that goal though different means. Musically, it's far more subdued and spacious; the lacerating swathes of digital noise have been subbed out for tracks that favor lonely, clattering rhythms, yawning sub-basslines, and displaced vocals. Like a lot of his contemporaries, Rupture has clearly gravitated towards dubstep over the past few years, and Uproot shows his selection skills in that space are as impeccable as they are elsewhere. From the cavernous glissandos in Frescoe's ""Afghanistan"" to the twerky, demodulated keys in Filastine's ""Hungry Ghost (Instrumental)"" to the haunted illbient fog of Moving Ninja's ""Uranium"", Clayton's selections are generous and far-reaching, and build a pretty compelling case for dubstep as the most creatively robust genre in electronic music right now. Perhaps surprisingly, Uproot also features moments of genuine, unfettered softness and beauty. Atki2's ""Winter Buds"" is a dubstep rhythm that rests on an expected rush of warm piano chords, while Dead Leaf's ""Save From the Flames All That Yet Remains"" chases the looping, pulsing ambient of Professor Shehab + Lloop's ""Drunken Monkey (Ambient Remix)"" with a gentle swell of strings and pianos. Most notable, though, is the 1-2 punch that provides the mix's stirring midway point; a bittersweet interlude from cellist and Clayton collaborator Jenny Jones provides the segue into a few minutes from the second of Ekkehard Ehlers' terrific two-part ode to filmmaker John Cassavetes, from his 2002 album Plays. Although roundly earmarked as special by the relative few who heard it upon its release, history has arguably done ""Plays John Cassavetes"" a disservice. Clayton's resurrection of it here, in turn, speaks to another key reason his mixes are special; he's in the rare category of DJs who gives the impression that he is not just wading through music, but correcting it by building his own canon, and constructing an alternate history. It's a place you would want to live.","Jace Clayton, aka DJ/rupture, returns with another outstanding mix.

Animal! / Not Animal,Margot and the Nuclear So and So's,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd8113d197565213b562/1:1/w_160/84051029.jpg,2008-10-23 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12325-animal-not-animal/,Epic,"There is, indeed, a story in Margot and the Nuclear So and So's two-- yes, two-- new releases, or more specifically, a backstory. ""Intense panic attacks had made it difficult for me to leave the house,"" claims songwriter Richard Edwards. He also claims the material that came out of that isolation (admittedly, an isolation he shared with his bandmates, who all supposedly live in the same Indianapolis house) was originally intended for a concept album about the Heaven's Gate cult. Remember them? UFOs? Magic sneakers? Castration? Group suicide? Yeah, that one. The backstory continues: Unsatisfied with their Indiana sessions, the group relocated to Chicago to record with Brian Deck and came up with so much stuff the band and its new major label couldn't agree which songs would comprise the record. So a compromise of sorts was reached: The collection of songs the band preferred, Animal!, would get released on LP, and the collection of songs the label preferred, Not Animal, would get released-- on the same day-- digitally and on CD. That's a lot of backstory to sift through, and the more self-aggrandizing aspects of the group's collective personal and creative ordeal smells a bit like a stunt. After all, since when does an upstart indie band ever strong-arm its big league partner into releasing not a double album, not two companion albums, but two mostly different versions of the same album at the same time? Then again, expectations have been relatively high for these perpetual next big things ever since 2006's The Dust of Retreat made them a kitchen-sink indie band to watch. Maybe Epic was simply willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. But as they say, let's go to the tape. Animal! is reportedly the band's chosen album, so that's the best place to begin. The album starts with ""At the Carnival"", an atmospheric art-rock piece that features Edwards reaching his falsetto as high as comfortable, conveying maximum self-seriousness as it floats off into the ether. It's more mood setter than anthem, slowly easing you into the album, and while you've heard this kind of stuff before, Margot et al. do keep you on your toes with a surprise upbeat New Orleans brass interlude before going back to spookyville. ""O' What a Nightmare!"" is equally morose, featuring its own unexpected genre detour into the blues before getting back to the business of miserablism.  But the fact that ""Hello Vagina"" doesn't live up to its colorful name, sticking instead to the same ol' dull dreariness, unfortunately affirms mounting suspicions that, lo and behold, this album born of isolation and drama is yet another melancholy, self-important slog that mistakes insufferable earnestness for actual emotion. The clearest reference here is Radiohead, of course, but even Radiohead recognized that too much of this stuff can lead you straight into a dead end, at least in a sense that a deluge of rainy day murk can be a bit like banging your head against the brick wall. The death march gets more than a little overwhelming after a short while, making each track feel twice as long as it really is. It doesn't help that the band is not above a little shameless pilfering with the likes of ""Love Song for a Schubas Bartender"", ""A Children's Crusade on Acid"", ""German Motor Car"", and other low-rent cops from Thom Yorke and crew, the mood minimally tempered by some pat, bet-hedging chamber rock arrangements. At least the disc ends on a slightly lighter note, with ""As Tall as Cliffs"" a mix of rootsiness and Modest Mouse-y weirdness that finally hints at sun shining through the grey.
*
Not Animal* is more or less frontloaded with the five songs ported over from the parallel Animal! but ""A Children's Crusade on Acid"" and ""German Motor Car"" mark a much stronger starting point than where they fall on Animal! ""Broadripple Is Burning"" and ""Holy Cow!"" can coast on lazy chord progressions, but they're both brighter and catchier than much of Animal! as well, better positioning the reprise of ""Cold, Kind, and Lemon Eyes"", ""Hello Vagina"", and ""As Tall as Cliffs"" and setting the disc up for the concluding streak of five songs unique to this set. ""Real Naked Girls"" makes better, simpler use of the band's quirky arrangements, not to mention Edwards' falsetto cries. The frenetic ""Pages Written on a Wall"" is actually a little fun, in its own rollicking, riff-wielding, universe-exploding way, while the hooky ""The Shivers (I've Got 'Em)"" and ""The Ocean (Is Bleeding Salt)"" approach the poppier side of art-rock. If the Beach Boys harmonies that adorn the final ""Hip Hop Hurray"" skirt distracting cliché, and Edwards has devolved from Yorke-y anomie to Chris Martin soft rock, there's a silver lining of hopefulness to the track that leaves you open to more rather than relieved to have made it through. Without question, there's a stronger album to be made out of this overkill, especially as neither disc makes a total case for itself as a stand-alone release. One would have sufficed, but forced to choose, the advantage goes to Not Animal, which is smart (or at least commercially savvy) enough to drag some of the band's better songs out of the morass. Margot and the Nuclear So and So's might insist more (or at least more cohesive) misery is better, or even somehow more true or authentic, but Animal! tries so hard and lays it on so thick you're left gasping for air. Not Animal may in the end be no less fussy and over-composed, but it shows you needn't wallow in the rain to appreciate the storm.","Indiana's would-be indie superstars sign to a major and release not one but two new albums, one the band's choice and one the label's choice.

You can hear that experience and the confidence it inspires on Of Sirens Born (previously a 2006 CD-R on Gameboy). It's a dense, patient work that could only have been made by someone who's done this before. There are certainly precursors to his music: the haunting film scores of Popol Vuh, the all-night minimalism of Terry Riley, the garage din of Yellow Swans, the natural timbres of South American folk music. But the assured way that Raglani mixes these styles is less mimicry than synthesis, as if he were directing his influences like actors on a film set. Raglani's movie features an ensemble cast, but the name above the title belongs to Popol Vuh. Through a Kranky press release, he cites the German group's score to Werner Herzog's Aguirre, Wrath of God as a reference point, and you can hear PV's trance-inducing soundtracks in this album's ringing atmospheres. That gives Of Sirens Born a cinematic quality, with widescreen drones perfect for slow pans across foggy landscapes and ominous bodies of water. Through layered sounds and well-timed changes, Raglani builds a wordless narrative, each track feeling like an abstract painting set in motion. The most Popol Vuh moment is opener ""Rivers In"". Pushing choral tones like ocean waves, Raglani sounds both austere and organic. You can practically see empty fields of grass wafting back and forth to these windy chords. The 10-minute ""The Promise of Wood and Water"" follows with similar environmental leanings, but floats off a bit too far, caught in a loop of hums and chimes that veers toward new age. Of Sirens Born recovers quickly. ""Perilous Straits"" evokes Terry Riley with rolling tones that gradually grow denser yet somehow clearer. ""Jubilee"" continues that upward drift, as sheets of static and distortion cover each other like winter blankets. The album's noisiest cut, ""Washed Ashore"", is its peak, a grinding sprint that conjures images of an exploding temple, then descends into small, sparse sounds, like the crackling embers of an acre-sized fire. On an album with such clear antecedants, it's the one track that sounds only like Raglani, blasting away all traces of influence. If he keeps heading in this direction, such reference-deletion will become permanent very soon.","Having already amassed a solid discography of limited-run releases on numerous labels, St. Louis-based drone architect Joseph Raglani arrives at Kranky with a well-formed aesthetic.

Summer Salt & Subway Sun,Eyeless in Gaza,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd7ceb335119a49eceb3/1:1/w_160/b0bea5b8.gif,2008-10-23 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12321-summer-salt-subway-sun/,Beta-Lactam Ring,"England's Martyn Bates and Peter Becker have been recording under the name Eyeless in Gaza for nearly 30 years. The duo formed in 1980, taking their name from an Aldous Huxley novel, and have since put together a body of work as remarkable for its consistent quality as its near-total lack of mainstream recognition. They seem content to toil away in the shadows, though, working their unique post-punk niche in a way that sounds modern, yet somehow also very old. Their out-of-time-ness might account for some of their lack of recognition-- any time a trend comes along, there's a good chance they tired of it five years earlier. Case in point: On Summer Salt & Subway Sun they've nearly abandoned their occasional weird-folk leanings in an era when weird folk music is hot property. The most immediately striking feature of this album is the incredible lengths to which Beta-Lactam Ring has gone to package the thing. It's a 2xCD set housed in a hinged, hard-bound box with two slipcases inside, each solid enough to be their own packaging. There's also a lyric book, and the CDs have dust jackets to keep them from getting scratched. It's a display piece that seems ever the more lavish for appearing in the age of the mp3. The two discs, Summer Salt and Subway Sun, are stylistically similar-- simple sequencing seems to have been the sole determinant of what songs wound up where. Bates and Becker rarely employ anything approaching a full drum kit, and these pieces of music derive most of their rhythmic energy from guitars, electronics, and percussion programming. Bates' smooth and clear tenor leads us through the soundscapes with melodic authority, his vocal lines often turning in strange and unexpected ways as the arrangements shift below them. One of the most masterful compositions on either disc is ""Where Vivid Bloomed"", where the wash of synth that backs the initial verses surprisingly coalesces into a shimmering loop and modulates to a new key. It's a spine-tingling moment where the band manage to wrench a strong emotional effect from a bed of entirely artificial sound, while simultaneously turning a static piece of music into something alive and urgent. There are passages on the record that have the feel of intergalactic drift, as small, pinging sounds float through dark, icy spaces-- the coda of ""All New"" would probably sound just as good soundtracking a planetarium presentation. The duo's instrumentals range from quiet, ghostly, ambient explorations to workouts for drum machine and minimalist guitar. Though their music is too distinctive to peg to any particular peers, they bear a sort of spiritual similarity to Bark Psychosis, Disco Inferno, Talk Talk, and the Durutti Column-- artists who similarly filled the air between genres-- but these guys have done it longer than any of those colleagues. This album is accessible and ultimately enveloping, a worthwhile addition to an already expansive body of work from two musicians who have only ever been interested in doing their own thing.","Martyn Bates and Peter Becker continue to explore outside typical genre boundaries, offering an accessible and enveloping record that's in pace with their largely unrecognized output over the past three decades.

Songs for the Broken Hearted,Windy & Carl,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd8413d197565213b56a/1:1/w_160/bbe5ef1c.jpg,2008-10-23 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12327-songs-for-the-broken-hearted/,Kranky,"Like another married and long-running team, Yo La Tengo's Georgia Hubley and Ira Kaplan, Windy & Carl's focus on craft means they can be trusted to continually improve. The Michigan-based duo have been working with shoegaze, dream pop, and ambient music for 15 years, and their mastery sounds effortless. Maybe it has something to do with working with a spouse-- there's always someone around to call you on your bullshit. Intimacy whittles away at the ego-driven blind spots where poor artistic decisions happen. It's like working with a mirror. You can't fool yourself. And intimacy suffuses Songs for the Broken Hearted, a hushed, ascetic collection of long-form ambient compositions. Some of them are purely instrumental; great banks of fog lit softly from within. Sometimes Windy moves through them like a small figure with a lantern, as if searching for a way out, her voice a whisper amid a slow, steady gale. In turn, we feel as lost and lonesome as she sounds. That might not read like commendation, but it is. The album is sad, but not melodramatic; it's the quiet, complex suspension of feelings that informs adult sadness. Anyone who's been in a long-term relationship knows that intimacy and loneliness are not mutually exclusive. There's nothing flashy about ""Btwn You + Me"", but its airily opaque drone (comparable to works by Christopher Bissonnette and Belong) is formidable, and Windy breathes into it so subtly that her voice sounds like part of its shapeless mass until it fragments into wisps of language. ""La Douleur"" is just as uncompromising, a work in low rumble and high shine that seems continually to surge over a 12-minute arc. ""My Love"" breaks the colossal structures of the first two tracks into glittering shards, with discernible traces of the guitars Windy & Carl process into impenetrable sheets; ""Rhodes"" striates them like a Growing track; ""When We Were"" bends them into monkish hymns. Throughout the formal variations, nothing feels out place or breaks the mood. That sort of refinement simply comes with practice. But craft will only get you so far, especially in ambient music, which becomes blanker as it approaches the ideal. To fill that blankness, you need feeling, of which this album has a surplus. Its genesis looks something like this, according to a blog post by Windy: They made the initial recordings for Songs the same weekend she began her solo album, the equally austere I Hate People. As she worked obsessively on her solo album, Carl worked obsessively on these recordings. (This was a period of unspecified sadness for the couple.) Eventually, Carl gave Windy a CDR of the finished tracks; she listened to them and cried. Finally, she turned to her journals and found the words she couldn't seem to write. ""What was happening/ Between you and me?"" Picture them: Windy & Carl, pursuing their private obsessions on different sides of a wall, trying to say in music what they couldn't say to each other in words. Even when the lyrics are hard to make out-- which they often are-- there's no mistaking their meaning. You can hear it in the distance between the words and the sounds, the beginning of each track and the end, what's said and what isn't. And that depth, those vast empty spaces, is what makes Songs for the Broken Hearted so enveloping and so remote at once.","This Michigan-based duo have been working with shoegaze, dream pop, and ambient music for 15 years, and their mastery of their craft-- and their expression of feeling-- sounds effortless.

Johnny Cash at Folsom Prison: Legacy Edition,Johnny Cash,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd89eb335119a49ececb/1:1/w_160/9aad76d5.jpg,2008-10-23 06:00:01,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12331-johnny-cash-at-folsom-prison-legacy-edition/,Columbia,"It's odd not hearing ""Hello, I'm Johnny Cash"" at the very beginning of this 2xCD/1xDVD set of the Man in Black's infamous show at Folsom Prison. His signature introduction-- as if he actually needed to tell an audience who he was-- is one of the best moments in recorded rock history, rendered in his immediately recognizable robust baritone and prompting unabashed applause. On all previous editions of this concert, whether vinyl, cassette, eight-track, or CD, have begun with that four-word intro, but Columbia/Legacy's new set relegates it to the actual moment in the show, well after Carl Perkins and the Statler Brothers have warmed up the crowd. Here it's revealed to be a rehearsed moment: Hugh Cherry: I need your help. When John comes out here, he will say-- and which will be recorded-- ""Hi there. I'm Johnny Cash."" When he says that, then you respond. Don't respond to him walking out. Welcome him after he says, ""Johnny Cash."" I'll have my hands up, and you just follow me. Johnny Cash: Hello, I'm Johnny Cash. Crowd: Goes nuts. Call it staged if you want, but the moment comes across as genuine, as if the emcee had told the prisoners what they had planned to do anyway. And it's justified by Cash's notoriously volatile performance, which made this concert the foundation of his mid-career resurgence and the framing device for the 2005 biopic Walk the Line. His countercultural appeal during the late 1960s and his abiding popularity throughout the 1970s are grounded in the rough-and-tumble energy he exudes on stage. This edition of At Folsom Prison is a companion piece of sorts to Columbia/Legacy's 2006 reissue of At San Quentin, but it's easily the greater of the two, if only because it was both such a risky endeavor and such a rewarding payoff. When Cash and his crew arrived to play this show, he had been playing prisons routinely and had even serenaded the rowdy crowds at Folsom before, but this was the first time anyone had seen any commercial benefit in recording a show. Described as worried but determined before the show, Cash gives a superlative performance, feisty and playful and a bit maudlin. It's an ideal setlist, with every song playing to the prisoners: ""25 Minutes to Go"" and ""Dark As a Dungeon"" of course, but also ""Green, Green Grass of Home"" and ""I Still Miss Someone"", which evoke a more general sense of yearning. Furthermore, the definitive versions of several of his hits are here, including the raucous ""Cocaine Blues"" and ""Folsom Prison Blues"", but the show is equally remarkable for the banter he maintains with the prisoners. Playing off their excitement, he slyly portrays himself as a rebel: Before ""I Still Miss Someone"", Cash explains, ""This show is being recorded for an album release on Columbia Records, and you can't say 'hell' or 'shit' or anything like that."" Previously the latter has been bleeped out, but this reissue reinstates the expletive. ""How does that grab you, Bob?"" he asks, referring to producer Bob Johnston. Cash played two shows that day, one at 9:40 in the morning and another at 12:40 in the afternoon. While previous editions of At Folsom Prison have reproduced the bulk of the first show while drawing one or two tracks from the second, the Columbia/Legacy edition presents both performances uncut and remastered, which gives the set a documentary feel as well as some historical weight. The first performance sounds tense and immediate, the second somewhat relieved, less energetic and therefore less urgent. The liners suggest that Cash was simply tired, but it seems more likely that the worst of it was over and he knew he had nothing left to prove at that point. Even so, the rough second-show performances of ""Greystone Chapel"" might just surpass Cash's first-show take. With June Carter and the Statlers, he runs through the song twice, channeling all his woe and weariness as he tries to get a good take. That the song's composer, Glen Sherley, was then a Folsom inmate not only lends it gravity, but also bolsters the suspicions Amanda Petrusich addresses in her Pitchfork review of At San Quentin-- namely, that Cash's prison shows ""exploited the convicts' plight to buoy his own rep."" And of course, Cash never really did all the hard time he sang about in ""Folsom Prison Blues""; his violations were largely misdemeanors (picking flowers in Starkville, Mississippi) rather than outright felonies (shooting a man in Reno just to watch him die). But his lackluster rap sheet doesn't make these two shows any less rewarding or meaningful. Rather, they have the force of empathic endeavors, as if he were doing penance for his notorious bad habits. Having courted his own prison sentences-- both literally and metaphorically-- Cash knew how little separated the free and the condemned, so he turned his angst into raucous country music during his first performance and breathed a deep sigh of relief during his second.","A companion piece of sorts to Columbia/Legacy's 2006 reissue of At San Quentin, At Folsom Prison is the greater of the two, if only because it was both such a risky endeavor and such a rewarding payoff.

Earth Junk,The Howling Hex,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd64ea9e61561daa76c7/1:1/w_160/c8dbf064.jpg,2008-10-22 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12302-earth-junk/,Drag City,"Following the demise of Royal Trux in 2001, guitarist Neil Michael Hagerty went on to record with D.C. punk honcho Ian Svenonius on Weird War's no-frills, self-titled debut. Since then, he's largely focused on the Howling Hex, a prolific, rambling rock project currently based in New Mexico that features a revolving cast of musicians, the only constant being Hagerty himself. Over the last five years, the group's nine albums have been adventurous, if at times distracted, experiments that inject conventional songwriting formulas with the sort of playful absurdity and nihilism that Hagerty's been trading in since his days with Pussy Galore in the 1980s. The Howling Hex's latest record, Earth Junk, has many qualities that invite the listener's attention and suggest great musical possibility: there's a general ambience of late-60s psych that runs throughout the album, both in the tone of the recording and in the spiky, upfront guitar lines which are pleasingly reminiscent of the Zombies. The band also effectively adopts the Hammond organ as the dominant percussive instrument, which relaxes the need for proper drums in the manner of Suicide while giving the music a nice spaciousness and melodic breathing room. Combined with a deficiency of actual hooks, however, the lack of a beat ends up taking its toll, leading to forgettable songs and giving the record an overly linear feel. Fortunately, Hagerty's proficiency as a songwriter is revealed in his guitar playing, which always features heavily on Howling Hex recordings and introduces color and dynamic spark to the rough bagginess of the song structures. Opening the album with whined lyrics like ""ring-a-ding-ding"" and ""rama tam tama"" does not bode well for what is to come. There is something deeply irritating about Hagerty's voice on this album; it sounds overtly affected, as though he's trying to emulate the vocal style of the type of baroque pop that has clearly influenced this record while falling awkwardly short. Luckily, this is balanced out by the reverb-saturated, soulful vocals of Eleanor Whitmore on tracks such as ""Annie Get Redzy"". She also takes the lead on ""Faithful Sister"" and ""Contraband & Betrayal"", and indeed, the tracks she sings on are generally the strongest. When Whitmore's voice is paired with the playful, honky-tonk keys, the music often strikes common ground with the Fiery Furnaces, though it lacks the taunt weave and quick-wink smartness that makes that band so intriguing. The back of the album artwork shows a photograph of Hagerty's face, beside which the track listing is split in two, possibly suggesting that the album is open to being seen in two parts. Certainly it seems that way, as from middle track ""No Good Reason"" onwards, the songwriting becomes more enjoyable, such as the bluesy, spaced out craziness of ""Blood & Dust"". Still, these later highlights are not enough to recommend the album at as a whole. At just over 33 minutes, Earth Junk is a short recording, but even at that length, the limited sonic range and repetitive tricks are ultimately draining.","The latest album from the ever-shifting avant-rock project of Neil Michael Hagerty, formerly of Royal Trux, has the general ambience of late-60s psych and plenty of room for his dynamic guitar work.

The Way I See It,Raphael Saadiq,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd63ea9e61561daa76c3/1:1/w_160/55bf830d.jpg,2008-10-22 06:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12301-the-way-i-see-it/,Columbia,"After the decreasingly inspired string of retro-soul hits and the increasingly depressing string of headlines trumpeting new lows for Amy Winehouse, its chief (and really its only) star, the trend seems to be sputtering out in fourth-quarter 2008, with Adele already a footnote on U.S. shores. It's actually refreshing, then, to hear a record like Raphael Saadiq's unabashedly retro The Way I See It, which doesn't try to ""update"" old soul sounds to a hip-hop world and a white singer. Instead, the former Tony! Toni! Toné! frontman works under the simple belief that those styles created in Philadelphia, Detroit, and Memphis during the 1960s speak as loudly now as they did then. They don't need to be revived, resurrected, retrofitted, or revitalized. They just need to be played. So Saadiq, an artist whose career has failed to match his considerable talents, self-produces The Way I See It to sound out of time. Playing almost all the instruments, he keeps the drums taut, the basslines rubbery, and makes sure the tambourine remains a vital component of the rhythm section. His tightly wound guitar on ""Staying in Love"" even recalls his early New Jack Swing riffs (see: ""If I Had No Loot""). The album starts rockily, however, with ""Sure Hope You Mean It"", a clever rewrite of ""How Sweet It Is"" that suffers from a bad mix. Against Saadiq's exuberant delivery (he's a superlatively smooth vocalist), the percussion sounds slightly off-beat: The tambourine shakes before hitting on the beat, creating an audio illusion of being too fast, while the snare rolls into the verses sound too slow, like they've been manipulated from a faster performance. As a result, the song sound like it's forever winding down, then struggling to correct itself. It's a curious opener, technically flawed but conceptually solid right down to the distant yoo-hoo's. Fortunately, ""100 Yard Dash"" rights things quickly, sounding appropriately dashed off. Sex and social issues commingle on The Way I See It, with playfully physical songs like ""Dash"", ""Just One Kiss"", and ""Let's Take a Walk"" (sample lyric: ""Love can happen anywhere"") alongside fare like ""Keep Marchin'"" and ""Big Easy"". The latter, obviously, is about Katrina and features the Rebirth Brass Band, yet Saadiq makes no larger point than WTF, capping an uptempo chorus with a massive question mark: ""Someone please tell me what's going on,"" he sings, echoing Marvin Gaye but sounding right this very moment as the horns blare around him. It's immensely affecting without hitting you over the head. Afterwards, he road-trips to Philly for the lushly orchestrated ""Just One Kiss"" (with Joss Stone kept in check) and ""Oh Girl"", which cuts a big slice out of the Stylistics' ""Betcha By Golly Wow"". The cloud cushion of strings and slow-moving sitar-sounding riff come across as overly curatorial, but the bonus version of the song sounds much better for sounding so modern, thanks to Jay-Z's pointed rhythms and verbal shadow-boxing. I can't tell you a thing about what Jay-Z raps about, and he probably left the studio before the second verse, but he opens up the song quite a bit, making it less dependent on its source material. Still, few artists live so vitally in the past as Saadiq.","Raphael Saadiq's unabashedly retro fourth album doesn't try to ""update"" old soul sounds; instead, the former Tony! Toni!

Receivers,Parts & Labor,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd7eea9e61561daa76ff/1:1/w_160/53d90b00.jpg,2008-10-22 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12323-receivers/,Jagjaguwar,"Never mind the 21st century's answer to the Tarkus on the front cover-- Receivers is Parts & Labor's most ambitious record, for sure, but they haven't gone off the deep end or made irreparable changes to their distinctive sound. They're still stubbornly reconstructing punk anthems from the same raw parts-- Dan Friel's wheezing, bagpipe-reminding keyboards chiefly among them-- but building something bigger, from stronger foundations. They aim for tension and nuance where they'd previously shouted and bludgeoned (not that anyone minded the bludgeoning, of course) and their tables of broken toys sound like tidal waves of melody and sound. Of course, another essential part of their sound was the machine-man pummeling of drummer Christopher R. Weingarten, who has since left the band. Rather than fill his spot with more brute force, Joe Wong takes a relatively less-is-more approach, and Sarah Lipstate joins them on guitar with often clean, spacious playing that makes an auspicious contribution to these nine songs. ""Satellites"" is driven by a bright recurring mechanical tone, the rhythm of a one-chord guitar strum, and a voice that doesn't bellow or bark, but actually sings. The familiar 8-bit buzz of the keyboards bring in a counter-melody, the harmonies kick in and reach for the highest registers. If it isn't clear how ""big"" the band are going, all of it falls together for the second verse-- especially when the song builds to a towering unstable coda and finally evaporates into a minute of placid, layered static. ""Nowheres Nigh"" is just as strikingly clean and ambitious, with a similar reach in vocals-- to be frank, neither of these guys are understudies for the Three Tenors, but BJ Warshaw confidently sells his vocals here and there's more than enough texture in these songs to comb over the thin parts. ""Mount Misery"" finds a way better vehicle for Dan Friel's croon, borrowing some more evocative theremin-aping electronics from his recent (and excellent) solo record as well as a damn-near folky guitar pluck from Lipstate, all over a half-time skipping rhythm. It's a big change for the band, but it works just as well as its busted-robot hardcore did on their previous two albums. Parts follow it up with their best curveball-- the slow simmer of ""The Ceasing Now"", replete with mechanical handclaps-- and save their boldest new material for the album's final three tracks. It's not just more harmonies or more fun noises that they've piled on: Nothing on previous records compares to the wheeze and full-band crash on the chorus of ""Wedding in a Wasteland"" or the grinding, clattering crescendo of ""Prefix Free""-- not to mention the fake-out that stretches the tension rather than merely exploding. They've tried all these things before to some degree, but just not in songs as layered, dynamic, or delivered with such a steady hand. It's hard to predict where they'll go from here when Receivers sounds as if they've stretched their favorite sonic ideas to the very brink of saturation-- but no one could have guessed they'd take them quite this far.","Receivers is Parts & Labor's most ambitious record-- and it finds them growing to a four-piece with the addition of guitarist Sarah Lipstate-- but its still finds the Jagjaguwar band stubbornly reconstructing punk anthems from the same raw parts.

Liver! Lung!

Owe your label one last album, but are locked in arguments with your bandmates, imprisoned by writer's block, or don't want to waste your great new material on them? Just record from the sound board one night at the club, and-- presto!-- you've fulfilled your obligations. Luckily Glasgow's Frightened Rabbit are one of the few bands that earn such an indulgence. They have proven, in the course of their brief career, that they are definitely not slackers; their first two albums, Sing the Greys and Midnight Organ Fight, were released within a year of each other. And though Lung! Liver! FR!, which was recorded at a hometown gig in July, includes neither new songs nor any track from their charming 2007 debut, it succeeds at stripping down and speeding up Organ Fight's songs, closing the gap between the band's more mannered studio image and their sweaty, raw live one. On their studio albums, Frightened Rabbit's charismatic, bass-free folk rock is sadly scathing but always pleasantly rousing, and their catchy acoustic melodies soften the jagged edges of their songs. They express their aggression instead through the frisson in their acoustic and electric guitar interplay. Live, however, the lyrical bitterness is unadorned, the electric guitars mostly ignored. James Graham from the Twilight Sad joins the band to sing ""Keep Yourself Warm"", and when he wails ""It takes more than fucking someone to keep yourself warm,"" there is a desperation in his quivering voice. Though the arrangements haven't changed much-- sacred/sad organs still whirr in the background, but instead of the fuzzy, belligerent embrace of a crashing electric guitar, an acoustic thrums with insistent melancholy-- the overall feeling is more urgent. And though lines like ""Jesus is just a Spanish boy's name/ How come one man got so much fame?"" (from ""Heads Roll Off"") always had a provocative power, bled of the original's rocking guitar chug, the audible catch in singer Scott Hutchison's throat makes him sound more sorrowful than smart-assy. The drumming of Grant Hutchison (Scott's brother) is a throbbing, muscular base, but live, the rich thump of his kick drum has a surprising musicality. On some tracks you can hear just how hard he plays, and on others he offers nuance that gooses the emotion in his brother's carpal tunnel-inducing strum. Billy Kennedy's keyboard parts, used in the studio to fill out the rhythm section, have added importance here, whether taking on the guise of a hollow synthesizer, an ethereal organ, or a mournful piano. Stripped of their guitar jangle, these songs are left with their exposed nerves, aching delivery, and rhythmic heaviness, which makes the keys a welcome melodic guide through this collection. Though there is a newfound vitality to the live incarnations of these tracks, many may wonder what is the point of basically re-buying Midnight Organ Fight with added cheering-crowd sounds. The hope is that, for fans, this album imbues added depth to the familiar songs, bringing out their bruised sentiment and illustrating Frightened Rabbit's power as a live band. (Although Ross Cook's mandolin on ""Old Old Fashioned"" lends this album the air of a local hootenanny.) But for those who missed Frightened Rabbit's last record, those who weren't already enthralled by these tuneful Scots, this album will really come alive. After all, for those listeners, these 12 tracks are new and, therefore, essential.","Recorded at a Glasgow gig in July, Lung! Liver!

"The Bootleg Series, Vol. 8: Tell Tale Signs: Rare and Unreleased 1986-2006",Bob Dylan,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd88c0084474cd0c2d0c/1:1/w_160/9c2642da.jpg,2008-10-22 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12330-the-bootleg-series-vol-8-tell-tale-signs-rare-and-unreleased-1986-2006/,Columbia,"There's often an understandable wariness when it comes to criticizing Bob Dylan-- for one thing, he's better at this words stuff than we are. For another, inscrutability is pretty much his career's one constant and trying to get into his head is a fool's errand. Each twist in the man's art leaves you scrambling to re-assess the last. For instance, his brace of old-time covers albums in the early 90s were decried as evidence that Bob's flush was finally busted-- the well was dry. Now it seems like they were the work of a craftsman re-acquainting himself with some of his most basic tools before putting them to more remarkable use. How to put his work into context? The Bootleg Series is your best starter kit. Tell Tale Signs is the eighth volume in Dylan's anthology of discards, alternate takes, and live performances, this time offering an alternative path through his last two decades' work. The series presents itself as an appendix, but it's more like a glossary-- offering crucial insight and definition. And if that sounds too dry, rest assured there's also some astonishing music here. If a critic can't write Dylan off, there's a temptation to go in the other direction: This collection's remit starts with 1989's Oh Mercy, hailed at the time as a staggering return to form. Now it sounds relatively clumsy, its reverb-heavy production straining to fit Dylan into a modern rock mold. But the songs were there, and Tell Tale Signs is thick with tracks from this period, casting it in a far richer light. The familiar is transformed: ""Most of the Time"", a vista of shimmery regret on Oh Mercy, becomes a delightfully rueful acoustic bounce lent extra warmth and wistfulness by its staccato harmonica. ""Dignity"" shows up as a weighty piano ballad and as a jaunty full-band outing that brings out the humor in the song-- I like that version more, but if there's one thing this collection tells you, it's that ""definitive"" with Dylan is a trick of the release schedule. So is it even possible to speak generally about ""late Dylan""? It seems to me that his most recent period, the late flowering that kicked off with Time Out of Mind in 1997, has seen a shift in his approach. While the cluster of live tracks here demonstrate that he's still very much a rock artist, as a songwriter he's returned to blues and folk, with their storyteller's structure of verses and refrains. In place of a chorus, Dylan's songs often have a payoff that each verse winds its way towards and some of the joy is in following that image-trail to the repeated endpoint. The payoff refrain accumulates effect in different ways-- on ""Dignity"" it's ramming a point home, on ""Mississippi"" it's a resigned reminder that the narrator keeps on screwing up. On several tracks its inevitability brings the whole song an air of predestination, and the payoff has the weight of Judgement on it. ""High Water (For Charley Patton)""-- here in a fierce live version-- ends each verse with a cry of ""High water everywhere!"", the repetition making Dylan's catastrophic vision more and more encompassing. ""High Water"" fits Tell Tale Signs' overall mood-- one of barfly eschatology, smokily rambling half-stories of lust and loss, and a dash of apocalypse, told with a chuckle that's halfway to a death rattle. The vibe crosses eras and musical tracks-- the rich production on ""Dreamin' of You"" is a gothic heat-haze; the brisk ""Tell Ol' Bill"" conjures the bone-rattling spirit of Tom Waits-- but it holds the set together with mordant wit, making the record far more than a grab-bag. Listeners who bridle even at Dylan's 60s voice should, however, stay well away: This set shows the instrument in its progressive collapse into rheum and ruin. But only in terms of tone: When it comes to fitting voice to material, or threading the audience through a song, or capturing a lifetime's lessons in a twist of inflection, he's still one of the world's best. Take the outstanding ""Red River Shore"", for instance: Dylan's voice is a halting croak throughout this tale of obsessive, mystical love, but his phrasing is impeccable, comfortable switching from the high-flown to the vernacular in the space of a line, and drifting between emphatic certainty and querulous doubt as it becomes clear that the girl-- or Dylan himself-- may be a spectre. As the stately Latin music swells and strengthens, Dylan weakens, and by the song's end he sounds older than ever. Of course, Dylan has a vested interest in sounding ancient: The last 15 years have seen him re-engaging not just with his own craft, but with the roots and history of American song, becoming one of its most prominent flame-keepers with his ""Theme Time Radio Hour"" show. My favorite track of all here is a tender reading of a Jimmie Rodgers tune, ""Miss the Mississippi"", gentle and direct in its sentiment: Dylan has never been afraid to be corny when it suits him. And the debt his own music owes to the past has never been clearer: Sometimes on Tell Tale Signs he comes on like a broke-down transmitter, singing in epigrams, the disconnected and cryptic verses he's always used sounding like snippets of a thousand imaginary old-time songs. Nourishing and engrossing in a way a Greatest Hits album couldn't be, Tell Tale Signs is a testament to Bob Dylan's love of music as well as his continued mastery in crafting it.","The eighth volume in Bob Dylan's anthology of discards, alternate takes, and live performances, this volume offers an alternative path through his last two decades' work, offering crucial insight and definition. And if that sounds too dry, rest assured there's also some astonishing music here.

Yosuga,Nagisa Ni Te,by: Aaron Leitko,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd4113d197565213b4de/1:1/w_160/9b1b3116.jpg,2008-10-21 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12273-yosuga/,Jagjaguwar,"Japanese duo Nagisa Ni Te have never strayed far from the territory they know best: restrained and romantic folk. The songs of Shinji Shibayama and partner Masako Takeda's play like a Zen Buddhist's tribute to the Beatles-- clean guitar chords are slowly strummed and lyrics take the form of austere pop-haiku meditatons on love, nature, and love-amidst-nature. Yosuga, the duo's seventh album and first release in roughly four years, not only adheres to the formula, but strips things down even further. Founded in 1992, Nagisa Ni Te (the name translates to On the Beach) has always been a couple's band, a songwriting outlet based on the relationship between Shibayama and long-time girlfriend Takeda. A revolving cast of backing musicians helped to flesh things out and the band often skewed into hushed psychedelic territory not too far removed from hippie-dippy peers like Ghost or Magic Hour. At the very least, you got a few guitar solos. But although Nagisa Ni Te's social circle hasn't slimmed-- a few friends fill in on bass and lead guitar-- Shibayama and Takeda seem to have Yosuga all to themselves. The spontaneity and collective vibe of previous efforts like On the Love Beach is largely absent. Even the production-- lacking in room resonance or reverb-- seems hermetically sealed from the outside world. This time Nagisa Ni Te are on the beach all by themselves. Album opener ""Premonition"" is Yosuga's single truly energetic moment, and it's still pretty laid back. The sound of chirping birds gives way to low-key love-rock with Shibayama and Takeda strumming simple chords over bubbling organ figures. Almost all of the album's lyrics are in Japanese (""Premonition"" has a chorus in English) and it's hard to fully appreciate Yosuga's songs without reading the translations in the liner notes. Judging by the guitar figures and melodies alone, ""Seeing the Sea"" sounds rather mournful and dour. But closer inspection reveals a sexier intent: ""I want to strip you even more naked/ More, harder/ Meeting melting."" Most of Yosuga plays like a conversation between lovers-- which is ostensibly what it is. Shibayama and Takeda trade phrases, answer each other's melodies, and sing the choruses in blissed-out unison. But halfway through the album-- which runs a seemingly eternal 70 minutes-- this intimacy starts to feel a bit awkward and claustrophobic. With spare instrumentation, ascetic melodies, and a pace that's positively glacial, there's little to fuel Yosuga but the intensity of Nagisa Ni Te's affections. On songs like the album's title track that intimacy is so pronounced that one can't help but feel like an outsider-- a bothersome third wheel on somebody else's hot date. While that often makes for lovely and sweetly innocent listening, it also demands a lot of patience.","This Japanese duo has long specialized in restrained and romantic folk, but this release is especially austere and intimate.

Temper,Benoît Pioulard,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd8613d197565213b56e/1:1/w_160/a24e5fe2.jpg,2008-10-21 06:00:04,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12329-temper/,Kranky,"Since releasing his first LP, Précis, in 2006, Thomas Meluch (aka Benoît Pioulard) has hauled his acoustic guitar, effects pedals, and samplers from Michigan to indie rock's West Coast mecca, Portland (apparently Brooklyn is finally full). Relocation hasn't had a perceptible effect on Meluch's DIY M.O.-- not yet, anyway. Even if Temper's opener ""Ragged Tint"" deploys a more aggressive, even violent, guitar figure than anything found on Précis, the albums are for the most part woven of similar strands of instrument and machine, pop and art, beauty and noise. Nevertheless, location-- or, rather, dislocation-- seems to remain one of the project's core concerns. Meluch never has, to my knowledge, satisfactorily explained his French-inflected pseudonym (it, uh, came to him in a dream) and it's mighty tempting to write it off, along with his conspicuous song titles, as student pretension (he just recently graduated from college). The name does, however, plant a few helpful signposts to Europe and critics are, unsurprisingly, fond of comparing Benoît Pioulard with Fennesz, Four Tet, Boards of Canada, and any handy Gallic laptop act. Considering Meluch's slack enunciation and pretty much incomprehensible (English) lyrics, he might as well be singing in French (or Italian or Serbo-Croatian). Then again, Zach Baron's Pitchfork review of Précis makes just as compelling a case for Benoît Pioulard's kinship with state-siders Brightblack Morning Light and Califone. Hell, I'll point north. Droning interludes ""Ardoise"", ""Sweep Generator"", and the mournful cello-lined ""Tapyre""-- plus the way many of Meluch's flatly sung melodies slip their instrumental and found-sound shells gently, as if by accident-- resemble a folkier, less geeky version of Dan Snaith's Manitoba and early Caribou work. ""Golden Grin""'s archaic-sounding tune could be a afterthought to the fuzzy noise collage that precedes it, as if Meluch left a recorder in the woods and happened to capture a passing hiker's song. Temper offers a few straight pop pieces (""Ahn"" and ""Idyll""), that plop vocals at the fore and recognize other conventional mixing hierarchies. But in ""Physic"" and ""The Loom Pedal"", Meluch's tamped-down voice enjoys no more authority than the guitar arpeggios, shuffling beats, or tape hiss. Like the album art's diffused light Polaroids, its music remains sonically and spacially uncertain. However disparate its geographic points of reference, Temper is an artistically consistent, tonally temperate, record--  depending on your taste, maybe a little too balmy and dispassionate. If Meluch's lost anything on recent journeys, it isn't his fondness for wrapping yearning expansiveness in snug, even stifling, intimacy. ""A Woolgathering Exodus"", the album's lushest track, pulses with psychedelic, mind-expanding keys chords even as Meluch's voice implies that he's on the verge of nodding off before the fire. He doesn't have to decide between engagement or non-: The song fizzles out in static.","Thomas Meluch follows his excellent Benoît Pioulard debut Précis with another record woven of similar strands of instrument and machine, pop and art, beauty and noise.

"Awake, My Soul: The Original Soundtrack / Help Me to Sing: Songs of the Sacred Harp",Various Artists,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd74ea9e61561daa76ef/1:1/w_160/cf901402.jpg,2008-10-21 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12315-awake-my-soul-the-original-soundtrack-help-me-to-sing-songs-of-the-sacred-harp/,Awake Productions,"Since watching the 2006 documentary Awake, My Soul: The Story of the Sacred Harp and listening to the just-released soundtrack, I've been trying to imagine what it would be like to hear a Sacred Harp singing from within the hollow square. That space around which all the singers gather is, according to the documentary, the ideal place to hear this form of a cappella singing, where you can feel the full force of every voice in the room. The singers don't take a stage or stand in a loft, as they do in many churches. Rather, the choir becomes the congregation, the performers their own audience. Sacred Harp singing-- or shape-note singing, as it is often called-- is not performative or presentational, but participatory and communal, and to hear these songs from your stereo speakers or ear buds is to experience only a fraction of the music's power. Or, as filmmaker Matt Hinton writes in the liner notes to the Awake, My Soul­ soundtrack, ""A Sacred Harp recording may be the light, but a Sacred Harp singing is the sun."" Despite that intrinsic shortcoming, the soundtrack nevertheless sounds revelatory and exultant, dense with harmonic ideas and often overwhelming even on CD. Sacred Harp singing is spiritual music, but despite its name and the circumstances of its practice, there is no scriptural imperative for this style of singing, aside from the Biblical admonition to ""Seek the old paths and walk therein""-- a verse printed in the Sacred Harp hymnal. Its authority is primarily historical, with roots in the settlement of the American colonies and the consequent spread of singing schools and itinerant music teachers. During the 1800s, a composer named B.F. White developed a musical technology that employed only four notes of the seven-note scale-- fa, sol, la, and mi-- which he represented on the page with different shapes. Hence the name shape-note singing. The soundtrack consists of recordings made between 1998 and 2006 at rural churches in Georgia and Alabama. Many begin with a verse sung only in syllables, creating a dense swarm of harmony from which melodies and lyrics arise. Some you may be familiar with: I sang ""Jordan, 66"" innumerable times growing up in a Southern Baptist church, but I knew the song as ""There Is a Land of Pure Delight"". And everyone knows ""New Britain, 45t"" as ""Amazing Grace"", which the Liberty Baptist Church singers in Henegar, Alabama, manage to render freshly captivating.  Many of these recordings are straightforward, showcasing full, clean notes with no vibrato or slurs, but they are never simple. ""Stratfield, 142"" and ""America, 36t"" sound like chants, only more emphatic and excited, and the soundtrack contains several examples of fuguing songs, including the moving ""Russia, 107"", which set the singers in a roundelay to create intricate rhythms and harmonies. Sacred Harp singing is not only one of the country's earliest indigenous musical traditions, but in clearly rejecting European refinements, it is an essentially American style, favoring populism rather than exceptionalism. Singers sing together, with no soloist nor accompaniment of any kind. Even in the rigid strictures of these shaped notes, there are, however, occasional opportunities for self-expression. On the incredibly raucous ""Bear Creek, 269"", a lone alto soars an octave above the harmonies, ecstatic in praise and music-making. So don't mistake the music's historical weight for for a duty-bound listen or a scholarly undertaking: As music heard well outside the hollow square, the recordings can be powerful and moving. To quote the popular hymn, this soundtrack has its own ten thousand charms. Accompanying Awake, My Soul is a second disc titled Help Me to Sing, on which contemporary musicians offer their own interpretations of Sacred Harp songs. They are largely and inevitably more subdued, and thankfully so. Attempts to mimic too literally the abandon of actual Sacred Harp singings would surely ring false. Rather than emphasizing performance, Help Me to Sing focuses on the songs themselves, historical documents that in some cases predate the Declaration of Independence, yet still sound viable today. A tribute album by default, Help Me to Sing opens and closes with the otherworldly, sinner-in-crisis drone of ""Blooming Youth, 176b"" by Rayna Gellert and John Paul Jones and ""Bound for Canaan, 82b"" by Old 97s bass player Murry Hammond. In between are a variety of interpretations and musical settings, some dutifully reverent and others slightly freer. The Innocence Mission's ""Africa, 178"" and Liz Janes' ""Abbeville, 33b"" sound hushed and liturgical, as if singing might be a form of personal prayer, and Jim Lauderdale (who narrates the documentary) creates what might be called a low lonesome sound on ""The Christian's Hope, 134"". On the other hand, Elvis Perkins in Dearland and the Good Players re-create the spirit of Sacred Harp singing with different means-- namely, rock instruments-- and toward different ends, while Tenement Halls (featuring Hinton on guitar) rework ""Essay, 157"" into a rambunctious rocker and All Things Bright & Beautiful's ""China, 163b"" builds and builds but never resolves, the journey being much more important than the destination. Largely, the more subdued songs carry more power. Sam Amidon's ""Kedron, 48b"" has a sackcloth-humble arrangement featuring only a ragged electric guitar, which suits his bent voice ideally, and DM Stith's ""Christian's Farewell, 347"" needs only an ethereal choir for accompaniment. By contrast, the menacing bass vocal on Richard Buckner's ""Windham 38b"" comes across as cartoonish and Woven Hand's sinister ""Consecration, 448t"" just sounds hammy. But the most telling moment on Help Me to Sing comes in the transition between Danielson's gloriously strange, if curiously withdrawn ""Sermon on the Mount, 507"" and Doc Watson's homey performance of ""Am I Born to Die?, Idumea 47b"" That segue-- from orchestrated to merely accompanied, from public to personal-- reveals the durability and versatility of these old songs. They can convey any emotion, support any reading, and inspire in any setting.","Sacred Harp singing-- essentially American spiritual music favoring populism rather than exceptionalism-- continues to take small steps away from the hollow square thanks to excellent work like the Awake, My Soul documentary and its soundtrack.

"""Singles""",The Long Blondes,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd83c0084474cd0c2d04/1:1/w_160/163aeab0.jpg,2008-10-21 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12326-singles/,Angular,"In the early 1980s, Orange Juice practically invented the whole idea of indie with a string of singles for hipster Scottish label Postcard-- then went right out and glossed things up for Polydor on their debut LP. A lot of people were hurt, even pissed. That sort of jealous guarding of lo-fi sensibilities seems more rare today: Another Scottish band, Glasvegas, recently parlayed some scrappy, excellent singles into a major-label album, then hired Muse's producer and still got a 9/10 from the NME. But a lot of people who got excited about the Long Blondes' four early singles in the middle of this decade were let down by their debut LP, Someone to Drive You Home. Perhaps the disappointment stemmed in part from the dearth of these sort of handmade, indie throwbacks in the UK these days-- bands with a keen sense of history, who still associate indie with things like 7""s (or button badges, or John Peel) in the first place. (Though maybe with a group like Los Campesinos! around that's loosening up a bit.) It could also, however, have been simply some heel-digging from people who missed the rawness and jagged edges of those early tracks, which became buffed and shined a bit on the album. From a band as stylish and keenly aware of how to put themselves together as the Long Blondes, it's no real surprise though that they took advantage of the opportunity to pretty up their songs-- though that sheen has overwhelmed their more unique and appealing qualities on this year's Erol Alkan-produced ""Couples"". No such shine exists on the compilation ""Singles"". Of the dozen songs here, only three appeared on their debut album-- ""Giddy Stratospheres"", ""Lust in the Movies"", ""Separated By Motorways""-- and these versions are, on the whole, a bit more appealing. ""Giddy"", in particular, when stretched to almost five minutes, prolongs and heightens the pent-up sexual frustration in the song. Elsewhere, I would have sworn when first looking at this tracklist that ""Autonomy Boy"" and ""Appropriation (By Any Other Name)"" had made the debut-- they're among the band's top-tier songs. Each of those two is cut more from ""Giddy""'s cloth rather than hewing close to short, sharp stuff like ""Motorways"" (heard here in demo form). Singer Kate Jackson excels on each when given the room to move around in a song, stretch her syllables a bit, get comfortable within a sonic space, and let her words and theatrical delivery do the work. On many of these early songs, she functions best like that, as she slowly develops and clicks into the persona that worked so well on Someone. She's best when she flits between wizened observer, buzzing like a queen bee taking stock of a scene's sexual and social politics, and home alone wishing she was doing something-- anything-- else. It's a familiar dichotomy-- a catty front to mask her characters' own sense of emptiness-- and she pulls it off with a hard, detached exterior and a soft, vulnerable core. Other early songs skirt closer to rote exercise (the girl-group of ""Polly"", the lo-fi sloganeering of ""New Idols"", the pub-rock of ""Darts"", the jangle pop of ""My Heart Is Out of Bounds""), with a few glimpses of the more fully-formed band in place to make them more interesting than they'd otherwise be. Still, the Long Blondes were at their best when Jackson-- IMing in the pub on her own, lamenting a night in, or lording it over a night out-- is the clear focus, navigating the world of aging hipsterdom like a UK companion to James Murphy or Craig Finn. All three writers are storytellers, but Jackson better crystallizes a specific persona, and in that way the Jarvis Cocker comparisons are dead on-- the more she encapsulates the post-internet indie queen fighting not to cede ground to the kids coming up from behind, the more compelling she is. And with a new generation of those UK kids possibly galvanized by Los Campesinos! and again hooked on the ephemera and attitude of indiedom, perhaps this record-- a set of scrappy, charming indie songs that draw on traditions of great UK guitar pop-- will find a new, more appreciative audience. Either way, this is alas a bittersweet coda to the Long Blondes story. Earlier this week, the group announced it was disbanding, four months after guitarist Dorian Cox suffered a debilitating stroke. Cox, worried that he'd not be able to play guitar again, made the announcement himself on the group's MySpace on the day this record was released, tragically closing the book on the band just as listeners are given the chance to easily digest all of its recorded output.","This week the Long Blondes announced that they were disbanding. Though not intended as such, ""Singles"" serves as a bittersweet coda to the band's story, highlighting scrappy and charming songs that draw on traditions of great UK guitar pop.

Skeletal Lamping,Of Montreal,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcf4ea9e61561daa75d3/1:1/w_160/3170870c.jpg,2008-10-21 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12328-skeletal-lamping/,Polyvinyl,"If there's any lingering suspicion that alter ego Georgie Fruit was merely an offhand whimsy by Kevin Barnes-- just tongue-in-cheek self-mystification-- Skeletal Lamping will clear things up. Last year's Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer? was so rich with cathartic pop goodness it's easy to forget Barnes supposedly morphed into a middle-aged African-American transsexual midway through the album. And he hasn't yet changed back. Longtime fans still hoping for a return to The Gay Parade or Cherry Peel days of innocence may want to stop reading, because Skeletal Lamping roofies Hissing Fauna's back half to live out Barnes', er, Georgie's sexual fantasies. However, the story with Skeletal Lamping isn't Barnes' role playing, but its relentlessly schizophrenic composition. Although broken into 15 tracks, the album seems like nearly an hour of song fragments. The pop hooks are still there, but like the similarly kaleidoscopic material of the Fiery Furnaces or even Girl Talk, Skeletal Lamping can be utterly exhausting, even at its most fun-loving. The album starts harmlessly with the fractured but hummable one-two punch of ""Nonpareil of Favor"" and ""Wicked Wisdom"" before ""For Our Elegant Caste""-- which contains one of the most annoying choruses of the year-- kicks off the album's convoluted middle section. Excepting the 90-second Elton John coke crash ""Touched Something's Hollow"", this middle portion whips the listener through a rollercoaster of orgasms, hangovers, and euphoria, leaving no time in between for a breather. Georgie's funk persona-- he played in a 70s funk band named Arousal apparently-- feels most apropos on the Prince bedroom ballad ""St. Exquisite's Confessions"", but the laidback tempo doesn't allow Barnes to spew his typical 100 hooks per minute, making the track his most by-the-numbers genre hop. The brief teases of Barnes' melodic mastery will probably frustrate even more than Lamping's clunkers. Single ""Id Engager"" closes the album on a surprisingly carefree note, concluding the twisted sexual odyssey with the one song that could've passed prima facie on Hissing Fauna. The stunning chorus on ""Plastis Wafers"" meanders through disco and cock rock with equal grace, but requires the listener to suffer wandering passages that help push the track over seven minutes. ""Wicked Wisdom"" finds Georgie not yet a full-blown lothario, and his sympathetic naiveté, whether lamenting his struggles to connect with girls or flaunting his puppy love, is reinforced by gumball hooks ranging from power-pop to psychedelic melodrama. Ultimately Skeletal Lamping registers as a misstep, but not without loads of silver lining. For one, Kevin Barnes has established himself as the anti-Christ to the polite, erudite indie world, and for all this album's shortcomings, it's a breath of fresh air for those bored by ivory tower indie rock. For that matter, with an overblown live show replete with costume changes, skits, video screens, etc., Of Montreal's hardly pretending to be an album-oriented act anymore, making Lamping feel like a soundtrack to a much more interesting movie. Coming off his magnum opus, it's understandable Barnes takes a victory lap here, but his mad genius-- no matter how outwardly freewheeling and escapist-- sounds better wrung through some semblance of a conventional pop filter.","Despite Kevin Barnes' role-playing-- he again here inhabits the figurative skin of alter ego Georgie Fruit-- the story on this album is its relentlessly schizophrenic composition, with nearly an hour of song fragments fused into 15 tracks.

An Optimist Notes the Dusk,David Grubbs,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd61eb335119a49ece80/1:1/w_160/2e0ba4e3.jpg,2008-10-20 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12299-an-optimist-notes-the-dusk/,Drag City,"David Grubbs started out in Squirrel Bait, the linchpin of a Louisville indie scene that soon after would introduce such staples as Slint and Will Oldham. But since that auspicious debut, Grubbs has spent most of his time racing away from his punk roots as fast as possible, most prominently in Gastr del Sol (particularly in partnership with Jim O'Rourke) and later through a number of idiosyncratic, sometimes inscrutable solo records. Talk about post-rock: objects in Grubbs' rearview are receding so fast, they're barely a blip. Grubbs' solo discs have touched on genres like folk and country, but mostly as subjects for subtle deconstruction. In fact, ""Gethsemani Night"", the first track off of An Optimist Notes the Dusk, Grubbs' first solo album in four years, could pass for folk were it not for his trademark use of space, pauses, dissonance, and unpredictable sing-song melodies. Then again, maybe it is folk despite this, just folk dissected while looking through the wrong end of the microscope. Certainly there's a bucolic feel to the track, and while Nate Wooley's trumpet as often as not sounds like a scratched string instrument rather than a horn, it may as well be the wind blowing outside the window on a particularly blustery day. This open, airy theme continues through even the most insular tracks. Like ""An Optimist Declines"", which features two free guitar/drum duets sandwiching a menacing low-end drone, like the light at both ends of a tunnel, as Grubbs offers enigmatic lyrics describing ""smoke edged with glass, backlit."" With ""Holy Fool Music"", however, his pastoral reverie veers radically to rock, albeit rock infused with momentum-subverting tricks along with the occasional big riffs and drum rolls. Even then, the song ends back in the ether, the pensive transition to the instrumental ""Storm Sequence"", whose title may reference a day in the studio when (per the liner notes) the temperature ""hit a record 105 degrees before thunderstorms came, turned the sky green, and thrashed the cornfields."" See what a little bit of direct language can do? Grubbs' compulsive poetic obfuscation makes for fine capital-A Art, but its inherent pretentiousness hurts ""Eyeglasses of Kentucky"", apparently an elliptical Ambrose Bierce paraphrasing tribute to Lexington photographer Ralph Eugene Meatyard that would have benefited from a more direct bent. ""Here's a photo of a house/ An embarrassing semblance of face,"" Grubbs sings, adding little to the mood of the track beyond enigmatic distraction and further abstraction. In the press notes Grubbs calls the album, somewhat glibly, ""a step into the void,"" and with ""The Not-So-Distant"", the void finally arrives in full force. Or maybe full lack-of-force is more accurate, as for nearly 12 minutes the track hums, ebbs, and (sort of) flows, a menacing vampire-morning sunrise that unfolds like a slow explosion erasing everything from the horizon. It's scary because it's so simple and spare, a quietly cresting and falling apocalypse that soothes the crap out of you. Or maybe it's just some avant-garde term-paper bullshit dreamed up in the exact duration it took to record. The optimist, however, would note such a perspective doesn't alter the track's creepy effectiveness, even as, in one gradual sweep, it makes you instantly forget nearly everything that came before it, until it, too, disappears.","David Grubbs, former member of Squirrel Bait, Bastro, and Gastr del Sol, pokes his head out of his cave of academia, squints at the sun, and releases his first solo album in four years.

Dirt Don't Hurt,Holly Golightly & the Brokeoffs,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd6cea9e61561daa76da/1:1/w_160/8072308e.jpg,2008-10-20 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12308-dirt-dont-hurt/,Transdreamer,"Holly Golightly has enough experience not to draw from it. She released her first solo album in 1995, after spending a few years in Thee Headcoatees; since then, she has kept up a steady pace of new material, at least one of these per year: singles comps, odd and ends packages, live shows, and (oh yeah) traditional albums. That rate of production often seems crucial to the palatability of her new old-timey music, preventing her from overthinking her songs or her performances while keeping everything loose and tossed off. As a result, she sounds a lot less manicured and a lot more convincing than upstarts like Langhorne Slim or Scott H. Biram. In fact, writing on her web site, she sounds almost apologetic explaining that it took five days to record Dirt Don't Hurt, her second collaboration with the Brokeoffs. Their previous effort, You Can't Buy a Gun When You're Crying (which, you have to admit, is useful advice), was wrapped up in four days. And while she does admit ""it may seem a little over-produced to some!"" Golightly hasn't gone all Dave Fridmann on us: That extra day doesn't ruin the antique luster of her songs, but just focuses the collection considerably. It's still a heartily ramshackle affair, with pots and pans for percussion, rudimentary banjo picking, and what sound like first take on every track. The album's clattery rawness is its chief appeal. Some explanation may be required: The Brokeoffs isn't a real backing band, as the pluralized name might suggest. Instead, it's just some dude named Lawyer Dave, who has been playing upright bass for Golightly for about a decade now. He provides the clatter, even sings in a cough on menacing opener ""Bottom Below"". Their sandpaper and satin voices blend nicely on the country lament ""Up Off the Floor"" and they imbue ""Indeed You Do"" and ""Slow Road"" with a folksy eeriness that lurches and claws at the recriminating lyrics. The slapdash ""Gettin' High for Jesus"" puts the pot in pots-and-pans. A Holly/Lawyer original, it could be a cover of some late-60s hippie novelty hit by, say, Country Joe & the Fish. At times Dirt Don't Hurt gets away from them: The clamor becomes grating (the demonstrative metal smacks that kick off (""Three Times Under""), the murder-and-mayhem storytelling sounds like dress-up (""My 45""), and the duo risk the sort of preciousness that sinks some of their sepia-toned peers (the clucks and bocks on ""Cluck Old Hen""). But more often than not, they make virtues of these shortcomings, as on the closer ""I Wanna Hug Ya, Kiss Ya, Squeeze Ya"". This Claudia Swann cover ought to sound unbearably saccharine, but thanks to the rumbling electric guitar and Holly and Lawyer's Mickey & Sylvia vocal trade-offs, it's the album's highlight-- the reconciliation after all the bickering-- underscoring how well the duo play old songs as if they wrote them and write new songs that sound decades old.","Holly Golightly's second album with the Brokeoffs (aka Lawyer Dave) retains the antique luster and heartily ramshackle quality of her work but gives her old-timey music a bit more focus. Just a bit: The album's clattery rawness is its chief appeal.

The Door,Religious Knives,by: Mia Lily Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd715e6ef9596932306f/1:1/w_160/2ffd057e.jpg,2008-10-20 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12312-the-door/,Ecstatic Peace,"As half of the exhilarating, first-rate drone quartet Double Leopards, Michael Bernstein and Maya Miller created chillingly expansive extreme noise-- a distinctive mesh of sounds that peaked with the group's brilliantly sinister release, Halve Maen. Since forming Religious Knives in 2005, the duo have released a slew of CD-Rs and cassettes, largely through their own Heavy Tapes imprint. Now, with the addition of percussionist Nate Nelson of Mouthus and bassist Todd Cavallo, they've been spreading their sonic rash through basement shows, living rooms, and the beat-up tape decks of noise enthusiasts. The Door was produced with long-time supporter and label owner Thurston Moore, and from the crawling guitar line of early track ""Basement Watch"", it suggests a considerably more melodic, traditionally structured album than one might expect considering the ear-splitting frenzy of their previous releases. Of course, this is all relative: The Door is still firmly in a field of its own, offering six tracks that are equal in barbed psychedelic power yet compliment one another in such a way that this album-- although brief by the clock-- feels substantial, fully-realized, and bizarrely anthemic. Stretching the sinews of their sound almost to the breaking point, Religious Knives find a balance between the repetitive rhythmic skeleton of krautrock and the psychedelic keyboard thrusts of early Doors. The band's collective attunement to the finer elements of noise turns out to be an ideal complement to their songwriting skills, particularly because they use abrasiveness sparingly and wisely-- just barely peaking through, yet always present. As vocalists, Miller and Bernstein wrestle against each other in tough monotones; Miller has shadows of Grace Slick burning beneath her dark tones, and, combined with Bernstein's hollowed-out baritone, it's gloriously menacing when they sing lines such as ""Where does it come from/ The feeling you get when you want to hold back nothing/ Your eyes are weapons in broad daylight/ Your fists are iron fucking arrows/ Control is lost"" on ""Decisions Are Made"". The Door builds up in intensity as its course develops. The opening tracks ""Basement Watch"" and live improvisation ""Downstairs"" have the same lurking energy that characterizes the album, but ""Major Score"" slithers down into a dripping mess, upending the distinction between keyboards and guitars while riding the distortion hot enough to have shades of the Black Angels. By the time ""On a Drive"" rolls around, the listener is lead even further through the group's murky waters, as a bare-boned drum patterns set the pace for Bernstein's tale of midnight beach wandering and a flood of gloomy fuzz. Religious Knives have said that their aim with this album is to capture the feeling of Brooklyn's streets, and The Door does indeed sound as though their music is reflecting off concrete. Or being burned into it.","Produced with long-time supporter Thurston Moore and released on his Ecstatic Peace imprint, the latest from this Brooklyn noise-rock band is a considerably more melodic and traditionally structured album.

Saint Dymphna,Gang Gang Dance,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd7fc0084474cd0c2cfa/1:1/w_160/b4708230.jpg,2008-10-20 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12324-saint-dymphna/,Social Registry,"Gang Gang Dance's third album, God's Money, remains a revelation three years after its release. Pouring the muffled art-beats of 2004's Revival of the Shittest and the extended space-jams of 2004's Gang Gang Dance into structured songs, the record was starry and dreamy, yet also taut and focused. It made evident what was implicit from the start-- that these four hyperactive talents with underground pedigrees (see the Cranium, SSAB Songs, Angelblood, et. al.) could funnel their ideas into melodic pop without diluting them. It also suggested that Gang Gang Dance might become an all-out pop band. But three EPs since God's Money have defied such expectations. Though gems like ""Nicoman"" did surface, Hillulah, Retina Riddim, and RAWWAR were mostly mysterious experiments akin to the band's earlier releases. Not that any of them were anything less than good-- but none were the pop epiphany the band on God's Money seemed poised for. It turns out they had been working on that all along, and with Saint Dymphna their patience pays off. So clear and shiny it makes God's Money seem murky by comparison, this is predominantly a relative dance-pop album. But it still sounds completely like Gang Gang Dance, preserving their core of new-wave synths, tribal beats, otherworldly singing, and Residents-style loops. The biggest difference this time around is a lack of cavernous atmospheres. Here every sound and beat is laid bare, with no heavy reverb blanketing the songs like fog. The newfound clarity produces neither thinness nor tedium, but simply a direct, unadulterated power. That power is clear immediately, when opening instrumental ""Bebey"" melts into the rhapsodic ""First Communion"". Here Lizzi Bougatsos' dreamy poetry (""Prisms have kissed my lids/ Sea salt has rubbed on my hips"") and the band's coiled rhythms (particularly the beat-and-synth workouts of band MVP Brian DeGraw) hit on a momentum that could easily be the album's climax. But so many peaks pop up along Saint Dymphna's continuous stream that it's tough to catalogue them all. Two moments in particular show that the more Gang Gang Dance change, the more they stay the same. After a lengthy synth opening, ""Princes"" becomes an actual hip-hop song featuring a rap from Tinchy Stryder. Sure, it's slightly jarring to hear his pulsing cadence paired with Bougatsos' ethereal howls, but the band's familiar elements-- especially Josh Diamond's wiry guitar line-- fit snugly around him. Even more surprising is ""House Jam"", a gleeful rip-off of Madonna circa ""Holiday"". But put the track on repeat and you might be more surprised that you never realized how well Gang Gang Dance's sound could work as 80s disco-pop. Saint Dymphna ends with ""Dust"", a beatific instrumental that carries the band away like a magic carpet. Often when a group with avant-garde leanings flies close to the pop sun, the results can sound forced or off-key. But since accessible melodies have always bubbled beneath their music's surface, Gang Gang Dance's evolution sounds supremely logical. And anyone who thought that the cloudy sound of previous albums was a smokescreen should think again-- it turns out the band behind that curtain really is made up of wizards.","So clear and shiny it makes the taut and focused God's Money seem murky by comparison, this is Gang Gang Dance's long-simmering version of a pop album-- though it still preserves their core of new-wave synths, tribal beats, otherworldly singing, and Residents-style loops.

Satanic Messiah EP / Black Pear Tree EP,The Mountain GoatsKaki King,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd68abf31b7dc7155f3c/1:1/w_160/f017802a.jpg,2008-10-20 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12305-satanic-messiah-ep-black-pear-tree-ep/,Cadmean Dawn,"In John Darnielle's voice, everything is urgent. He trembles through quiet moments like he's straining for warmth in winter, and rattles through loud ones like a revving engine. His voice isn't just the center of the Mountain Goats, it's their essence. This is a liability as often as it is an asset: Of the people I know who hate his music, the first explanations are always that ""the singing is annoying"" and ""I don't care about the words."" His scenarios are suffused with confusion and dread. His best characters' tragic flaw is benign faith in ventures doomed to spectacular failure. But he uses songs to order and explicate messes, not mimic them. In his music, meth-heads and abused teenagers-- types not known for their lucidity-- speak in complete sentences. And they come through Darnielle's tough, reedy, persistent voice. Trying to define his songs as happy or sad is irrelevant, because intensity-- real, immolating intensity-- is neither. But Darnielle has given his voice a rest in the past few years. And in the absence of urgency, is space to reflect. Songs like The Sunset Tree's ""Song for Dennis Brown"" or ""Love, Love, Love"", Get Lonely's ""In Corolla"", or Heretic Pride's ""Marduk T-Shirt Incident"" sound different than anything he's ever done before, and sometimes, better. I think some fans hear this as a weakness-- Darnielle's exemplary moments carry the same grace and power to his fans as a well-set blastbeat does to the metalhead. Two new EPs-- Satanic Messiah, limited to 666 vinyl copies and offered as a pay-what-you-will release here, and Black Pear Tree-- present Darnielle in ways we've never heard him before: With distinct, independent supporting actors (the pointillistic, vivid guitar work of Kaki King); and solo, with piano. And their best moments are the clearest articulations of the progress he's made as a performer-- someone who no longer needs to mime hysteria to show he really means it. Satanic Messiah, the piano-heavy set, has a pious, meditative quality to it. The ease of his performances disconnects them from the violence of his lyrics. But it also reinforces them-- moments that Darnielle might've throttled in the past take on sanctity and earthiness; by taking a calm hand to a volatile situation, Darnielle bronzes the moment. Two songs, ""Satanic Messiah"" and ""Sarcofago Live"", assume the vantage point of a fan seeing a band. The first is one of the best in his catalog: Direct in vocabulary and elliptical in narrative, with a sentiment that shifts its weight from anthem to depth charge. He compares a rock star to a prophet, and delivers the moment with a quiet dignity reserved for church. Even as an obvious proponent of music's power-- his onstage quaking is a wrench in the mind-body duality argument-- this is a gamble. But when Darnielle extends the same tenderness to disenfranchised Ethiopians murdering tax collectors in ""Gojam Province 1968"", he renews a commitment he's made for almost 20 years: Not giving a voice to the voiceless, exactly, but articulating the experience of people too possessed to know what to say. Black Pear Tree, a vinyl- and tour-only EP recorded with the guitarist Kaki King, is one of the only times he's shared center stage. Her vocals on the near-static title track drag his lyrics around like a jail sentence. Dread's nothing new in his songwriting, but his verbal clarity makes vaguer emotions-- fear, for example-- a challenge. ""I saw the future in a dream last night, somebody's gonna get hurt, somebody's gonna get hurt/ I hope it's not me, but I suspect it's going to have to be"" is as lean as hopelessness gets, but it's not till later that Darnielle's verbiage blurs to a point where the words mimic the feeling: ""And when its time came I could see it happen, blossoms black and sweet as Texas crude/ I saw the future flowering like a ruptured vessel, somebody's gonna get screwed""-- now there's doom to get lost in. On ""Mosquito Repellent"", King chops at a guitar while Darnielle needles through a lyric about a hopeless, high-strung guy waiting for nothing in particular-- in a rare moment, she sounds freed from her virtuosity and he from his rep as the Mountain Goats, and they're collaborating. Her guitar performances-- deft, pinging adventures-- are strong enough to prop up a slapdash indie pop song, and the weaker ""Bring Our Curses Home"" and ""Roger Patterson Van"" get over by the grace of her playing. They close with ""Thank You Mario But Our Princess Is in Another Castle"", which is about Toad, a character whose sole purpose in the original ""Super Mario Bros."" was to wait in terrifying darkness for Mario to arrive, only to wave him through to the next level. But the tail of the song bends to offer the same sweet relief that the Mountain Goats have always leant the used and abused: ""When you came in, I could breathe again."" Alone, hopelessly-- but at least someone's thinking of him.",,7.8,
More Modern Short Stories From...,Hello Saferide,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd5eeb335119a49ece78/1:1/w_160/aa7dd0ed.jpg,2008-10-17 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12296-more-modern-short-stories-from/,Razzia,"The best songs are like people, it's been said, and Sweden's Annika Norlin is the kind of songwriter who knows the reverse can also be true. On ""I Wonder Who Is Like This One"", the opening track on Norlin's sophomore album as Hello Saferide, More Modern Short Stories From..., she compares herself to ""Can't Get You Out of My Head"": ""Annoying at times, but I make you want to dance."" On 2005 debut Introducing..., though, Norlin's storytelling, tunefulness, and sweet, sweet LOLs made her more like ""A Postcard to Nina"". The same person returns on Hello Saferide's latest, a little older, sometimes wiser, and, for better and for worse, more presentable to your parents. Bright guitar-pop and neurotic narratives still abound, only this time Norlin's worries are more serious than stalking high-school crushes on AltaVista or having too many drinks on Saturday night. Poignant, wittily crafted first single ""Anna"" pivots off of a throwaway line from Introducing...'s ""I Can't Believe It's Not Love!"" to imagine an HIV-curing, Nobel Prize-winning daughter who might've never known heartbreak-- something which the narrator clearly has on her buddy list. At a time when buzzier bands can get by mostly on vibe and tasteful influences, you'll actually need to pay attention all the way through the piano and harmonica of aptly titled male-female duet ""Overall"" to appreciate why these parents are so worried about their son playing the same violent video games we all did. Bonnie and Clyde fantasy ""Middle Class"", too, will be more rewarding if you're not multi-tasking. Much as the U.S. edition of Introducing... had odd recurring motifs like a fear of feet, dislike of sci-fi flicks, and contemplation of suicide by knife, thematic threads help More Modern Short Stories From... cohere into more than a collection of singles. Bob Dylan comes up a couple of times, first on cello- and Hammond-graced ""Lund"", where an unusually Joni Mitchell-esque Norlin sings about someone her narrator once knew-- - ""He came from the south of Sweden/ He spoke just like a Dane""-- who ""would have gotten my virginity."" That's right before Norlin's tendency toward blush-worthy frankness leads her to a description of first sex, on the uncharacteristically predictable ""X Telling Me Something About the Loss of Something Dear, at Age 16"". Likewise, Norlin's metaphorical return to the womb on ""Parenting Never Ends"" leads, musically and lyrically, to the might've-been birth of ""Anna"". Norlin's Swedish-language debut last year as Säkert! (which translates, roughly/idiomatically, to ""Yeah right, for sure"") had her using electric guitar more often than acoustic, a transition she completes on the new album. That shift, coupled with Andreas Mattsson's radio-ready production, means such weaker songs here as generic-sounding modern rocker ""Travelling With HS"" can't simply fall back on homemade charm. Norlin's onomatopoeic sound effects on delicate, string-draped meditation ""Arjeplog"" just barely redeem their potential cloyingness, and ""Sancho Panza"" sums up Hello Saferide's dorky-outsider persona almost too neatly. ""25 Days"" counts down until the narrator will know whether her budding romance has endured ""backpacker girls with newly braided hair and Manu Chao records""; when the guy texts to say he got the dates wrong, she repeats at least one time too many, ""You stupid fuck!"" As with Morrissey or Motown, Norlin's music is most likable when you have to look close to trace the tracks of her tears.","Sweden's Annika Norlin returns with her Hello Saferide project, and while bright guitar-pop and neurotic narratives still abound, this time her worries are more serious.

Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist OST,Various Artists,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd77eb335119a49ecea8/1:1/w_160/8d5b691c.jpg,2008-10-17 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12317-nick-and-norahs-infinite-playlist-ost/,Atlantic,"Seeing as music's a titular concern in Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist, one would think the soundtrack-- a playlist, after all, however finite-- might have a little more to do with what's on the screen. It's a cute little movie-- decently scripted, well-acted mumblecore for teens. Though its portrayal of indie fandom seems focus-grouped and reconstituted within an inch of its life, the film's earnest romance-- about young love, about New York City, and about losing your shit over music in its various forms-- helps quell the inevitable cynicism. This movie is, after all, called Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist. The thing is, the film isn't actually about music. Sure, Nick labors over heartwrenching mix CDs for his newly ex-girlfriend, which Norah finds discarded and cherishes as her own. Indeed, much of the movie's storyline is predicated on its characters finding a purportedly awesome band with the unfortunate name of Where's Fluffy?, and there is the occasional conversation about real live music and actual listening habits and such. But, really, music as it exists in the film is a plot device rather than a thing of actual concern for the characters; a quick find-and-replace on the ol' script, and you could just as easily turn Nick and Norah into voracious cinephiles trying to hunt down a rare screening or something. That in mind, the film music that actually makes its way to the soundtrack is, at best, secondary to the goings-on.  Nearly every song is used much as it might be in any other commercial film about anything; occasionally, a choice cut-- like Richard Hawley's searching ""Baby, You're My Light"" in a tender scene-- evokes the moment at hand, and Bishop Allen do appear on-screen to play a few bars of ""Middle Management"" at a show. Oh, and there's Devendra Banhart, for a half-second, talking about orgasms. By and large, though, tunes are relegated to mere background noise, something to fill in the silence of the surroundings. Taken as a playlist, the Nick and Norah soundtrack has only a few things to recommend it. It's totally frontloaded, leading off with Chris Bell's classic ballad ""Speed of Sound"" and leading into Devendra's bouncy ""Lover"", the aforementioned Bishop Allen track, and Vampire Weekend's stellar new ""Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa"" quoting ""Ottoman"". Things dip significantly around the Dead 60s almost comically hollow Franz Ferdinand ripoff, picking up again briefly with Band of Horses' lovely, compact ""Our Swords"" and highlighted throughout by Hawley, a not-half-bad Shout Out Louds tune, and Mark Mothersbaugh's spacily evocative theme song. Much of it is decidedly unexceptional, favoring generally applicable sentiment and wide-open chords rather than anything potentially challenging. It turns out like something your friend might leave in your car that you don't mind skipping around on occasionally but would never bring up in conversation; and, though that method might very well turn a person on to the Submarines or something-- its intended purpose, one presumes-- it's not an especially good calling card for any of the up-and-comers here the way Garden State hipped a lot of people to, alas, Frou Frou. It's telling that nearly all of the non-live music played in Nick and Norah comes from MP3 players and burned CDs, rather than commercially-available physical products like this very soundtrack; the movie seems to be urging folks towards music discovery through conversation and keeping an open ear, but the fact remains that this is a group of tracks in a set running order available on such unplaylistable formats like that vinyl the kids keep on buying. It all just seems so antithetical to the film it's supposedly attached to; Nick might've burned this sucker once and popped it in his car, but he would've also started almost immediately on the next installment, and that's not something having a physically released soundtrack makes any deference to. And, hey, maybe round two's coming; there was great music aplenty in the film, from the National and Modest Mouse and Tapes 'n Tapes, that doesn't appear on this soundtrack, and the reasons for the inclusion of, say, Paul Tiernan's sorta hokey ""How to Say Goodbye"" and not ""Insistor"" are unclear. One has to wonder what exactly the point of a soundtrack like this is in 2008, where folks could just as easily download the songs-- even the ones, gasp, that didn't make it to the disc-- for the jumpoffs of their own infinite playlists. For this product to have relevance commercially or otherwise, the songs on it have to matter, and with the exception of a great Vampire Weekend tune and some frequently great (just-so-happens-to-be-indie-)pop, it doesn't matter enough not to just burn yourself.","Nick and Norah apparently are mostly into the unexceptional, favoring generally applicable sentiment and wide-open chords. Among the film soundtrack's highlights are songs from Vampire Weekend, Richard Hawley, and Devendra Banhart.

Soft Airplane,Chad VanGaalen,by: Roque Strew,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd79c0084474cd0c2cec/1:1/w_160/b00f8cfe.jpg,2008-10-17 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12319-soft-airplane/,Sub Pop,"Sometimes we want the sounds of the city, sometimes we want the sounds of the country. Ours being a suburban republic, now and then we want both, and few musicians are better at this union of sensibility than Chad VanGaalen. The one-time busker from Calgary has a knack for summoning a virginal rural past with his picking and strumming, a dreamy patch of woodland, though he can also work up a mean batch of richly abrasive experiments that bear little relation to the pastoral. Part of the charm of VanGaalen's past two records, 2005's Infiniheart and 2006's Skelliconnection, arose in their sense of looseness and disorder, which came through in the lyrics, the sequencing, and the textures. Both releases drew from an archive of home recordings; consistency would be tough to fake. But on his latest release, he gathers a handful of songs recorded around the same time, in the same place (his basement), with the same equipment (""primarily on an old tape machine and a JVC ghetto blaster,"" according to the press notes). Small wonder that, with Soft Airplane, VanGaalen finally attains a uniformity of sound and theme that can hold his gorgeously fractured songs together. Past the numberless instruments, styles, and guises, the solid form of Chad VanGaalen is now visible.  Neil Young meets Thurston Moore, an irresistible comparison to draw, does touch the heart of VanGaalen's aesthetic. The emotionally cracked falsetto, the nerdy forays into science fiction, the death-instinct, the longing, and the very metropolitan impatience with harmony and quiet are all there. We see this as we slip into ""Molten Light"", a murder ballad in the vein of Young's ""Down by the River"", as VanGaalen sings, ""I dumped her body into the molten light/ It floated to the surface and it did not ignite."" He shot his baby, but unlike Neil's gunman, he watches her rise out of the water to sort him out. Equally morose, bearing another final-resting-place title, ""Willow Tree"" describes death as liberating as he reflects on hangings and Viking funerals over a twanging banjo.  Which isn't to say that the ratty glimpse of the future, the glitch and crunch of his on-the-cheap production, is no longer there. He keeps the rainbow of precious instruments-- jury-rigged drum machine, analog synths, accordions-- only now the choices feel smarter, more attuned to each song's spirit. Fuzzed around the edges, thick with mood, the Thurston Moore-like ""Bare Feet on Wet Griptape"" whizzes by on its careening guitars and melodic hooks. Clearly VanGaalen wants to keep his grip on a pop sensibility, even if it's in the warped form of a no wave jam. With its curious pairings of harmonica and synthesizer, ""Phantom Anthills"" and ""TMNT Mask"" drift further away from the countryside, all the way onto the dancefloor-- or rather VanGaalen's skewed vision of a dancefloor. These gestures toward a wider audience aren't free of VanGaalen's chronic morbidity. Where we do it in our thoughts, or on our anonymous blogs, this man thinks about death with his instruments. Now he's just going easier on the ears. We see this on the charismatic ""Cries of the Dead"", which artfully fleshes out the fixation on death that has marked all of his work, with the help of pop flourishes and patterns. In a matter of minutes, listeners are shuttled from the sight of a man beating his dog, to a memory of gazing upon a lover's painting of mountains and feeling like he was there. The song distills the essence of Soft Airplane, an intimate, intelligent, and always transporting cycle of songs that sends VanGaalen closer to his own voice and, in the process, closer to us.","After two releases mined from years of home recordings, Calgary songsmith Chad VanGaalen gathers a handful of songs recorded around the same time, in the same place, and unsurprisingly he finally attains a uniformity of sound and theme that can hold his gorgeously fractured songs together.

Little Honey,Lucinda Williams,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd3fc0084474cd0c2c6c/1:1/w_160/54ac9295.jpg,2008-10-17 06:00:02,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12271-little-honey/,Lost Highway,"The long waits for Lucinda Williams' third and fifth albums-- eight years for Lucinda Williams and six for Car Wheels on a Gravel Road-- have become the defining story of her career. During those lengthy intervals she established herself as a perfectionist who took her own sweet time making records and tweaked every aspect until it met with her highly strict requirements, which of course she never explained to anyone else. She worked intuitively rather than scientifically-- the songs had to feel right. But those albums fully justified both the waits and her peculiar particularity: Williams' self-titled album expressed her inner desires and uncertainties so comfortably that country and blues felt like second skins, and Car Wheels is a tough and tender travelogue. Neither sounds overworked; she toiled for nearly a decade on each to sound completely off the cuff. In the decade since Car Wheels, Lucinda has increased her output considerably, releasing three studio albums and a double live with only two or three years between them. If once she was difficult to work with, she has becoming increasingly difficult to listen to, penning uninspired songs that rest uneasily on lyrical clichés, unpalatable vocal scrawls, and a talking-blues delivery that obsessed her but confounded all others. Her gradual downfall sounded like a concerted retreat from roots-rock respectability (no crime there) and an unhealthy, unhappy self-sabotage, and 2007's West was the one thing that no one ever expected from Lucinda: an utterly irredeemable album, short on melodies and insights but long on self-absorption. It would have been a fascinating failure were it not so unfathomably dull. Perhaps it's fitting that her new album, Little Honey, begins with ""Real Love"", an unironic, unsentimental statement of newfound happiness that sounds like 1992's Sweet Old World-- or at least Essence. It's not a Mary J. Blige cover: Instead of searching for a real love, she's found one, and it involves a guitar and an audience. Williams reasserts her talent for taking a vague sentiment and unraveling it into something real and immediate. Her vocals sound perfectly slurred, the guitars nicely abrasive, the lyrics suitably modest but incisive. It's enough to raise expectations that Little Honey will be a significant uptick in her output. It is. And it isn't. While Williams generally sticks to her strengths and suppresses most of her more unsavory musical habits, she maintains her curious reliance on tacky AABB rhyme schemes and lyrical clichés like ""It's raining cats and dogs"" (on the otherwise excellent ""Circles and X's""). From anyone else, that line might not warrant scrutiny, but Williams-- the daughter of former poet laureate Miller Williams-- has shown a poet's eye for detail, phrasing, and juxtaposition, laying out her sentiments in a conversational style and downhome cadence, and her earlier work inspired highest standards in her listeners. Lines like that pepper the album, but every bad habit of hers appears in the embarrassing ""Honey Bee"", an anonymous rocker on which she literally shouts her lines: ""Oh my little honeybee/ I'm so glad you found me/ Buzz around you hive now/ You're in overdrive now."" John Belushi's ""King Bee"" sketch was more dignified. After that side-one lull, Little Honey picks up considerably with a string of tracks that recall the old, exacting Williams. She sounds like she might even be having fun on the gospel-blues ""Well Well Well"" and ""Jailhouse Tears"", a duet with Elvis Costello that's a fitting sequel to ""There's a Story in Your Voice"", their previous pairing on his 2004 album The Delivery Man. ""If Wishes Were Horses"" creates an animal metaphor that actually something meaningful: ""If wishes were horses, I'd have a ranch,"" she sings on the lovely chorus. Her vocals are wounded yet measured, as heartbreaking as you know she can be, even on ""Heaven Blues"", which recalls the acoustic blues of her first two albums. After such a build-up, it's all the more discouraging that Little Honey falters at the end. ""Plan to Marry"" poses a gorgeously mopey lament: ""Why do we marry? Why do we fall in love? Why do we keep believin'?"" She sounds like she's going to wash her hands of the whole romantic mess, but sadly, those questions don't remain rhetorical: She actually answers them, turning the song into a saccharine lover's anthem. It's a poor lead-in to ""Long Way to the Top"", an aimless AC/DC cover with showy gospel backing vocals and a jaded, defensive tone that leaves a bitter aftertaste. For Lucinda, it's a long way from the top, although it's nothing a good eight years wouldn't fix.","In the decade since breakthrough Car Wheels on a Gravel Road, Lucinda Williams has increased her output considerably, but the quality of her work has suffered; on Little Honey, she thankfully makes nods toward her strengths and suppresses most of her more unsavory musical habits.

As Julien Temple's recent documentary, Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten, illustrated, the titular Clash frontman went to great lengths to distance himself from his well-established pre-punk/pub-band roots, and perhaps as a result, the Clash railed against classic-rock hero worship harder than most, by taking names (""no Elvis, Beatles, or the Rolling Stones in 1977!""), stealing sacred riffs (the Who's ""I Can't Explain"" bastardized into ""Clash City Rockers"") and redesigning pop history in their own image (the Elvis-swiped cover art of London Calling). So surely these detractors of ""phony Beatlemania"" must've had a good ol' laugh at the prospect of conquering one of the key sites of the real Beatlemania. Of course, it would take a tour invite from the Who to get the Clash into Shea Stadium on Oct. 13, 1982, but in a way that just makes the story all the more rich: the punks meet the godfathers-- the former at the peak of their commercial ascendancy, the latter on the way to the first of many retirements. But while the two bands were born of different eras, both had followed similar trajectories, having each made their own escapes out of garageland to pursue more ambitious musical plans. And yet Live at Shea Stadium (a popular bootleg now receiving official release on its 26th anniversary) marks something more than just the passing of the torch between two generations of kindred spirits; it also documents the first time class-of-'77 punk-rockers graduated to the American stadium circuit, and the pyrrhic victory contained within. The Shea show was not the biggest the Clash ever played in America (that would be the US Festival in 1983), nor the most incendiary (see: the legendary 17-show string at New York's Bond Casino in 1981), but the set most vividly captures the Clash's most enduring qualities: the triumphs and tribulations of being populist punks.
 
Fittingly, the Clash's Shea Stadium coronation would come in a downpour of very English rain. But where the Who might use such a backdrop to dramatize a typically blustery version of ""Love, Reign O'er Me"", for the Clash, the soggy weather was an ideal way to make a ballpark feel more like a sweaty dive. Following a humorously crowd-baiting opening spiel from Clash cohort Kosmo Vinyl, Joe Strummer introduces ""London Calling"" by declaring ""welcome to the Casbah Club!"" It's the first of many quips that Strummer uses to downsize the stadium spectacle into more club-like dimensions (""shhh… would you please stop talking at the back, it's too loud!""), and he's also careful not to turn his elevated podium into a pulpit; rather than use the spotlight to educate the American masses on the urban unrest that inspired ""Guns of Brixton"", Strummer simply offers, ""If you don't know what's goin' on, just ask the person standing next to you."" Foreshadowing the BBC Radio Global a Go-Go broadcasts that would define his later career, Strummer sounds happiest playing cruise-leader to his band's genre tourism, talking the audience through a live mash-up of Sandinista's rap-rock prototype ""The Magnificent Seven"" and Willie Williams' reggae standard ""Armagideon Time"" like he was holding a bus megaphone: ""This is a black New York rhythm we stole one night...so while we're here doing our little thing, I'm gonna take you to Jamaica...so hold on, fasten your seatbelts, extinguish all reefers!"" But while Strummer's stage banter frequently highlights the seeming absurdity of the Clash playing a venue the size of Shea, the set list more than justifies their promotion to it, adhering as it does to the time-honoured stadium-rock tradition of playing the hits and playing them often; even the band's current release at the time, Combat Rock, is represented only by its two popular singles (which means there's no ""Straight to Hell"" to lure in newly arrived ""Paper Planes"" chasers). Highlighting the staggering procession of classic singles the band had amassed in just five short years, the incredibly well-preserved (or greatly refurbished) Live at Shea Stadium recordings make the contradictory concept of stadium-punk seem like a natural state: if anything, the lock-and-load riffs of ""Tommy Gun"" and the shout-and-response reworking of Eddy Grant's ""Police on My Back"" sound like they were originally designed with the bleachers in mind. Live at Shea Stadium, however, also provides a glimpse into the existential quandaries that would afflict agit-punk progeny from Rage Against the Machine to Against Me! onward: that is, the inherent difficulty of reconciling your activist politics with your growing bank balance. As the lone Clash original featured from their 1977 debut, ""Career Opportunities"" seems like a particularly odd choice to play at Shea, if only because these sorts of gigs forever distanced the Clash from the dole-line doldrums detailed within (a notion the Clash themselves seemed to have already addressed with Sandinista!'s cheeky kiddie-choir cover version). You can also hear the band's simmering tensions play out in the rather hollow version of ""Rock the Casbah"", which suffers from both the physical and spiritual absence of Topper Headon, the drummer who came up with the song's rhythm and its indelible piano-rolled hook, but whose chronic drug problems got him ousted from the band on the eve of the Combat Rock tour (to be replaced by original Clash drummer Terry Chimes). As a result, the Clash's most effortlessly funky tune is rendered as a rather joyless, standardized guitar rocker-- one that betrays the flagging enthusiasm that would eventually send Mick Jones packing less than a year later, and force Strummer to deep-six the band for good following 1985's roundly derided Cut the Crap, the only band that matters silenced with barely a mutter. In a cunning premonition of their own impending collapse, the Clash bid Shea Stadium adieu with their signature cover of the Bobby Fuller Four's ""I Fought the Law"", the ultimate fight song for those who got no more left in them. The Clash may have showed up at Shea to inherit the Who's torch and create a new model of the thinking person's rock star for the 1980s, but they ultimately flubbed the hand-off-- and a group of Irishmen were more than happy to swoop in from the sidelines and run away with it.","A popular bootleg now receiving official release around its 26th anniversary, this set documents the Clash's famed performance opening for the Who at the soon-to-be-demolished Shea Stadium.

Now or Heaven,The Broken West,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd725e6ef95969323072/1:1/w_160/2b9da3d7.jpg,2008-10-16 05:00:04,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12313-now-or-heaven/,Merge,"The fundamentals of the Broken West's music are strong. Following a debut LP that clung tightly to boilerplate 60s-revisionist Cali-pop, the genial L.A. five-piece has stripped its sound down to something far more taut and rhythmically insistent for the group's sophomore effort, Now or Heaven. Consequently, at a base level the record is pretty much beyond reproach, marked by precise drumming, pulsing bass work, and an admirable use of musical space. Unfortunately, the Broken West doesn't do nearly enough with these sturdy building blocks compared to several other bands who mine similar sonic territory, and the result is merely competent pop-rock that routinely fails to rise above its foundations. That's not the case with the record's opening track, ""Gwen, Now and Then"", a mostly unreplicated model of momentum, drive, and windswept cool. The lyrics are throwaways, but the way the hook hurtles forward speaks more to the joys of barreling down the highway with the windows down than any of this album's actual words speak to subjects like love and loss. Following that captivating opener, however, Now or Heaven largely loses sight of popcraft and gets overly preoccupied by atmosphere and suggestion instead. It'd be a forgivable trade-off if the Broken West could use its newfound love of minimalist grooves to conjure up sex and menace like, say, Spoon, but something's holding the group back. Mainly I think it might be Ross Flournoy's vocals, which can't help incongruently signifying boyish blitheness no matter how hard the band strives to moodily seethe beneath him. Sterling influences inform songs that fall just short of their marks-- Flournoy claims the Knife inspired ""House of Lies"", yet it comes off as beefy 80s AOR fodder (albeit pretty successfully), while the apparently Prince-beholden ""Got It Bad"" misses frustrated desire and settles for slight peevishness. But hey, these guys have been touring with the National and the Walkmen, and clearly picked up some pointers, judging from the tight-as-hell high-hat-riding ""Terror For Two"" and elegantly spare ""Elm City"". Again, however, the scuff and seediness of those bands doesn't really suit the Broken West, not when the band is busy emulating the Shins on ""The Smartest Man Alive"". Given the far sunnier cast of the group's debut, it's fair to say Now or Heaven is a document of growing pains. Perhaps realizing that guileless jangle-pop is a 21st century creative dead end, the Broken West are encouragingly moving towards something darker and more mature, but for the time being remain stuck in an uncomfortable middle ground, aiming to unnerve but managing for now only to slightly unsettle.","Following a debut LP that clung tightly to boilerplate 60s-revisionist Cali-pop, the Merge five-piece has stripped its sound down to something far more taut and rhythmically insistent for the group's sophomore effort.

A Summer Beneath the Trees,Library Tapes,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd51c0084474cd0c2c89/1:1/w_160/a9a14a85.jpg,2008-10-16 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12284-a-summer-beneath-the-trees/,Make Mine,"On 2007's Höstluft, the Swedish musician David Wenngren (a.k.a. Library Tapes) used ghostly pianos and sparse field recordings to create what sounded like Erik Satie compositions on dirty vinyl. Austere piano etudes either floated unadorned or hid inside a haze of scratchy ambiance. As if recognizing that he couldn't push this extreme minimalism much further (the next step would have been silence, and John Cage beat him to that by more than 50 years), Wenngren shifted into a heftier mode with last year's Sketches EP, where Danny Norbury added cello accents to the emboldened piano themes. Of course, ""hefty"" is relative: Like most of Wenngren's music, Fragment was stark, allowing for little interference between the listener and the limpid melodies. A Summer Beneath the Trees is still pretty ascetic, but by Wenngren's usual standards, it's practically Wagner. A lot of the credit for this newfound mass is due to Peter Broderick (who also played on the superlative Fragment EP), a young musician from Portland who worked as a session man with M. Ward, Zooey Deschanel, and others, before moving to Copenhagen to join Efterklang. Here, Broderick complements Wenngren's piano with a wide variety of accompaniment: violin, guitar, accordion, trumpet, celesta, viola, and banjo. Höstluft and Fragment were almost accidental music-- like walking by a house and catching a couple minutes of someone picking out a melody on a beat-up old upright inside. This is the fullest, most finished-sounding Library Tapes project since it was an official duo (with Per Jardsell), and may suit listeners who need more than a few endlessly revolving piano notes better than recent offerings. For fans of Max Richter, Tim Hecker, and Eluvium, A Summer Beneath the Tress is a can't-miss album. It is also, by and large, an exceptionally melancholy album that never slips into outright pathos. Its bucolic title is belied by the music's wintry strains. ""The Sound of Emptiness"" parts one and two are slow, shrieking dirges; landscapes of nothing but wind and rocks. ""Pieces of Us Were Left on the Tracks..."" features one of Wenngren's typical, glittering piano themes, buttressed by mournful strings and contrapuntal guitar. These tracks and others like them convey a strong presentiment or memory of loss. More importantly, they serve as foils for the record's handful of triumphant moments, and render them more affecting by contrast. One exemplary track, ""Above the Flood"", begins with heartbroken piano, but lights up unexpectedly with jaunty, staccato strings, and ends with positively joyful flourishes. And on ""The Modest Triumph"", the strings take the lead for a sweeping theme that sounds like elation incarnate. As such, it's neither a stereotypically sad record nor a happy one-- it's just human, highlighting emotional extremes to imply the whole range between them.","The latest album from Swedish musician David Wenngren sports a fuller sound that puts his music in the realm of Max Richter, Tim Hecker, and Eluvium.

24 Postcards in Full Colour,Max Richter,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd33abf31b7dc7155ec7/1:1/w_160/4253ad81.jpg,2008-10-16 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12264-24-postcards-in-full-colour/,Fat Cat,"The place where art music and pop music meet is today less a border than a bridge constantly filled with traffic flowing both ways. I like to think of German-born Max Richter as standing somewhere in the middle of that bridge, a modern composer with a pop musician's sense of conceptual unity, emotional connection, and payoff. His albums to date have played like post-minimalist classical for those who follow indie rock and electronic music-- they could lead a Mogwai fan to Arvo Pärt and Gavin Bryars, or a Pärt fan to Rachel's, Stars of the Lid, and Philip Jeck. The point is that he makes art music with broad appeal, miles from the kind of process pieces that are easier to read about than listen to. Richter's latest takes a step into a part of the pop world few modern composers have approached: the ringtone. Old-school classical music has been there for a while-- I have friends with piano sonatas, Mozart snippets, and bits of Bach on their phones-- but Richter is one of the first to build an entire recording around this most ubiquitous man-made ambient noise. These 24 brief tracks (totaling around a half-hour) are theoretically all meant to tell you that Mom is calling, but don't come expecting the bassline to ""Play That Funky Music"", the pep of ""Eine Kleine Nachtmusik"", or anything similarly snappy. These pieces are almost entirely in the same somber vein of Richter's other work. If you want a ringtone that could stop everyone else in the produce aisle in his or her tracks with its beauty, this is for you. The main musical aim here appears to be tonal variety. Richter places a minute of burbling, crackling ambient noise next to a painfully gorgeous minute of violins slipping in and out of harmony, or an arpeggiating electric guitar smothered in voices. The piano pieces are soft, contemplative, and a bit chilly-- they make me think of wearing a sweater while reading a thoughtfully written book by the light of a single lamp in an otherwise dark home. Autumnal is a word I occasionally see used to describe the feel of Richter's work, and it certainly applies here. These pieces are falling leaves and brisk breezes embodied in bow strokes, keystrokes, and electronic textures. Richter has discussed the possibility of performing shows using these pieces as ringtones on his audience's phones, controlling the music from the stage via text message-- I'd love to be at one of those shows to see how it feels as a droning violin or gently pulsing, organ-like tone spreads through the crowd. Setting the concept aside, this is a frequently haunting album, though it sacrifices a great deal of flow in the name of brevity and variety. Even if no one ever downloads it to a Nokia, the hair-raising violin of ""A Sudden Manhattan of the Mind"" makes its point just fine as part of the album. And that's the most important thing to remember about this album: the concept is strong, but the music is stronger.","The German-born, UK-based composer creates an album of exquisite sonic miniatures-- 24 pieces in around half an hour-- designed to be used as ringtones.

Secret Machines,Secret Machines,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd78abf31b7dc7155f61/1:1/w_160/f95ea7dc.jpg,2008-10-16 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12318-secret-machines/,TSM,"It wasn't the grandiosity that made so much prog rock unfashionable; it was the pomposity. How can you take seriously any band that takes itself so seriously? Not that Secret Machines don't take themselves seriously. Indeed, glimmers of Roger Waters-- the most famously no-fun and pompous name in prog-- have always been in the group's songs. But fortunately, Secret Machines have also recognized that a rock band needs first and foremost to actually rock, and although they can represent Pink Floyd at their most po-faced, they are also fueled by the muscular thump of Led Zeppelin. Zeppelin were, of course, powerful enough to get away with multi-part musical marathons and prodigious interplay while still avoiding the prog tag. Following that lead, Secret Machines have even got their own John Bonham-like anchor in drummer Josh Garza. Yet it's not Garza's presence that initially dominates this self-titled third album but the absence of Benjamin Curtis, who left Secret Machines last year, leaving Garza and brother Brandon Curtis behind. Surely his departure necessitated a slight rethinking of the group's musical strategy, and indeed the group's injected a good deal of Scary Monsters-era David Bowie's frayed art-glam, among other elements, to good effect. Yet Secret Machines remain the same band responsible for Now Here Is Nowhere and Ten Silver Drops, which means the toughest tracks often still devolve into hypnotic grooves and motorik mutations, and the gentlest starts often lead to the most bombastic conclusions. Curtis has been replaced by Phil Karnats, whose guitar is often used as an almost-synth like effect layered on top of the group's menacing melodies and pulsing beats. It's an interesting balance, lending even relatively short tracks such as ""Atomic Heels"" (with its hints of ""Diamond Dogs"") and ""Underneath the Concrete"" the feel of epics. When the band does up the run time, as with the nearly eight-minute ""Have I Run Out"", the results justify the indulgence. And when Garza's double-time syncopation, Brandon Curtis' keys, and Karnats' guitar synthesize into a series of squelches and searing sounds, it makes for hypnotic space-rock. But Secret Machines can do mellow, too, at least to a degree, as demonstrated by highlight ""Now You're Gone"", which begins more meditative and stripped down before the oppressive arrangements kick in. But here they're allowed to breath, almost floating above and around Garza's gallop until the song hits its inevitable concluding crescendos. ""The Walls Are Starting to Crack"" pulls off a similar trick while at the same time tipping its hat to the band's prog predecessors more than ever (and directly, too, not via some circuitous Radiohead route). You can hear Pink Floyd, but also King Crimson, even Van Der Graaf Generator, a nice set up for ""I Never Thought to Ask"", a pretty ballad that splits the difference between Hunky Dory and The Final Cut. With ""The Fire Is Waiting"", the band finally gets to cut loose with a full-on 11-minute blow-out full of Godzilla-sized riffs and quiet interludes. The song's length, especially as it transitions to otherworldly hums and drones, provides the perfect opportunity to ruminate: sure, it's grandiose, but is it pompous? Do Secret Machines cross that line? Well, yeah, probably, they do. With its apocalyptic portent, Secret Machines demands to be taken seriously. But at least the music-- ambitious, scary, inspiring, rousing-- matches the sentiment. Secret Machines are serious about what they do, and until more bands find ways to balance pop, prog, and booming hard rock as well as the Machines do on ""Last Believer, Drop Dead"", that pomposity can be forgiven as just part of the whole package.","The third record from these indie-prog aesthetes, and first minus founding member Benjamin Curtis, finds the group mining its usual influences-- Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, and more-- to mostly good effect.

The Chemistry of Common Life,Fucked Up,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd7aabf31b7dc7155f63/1:1/w_160/4c360ea1.jpg,2008-10-16 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12320-the-chemistry-of-common-life/,Matador,"Whether it's their second release or their 60th (no one's even pretending to be sure), Fucked Up's The Chemistry of Common Life is really easy to get excited about. A lot's been made about how it could possibly revitalize hardcore, although framing it within genre terms tends to lead to the wrong questions: Is it too melodic and instrumentally diverse to qualify as hardcore? Maybe. Is it heavy and chaotic enough to satisfy fans of the debut, even while it dramatically broadens their fanbase? Possibly. Can a band as destructive as Fucked Up really carry an entire scene on their sweaty, unshaven backs? Stranger things have happened. It might seem counterintuitive to call Chemistry a grower: From the first listen, it's both pummeling and riveting. When frontman Pink Eyes (Damien Abraham) makes his grand entrance 1.5 minutes into the massive album opener ""Son the Father"", he channels G.G. Allin by way of Les Savy Fav's Tim Harrington, delivering fiercely intelligent lyrics in a singing voice presumably treated by years of guzzling Canadian Club and then eating the bottles. That said, The Chemistry of Common Life is a guitarist's album: 10,000 Marbles (Mike Haliechuk) and producer Jon Drew balance classic rock force with shimmering overdubs, at times recalling the Smashing Pumpkins, while at others echoing the layered, chiming guitars and famed loud/quiet dynamics of Bossanova-era Pixies. First single ""No Epiphany"" has 18 overdubs alone. Fractured harmonies bring ""Crooked Head"" to its cruising altitude, while breakneck opener ""Son the Father"" is almost tactile in its texture, with power chords and rich overtones busting into an arm-swingng chorus that doubles as the record's thesis: ""It's hard enough being born in the first place/ Who would ever want to be born again?"" It's a hell of a pace to sustain, particularly after the bongo-laced battering ram ""Magic Word"", but Fucked Up get plenty of help: Chemistry is an ""it takes a nation of millions"" endeavor, born out of a sense of community and the determination to create something huge. According to the band, something along the lines of 70 tracks of instruments went into the making, as well as guest vocals from Vivian Girls and Sebastian Grainger (formerly from Death From Above 1979). It's not a situation where Fucked Up are seeking credit merely for beginning the album with a flute or other decidedly non-hardcore instruments. These touches often provide the most memorable moments: The gorgeous curtain-raise of female voices that open ""No Epiphany""; ""Twice Born"" and its shout-along chorus (""Hands up if you think you're the only one denied!""); the mystic Black Mountain-style duet on ""Royal Swan"". Along with a sense of community, the album also offers a refreshing take on religion. Fucked Up's spiritual bent is something richer than believers being targeted by secularists aiming to make them look stupid (there's your Religulous spoiler-- save the $10): Chemistry is questioning but rarely cynical, the album's midsection testing faith in the face of reason and science, and finding meaning in the actual search for answers (""Days of Last"", ""No Epiphany""). Chemistry doesn't sit still, and perhaps paradoxically, its most palatable track might be its most divisive-- judging from the ringing open-chords and insistent drum beat of ""Black Albino Bones"", you might get the idea that this is actually an indie rock album (oh yeah, it is on Matador), a forgotten Husker Du track, or god forbid, pop-punk. Were it given a more conventional vocalist, it could easily sidle into MTV with more ease than this performance of ""Twice Born"". But while ""Black Albino Blues"" marks the album's most melodically uplifting track, it might be the most lyrically melancholy, furthering the message of the title track that the magic in our lives is still often a result of nature. ""It's the little things that get us through life,"" barks Pink Eyes before Dallas Green sweetens up with ""I need a little escape."" This still being Fucked Up, it's a song about sex and drugs, but if they happened to leave something out of that eternal triad, it's only because The Chemistry of Common Life kicks enough ass to demand inclusion on its own terms.","They may owe their roots to hardcore, but on their second album, Toronto-based six-piece Fucked Up reinvent themselves with power chords, rich overtones, and anthemic, arm-swingng choruses to create one of the year's most ambitious and uniting hard rock records.

Matterhorn,The Clips,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd47abf31b7dc7155ef4/1:1/w_160/5b4ca436.jpg,2008-10-15 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12276-matterhorn/,Unfamiliar,"Most of what I know about Vancouver comes from reading Douglas Coupland essays and novels, but I have to say it sounds like a very cool place, somewhere I'd visit if I had the time and money. I'm not sure if it's just my mind playing tricks on me, but the Clips, a keyboard-dominated quintet who hail from Vancouver, really sound like the image I have of their hometown. What I picture is a city hemmed to the sea by tree-covered mountains, linked to a pristine island by an impressive bridge-- sort an intersection of sleek modernity and old-school nature. And I get that in this band's music, where the buzz and glide of electronic keyboards and reverb-drenched piano stacks up against raw, unrefined drums, crunchy bass, and long strands of guitar. Even if that only makes sense in my own head, the band's basic power-trio-plus-two-keyboardists set-up is easy enough to understand. Their range is mostly rhythmic-- they go from fast songs with choppy drums to slow songs with choppy drums and back again-- but it's an interesting enough sound to fill an album, even if a few of the nine songs are overlong. It's hard to imagine from the start that they haven't been listening to a fair amount of Radiohead. ""Wire"" definitely feels like a post-Kid A song, with a calm electric piano playing an unresolved chord sequence that's even more unsettled by the frenetic drumming of Jeremy Gruman. Edo Van Breeman's vocals adhere to the voice-as-instrument school of singing, and the song is a solid, if lengthy, introduction to the band. I imagine listeners to this band will be divided as to whether they're at their best working contrasting textures over a slow beat or in their more immediately accessible dance-rock mode. Both have their moments. Van Breeman's best vocal undoubtedly comes on the slow but persistent ""Eyesuck"", where he trades hooks with the guitar and ventures near a falsetto. The song veers off on two consecutive instrumental tangents, one geared for dancing, the second for coming down. The album flips conventional sequencing wisdom and ends with two of its danciest tracks, the buzzed-out instrumental ""2nd Hand Deal"", which launches itself from a sharp keyboard/bass riff into splatter disco passages where most of the instruments run into the red, and ""Kassel"", a strong song that nicely pays off the buildup in its verses with a rocketing keyboard riff. ""Kassel"" is the song that best crystallizes the band's talent, matching a strongly written, well-sung vocal verse against exciting and unpredictable instrumental passages. The band bogs down a bit in the middle of the album, with a string of four songs that are each only half successful. For instance, the march experiment ""Missing the Plan"" has interesting rhythmic ideas and a nice guitar solo, but the melody is basically flat and the song doesn't go anywhere even as it intentionally moves through differently arranged sections. Imperfect though it may be, Matterhorn's handful of take-away songs make for a promising and enjoyable debut.","This keyboard-heavy band from Vancouver, while sounding like they've listened to more than a little Radiohead, nicely capture their hometown's intersection of sleek modernity and old-school nature.

Holy,Love as Laughter,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd545e6ef95969323031/1:1/w_160/36837288.jpg,2008-10-15 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12287-holy/,Epic,"Love as Laughter have never been tough to root for. Since founder and songwriting engine-- as well as former Lync frontman and longtime Isaac Brock bff-- Sam Jayne started the project as a platform for hissy four track meanderings in the mid-1990s, LAL have taken an increasingly populist bent to squeezing out their Stones-y indie rock. 2001's From Sea to Shining Sea and 2005's Laughter's Fifth arrived quietly and to less commercial ovation than you would think given the way they seemed to brush aside bands of their ilk. There were skyscraper hooks, whimsical lyrics, and, perhaps most importantly, there was nary a trace of pretense. At high volumes or low, Sam Jayne just seemed like he could give a fuck. It's a charm, of course, that has benefitted Jayne's fly-unzipped songwriting greatly in the past. But Holy, his major label debut and first for Brock's Glacial Pace imprint (Brock also appears here, providing guitar licks in ""Paul Revere"" and ""All Parts Of Me""), is more a collection of scattered mood pieces than the big league unveiling it could have been. Produced by Joe Blaney, whose CV includes work with the Clash, the Ramones, and Tom Waits, Holy does enjoy an expected sheen that previous work didn't. Still, the end result feels flat and a little phoned-in, this despite Jayne's gradual and often fruitful progression towards breezy, back porch fare. Undeniably top-heavy, Holy is an album whose more winning strummers and stormers are conveniently located in its first half. Title track and opener ""Holy"" is a slow-roasted acoustic number, with Jayne setting the tone via falsetto: ""Holy is never out of reach, I heard that demons don't hit the beach."" While muted, it still shares the oddly hypnotic effects of its predecessor on the 2005 LP Laughter's Fifth's. There, opening track ""In Amber"" was a tone poem that tapped Keith Richards vein with great success. ""Holy"" does well by forming a Stones-saluting diptych with the subsequent ""Baby Shambles"", bouncing its guitar strokes into a latticework of carnival ba-ba-ba-ba-da-da's as the Dionysian thrust of its counterpart goes down just as smoothly. Early highlights aside (particularly the bone-rattling ""Paul Revere""), much of the album could be written off as cruise-controlled and that feel definitely resonates. Jayne is wise to feature guitar tones that soften and grow more sumptuous with each listen, if only because it accents nicely the languid, almost lazy feel of the record as whole. Nothing feels forced. Even the glassy-and ill-advised tropical pop of ""All Parts Of Me"", which sounds more like a recent Modest Mouse outtake, brandishes an unusual sense of contentment. Few of the melodies feel inspired, but within the dusty halfway point, ""Konny And Jim"" resides the sound of a songwriter totally cool with that. He'll turn it up and on when he feels like it.","Released on Isaac Brock's Glacial Pace imprint, the latest from these Pacific NW indie rock stalwarts has a mellow sense of contentment that suits them.

(And, in part as a result, Robyn already has enjoyed a #1 in the UK.) Thus, the emergence of Anna Ternheim. She's a critical and commercial success back home, where she has a Swedish Grammy. Decca recently released a comp over here called Halfway to Fivepoints, culled mostly from her hit Separation Road and presumably released to warm audiences to a forthcoming full-length. A subsequent American trek supporting svenskars El Perro del Mar and Lykke Li followed. (Ternheim dubbed it the ""'Swedish Music Takes Over the World' tour."") For her part, she seems to lack either the poise of El Perro or the bubblegum appeal of Li, but Fivepoints hints at an effervescent personality who, at her best, hints at something darker and more complex than orchestral folk rock. Ternheim achieved her folksy hybrid on tour as a one-woman act, her iPod often acting as a backing band. On record, she's far more prepared and polished, backed by a full band and strings. At times her peculiar arrangements recall the beguiling progressive style of St. Vincent's Annie Clark, but she's often subdued, whether backed by verdant orchestration (""Such a Lonely Soul"") or her own acoustic guitar (as on the somber Fleetwood Mac cover of ""Little Lies""). Her compositions all sound rooted in the same humble beginnings, hinting at a history as a coffee-house songstress excitedly discovering the pleasures of the audio field. Savvy listeners may have previously experienced, say, the Guillemots-by-way-of-Coldplay orchestral chorus of the opener ""Girl Laying Down"", but the tinker-toy way it was affixed to the piano stabs of the preceding verse seems more affectionate than affected. But whether playing at eclectic or electric, she's not immune from leaving an impression that she's laying a bit fallow, that she's waiting for something to happen. The bluesy guitar fills of ""Bridges"" seem directly lifted out of some bar-band's set-list. And the Fyfe Dangerfield (Guillemots) duet ""Lovers Dream"" drags aimlessly, Fyfe's pipes bridled save some indiscriminate yelps that sound like they were picked up off the Through the Windowpane cutting room floor. Her missteps point at a troubling lack of discretion (or, perhaps, artistic freedom) to reject a questionable eighth choice after making seven previous good choices. Fivepoints hints at the conflict of duality, a surprising game to play for a girl armed only with a guitar and an iPod. Love songs intertwine with romantic diffidence, folk rock clashes with Van Dyke Parks. Ternheim is capable of conceiving of her art as able to convey depth and innovation while still inadvertently slipping into bush-league tropes. Ahead of the pending release of her next full-length, it's tempting to speculate on how Americans will receive her. See, fans of the Sweden scene seem to be attracted by the perception that Peter, Bjorn, John, Lykke, and others listened to the same Fab Four, the same Dylan, the same Madonna, and the same Velvet Underground that we did, but like French yé-yé girls before them, they envisioned it possessing an exuberance that American pop has lost. It seems fairly obvious that Anna Ternheim has the exuberance, but it looks like she's still working on her vision.","The American debut by Swedish folk-rock songstress Anna Ternheim is a compilation of hits that have earned her a Swedish Grammy and a spot touring the States with Lykke Li and El Perro Del Mar.

Perfect Symmetry,Keane,by: Tom Ewing,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd7313d197565213b53f/1:1/w_160/f5c2f1e3.jpg,2008-10-15 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12314-perfect-symmetry/,Island,"Keane's career so far has rested on being the UK's smallest big band. Their hits have often been naked pleas for security and comfort in an era of baffling change, and they've sealed their everyman appeal by projecting these insecurities and worries onto the monster canvas stadium rock affords. Perfect Symmetry promises a shift in direction. Jacques Lu Cont's Stuart Price produced some of it; electronic tweaks and jagged drum patterns abound; they've radicalized their instrumental palette-- well, they've put a musical saw on one track. And perhaps most strikingly this is the first time they've put a record out in the same year as style leaders Coldplay. This album has been hyped in the same way Viva La Vida was-- as an experimental gear-change to escape a potential rut. It starts well. First single ""Spiralling"" is enjoyably awkward and unexpectedly vigorous; all lurching rhythms, blaring keyboards, and desperate clipped whoops as Tom Chaplin sings about a life slipping into chaos. He then tries to ruin the song with a risible ""Once in a Lifetime"" spoken-word section, but he can't quite wreck his band's momentum. ""The Lovers Are Losing"" takes ""Spiralling"" and irons out its kinks, taking us into pure 80s chest-beating territory: An unashamed populist bigness of sound, underpinned by bright keyboards. Keane as a reborn Simple Minds, perhaps, or huger yet-- a melodic lift from U2's ""In God's Country"" serves notice that this band are aiming high indeed. But that's part of the record's problem-- after a few songs Perfect Symmetry's maximalism exhausts the listener. It can feel like Keane have been holed up in some pop laboratory, studying previous methods for making ""big music"" and ticking them off one by one. The title track, for instance, blends rolling piano, a trademark drivetime chorus, a middle eight out of the Born to Run playbook and a coda which finds common ground between U2 and ABBA. Oh, and it's a meditation on the July 2005 terror attacks in London. This is a lot to freight a song with, and in trying Keane sacrifice dynamics for bluster: none of its ideas manage to break loose and stand out. Tom Chaplin's vocals run into similar trouble. He has a rich, crowd-stirring voice which he uses in exactly the same soaring way on almost every track: No vowel escapes unstretched, no meaning unstressed. It's the emotional equivalent of dynamic range compression-- the meters of feeling pushed unvaryingly into the red until you're left with a sense that passion is his comfort zone. Admittedly if you're given lines like ""The sky will be my shroud/ A cenotaph of cloud"" you can't afford to blink when you deliver them, but it means the more interesting images-- like ""I dream in e-mails""-- sound dumber than they actually are. By the back end of Perfect Symmetry, it's business as usual for Keane: Epic piano belters to the fore, and the experimental approach promised by ""Spiralling"" has devolved into a rather odd James pastiche (""Pretend That You're Alone"")-- though by then you're grateful for any respite from the massiveness. To an extent, the world has called Keane's bluff-- even in the good times they traded in vague fretting, and now their lyrics are full of dislocation, futility, and panic. I can sympathize, but most of Perfect Symmetry sounds over-inflated. It's a band reaching for an arena-size sound and scale, but Keane's primary inspirations filled those huge spaces with charisma, not just glossy noise.","Coldplay-a-likes Keane follow their more well-known bretheren by hooking up with an electronic music-versed producer (in this case, Jacques Lu Cont aka Stuart Price) and crafting an experimental gear-changer in order to escape a potential rut.

Matador Singles '08,Jay Reatard,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd76c0084474cd0c2ce4/1:1/w_160/68bd3a90.jpg,2008-10-15 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12316-matador-singles-08/,Matador,"Just like the guy in the tub on this record's cover, you might consider singles to be completely different animals. Not usually beholden to the greater aesthetic or weight of an album, the single can stand on its own two pegs. It can be cranked out independently, ferociously, and perhaps most importantly in the case of a one Jay Reatard, quickly. Wham. Bam. Onto the next. Such is the Taz-like clip with which Reatard has cranked out micro-epics since the release of his incredible solo debut, 2006's Blood Visions. That garage-punk opus spawned many of the cuts on Singles 06-07, the singles compilation released by the In the Red label just four months ago. Now he's back with Matador Singles '08, a collection of limited-edition singles recorded and released, like the title promises, this year for Matador. Harnessing his hyperactive work rate, Reatard's new home let him loose in what seems to be his natural habitat, encouraging him to headbutt a variety of sounds before recording a follow-up full-length. While the In the Red singles share a certain wealth of diversity (synths!) with their Matador cousins, they didn't signal a major shift in sound. But here, Reatard goes the full Ramone, imbuing each recording with an expansive pop sensibility. And though this collection doesn't benefit from the sequencing a standard LP would, it does nicely chart the directions in which Reatard's self-described ""schizophrenic"" musical jones have hurried him. First A-Side ""See/Saw"" is a hail of Tommy gun guitar work and Reatard's rubbery bark, a noticeably snottier departure from the collapsed-lung screams listeners are accustomed to hearing from him. ""See/Saw"", alongside its excellent B-Side ""Screaming Hand"", is built on a healthy spine of acoustic guitar. A no-no in the rulebook of pure punk, it's an approach that defines many of Reatard's fresher foundations-- most dramatically, the gentle whispers (gasp!) of the kiwi-pop inflected single that wrapped up the series. That trio of songs-- ""No Time"", ""You Were Sleeping"", and the gorgeous ""I'm Watching You""-- hint at a possible sound for next year's full-length, but they don't effectively showcase what Reatard does best: erecting epics in spaces most would deem too tight for them. Listen to the way ""Always Wanting More"" breaks loose on the back of a caped riff and a chorus no basement or half pipe could contain. It's a moment bested on this record only by the final 30 seconds of hyper-caffeinated post punk dirge ""Trapped Here"". Reatard's weaknesses present themselves when he leans too hard on the familiar-- ""D.O.A."" is a bit by-the-numbers-- or is out of his comfort zone, as he is on a nearly five-minute take on Deerhunter's ""Flourescent Grey"" built on drone and electric moans. Considerably longer than anything else in his jamography, Reatard is able to take a contemporary band's song and make it his own, no matter how radically the sonic paradigm might differ. It's admirable, but if he were to take a shot at writing something equally ambitious, with the energy you'd expect from him, the result could be dizzying. For now, he's making things look easy.","Just four months after his In the Red-released collection, Singles 06-07, Jay Reatard returns with another compilation of garage-punk micro-epics, one that shows more range, including acoustic guitars and nods to kiwi-pop.

From the Mountain to the Sea,Birdmonster,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd55abf31b7dc7155f12/1:1/w_160/d457a16a.jpg,2008-10-14 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12288-from-the-mountain-to-the-sea/,Fader,"Ha, you're not getting away that easily, Birdmonster. Inextricably shackled to the 2006 chain gang of heart-on-sleeve blog bands, the San Franciscan quartet throws on a pair of Groucho Marx glasses and makes a run for it, and who can blame them? They've seen their RIYL buds either shunned or put to sleep by indie audiences existing outside of comment sections and blog aggregators, and the only thing seemingly protecting these guys from a similar fate is their inferior exposure. Their escape plan? Trade in those jingle-jangle guitars for some rugged acoustics, essentially a last-ditch shtick-switch hoping to feed off of Feist, Sufjan Stevens, and a hankerin' for Americana that only an election year can bring. Released digitally by Fader a month before it hit stores, From the Mountain to the Sea is so slick and inoffensive you'd think Lou Pearlman was managing these guys. 2006 debut No Midnight didn't exactly push the envelope musically, but its athletic 1990s rock sounds down right terrifying when compared to Sea's coffeehouse whimper. Frontman Peter Arcuni finally sounds as cute and cuddly as his press photos, and the band does its best not to overpower his whisper. They don't even deign to slap any indie signifiers on their Muzak this time, not a Springsteen chorus nor a droning Pixies riff. Lost in this monstrous buzz kill are a few decent Ted Leo rips, led by the spunky ""New Country"" and ""Greenland Sound"". Even on these tracks, though, the occasional tacky hook or flourish recalls Toad the Wet Sprocket, the Goo Goo Dolls, and other 90s ""alt"" bands with names (and songs) too painful to remember. On the other hand, these areas on Sea prove far more interesting than Arcuni's conflict-free tales of happily requited love and obstacles overcome. Single ""Born to Be Your Man"" and folksy opener ""My Love For You"" are sure to kill teenage girls with their romantic testifying, and uplifters like ""I Might Have Guessed"" suggest that Arcuni, when armed with his trusty acoustic/mandolin backing, can solve anything from the Wall Street crisis to a stubbed toe. Unlike their last effort, there's not even a fully fleshed-out song here to suggest Birdmonster is destined for more than teen drama soundtracks, which may be fine since they don't sound interested in indie rock anymore anyway. That's not intended as a put down, either. Birdmonster never pretended to shy from mass appeal in the first place, and looking back, it's likely their grassroots 2.0 origins erroneously linked them with concurrent blog bands. Either way, their days of opening for Clap Your Hands Say Yeah appear long over.","SF-based indie rockers trade in the cute jingle-jangle guitars found on their 2006 debut for some rugged acoustics, as the songwriting focus moves to happily requited love and obstacles overcome.

Just Thoughts,Prints,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd205e6ef95969322fc4/1:1/w_160/61cf1453.jpg,2008-10-14 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12245-just-thoughts/,Temporary Residence,"Ah, good old Temporary Residence Limited and their catalog of strangely reserved, and often wordless, works of high-ish quality that never seem to be aiming for giddy stratospheres (well, except for some of Mono's operatic guitar spires). The duo Prints are a perfect fit, and not just because multi-instrumentalist Kenseth Thibideau is a veteran of four other TRL acts. Their self-titled debut full-length boasted subdued production, like-whatever lyrics, and a general sense that the project was a leisurely outlet for two talented guys who didn't need anything from it. Listeners in a mode of endless intake might welcome such a breezy ethic, but those laboring to achieve more spartan hard drives probably took a pass, waiting until Prints squirt out something that plays like it just had to be born. This new EP builds ever-so-slightly on one angle of the debut, which fused boogieless aspects of dance music with polite hints of psych. Much of it seemed to crave sounding all-over-the-place, but settled for the mild outskirts of starchy Tropicália. The album closer ""End"", though, added to the influence-porridge elements that suggested M83 trying to outswath a Trans Am coming after them with a cutting board. Just Thoughts mostly continues to mine this stilted, soft-hitting electronic vein. Less lingering is the suspicion that the tracks are showcases for musical chops whose authors didn't know or care whether they were making actual songs or, you know, ""pieces."" The title kinda implicates the intentionally tossed-off lyrics, even though the phrase ""just thoughts"" actually appears during a passage worried about the brain's relentless presence. Stoner advice is the default here, with over twenty fizzy imperatives (""taste the color,"" etc.) coming in the first three tunes' twelve-minute span, climaxing in an answering machine message about tree sentience from Elizabeth Teebee'eh and the redeundant truism ""what we make is made."" Mind-clearing to the point of drool-farming. Enter DFA's Tim Goldsworthy and !!!'s Tyler Pope, co-hosting a combined remix of two already-linked tracks from the long-player. Despite retaining the original Ween-caliber words (""There's a pretty tick/ Sucking your blood and shit"") it's ingratiatingly layered/sequenced, and even dismisses itself elegantly, full of life but never violating Prints' apparent policy of only allowing would-be bangers to percolate. Which is why their new music can come off elsewhere like stately Of Montreal reworks by Steely Dan, elevator MGMT, or worse, like the inevitable (after the re-cooling of Vangelis and Balearic textures) indie peekaboo into the soulpatched chillout lounge.","Fusing aspects of dance music with polite hints of psych, the latest EP on Tempoary Residence from this duo also features a remix from DFA's Tim Goldsworthy and !!!'s Tyler Pope.

Krallice,Krallice,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd24eb335119a49ecdf7/1:1/w_160/dedb06bc.jpg,2008-10-14 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12250-krallice/,Profound Lore,"""I'd love to be a nature band, but unfortunately we live in New York."" So said guitarist/vocalist Mick Barr in Pitchfork's interview with Krallice, his black metal band with Colin Marston and Lev Weinstein. He was referring to black metal's typical obsession with nature, given its origins in Scandinavia's rugged landscape. But Krallice is a nature band. It's just that New York's ""nature"" is concrete, glass, numbers, and dollars. Barr's and Marston's main gigs are Orthrelm and Behold...The Arctopus, respectively, two bands that showcase mind-boggling technicality. Their ""calculator metal"" aspect colors Krallice, which is precise, neurotic, yet powerful-- just like mathematician Maximillian Cohen, protagonist of Pi, Darren Aronofsky's Kabbalah/math thriller set in New York. ""For fuck's sake, how does a Jew end up listening to Burzum?"" Weinstein rhetorically asked. Easy: Cohen would have jammed hard on Krallice. From their first note, it's obvious how unlike most other black metal they are. Barr's agonized yell isn't the usual witchy screech. The guitar tone nods to black metal's trebly buzz, but it also has rich midrange. Instead of paper-thin walls of cymbals, these drums have heft, blessed by a naturalistic analog recording. No Satanism, Odinism, or nationalism here-- a few mysterious phrases replace printed lyrics: ""Solar winds breed laceration""; ""The lesser gods have taken their withered placement back from man."" Most saliently, the guitar work isn't the typical minor chord that's moved up and down. These are complex, abstract lines, often spinning away from each other in counterpoint. In ""Cnestorial"", guitars cross at skewed angles, cutting the tonality loose in an indeterminate key. Eventually, dreamy sheets of Rothko-esque chords envelop the tune. ""Timehusk"" flutters with free jazz skronk, then resolves into straight-ahead thrash. ""Forgiveness in Rot"" weaves lines picked at light speed with curtain-like chords that billow open and shut. It's ambient music at 200 bpm. The tremolo picking and blastbeats are unmistakably black metal, but this record otherwise relocates the Norwegian art form to Mars. Two American precedents do exist for Krallice: Weakling and Wolves in the Throne Room. Weakling were more emotional, and Wolves in the Throne Room are more lush, but both have stretched what essentially began as Satanic punk rock into 10-minute textural meditations. Krallice have now added math to the equation. The results are hard to grasp, but strangely addictive. Krallice would have made a marvelous soundtrack to Pi.","Members of Orthrelm and Behold...The Arctopus come together for a project that combines the hyper-technical ""calculator metal"" of their other projects with dreamy textural meditations.

Double Night Time,Morgan Geist,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd0bea9e61561daa760e/1:1/w_160/4e04b5aa.jpg,2008-10-14 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12227-double-night-time/,Environ,"Brooklyn-based DJ/Composer Morgan Geist is one of electronic music's yeoman, quietly advancing the cause of several labelmates and collaborators while rarely taking a star turn himself. While he has a couple of albums to his credit-- 1997's eponymous solo turn and his lauded collaborations with Darshan Jesrani as Metro Area-- if his name has flittered by your eyes in the last half-decade or so it's likely due to his label, Environ, and its increasingly high profile or for his now-seminal mix, Unclassics, re-unearthed last year as a common ""next step"" for newly minted Italo-disco fans. So Geist's second solo artist album comes slapped not just with a cheeky title-- Double Night Time-- and high-profile guest vocals from the Junior Boys' Jeremy Greenspan but with toe-tapping ""it's about damn time""-anxiety. Geist's 2006 remix of the Junior Boys' ""The Equalizer"" was the first clue, but Greenspan and Geist prove a natural fit. Whereas Geist's previous work had spun through excitable rave-pop (The Driving Memoirs) and electro-lounge cool (Metro Area), an older Geist mines the same lightly frosted pop sounds of Greenspan's Boys. Indeed, it's a patient, subdued album for the time in your life when Saturday questions like ""Where are all my friends tonight?"" have uneasy, obvious answers (""Married, the suburbs""). That type of experience begets compositions that are skillful, but subtly so; Geist makes his sequencers and drum machines hum so efficiently that no one-- man nor machine-- breaks a sweat. It's a cloistered record-- with a uniform textuality-- that threatens to sound sterile as a result. The tempos remain even as well: Greenspan's voice isn't suited for rave-ups, but Double Night Time features few ballads, leaving almost every track in a milky midtempo soup. Geist's programming expertise has always leaned towards the expertly prepared rather than the sonically adventurous, and Double Night Time rarely surprises: It sounds like a control variable for future electronic pop experiments. Double Night Time's real draw is Greenspan, who is at least not obviously saving bullets for the next Junior Boys album. It's a little strange to hear the relative newcomer tip-toe his way through ""Detroit"", Geist's tribute to motorik blends of Carl Craig and Derrick May, but by the time ""The Shore"" hits, the duo have found even terrain. Singing mostly Geist's lyrics, Greenspan matches Geist's veteran presence, detailing not the combustible dalliances of teenagers but the well-spaced hardships of adults. Relationships have pasts, and possibly futures; reflection is spread over years, not weeks. ""Ruthless City"" is their greatest triumph, Geist offering a minimal, mousy squeak and Greenspan seeking answers-- ""My best friend/ He once was yours/ He gave you all his love and money""-- going on breathlessly enough that Geist is forced to build the track into something of a climax. The track muddies the distinction between ""ruthless"" and ""truthless"" as the sequencers muscle and whir. The refreshingly busy chorus of ""The Shore"" speaks of ""panicked, backward glances,"" a fine encapsulation of urban adulthood. Double Night Time lags, though: the mostly instrumental tracks, ""Lullaby"" and ""Nocebo"" chief among them, are soggy and trying. Despite the album's most evocative title and Greenspan's only co-writing credit, ""City of Smoke and Flame"" finds too much comfort amid muted bass thumps. ""Palace Life"" is the only track that might crowd a dance floor, but there's no hook save a wordless choir as the track pounds to a close. Geist's contributions to electronica have always seemed fringe-- label head, remix specialist, in-demand crate digger-- and it's once again nice for him to have something to put his own name on. But after years of waiting, Double Night Time confirms that Geist is most valuable behind the curtain.","After spending much of the decade as a man content to do great things behind a relative curtain-- running the Environ label, releasing exquisite disco tracks with Darshan Jesrani as Metro Area, mixing the Italo-disco primer Unclassics-- Morgan Geist finally issues his first solo artist album in 11 years.

Lost Wisdom,Mount EerieJulie DoironFred Squire,by: Matthew Solarski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd59c0084474cd0c2ca3/1:1/w_160/ff49cfdc.jpg,2008-10-14 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12292-lost-wisdom/,P.W. Elverum & Sun,"At a glance, a Phil Elverum/Julie Doiron meet-up seems entirely apt, perhaps even inevitable. The two share collaborators, hail from sleepy corners of their respective countries, and make music a Last.fm or Pandora bot would more than likely peg as ""similar."" Viewed a certain way, however, the two couldn't be more far afield. Elverum, as a songwriter, has long occupied himself with The Big Questions, his catalog full of probing meditations on birth and death, the elements, and the unknown. Doiron, conversely, has consistently stuck to the simple and domestic, quietly reveling in the tangible and everyday. Songs such as ""Snowfalls in November"" are patiently observed odes to satisfaction and serenity in the absolute. In short, Doiron is the contented period to Elverum's searching question mark. The mini-album Lost Wisdom represents an intersection of those two distinct sensibilities and their resulting voices: Elverum, his tone often hesitant and sorrowful; Doiron, her singing reassuringly direct and familiar. For Doiron, this is a chance to wrap her warm, homespun vocals around Elverum's words of uncertainty, bringing earthly color to songs which, under the Mount Eerie banner alone, might emerge cold and gray. From her entrance on opening track ""Lost Wisdom"", a stately rumination rife with natural imagery which sets the tone for the album, through her solitary vocal on the Songs-era Leonard Cohen-evoking ""If We Knew..."", and on to the closing duet ""Grave Robbers"", Doiron is a reassuring presence in song-world often threatening to capitulate to doubt. Indeed, it's this presence of a second voice that distinguishes Lost Wisdom amid the abundance of post-Microphones Phil Elverum material. To hear Elverum sing of his existential quandaries in isolation is frequently compelling, but with these songs often cast as duets, we're presented with the notion that Phil's struggles are universal. Nowhere is this better demonstrated than on ""Voice in Headphones"", the closest thing to a standout track on Lost Wisdom, with its harmonized refrain-- borrowed from Björk's ""Undo""-- of ""It's not meant to be a strife/ It's not meant to be a struggle uphill."" It's the sort of lyric Elverum would have the whole crowd singing along to at a show, and here-- surrounded as it is by plenty of brooding restraint-- it sounds resoundingly triumphant, a more terrestrial counterpart to the otherworldly song it quotes and a kind of modern day spiritual for those oppressed within. Elverum, too, benefits from the de facto constraints of this collaboration. The album was recorded during a brief touring respite, forcing him to forgo the intricate (if still lo-fi) ornamentation that typically adorns his output. It is instead, as he told Pitchfork, a ""documentary of a session."" Even Fred Squire's electric guitar is notably unobtrusive as it complements the two voices and the steady rumble of Phil's acoustic. The result is a collection of songs so taut and concisely resonant as to be psalms. But psalms to be sung, perhaps, in secret: ""Grave Robbers"", the closing track, ends with someone abruptly shutting off the tape. In a way we're made to feel as though we've been eavesdropping all the while, but even so, seldom has an act of auditory voyeurism been so rewarding.",,8.3,
Hell and Highwater,Shock Cinema,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd07ea9e61561daa7602/1:1/w_160/ef12439f.jpg,2008-10-13 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12223-hell-and-highwater/,Kanine,"On last year's debut Our Way Is Revenge, Brooklyn's Shock Cinema sought cheap thrills from haunted house scare tactics and literary snobbery. To make matters more irritating, their already dubious shtick was steeped in cookie-cutter post-punk posturing. The album stared down its nose at your while flaunting the most garden variety craftsmanship, the kind of Siouxsie Sioux-inspired goth rock available on every Williamsburg corner. In retrospect, it's clear that Shock Cinema, slapped together from spare parts of several bands, jumped the gun a bit by releasing an awkward EP consisting of a few so-so songs and two remixes. Hell And Highwater jettisons many of the band's gimmicks and showcases a formidable range of songwriting styles and moods, and you don't have to be into something like French surrealist film to appreciate the music. Chalk up some of the improvements to a change of scenery. Recorded in San Francisco with Nation of Ulysses/Fucking Champs member Tim Green, the album kicks off with the gloomy Yeah Yeah Yeahs'-inspired rocker ""Leviathan"" but quickly scatters in several directions. Lead singer Destiny Montague isn't digitally processed to sound like she's singing from the depths of hell on every track, and the newfound starkness in her vocals makes a jangly dirge like ""Oddfellow"" sound less like Joy Division or Bauhaus than I.R.S.-era R.E.M. trying their hand at avant-garde. ""Mutineers Reconsider"" makes for a nice point of comparison with Revenge's hokey ""Art of Noir"", the former handling its precarious dance-punk feel with a lot more discretion and more memorable melody. That's not to say Shock Cinema's mastered the art of subtlety. ""Atlas Shrugged"" is as long-winded and overbearing as the eponymous novel, and tracks like ""Lone Islands"" and ""Dead Sea"" are slow burners that build not with musical ideas but additional layers of instruments and cheesy dramatic splashes. Still, Hell's songs stand on their own much better than previous material, so much so that a bluesy stomper like ""Wax Wings"" doesn't even sound related to the other YYY/Kills-like numbers here. The uniform pallor that sanded Revenge down into one constant, anti-climactic sneer doesn't afflict Shock Cinema's latest effort, and even if they're still struggling to carve their own niche in post-punk-- or at least find an exciting single-- they're much closer to doing so than they were 12 months ago.","Improving on their debut EP Our Way Is Revenge, the first full-length from this Brooklyn band with goth inclinations cuts back on the gimmicks and showcases a formidable range of songwriting styles and moods.

When the duo went to the Ars Electronica summit in 2001, other artists made snide comments about two classically trained musicians at the conference. The women took the academic (and perhaps a little misogynistic) sneering in stride, and their LP, The Messy Jesse Fiesta, snatched second place at the Digital Musics competition. Then they broke up. Parting drove them in unexpected directions: Blechdom moved to Berlin, started writing banjo music, singing live over MIDI, and spreading animal guts on her body as the grand finale of her shows. Blectum moved to San Fransisco, put out solo records, collaborated with other artists, and studied veterinary science. Listening to their latest LPs now, it's hard to believe that Blectum and Blechdom used to be so close that, well, they took essentially the same last name. Or that they used to perform, as the brilliant and ridiculous Blectum From Blechdom, in a custom-made costume that bound them together. Gular Flutter, Blectum's first album in four years, is as indebted to her veterinary studies as it is to her collaboration with Blechdom. The title refers to a part of a bird's throat (ornithology is Blectum's area of specialization), but it's easy to locate animal metaphors all over. Every song has its flutters and tics. Blectum shaves beats so razor thin that they lose their bass-ness and become another light, feathery wafer to stack and arrange. She's clinical in her song-making: Every sound, from fuzzy poofs of static to 8-bit bleeps to the reversed violin (Blectum is classically trained), gets examined under her microscope. Each instrument resides in its own glass case, ready for inspection. On ""Cygnet"" (that's what you call a young swan), eastern drumming and reversed violin go silent every few seconds, as if the song were resetting itself and asking you to choose which passage you prefer. Bird sounds bookend ""Mine"", but it's the next song, ""Flowers Fade Fast"", that is truly bestial, at turns vulgar and writhing, and in that way closer to Blectum From Blechdom than the rest of Gular Flutter. Phantom samples seem to drift through the background of ""Retrice"", whose minute stereo pans require almost total silence to discern. Blectum also uses her voice here, and though it's not the plaintive, dare-to-hate-me bellow of Blechdom, its nakedness is compelling. ""Mine"" and ""Squeezed"" feel a little more fun, and the slight soul vocal that touches down on the latter loosens Blectum's tight reins. Her voice, along with the violins and contemporary classical passages, give the album a more human feeling. But it's not the human you want more of-- it's the animal-- and occasionally it would be better if Blectum flicked away a few grains of electron detritus and wilded out.","Gular Flutter, Blectum's first album in four years, is indebted to her studies of veterinary science: animal metaphors abound, and the classically trained violinist carefully examines each sound as if it were a bird in a glass cage.

Oneiromantical War,Wrnlrd,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd65abf31b7dc7155f34/1:1/w_160/b47bf6d4.jpeg,2008-10-13 05:00:02,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12303-oneiromantical-war/,Flingco Sound,"It would be a stretch to call underground metal the new lo-fi. But just as there were droves of indie musicians in the early 1990s making bedroom pop on four-track recorders, there now seems to be a comparable amount of hooded heads grinding out CD-Rs of all kinds of sub-metal. Just check out some Aquarius Records mail-order updates from the past few years, and you'll see an array of names comprising a global army of basement metal-makers. Most of these subterranean volume-pushers are pretty good-- at least most of the ones Aquarius champions are. Always clued in to the metal fringe, the San Francisco store has long extolled the virtues of Virginia's one-man behemoth Wrnlrd (whose name ""can be pronounced any way you like""), and with good reason. His first five releases (from a nine-part series whose numerical order is tied to a ""hypercube"" of mystical concepts) are intriguing mixes of distorted black metal, overloaded riffs, harsh noise, and haunting hints of backwoods acoustics. Entry number six (representing ""mystery, fire, and dreams"") is also release number one for Flingco Sound, the new vinyl-and-digital label helmed by ex-Kranky partner Bruce Adams. Though it's not quite as sludgy, Oneiromantical War evokes one of this year's best murky noise-metal LPs, the Goslings' Occasion. Both are drenched in bombed-out atmosphere and tinted with creepy acoustics (the man behind Wrnlrd apparently played bluegrass before he went black metal). But the six melted-together songs here can also be surprisingly straightforward. Every time you think Wrnlrd might have disappeared into noise quicksand, a tight riff and thunderous beat charge forward like a bicep-ripping workout. In fact, most of Wrnlrd's songs are built from basic metal blocks-- often they sound like 10 metal bands overlapping and blurring into howling abstraction. Most intriguing is how Wrnlrd's huge sound rarely relies on bottom end. Lots of metal uses deep, dark notes to create hypnotic power, but the tone here is generally mid-range, sometimes even trebly. Wrnlrd does visit the low register, as in the shaking ""Breath of Doors"". But even there, everything is bathed in burning fuzz, making it all sound a few octaves higher than whatever key the original chords came from. The effect is a fascinating disorientation-- Wrnlrd's distortion chimes more than it drills, buzzes more than it burrows, and creates a texture that has been rightly compared to the ambient sheens of Fennesz and Tim Hecker. At times this distortion-addiction can go from entrancing to grating, and it would be tough to call Oneiromantical War ground-breaking, steeped as it is in familiar metal riffs. Even ""War"", a 20-minute album-ending epic that dwarfs the preceding cuts, is more pastiche than original creation. But its journey from metal loops to near-classical bombast to fried atmosphere is intoxicating. It's also a strong indicator that, two-thirds of the way through his ambitious nine-point program, Wrnlrd's vault of ideas is nowhere near empty.","Bedroom metal auteur Wrnlrd-- who for years has crafted an intriguing mix of distorted black metal, overloaded riffs, harsh noise, and haunting hints of backwoods acoustics-- makes his debut on Flingco Sound, the new vinyl-and-digital label helmed by ex-Kranky partner Bruce Adams.

Women,Women,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd52c0084474cd0c2c8d/1:1/w_160/55157bca.jpg,2008-10-13 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12285-women/,Jagjaguwar,"There is an irony to Women's moniker-- the most un-Google-able name in rock since the Music-- that extends beyond the fact that the band is actually four dudes: Like many of their peers and forbears in the worlds of lo-fi psych-rock and industrial post-punk, Women make boys' club music, treehouse rock. Their debut deftly uses tape hiss as both a stylistic aid and compositional element, resulting in stocky blasts of melody. But where peers Deerhunter veer into amorphous song-globs and Times New Viking threaten to come unglued at any moment, Women has the cool, hard weight of something created under duress. You're reminded of how This Heat recorded their songs in a meat factory; Women’s cover-- a creepily synchronized group tai chi exercise-- recalls the sleeves for Reagan-era punk, released at a time when everything seemed vaguely politicized. Women was recorded by Sub Pop artist Chad VanGaalen in his basement, at least partially on boom boxes. The jangly whoosh of opener ""Cameras"" seems like a direct product of those bohemian environs: Quivering voices are propped up by picks scraping against strings, even when an exacted synth squiggle-- the first of several compositional left-turns-- betrays the rugged surroundings. ""Cameras"" lasts a mere 60 seconds and segues seamlessly into the steel-wool industrial sounds of ""Lawncare"", and from there, Women is deceptively easy and oddly energizing. Standout ""Black Rice""'s guitars rapidly approach and fall off little cliffs. ""Group Transport Hall"" is paisley-wallpapered psych, its hasty acoustic march a textural curveball. It's on tracks like these that singer Patrick Flegel's voice-- a sour monotone throughout much of the album-- gains unexpected contour, admirably navigating ""Black Rice""'s sighing chorus. Elsewhere, Women draws from a deceptive range of styles: ""Upstairs"" sounds like a mathematical composite of the breezier half of Chairs Missing. Instrumental ""Sag Harbor Bridge"" is almost John Fahey-esque in the way that its distorted, weaving fretboard runs conjure its namesake. On ""Woodbine"", another instrumental, a long drone sits impatiently as tittering electronics accumulate at its edges. By Women's end, the band's guitars have rusted: ""January 8th"" is fevered paranoia, its guitars angrily panning between speakers. ""Flashlights"" slows the pace momentarily before ramping up to a Sonic Youth-style jamboree. It's a brash, youthful ending for a band that spent most of the album avoiding such bludgeoning. Also strange is ""Shaking Hand"", jittery, Dischord-style precision-rock; at just under five minutes, it's the longest track on the album. Women do spend a tad too much time flexing their way through their instrumentals-- a shame since, when they bother with songcraft, they rarely miss: concise, nuanced statements with idiosyncratic arrangements. Awkward, youthful moments exist, but Women tire of them almost before you do. What's left are the best of post-punk ingredients: curiosity, noise, and sly artifice.","Recorded by Chad VanGaalen in his basement, this Calgary band's pleasantly varied and concise debut, versed in the use of tape hiss as both a stylistic aid and compositional element, is soaked in the stocky blasts of melody of Deerhunter or Times New Viking.

Dig Out Your Soul,Oasis,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd6fc0084474cd0c2cd3/1:1/w_160/32b2f538.jpg,2008-10-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12311-dig-out-your-soul/,Big Brother,"As startling as it was to see Noel Gallagher attacked onstage last month at the Virgin Festival in Toronto, it was arguably the most exciting thing that's happened to Oasis in over 10 years. For a band that once valorized rock'n'roll stardom as a vehicle through which to escape routine day jobs, Oasis have gone about their own rock'n'roll stardom as if it were a routine day job, their last decade of recorded output amounting to a model of passionless, assembly-line predictability. And yet, the Mancunian rockers have mostly held onto their status as the People's Band despite being 14 years and several million pounds removed from their scrappy, working-class roots-- mainly because (as their concert set-lists and greatest-hits CD tracklists prove), much like their legions of fans, Oasis only want to hear songs from their first two albums, too. No one knows exactly what compelled 47-year-old Daniel Sullivan to bodycheck Noel into his stage monitors (busting the guitarist's ribs and forcing several show cancellations in the process); one can only hope he wasn't so much a psychopath looking to off a celebrity as a concerned fan hoping to shake some life into his favorite band and literally push them back to the underdog position that inspired their most enduring anthems. But we'll have to wait another album to see if the incident instills in Noel a newfound hunger and fire; for now we're stuck with Dig Out Your Soul, which like every Oasis album from 1997's Be Here Now onward, makes cursory gestures toward making the band's mod-rock more modernist, before reverting back to the same ol', same ol'. The precipitous quality decline in Oasis' output since Be Here Now-- whose increasingly uninspired successors make it seem not so bad in retrospect-- can be measured two ways: the ballads got more overbearing (""Little by Little"", ""Where Did It All Go Wrong?""), and the rockers more sluggish (""Go Let It Out"", ""The Hindu Times""). At the very least, Dig Out Your Soul makes inroads to redressing both issues: the lilting sea shanty ""Falling Down"" is Noel's most graceful balladic turn since B-side ""The Masterplan"", while lead single ""The Shock of the Lightning"" is exactly the sort of tune Oasis needs more of to stave off impending geezerdom, a hard-driving strobe-lit rocker-- complete with a rejuvenating vocal turn from Liam and a suitably Keith Moon-like drum solo from moonlighting Who drummer Zak Starkey. It could be their most robust song since ""Morning Glory""; only a clunky middle eight lyric-- ""Love is a time machine/ Up on the silver screen""-- keeps it from entering the highest echelons of their canon. The song's brisk velocity makes you wonder why Noel Gallagher doesn't write in this mode more often, as it still seems to come easy to him; as usual, he runs into trouble when he tries to affix weighty themes to flimsy songs. Two songs in a row talk about ""the rapture,"" but don't look here for any insights about the political dimensions of contemporary evangelicalism: While ""The Turning"" at least tries to back up its vague love-as-religious-experience imagery with some suitably stormy acid-rocked intensity (guided by Starkey's loose rhythm, a backing choir, and a repeated single-note piano stab), the Noel-sung ""Waiting for the Rapture"" is just a limpid cock-rock stomp speckled with the usual Beatleisms (""revolution in her head"") and Lennon lifts (specifically, the guitar riff to ""Cold Turkey""). Sadly, this sort of lead-footed blooze seems to be Noel's default setting now, from the opening ""Fat Bottomed Girls"" crunch of ""Bag It Up"" to the awful honky-tonk exercise ""(Get Off Your) High Horse Lady"". Bassist Andy Bell likewise contributes the standard-issue ""Nature of Reality"", a pub-rock slosh that never delivers on the promise suggested by its ""Helter Skelter"" intro. Guitarist Gem Archer fares better with his songwriting ration, ""To Be Where There's Life"", which at least hitches its Beatles reference of choice (the wiggy sitar drones of ""Tomorrow Never Knows"") onto a more exploratory psych-funk rhythm, coming up with the sort of hypno-pop groover the Verve forgot to write for their recent album. But while you'd think a band seven albums into its career would outgrow its formative influences (or at least try to), the Gallaghers' Fab Four embrace feels more suffocating than ever, with Liam's ""I'm Outta Time"" pushing Oasis to new depths of Lennon grave-robbing: just when you're about to forgive the schmaltzy ""Free as a Bird""-style arrangement and the cribbed piano chords from ""Jealous Guy"", they drop an actual Lennon interview sample in the fade-out (because naming his kid after the guy clearly wasn't tribute enough). While slavish Beatles idolatry has been Oasis' stock and trade since day one, the band's definitive early material at least roughed up the Fabs' pop classicism with pronounced punk, glam, shoegazer, and Madchester influences. However, over the past 10 years Oasis have gradually curbed those corrupting devices without replacing them with any new aesthetic inspiration. So all we're left with at the end of Dig Out Your Soul is a promise from Liam to ""solider on""-- not because the band sounds eager to take on the next generation of Britpop revivalists, but because at this point that's all Oasis really know how to do.","Most of Oasis' post-Be Here Now output can be measured in two ways-- the ballads got more overbearing, and the rockers more sluggish; thankfully, each are at least somewhat redressed on the Mancunian band's latest could-be comeback.

A Picture of the Three of Us at the Gate to the Garden of Eden / Crimes,These United States,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd44ea9e61561daa7687/1:1/w_160/dbf5b8a0.jpg,2008-10-10 06:00:05,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12274-a-picture-of-the-three-of-us-at-the-gate-to-the-garden-of-eden-crimes/,United Interests,"If Jesse Elliott were making music in Southern California, we'd surely be comparing him to Gram Parsons. If he were from below the Mason-Dixon, we'd dub him southern rock and compare him (favorably, of course) to Kings of Leon. But Elliott is a Midwesterner living in Washington, D.C., a city whose chief musical styles (hardcore and go-go, for instance) are so far off from his sound that even the most imaginative listener would find no connections. Which is actually surprising, since he approaches indie rock as a massive synthesizing endeavor, combining many styles and sounds in a way that makes his stage name-- These United States-- pretty much inevitable. Within mere months, Elliott has released not one but two full-length albums. The first, A Picture of the Three of Us at the Gate to the Garden of Eden, is a collaboration with David Strackany (aka Paleo) that sounds a bit like the Postal Service and a bit like Beck's blues-folk albums from the 90s. The follow-up, Crimes, puts Elliott in front of a full band and was recorded in less than a week in Lexington, Kentucky. Picture is the primaries, Crimes the general election, but as different as they are from one another, neither sounds like an entirely satisfying expression of Elliott's talent or vision. Picture, the more ambitious of the pair, simply sounds unfocused, overly concerned with effects and production-- with moments and sounds-- than with songs or overall shape. Creaking boards and soft keys set the pensive tone on opener ""Preface: Painless"", then ""First Sight"" mixes guitar with Strackany's electronic burbles and Elliott's exaggeratedly poetic lyrics: ""The cataracts-ed alley cat spat back at the moon, thrown out into the nighttime/ Nine lifetimes too soon."" I could quote similarly unfathomable and overwritten passages from just about every song, which would be okay if they were bolstered by memorable hooks. The best, on ""The Business"", sounds like it was cribbed from ""Summertime Blues"". On this debut, Elliott either has something to say or a clever way to say something, but rarely both at the same time. As its succinct title suggests, Crimes is a much more focused and slightly more rousing effort. There are actually fewer musicians on this album than on the debut, but it feels like they had greater input on its direction, effectively streamlining Elliott's verbosity and punching up his songs considerably. With a finely grained voice that often brings to mind M. Ward, the singer/songwriter sounds much more at home and much more purposeful in these surroundings, especially on the slow-burning ""We Go Down to That Corner"" and ""Study the Moon"". However, much like Josh Ritter, Elliott gets carried away with his grand vision of America, packing his songs with look-at-me allusions to Mark Twain, Cain and Abel, Dionysius, and Babe the Blue Ox (the blue ox, not the band). But his pretensions are much more palatable in a rock setting than in a bedroom pop context, and a few songs-- such as ""Honor Amongst Thieves"", with its raindrops of Tom Hnatow's pedal steel-- have actual hooks to offset Elliott's self-indulgence. Crimes still feels a bit scattered, as if both records are practice sessions for albums three and four. Their eclecticism may stem from a precocious artist who wants to keep his options as open as possible, but it sounds more like someone who either equates artistic seriousness with a form of ADHD or can't commit to being himself. Hopefully Elliott will form these disparate elements into a more perfect union soon enough.",,4.2,
City of Refuge,Castanets,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd6a13d197565213b52f/1:1/w_160/457600d6.jpg,2008-10-10 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12306-city-of-refuge/,Asthmatic Kitty,"Castanets' Raymond Raposa has never shied from mortality. His folk-electronic hybrids have often romanticized death, which isn't the same thing as honoring it. But for City of Refuge-- which is really no city at all-- Raposa decamped, alone, to a tiny desert outpost in Nevada, away from Brooklyn, away from social interaction. The resulting album is appropriately barren and full of spirits. You can tell Raposa was scoured clean by the desert: This is his most nakedly honest record. But here's the thing about deeply personal artifacts: Sometimes, they don't communicate. To investigate yourself through music without regard for audience is very worthwhile. But such an artifact can fit strangely into the commerce stream, where different imperatives apply, and where City of Refuge now resides. When I listen to it, I find myself feeling glad for Raposa that he made it, while wondering what I'm supposed to do with it. He's speaking to himself in a code so deep and personal it scans as almost autistic. Hearing it feels more like voyeurism than dialogue. City of Refuge hangs together oddly-- in fact, it barely hangs together at all. Stern electronic set pieces, high-desert guitar arrangements, and morose folk songs intermingle without discernible rhyme or reason. As a result, the album fits no particular mood, hobbled by awkward pacing. It contains a number of admirable tracks, but its packaging and sale as an album is problematic. The overdubbed cameos from Sufjan Stevens, Jana Hunter, and others add a sheen of completion, but fail to bind it together. It works best in small doses, and might have been more sensibly released as individual tracks via the Internet. The most interesting tracks are the simplest ones. Guitar overture ""Celestial Shore"" sounds like the national anthem of some sad, dusty country. ""High Plain 1"" sends scraps of delayed guitar ricocheting off the walls. ""The Destroyer"" is a seductive dirge for reverbed arpeggios and wobbly percussion. But sequenced consecutively, these three compelling tracks just seem erratic, especially when they let out into more run-of-the-mill Castanets tracks (""Prettiest Chain"" and ""Refuge 1"") where Raposa's voice, distant and brassy as always, finally appears. Elsewhere, a work of purely abstract interference (""High Plain 3"") sits next to an earnest cover of the hymn ""I'll Fly Away""; a psychedelic guitar jam (""The Quiet"") next to a simple acoustic tune (""Glory B""). City of Refuge seems more like a collection of ideas for three or four different albums than one complete work. I find Raposa's electronic improvisations more interesting than his songs, and would love to hear an album where he explores them more fully. And maybe Raposa is primed to make something more focused, having gotten this lost diary disguised as a record-- sometimes intriguing, sometimes banal, often incomprehensible-- out of his system.","For City of Refuge, Castanets' Raymond Raposa decamped, alone, to a tiny desert outpost in Nevada, away from Brooklyn, away from social interaction.

Un Día,Juana Molina,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd5f13d197565213b518/1:1/w_160/b0155361.jpg,2008-10-10 06:00:03,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12297-un-dia/,Domino,"One senses Juana Molina finds sound every bit as captivating as songs and in fact, when not seamlessly conflating the two, may find the former more fascinating than the latter. On each of her beguiling albums, Molina has dissected and detailed the individual components of songs not just as rhythms or melodies or words, but as malleable sounds-- sounds that collide, connect, and complement one another. Her music is pop song as bricolage, the whole greater than the sum of its sometimes conventional, often unusual parts. Yet at the same time, Molina's works, for all their intricacies and novel intersections of electronic and organic, are undeniably subtle, and, like a complex collage relegated to the background, potentially ignored other than by those few curious enough to stop and take a closer look. As successful as she's been, Molina's likely at least a little frustrated that the easy on the ears results perhaps overshadow the discipline and invention behind them. Molina possibly designed her fifth album, Un Día, to counter that perception. Unlike its predecessors, Un Día is less a dinner-party record and more of a conversation piece itself. Here Molina further abstracts her songs, emphasizing more than ever dense hypnotic repetition and the forceful impact of sound itself, sometimes at the expense of the more traditional elements that have always rooted her music. The title track features layers of cascading noises and sonic elements added until the track approaches a cacophonous din. ""Vive Solo"" is more toned down, but Molina's vocals are still almost subsumed by the rhythms, at once indebted to South America and the 70s minimalists. Her singing here serves as a sort of breathy thematic thread linking the various polyrhythms, a living loop changing and modulating itself without veering too far out of range.. Molina's singing ultimately takes an even more supporting role on ""Lo Dejamos"", which tosses in jazz and rumbling sub-woofer friendly drones. It's the perfect lead into ""Los Hongos de Marosa"", one of the disc's highlights, which is propelled along by a circular acoustic guitar pattern as Molina ladles on the effects and electronics, not unlike the best techno deconstructionists, only from a more tactile perspective. Here, the laptop is the key, not the door itself, and Molina uses the technology to open new passageways through which to slip, leading the listener along with her by the hand. Certainly she sounds as engaged as ever with the intersection of man and machine, as heard in the entrancing overlap of synths and looped cooing that ends ""¿Quién? (Suite)"", nearly mushed together into one intriguing compound patch. Un Día is as warm and welcoming as it is weird, but it's also something of an experiment, as delineated by the irresistible statement of purpose conveniently included within the title track (and, translated, in the press notes): ""One day I will sing the songs with no lyrics,"" Molina sings, ""and everyone can imagine for themselves if it's about love, disappointment, banalities or about Plato."" Un Día marks one firm step forward in that regard. It's like sentences with the punctuation marks left out, all the more rewarding for its contradictory incompleteness. Everything's in its right place, but your ear-- and brain-- still struggle to make total sense of even the simplest ideas. It's not perfect, but it's progress.","Argentina's electro-acoustic wiz gets dense and ambitious with her fifth beguiling album, as she again dissects and details the individual components of songs not just as rhythms or melodies or words, but as malleable sounds.

Forfeit/Fortune,Crooked Fingers,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd6dc0084474cd0c2cce/1:1/w_160/9dccd26d.jpg,2008-10-10 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12309-forfeitfortune/,Constant Artists,"Self-releasing may be a viable revenue model for already massive sellers like Radiohead and Trent Reznor, but the jury's still out on whether forgoing record label patronage can keep smaller artists in subsistence rations, let alone support a rock'n'roll lifestyle. Last we heard from Eric Bachmann-- in 2006, when he released the lyrically grim (even by his misery-loving standards) solo record To the Races-- the guy was living out of his van. By choice, according to the musician, but still. So despite culling a decent following over the course of four solid Crooked Fingers full-lengths and a superlative covers EP-- and shored-up by a road warrior work ethic-- Bachmann's decision to hawk this one himself is somewhat risky. He's made Fortfeit/Fortune available in four formats via his website and also through iTunes and two dozen hand-picked independent brick & mortars. So fans who only spend their dollars at the Walton family company store and other mom-and-pop-crushing big boxes are out of luck. (Buy independent, y'all!) There are no hard feelings between Bachmann and recent Crooked Fingers label Merge (a relief, because if you can't count on Merge to do right by artists, hardened skeptics and rabid new paradigm types are right, and labels really are obsolete). Though even a savvy indie with a battalion of crack publicists might not know how to sell this oversalted stew. Typically corralled into the Americana pen, Crooked Fingers has for some time owed more to Iberian (and more recently, Eastern European) folk, contemporary Anglo-American singer/songwriter conventions, and punk rock, than Appalachian ballads, Nashville, or Neil Young. And on previous album, 2005's Dignity and Shame, the loosely cobbled band's strange brew went down reasonably well. Now, imagine that concoction several shots stronger and a whiff past its consume-by date. Bombastic, Boss-baiting opener ""What Never Comes"" has Bachmann emitting a teeth-grinding burr while the track's airless mix is smothered with sax solos. Not a promising start to an album but hey, if it's ever filmed, St. Elmo's Fire II has its theme! Next, ""Luisa's Bones"" imposes flamenco fancy dress on an otherwise charming drum-machined pop song winsomely sung by Elin Palmer, and Spanish motifs reassert themselves on ""Phony Revolutions"", ""No Me Lo Des!"", and the unfortunate ""Sinisteria"", which I can only guess is about Lou Reed chatting up Tom Waits in an Andalusian karaoke bar. Devotchka's Tom Hagerman lends his gypsy strings to ""Let's Not Pretend (To Be New Men)""'s funereal drone and ""Modern Dislocation"" pays tepid tribute to commercial alternative radio. Just running down the tracklist is exhausting. Bachmann's a good songwriter and musician with some exceptional credits-- ""New Drink for the Old Drunk"", ""Devil's Train"", ""Angelina"", and ""Andalucia"", to name a few post-Archers highlights. And downer that it is, To the Races is a beautiful record: thoughtful, patient, spacious, and sparingly embellished. So among Forfeit/Fortune's many misses, Bachmann can't help but hit a few. Neko Case guests on the synth-swamped new wave duet ""Your Control"", her cognac alto leavening Bachmann’s salt-and-vinegar baritone. And ""Cannibals"", the kind of weary, late-night, last-call rocker that could get your drunk, lazy ass moving, is also decent (even if it recycles bits of Dignity and Shame's ""Call to Love""). Here's where record reviewers usually say something about transition albums, and from a practical, economic standpoint, Forfeit/Fortune is certainly that. But considering Bachmann's always been a restless soul and every Crooked Fingers release is arguably a travelogue dispatched from the road to a radically different follow-up, transition talk would only be making lame excuses for a disappointing record.","Crooked Fingers' Eric Bachmann (Archers of Loaf) steps into the self-released arena, making his latest album of European folk, contemporary Anglo-American singer/songwriter conventions, and punk rock available in four formats via his website and also through iTunes and at two dozen hand-picked independent brick & mortar stores.

Lots of weird tics, art-school tropes, music theory indulgences-- and yet the San Francisco quartet has steadily veered closer to accessibility the past of couple years. Not that any of their albums ever logically followed each other, but in three years they've managed to custom fit Satomi Matsuzaki's screwy vocals with honest-to-god melodies (Milk Man), consistently tug at heartstrings with those melodies (The Runners Four), and then wrap that package into slick, replicable three-minute pop structures (Friend Opportunity). What more can you ask for from a rock band? Well, how about bigger guitars? With newly added guitarist/multi-instrumentalist Ed Rodriguez on board, the band recaptures the dual guitar interplay of previous albums and then some. I'm not talking about namby-pamby prog fiddling, either; there's legit Pete Townshend-style windmilling here, from the ""Rockin' Me"" bite on opener ""The Tears and Music of Love"" to the Chuck Berry seventh chords that propel the ""Fresh Born"" verses. Inevitably, Satomi gets intertwined in all this, yet never lost. There's still a melodic quality to Maggie, and it can still sound pretty and coherent at times, but the album's heartbeat is six-stringed and often distorted. Don't worry though, Deerhoof haven't pulled the plug on their pop tangent. They're just folding their canon on itself, taking the songwriting tricks they've learned during the last handful of albums and applying them to a raw rock aesthetic somewhere between Reveille and Apple O'. Deerhoof's never fully taken the plunge into electronics, but Maggie's trace amounts of techno-lalia are egregious. The album's all fretboard, no circuit board, and it feels most comfortable that way. Removed from the grid, the band's music follows a much more organic path, and it's interesting to note how seemingly scattershot bleeps and bloops on prior releases actually kept the songs relatively grounded. The album's second half best demonstrates this, its song structures vine-like, twisting and turning rather than firing off/on like a transistor. The dual guitar lines sneak up on each other in ""Numina O"" and closer ""Jagged Fruit"", and even if listeners have no clue what's coming next, they never get the feeling they're about to get sucker-punched. Satomi follows suit, projecting a very biological and terrestrial sound. Past allusions to time travel, robots, and outer space are replaced with themes of the flesh as Maggie covers ""The Tears and Music of Love"", ""Family of Others"", ""Fresh Born"", and even basketball. Also, while Satomi's voice hasn't deepened any, she certainly sounds less like a hyperglycemic/hyperactive little girl and more sage. Her vocal phrases are at their longest and most reserved here, patiently straddling the lead guitar of ""Chandelier Searchlight"" or Middle Eastern tumble of ""Buck and Judy"" for several measures before delivering a payoff hook. And though she often sings lockstep with Rodriguez and Dieterich, it's not the same hand-holding as Reveille-era Deerhoof. Satomi may sing in unison with the guitars, but she also shows the ability to establish mood. Her opening line, ""Tell me about your purple past,"" on ""My Purple Past"" is at once both curious pillow talk and hard-boiled interrogation, and the song's coy chorus only leaves you feeling less at ease. Despite these adjustments, Maggie is hardly a new animal within the Deerhoof canon. It's got all sorts of earmarks, from the token Greg Saunier Beach Boys homage ""Family of Others"" to the irritating hopscotch cadence of ""Basket Ball Get Your Groove Back"", this album's Shaggs-like ""Kidz Are So Small"" or ""Dog on the Sidewalk"". And even with all its perfectly nailed mid-tempo ballads, which filled the gooey center of the past two 'hoof releases, Maggie balks at the chance to make your knees go wobbly, keeping its allure strictly intellectual and technical rather than hot-blooded. That ethos isn't going to win a lot of hugs and kisses from fans or non-fans, but Maggie never asks for more than a firm, professional handshake, the kind of appreciation it more than deserves.","After steadily growing more accessible over the past few years, quintessential art-rock band Deerhoof have added a new guitarist and here take the songwriting tricks of their recent albums and apply them to a raw rock aesthetic.

Paperwork,volcano!,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd185e6ef95969322fae/1:1/w_160/7d8dd55b.jpg,2008-10-09 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12238-paperwork/,Leaf,"It may be easy to create an indie rock song that eschews structure for instrumental shock-and-awe, or reveals too much information in the lyrics, or pokes fun at messianic rock stars. Doing all of the above is rare, however-- as is making each stray verse or hiccup as arresting as the one before it-- but volcano! manage this on their second record, Paperwork, even better than they did on their debut, Beautiful Seizure. The mercurial three-piece may now be more cohesive, consistent, and focused, but volcano!'s unpredictability is Paperwork's biggest strength. ""'78 Oil Crisis"" starts slow with incidental noises, but it settles into a streamlined, linear melody, until the intermittent spasms of guitar become almost calming. A theremin tone anchors the grinding and coughing of ""Sweet Tooth"" as it grows more paranoid and mechanical, and later makes an insistent earworm from bent-out-of-tune guitar notes. ""Astronomer's Ballad"" is a doe-eyed Spanish-language serenade that eventually devolves into tightly controlled chaos. None is quite as stunning as the graceful and evocative ""Palimpsests"", whose well-tamed fuzz-guitar line and increased patter of drums makes With's taps-like call to ""wake up, wake up"" seem like a test of strength. The arrhythmic, stuttering beat and meandering melody of ""Performance Evaluation Shuffle"" is not the first song to send up cubicle culture, but few have sounded so suffocated and desperate. ""Africa Just Wants to Have Fun"" shows off the many modes of volcano! but flows more naturally than some of their other freewheeling material. The verse gradually builds to a brassy, step-ladder melody, which progresses to a damn-near funky staccato guitar line, as singer/songwriter Aaron With uses every bit of his elastic vocal range to lampoon Bono, most pointedly over the buzzing bass keyboards in its bridge (""Won't you make up your mind/ Are you bored or inspired... You're acting like Christ on the cross/ You look ridiculous""). As with many tracks on Paperwork, the floor drops out of ""Tension Loop"", but the percussion skitters along with impressive precision, never losing the pulse. The song emerges from gentle drums and a soft, busy guitar plucking, finally torn apart by jagged samples and electronic manipulation that go from pretty to hair-raising, while With's tempered croon grounds the song (with only minimal yodeling). ""Slow Jam"" (which is anything but) is the record's biggest gamble, a falsetto-laden ode to impotence. Lord knows why ""Kitchen Dance"" ends it all with a half-sigh, offering all the band's tricks-- bi-lingual crooning, keyboards that go from whisper to scream, double-time drums that spike the pulse-- without any of the pacing, charm, or measure of the rest of the album. But without volcano!'s occasional over-indulgence, this record would be half as interesting. Even compared to the convulsive and ambitious pop of their better-established peers like Deerhoof, volcano! are set apart by their fearlessness.","On their second full-length, mercurial three-piece volcano! are more cohesive, consistent, and focused than before, but their unpredictability is the album's greatest strength.

Futuristically Speaking...Never Be Afraid,Yo Majesty,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd57ea9e61561daa76b2/1:1/w_160/477c617b.jpg,2008-10-09 06:00:04,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12290-futuristically-speakingnever-be-afraid/,Domino,"Everything I've read about Yo Majesty makes me want to give them due respect. Tampa MCs Shunda K and Jwl. B make their names as outfront lesbians in a pop scene where an empty Maxim fantasy vessel like Katy Perry is considered sexually transgressive, and details of Yo Majesty's live shows-- Bacardi-fueled wild-out energy, rocking mics topless like LL, beats that made crunk and hip-house scissor each other-- led me to think of them as an idea whose time had come. Here was something rap had sorely lacked: kickass women who appreciate a booty clap as much as the fellas but are also completely unafraid to knock a misogynist's dick in the dirt. It's a hell of a background, which makes it that much more disappointing at how disjointed their full-length debut, Futuristically Speaking...Never Be Afraid, tends to sound. Earlier this year, Yo Majesty dropped the five-track Kryptonite Pussy EP, and in that compact context they sounded full of promise, focused, and fierce and often hilarious over an ideal retro-modern mix of Miami bass, classic electro, and modern house. Futuristically Speaking still has flashes of that excitement, thanks to a usually-high energy level and heavy production input from longtime collaborators Hard Feelings UK that does its best to keep things focused on ass-shaking beats. And Basement Jaxx chip in a bit of their time to contribute one of the best beats on the album, ""Booty Klap"", which pushes ghettotech into blown-out absurdity without actually making a patronizing joke out of it. (Bonus: One of the most enthusiastic, giddy deliveries of the word ""booty"" you'll ever want to hear.) Shunda K and Jwl. B are taut MCs, at their best shouting deceptively simple hooks that drop into motormouthed liquid flows or sleek harmonies without warning. And they've got a good handle on balancing rebellious agitation with a fixation on getting off; ""Night Riders"" has a neat bait-and-switch that turns a late-nite cruising anthem into an indictment of police brutality and poverty, and ""Hott"" sums up their approach to sex with one provocative question: ""You ever have an orgasm while you're pissed?"" But a fair amount of the record fails to play to their strengths, often times by putting them in the middle of unexpected genre exercises, and stylistic digressions like the furious, violent punk rock tirade ""Fucked Up"", downtempo funk cut ""Get Down on the Floor"", and the semi-acoustic R&B slow jam ""Buy Love"" feel so out of place it's actually kind of hard to tell that they're not actually bad songs. (That's more than you can say for the title track, where their 4/4 flows and the offbeat time signature of Sunship's production never really seem to mesh.) Disjointed as it is, there's still a solid half hour of get-wild anthems inside this uneven 55 minutes. Sticking it out to the end provides some highlights: ""Grindin' and Shakin'"" bumps like an M.I.A. production stripped down to a clattering, stomping drumline and a great titular hook, ""Club Action"" is a Detroit-style cut that features a chant of ""fuck that shit"" delivered, amusingly enough, over a strictly vestigial censor beep, and ""Take It Away"" closes things out like an unusually tight version of JJ Fad tweaked for the E'd up post-Missy generation. If you took the best half of Futuristically Speaking and appended it to Kryptonite Pussy, you'd have a damn good hour-long party record, and getting over a dozen hot tracks from Yo Majesty within a year is proof enough that there's plenty of weight to their potential.","Tampa MCs Shunda K and Jwl.

Sweaty Magic,Rafter,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd3bc0084474cd0c2c60/1:1/w_160/2dfc1f9c.jpg,2008-10-09 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12267-sweaty-magic/,Asthmatic Kitty,"If it weren't for Rafter Roberts' close personal ties to Asthmatic Kitty's artists (he's engineered albums for Sufjan Stevens and Castanets), he'd probably be an odd fit on the imprint. His noise-inflected collage-pop is a far cry from the sad-eyed new folk of many of his labelmates. Then again, the producer/jingle maker/experimenter seems so unselfconscious, so committed to the notion of music-as-fun, he could probably fit in almost anywhere. His songs-- brief, genre-defiant explosions wrapped in tight melodies-- reflect a similar feeling of brazen enjoyment and abandon. On this year's Sex Death Cassette, Rafter used an anything-goes approach to burn through material. Stirring together Caribbean, funk, and classic indie rock elements together at a breakneck pace, its 19 tracks clocked in at just 35 minutes. Sex Death Cassette was a blast, and has been rightly commended for injecting some lightheartedness into indie rock. But at such high velocities, it was hard to get a grasp of Rafter the artist, whether there was more to him than captivatingly produced fun-pop. His Sweaty Magic EP-- a much more groove-focused affair than Cassette-- doesn't clear any of that up. He's not interested in revealing more of himself. Rafter simply wants you to boogie. And have sex. And on a placeholder EP, that's okay by me. So Sweaty Magic takes its cues from Beck in Midnite Vultures mode, Chromeo, and other campy, libidinous dance acts, and is purely a blithe (and unabashed) party record. It lacks any consistent narrative thread; its songs jut into one another at random, and its lyrics (e.g. ""Salt""'s vague, repeated instruction to ""Put some salt on it."" Um, on what?) are often unclear. It's also kind of awesome. Part of what makes the record work is Rafter's commitment to form-- Sweaty Magic rarely veers from its wacky, Zapp & Roger-meets-Prince vibe. Songs ooze with sleazy sensuality: ""Sassy"" flips a Quincy Jones-produced Michael Jackson number inside out, putting distorted synths, boom-bap drums, and heavy bass upfront to let its funky guitars do the dirty talking. On ""Sweat"", Rafter sets his clean vocal harmonies atop cowbell percussion and a G-Funk era beat for hilarious, smoothed-out effect. ""Magic"", meanwhile, aims directly for the club. Its clattering beats and madcap synths ride a propulsive rhythm that fulfills his goal of shameless danceability. At the core of these retro-inspired dance tracks, though, is devotion to melody and structure. This is why Rafter can get away with what some might call cheesiness. He's jettisoned the lo-fi patches of fuzz that ran throughout Cassette, and this EP is cleaner and sharper because of it. Even on ""Noise"", the album's most atonal track, he complements the jagged verses with tunefulness-- a catchy guitar riff swoops in just before things become grating. ""Juicy"", the closest thing to a ballad, also showcases Rafter's capable production. Built above an acoustic guitar loop, squelching keys, and vocoder sections, the song remains crisp and potent despite its divergent instrumentation. Because of its multifarious song types-- leftfield club thumpers, futuristic sex ditties, and funky space jams-- some will contend that Sweaty Magic lacks cohesion, that it's too ADD to be listenable, but I would argue that is precisely Rafter's point. Like Gregg Gillis' Girl Talk project, Rafter here is the opposite of a serious artist, aiming only to create something that is immediate and sexy, and Sweaty Magic's erratic quality simply mirrors our own pop-drenched culture of endless options.","Taking cues from Beck in Midnite Vultures mode, Chromeo, and other campy, libidinous dance acts, Rafter's latest is an unabashed party record.

Such Fun,Annuals,by: Eric Harvey,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd625e6ef95969323057/1:1/w_160/ecc4e7ff.jpg,2008-10-09 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12300-such-fun/,Canvasback,"Yes, that's a Bob Ross painting functioning as the cover art for Annuals' second album Such Fun, their first full-length for Sony/Columbia boutique Canvasback. The man whose kitschy celebrity comes from the serenity of his voice and his homespun DIY inclinations (first-page YouTube results for Ross are mostly parodies, which is sort of sad). These aren't exactly the initial associations I'd want people making at the Best Buy new music endcap, but fortunately for Annuals and their listeners, Such Fun is nearly the opposite of serene populism. As on the moderately more enjoyable Be He Me, Adam Baker and his band are hellbent on disorienting their listeners, through nailing erratic bouts of punk and prog onto self-pitying balladry and slack-jawed country, and inflating songs to oft-ridiculous sizes before returning them to their original states. For the cover art, maybe an off-his-meds folk collage artist might have been more true-to-form. Baker co-produced Fun with Jacquire King, most known for his skill in wrangling iconoclastic rural eccentrics like Tom Waits and Isaac Brock, and making them sound full and modern while still anxious and/or nostalgic. King also helmed Kings of Leon's most recent effort, though, and while there are vague echoes of Brock in Baker's mercurial emotions on Fun, bigness and a borderline gimmicky connection to rurality remain the overriding aesthetics. ""Hot Night Hounds"" is a perfect example: An opening jittery piano figure is augmented ad infinitum as the two keep tacking shit onto it like untrained carpenters making a mansion out of a motor home. What starts as The Soft Bulletin somehow ends as Faith No More, and one of the song's recommendable traits is that it holds together without collapsing. That's the Annuals' schtick of course, and it would be unfair to expect them to suddenly switch gears, even for an ostensibly larger audience. Opening track ""Confessor"" recalls earlier single ""Dry Clothes"", and ""Springtime"" and ""Hardwood Floor"" come directly from the band's post-Funeral blueprint: calmness turning into a tempest and coming back again, one of Baker's vocal halves screaming at the peaceful one, old-timey instrumentation. ""Floor"" blooms into the sort of vocabled ethnic chant the band is enamored of, and ""Springtime"" recalls an even more bombastic update of Fleetwood Mac's ""Tusk"", which isn't a bad thing. While Fun is far from a collection of happy little trees created with a magic putty knife, the element of surprise that rendered Be He Me so invigorating has been repurposed and lessened. But there are other moves on Fun that show the band directing its plentiful energy in a different, intriguing direction. ""Down the Mountain"" merges hyperactive hillbilly (complete with fiddles and ambient country sound effects) with a chorus aimed at the mall-emo contingent, to which Baker's youthful timbre is perfectly suited. Dark, chugging guitars surround a howled question more petulant than plaintive: ""How could you take my only answer?!"" A bit later, ""Talking"" takes ""Mountain"" to one extreme-- it's a densely produced, riff-laden pop-punk song, within which the stately elements (soaring guitars, proclamatory brass) manage to fit.  Both herald a new direction, but not too far of a stretch: After all, My Chemical Romance and Arcade Fire have much more in common than a vocal contingent of indie bluebloods would like to admit. And that's where Annuals find themselves now: In that liminal stage between online indiedom, where fans assume they've organically nurtured bands and pushed them out into the world, and the equally precarious niche-based realm of a major's experimental micro-label. Such Fun ends with ""Wake"", perhaps the prettiest and most focused song on the album, with a well-earned and satisfying crescendo at the close. ""Wake"" is one of many indications that Annuals might well have it within themselves (though maybe in spite of themselves) to rein it in a notch and reach for that ever-more elusive monocultural consensus moment, one that might occasion their relocation from Canvasback's pay-weekly condo into more permanent housing. For the time being, though, they'll make do bunking with Manchester Orchestra.","Nailing erratic bouts of punk and prog onto self-pitying balladry and slack-jawed country, Annuals follow their blog-rock debut with another LP of the same.

This Is It and I Am It and You Are It and So Is That and He Is It and She Is It and It Is It and That Is That,Marnie Stern,by: Mike Powell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd40eb335119a49ece35/1:1/w_160/2211a9f2.jpg,2008-10-09 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12272-this-is-it-and-i-am-it-and-you-are-it-and-so-is-that-and-he-is-it-and-she-is-it-and-it-is-it-and-that-is-that/,Kill Rock Stars,"Marnie Stern can't sleep. Not well and not often, at least. That's what she says. I didn't learn of her insomnia for months after In Advance of the Broken Arm was released last February. But in retrospect, it made sense: When I first heard her music, I couldn't sleep either. In Advance opened with an eight-note guitar figure, cycled 32 times in half a minute-- about eight and a half notes a second. A brutal, highly repetitive pop song ensued. Marnie shrieked and trembled. Her rhythm section (Hella's Zach Hill) egged her on-- she juggled fire; he hosed her with gasoline to cool her off. She made hysteria sound hypnotic. What set her apart, though, wasn't showmanship, or even hooks-- it was her vulnerability. In a scene of bands that rely on technical prowess to sway fans-- or, if that doesn't work, beating the collective ass into ecstasy with noise-- Marnie Stern appealed to the heart. Her music didn't just aim to impress, but to move. For a couple of weeks, I thought of her as an emotive technician, but it became clear she was something else: A dizzy heir to Sleater-Kinney, or Helium-- arty, feminine guitar-rock that infiltrated Guyville without a mission statement. Her second album's title, This Is It and I Am It and You Are It and So Is That and He Is It and She Is It and It Is It a**nd That Is That isn't one you have to read more than once. But it sums Stern up. It's obsessive and choppy. It's playful. It's gleefully oblivious of when to shut up. But its obliviousness is crucial-- the music, like the title (a reference to the religious philosopher Alan Watts), implies a loop or a meditative void. She still strikes Van Halen and AC/DC poses. Her guitar parts still crisscross and crosshatch, her vocals are still shrill, and both are overdubbed relentlessly. Hill still implies a groove without sparing his kit any violence, but not enough to actually sound like he's grooving, which would be anathema to music this wired. As a group, though, there's a new sense of self-assuredness. She's learned when to flex and glint, and when to lean in the cut. ""The Crippled Jazzer"", ""The Package is Wrapped,"" and the album-closing ""The Devil Is in the Details"" get so comfortable they break into a strut-- a far cry from In Advance. In a way, that's reassuring-- while energy is essential to her music, it's not the only force at work. It'd be a shame to see her subsist solely on hammer-ons. But learning to relax and record in a real studio-- as opposed to her bedroom-- hasn't compromised Stern's singular talent: to make the work of one sound like the joy of many. In Advance was an album primarily about how hard Stern had to push herself to make it. The lines read like they were collaged from self-help, pop-Buddhism, and sports memoir. She was a cheerleader possessed. The newfound musical openness on This Is It is mirrored in lyrics that seem to actually account for people other than herself. ""What I need now is a good feeling to let me know""-- that's a promise. ""I'm hoping it's true/ I'm hoping for you, you, you""-- that's a declaration. By the time the album reaches ""The Devil Is in the Details"", it's hard to imagine Stern as someone who quit her job to sweat over a portastudio in the middle of the night. ""The devil is in the details if you are ready,"" she challenges. She ends the album on a precipice, which, I guess, is how she should-- with miles to go before we sleep.","The laborious title to Marnie Stern's new album weirdly suits her-- like her and her music, it's obsessive, playful, and choppy, and it captures the single-mindedness of this self-taught guitar virtuoso.

Outside Our Gates,Liz Durrett,by: Stephen M.

First, the insistent and decreasingly newsworthy declaration that she is the niece of Athens eccentric Vic Chesnutt, who lent his homespun production and tissue-paper voice to her first two albums. Second, the constant comparison to other Southern female singer-songwriters like Athens' Madeline, Memphis' Megan Reilly, New Orleans' Blair, and the grandmother of them all, Cat Power. Like them, Durrett sings in a dusky voice that does gothic evocation extremely well but doesn't allow for much variety of expression, which has kept her tempos slow and her songs muted. On her third album, Outside Our Gates, Durrett takes tentative steps toward the spotlight, challenging herself to quit her wallflower ways. If the main criticism of her previous albums was that they sounded pulseless-- all low-key numbers and pretty-but-aloof vocals-- then her new producer Eric Bachmann, from Crooked Fingers and Archers of Loaf, shakes things up a bit, bolstering her dark songs with strings and occasionally a full band to create an airy and unpredictable sound that gently prods Durrett out of her comfort zone. Stand-out ""Wild As Them"" builds on a repeating riff bolstered by a crunchy electric guitar and a counterrhythm courtesy of Chesnutt's blaring omnichord. Eerie, ambient percussion clatters in the background of ""All of Them All"" and ""Always Sign"", the latter sounding like a gussied-up Tom Waits track.* Outside Our Gates*' titular pronoun is intentional: This is not a loner's record, but a community's collection of songs. Appropriately, the credits read like a who's-who of the Athens scene. Tin Cup Prophette's Amanda Kapousouz lends expressionist strings, while Ham1 and former members of Man or Astro-Man? and Olivia Tremor Control (hey, who isn't a former member of Olivia Tremor Control?) back Durrett, adding spark and texture to these songs. The result is Durrett's liveliest and rangiest record to date, as purposeful as her previous efforts but somehow more surefooted and traipsing. Which brings us back to Thing Two: Slowly but surely, Durrett is outgrowing all of those comparisons, developing her own particular nuances, mannerisms, and tics. Her vocals define these songs, pushing ""All of Them All"" along its subtle but certain crescendo and corralling all the glowering distortion on ""Not for a Girl"". Uncle Vic harmonizes softly with her on the lush, patient ""We Build Bridges"", their voices blending so naturally and beautifully that she might have asked him to sing regardless of any family connection. She closes with the nearly a cappella ""The Sea a Dream"", on which she layers her vocals into a choir of Lizes. Outside Our Gates may be her most satisfying album to date, but more crucially, despite the crowd of guests, it's definitely the most hers.","On her third album, Durrett takes tentative steps toward the spotlight, distinguishing herself from her female Southern singer-songwriter peers by developing her own particular nuances, mannerisms, and tics.

Life Like,The Rosebuds,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd605e6ef95969323052/1:1/w_160/51dbe04b.jpg,2008-10-08 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12298-life-like/,Merge,"The Rosebuds exude quality. Not that everything the North Carolina band has done has been great, but the potential has always been there. From their auspicious debut The Rosebuds Make Out to its bittersweet follow-up Birds Make Good Neighbors and last year's synth-heavy but hardly frilly Night of the Furies, there have been glimmers of greatness in each of the group's three albums, a rapidly expanding catalog that's established the Rosebuds as Merge's most slept-on act since the shockingly overlooked Spent. The Rosebuds' husband-and-wife team of Ivan Howard and Kelly Crisp have credited their progress to a learn-as-you-go-along approach, rarely resting lest all that inspiration go to waste. In fact, Life Like, the band's fourth album of original material in five years, reportedly evolved during what was meant to be a break, self-imposed downtime that found the duo doing what they do best: namely, writing more songs, quickly accumulating enough tracks for another album. One advantage of the quick turn around is that as different as the records sometimes are, you can still hear the connections bridging one to the next. In the case of Life Like (which is, predictably, good stuff, if not necessarily always the band at its greatest), you can still clearly hear echoes of the minor-key synths that drove Night of the Furies. But you can also hear the group's guitar-driven indie rock roots, as well as the mix of mood and whimsy that made Birds Make Good Neighbors feel so special. Most of all, these tracks sound best in their native contexts: The opening title track could pass for yet more anonymously atmospheric post-punk, at least until it comes on during a late-night drive. Likewise ""Cape Fear"" could be just another indie-dance track, with its pulsing off-beat hi-hats and simple driving bass line, especially in context with Furies, but the mass of instruments and voices buried in the mix makes it hard to peg definitively as either exultant or mournful, even though it touches on both of those disparate emotional tones. ""Border Guards"" is no less mysterious but definitely easier to pin down-- it's as ghostly new wave á la the Church, albeit nowhere near as portentous (or at least only passively so) thanks to Howard's hushed vocals. It's hard to know where the noirish square-dance of ""Bow to the Middle"" fits into this amorphousness, but it makes self-contained sense nonetheless, just as much as the sentimental paean to road kill ""Nice Fox"" walks a tightrope between literalness and metaphor to capture some existential truth about the ineffable transience of life. The gauzy Church-isms come to the fore again with ""Another Way In"" and ""Concordia Military Club"", before the group reverts to whistle-adorned whimsy with the instrumental ""Hello Darling"", which also includes snippets of a record Howard's grandfather Bobby D. made for his wife during World War II (the record is dedicated to his memory, as well as to Crisp's Grandma Becky). Following that sweet palate cleanser, the reverb-draped ""Black Hole"" and the deceptively sprightly ""In the Backyard"" (about catching a preacher trying to dig his way to the underworld in the middle of the night) feel like solid if slightly perplexing afterthoughts. The impression is that, were the album tracks all shuffled up and presented in a totally different order, one might easily come away from Life Like with a completely different take or reaction. Indeed, it's an album with its feet on the ground and its head in the clouds, and listening to it is a lot like waiting contentedly in a kind of musical purgatory, happy to be there but still wondering what comes next. It's more of an ellipses pointing you to album number five, but compared to so many other backwards looking records, that's still a pretty great feeling.","On their fourth album in five years, North Carolina's the Rosebuds bundle together all the good things that have made them great in the past.

U.S. EZ,Sic Alps,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd325e6ef95969322fea/1:1/w_160/1fe36333.jpg,2008-10-08 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12263-us-ez/,Siltbreeze,"There's been such an embarrassment of riches coming from the lo-fi garage rock/psych duo of Mike Donovan and Matthew Hartman that I can barely bring myself to finish reviews on time. It's that overwhelming. Though it's almost a cosmic convergence that Sic Alps have landed on the Siltbreeze label for their latest LP, U.S. EZ, they stand a step or two apart from their more hotly-tipped peers, as they recall bands from much further back (past the early 1990s, even!). Their primitive riffery belies hours of mining for dusty psychedelic nuggets while their simple and strange recording style calls back to the earliest rock'n'roll, as does the direct, innocent spirit found in many of these songs. Still, this is new territory for the band. Sludgy and spare as they may be, Sic Alps do know how to write pop songs, and U.S. EZ is, surprisingly, almost nothing but. But their pop songs, despite their simplicity, still keep you off balance and snap you out of passive listening, as with the false ending in ""Massive Place"" or the bit of xylophone in the closer ""Quai Des Orfevres"". Some deconstructive impulses remain, like the few choice blasts of static clamoring for space in the languid instrumental ""Bric Jaz"", but these harsher moments are smuggled more inconspicuously into the songs. The approachability found here, when mixed with the scruffy recording ethic, makes the songs feel instantly familiar, yet still somehow alien. ""Sing Song Waitress"" is a sweet and longing tune that's nonetheless thrown askew by high-register backing vocals that warble like the sound of children crying through neighboring floorboards. A similar backing is found elsewhere in the two-chord stomp of ""Mater"", which ends with abrupt self-narration from singer/guitarist Mike Donovan. Even the fruity, Beatles-like shuffle of ""Gelly Roll Gum Drop"" sounds just a little left of center somehow. Without a doubt, U.S. EZ is a far more structured and melodic record, though its few more experimental tracks-- ""Put the Puss to Bed"" or the unexpected pummel and howl of ""N##JJ""-- pale in comparison to the ones that made A Long Way Around to a Shortcut so wonderfully unpredictable. Granted, that was a singles collection, so of course it's more diverse. But here, amidst the nods to a noisier past and the occasional dip into intoxicated broken blues (""Clubbing for $$"", ""CO/CA""), U.S. EZ breaks through with tracks like ""Everywhere, There"", which takes woozy primitive pop and transforms it into something simultaneously fragile and coarse and then, suddenly, sublime.","It seemed inevitable that these lo-fi garage rockers, who bury impressive melodies under layers of noise, would wind up with something on Siltbreeze. Their first album for the label does not disappoint.

OH (ohio),Lambchop,by: William Bowers,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd675e6ef9596932305d/1:1/w_160/b8af4f30.jpg,2008-10-08 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12304-oh-ohio/,City Slang,"Let's see: A release date one month before the presidential showdown, an album named after the electoral-vote caboodle that Diebold ""delivered"" to Bush in 2004, a cover-art painting called ""New Orleans Police Beating"", and a concluding rendition of a 1970 jam rhyming ""gasoline's in short supply"" with ""the rising cost of getting by"": This Nashville collective has finally up and gone politico, right? Naw, c'mon: Frontman Kurt Wagner would never be so gauche as to risk such a banal, linear message. He leaves his audiences to discern (or project) trails and patterns among the far-flung crumbs of his intentions. The release date probably has more to do with September 19 than November 4 (or September 11, for that matter), since a featured track is ""National Talk Like a Pirate Day"", and besides, the majority of Lambchop platters register as autumnal-to-wintry. The artwork was chosen to provide synergistic exposure to Wagner's grad-school mentor Michael Peed, and anyway, its naked lovers (like Wagner's lyrical personae) are choosing the balm of their mutual absorption over engagement with the brutal complications outside. OH knows that the bedroom, and one's interior landscape, provide the true battleground states. As for covering Don Williams' dopey ""I Believe In You""-- well, Wagner has always loved that kind of cool-less country, and stylistically, OH is kind of a Lambchop Legacy Revue, revisiting sounds from every long-player in their discography except for the symphonic lounge stylings of that particularly heralded one from the year 2000, the one whose critical static-cling Wagner griped about at the conclusion of his last album. So no wonder this acutely variegated disc ends with an almost too-lackadaisical take on a tune dating back to a certain unpopular administration: As his listeners suffer through the last days of Bush, Wagner's still got Nixon fatigue. The man's vocals never fail to pique. Perhaps more than ever before Wagner belts here as if accompanying-- and equaling-- a master with either a distinct mode or a legendary range. You know, like, in my brains, I'm a dead ringer for Chet Baker while a Chet Baker album is also playing, but solo, my mimicky breathmatazz comes about as close to Chetness as Wagner does to sirs Orbison, Como, Redding, and Kristofferson, from whom he seems to be taking enunciatory, respiratory, and time-management cues. He mostly sells it, though, and one dreams of being able to witness some sort of cross-sectioned live-action sonogram of his upper body, with a karaoke ball revealing from where in his gut, gullet, or jowls he is making those unconventionally expressive noises: the deep whispers, wobbly sermons, and bothered whines, often within a single verse. Lyrically, Wagner's found ways to self-deprecate and hold forth about the failure of utterance without handing critics hammers with which to bonk him. (Recent offerings almost always contained at least one track so self-consciously frustrated with articulation that it begged the question, ""Then dude, why not stop yammering?"") Longtime fans might even find him curiously sober, profanity-free, and un-ornery; it's not difficult to imagine Wagner's former fussbudget selves being embarrassed by some of this album's almost cheerful pleas of devotion. Witnessing the tension between Lambchop's linguistic splatter-painting and the deliberateness of the musicianship is, as always, a blast. Wagner sort of punk'd producers Roger Moutenot and Mark Nevers into recording rival drafts of the album, and then he chose his favorites. Um, Moutenot kills it: His tracks capture and emphasize every dynamic of the performances. The guitars are slapped and scraped, but retain their fluidity. The drums and keys serve as atmospheric lectures for Daniel Lanois on how to occasionally turn some levels down, while ""Popeye""'s coda is pure kinetic-but-dour sophistication, making me wish that Lambchop would tutor Jeff Tweedy not only on penning panoramic miniatures, but on when and why to art-rock responsibly. ""Popeye"" also has me thinking that Wagner is contemporary music's Robert Altman, from his comfort with starless ensemblery to his disinterest in conventional ""impact."" Each new Lambchop record glacially redefines the maturity of the previous one, but Wagner's the rare cult leader unpreoccupied with recruitment, and I could see folks being nonplussed by an act for which meandering is the point, and who essentially make no-stakes high art. (Plus, penultimate cut ""Close Up and Personal"" may tragically be the first to succumb to the Lambchop paradox-- I love me some dissonance, but that arrangement is just too pretty for Wagner's clipped honk.) Consider OH the ""most Lambchop"" of Lambchop releases, as it swings through almost every tone in the band's history of influence-collisions, arriving at a soul of its own.","Stylistically, the venerable Nashville band's OH (ohio) is kind of a Lambchop Legacy Revue, revisiting sounds from every long-player in its discography except for the symphonic lounge stylings of their 2000 breakthrough Nixon.

Another World EP,Antony and the Johnsons,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd5dabf31b7dc7155f23/1:1/w_160/973e6cdd.jpg,2008-10-08 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12295-another-world-ep/,Secretly Canadian,"At first, Antony and the Johnsons' follow-up to 2005's sublime I Am a Bird Now seems cut from the same cloth as that Mercury Prize-winning breakthrough. Bird's cover reveled in arty downtown grotesquerie with a portrait of Warhol muse Candy Darling on her deathbed. Another World's cover features another left-field theatrical legend, the butoh dancer Kazuo Ohno. Both images handily allude to the morbid singer's dramatic cabaret and gender fluidity. Furthering the correspondence, both albums open with piano-driven prayers for death, which, in Antony's parlance, can be interpreted as references to transformation more than physical demise. On Bird, it was ""Hope There's Someone"", where the identity-obsessed singer feared neither life nor death, but ""the middle place/ Between light and nowhere."" On Another World, it's the title track, which finds him similarly stranded in transition-- ""I need another world/ This one's nearly gone""-- while preemptively missing the plants, animals, and people of the world he's straining to escape. In other words, it's metamorphosis he both craves and fears, and both songs are perfectly poised between those two emotions. ""Hope There's Someone"" climaxed with a churning piano that implied the moment of passage, but ""Another World"" has no such epiphany. The tentative melody tiptoes behind distant feedback, never climaxing and never resolving. This is important because it represents the major difference between Bird and Another World-- on the former, Antony shook the rafters with his multi-tiered voice at regular intervals, but here he's more restrained. ""Shake that bird right out of me,"" he murmurs on ""Shake that Devil"", clipping his own wings to find out what he can do at ground level, down here with the rest of us. At first, Another World sounds like a handful of what would have been deep cuts on Bird, and you might miss the flashy crescendos. But it only takes a few spins to get over that and discover these remarkable songs for what they are. Antony has been compared to Arthur Russell for his downtown affiliations and the elaborate fragility of his voice. Here, he really earns that comparison, not just echoing Russell's Another Thought with the EP's title, but with the eclectic set pieces it contains. I Am a Bird Now spanned gospel, doo-wop, and R&B, but Antony's vocal histrionics often overshadowed genre specificity; Bird sounds downright monolithic compared to Another World's five concise songs. Their bare-bones arrangements put the emphasis right where it should be-- on Antony's lush, quavering voice, which can now keep apace without hysterics-- and profit from an ambiguity that fits his mercurial persona to a T. Anyone who thinks Antony's devoid of humor should consider to lyrics like ""Poor me/ Little rivers from my hands pool at the bottom of the stairs."" That self-skewering yet heartfelt line launches ""Crackagen"", and implies a streak of self-awareness. With just a ""poor me"" at the beginning, the personal mythology Antony stages amid sustain-heavy piano and drawling strings (there are cities in his eyes; rainwater in his father's) gains an arch undertone to its stirring melodrama. ""Shake that Devil"" is a terrific hybrid of Xiu Xiu-style drone-pop, revival-tent gospel, and free-jazz horn skronk-- the tautest, leanest song in Antony's catalog. Its metaphysical barnyard lyrics could easily fit on a Joanna Newsom record; it essentially amounts to a casting out of malevolent spirits-- a secular exorcism that often seems to be Antony's primary motivation for making music. Antony writes songs for the sake of escaping, either personally or by proxy, from whatever image of him they capture. Forget Arthur Russell for a sec: He's half Scott Walker, half Harry Houdini. On the halting ballad ""Sing for Me"", he builds a garden wall only to vanish over it, and on the uplifting madrigal ""Hope Mountain"", the titular peak is a nest for ""scores of soaring eagles,"" making it a mere launching pad for things that leave, things that change. This EP is a teaser for a forthcoming full-length, which will surely give us yet another incarnation of Antony. Even now, this new record represents an afterimage or whatever trace of himself Antony could capture while rifling through different guises. But we all know a little something about chasing that ideal version of ourselves, and Antony's persistence in the face of futility makes it a joy to run by his side.","At first, this five-song EP sounds like a handful of deep cuts from Antony Hegarty's breakout LP I Am a Bird Now, but repeat listens quickly reveal a more varied and restrained effort whose bare-bones arrangements put the emphasis right where it should be-- on Antony's lush, quavering voice.

Pull the Pin,Stereophonics,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd2a5e6ef95969322fd9/1:1/w_160/8da6d7c3.jpg,2008-10-07 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12255-pull-the-pin/,V2V2,"Given their track record, you'd figure that merely acknowledging the existence of a new Stereophonics album would just be piling on, but despite what you may have heard, we don't go actively searching for things to hate on-- there's hardly enough time in the day to cover all the good shit out there. I mean, who wouldn't want Pull the Pin to end up being a surprising career renaissance, and not, say, a phenomenally forgettable record so steeped in post-grunge that it's almost impossible to believe it came from Britain, in 2008? I think that score up there can tell you how it turned out. In retrospect, it looks like these guys cast their lot with ""Mr. Writer"", a laughably impotent revenge fantasy that projected their own narrow-mindedness on the critics that ""shoot them down."" It set up an us vs. them dichotomy that's allowed the band to retreat to pleasing the diehards and somehow still stick it to scribes: no matter how many times you listen to Pull the Pin, you're still rendered nearly incapable of describing what you just heard. The only variations are laudable only for at least feigning variation-- if Built To Spill's There's Nothing Wrong With Love-ending pisstake was 300% longer and somehow half as sincere, it would be ""Bright Red Star"". ""Daisy Lane"" keeps you up to speed on recent knife violence in England (it's bad), but in doing so, picks at the same threadbare melody line for the song's entirety-- one of the oldest tricks in the Stereophonics book. By the end, you're so sapped for something memorable, that you might be willing to laud the sawtoothed guitar tone that bristles ""I Could Lose Ya"". That's what it comes down to-- an effect featured on literally hundreds of better albums is the star of the show. Awful cover art and album title aside, Pull the Pin is rock in the platonic sense, cranking out distorted riffs and power chords while Kelly Jones' vox box stays caked with ashtray residue amidst song structure having the almost mesmerizing predictability of NASCAR. But it's also rock in a different sort of platonic way, as in platonic friend-- no sex, no spark.  Pull the Pin might be going for the uncluttered ""production"" of older Rick Rubin, but instead it cops the sterility of newer Rick Rubin, each song lumbering on a chassis of waterlogged tempo and Jones' wooden melodies, begging for just about anything to grab you. Though strings and other electronics were shelved because they're, duh, not rock, Pull the Pin rarely sounds like the result of four guys jamming out in a room. At least Language. Sex. Violence. Other? had some risible attempts at shoegazer and new wave, along with risibly confrontational lyrics. What you manage to catch here is typically lazy Jones quotes about grim alcohol abuse (the self-explanatory ""Bank Holiday Monday"") and conciliatory women (""I Could Lose Ya""). The former is certainly a charmer-- ""The mind can be a playground if you use it /She could go down on me in a theatre."" And once the dirt-dry blooze of ""Soldiers Make Good Targets"" begins, you half-expect him to start singing about a meatplow instead of his non-starter complaints about war (it's bad). Worse yet, ""It Means Nothing"", which attempts nothing short of being a Lee Greenwood anthem for London's 7/7 bombings, just makes you feel like an asshole for only remembering lines like ""If the bomb goes off again/ And my brain around the train/ And I hope that I'm with you/ 'Cause I wouldn't know what to do"" and ""You can find yourself a god/ Believe in which one you want/ 'Cause they love you all the same/ They just go by different names.""  Forget the title of Pull the Pin-- it's been sex, violence, and (mostly) other since J.E.E.P.'s mid-career pit stop into lightheartedness, and at this point, Jones sounds like someone who's just gonna keep crankin' 'em out until he's able to franchise a Hooters.","We'd love to say that the latest album from this plodding band, out last year in the UK and just now being released stateside, is a surprising career renaissance.

Moonwink,The Spinto Band,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd4deb335119a49ece56/1:1/w_160/3fab0fe2.jpg,2008-10-07 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12281-moonwink/,Park the Van,"Big, splashy numbers don't always add up. Early reviews of the Spinto Band's latest album, Moonwink, have noted with some surprise that it's technically the eighth (or, depending whose count you believe, ninth) full-length from the youthful Delaware sextet. All prior releases, though, appeared on the band's own Spintonic-- at least until their aptly titled 2005 Bar/None debut, Nice and Nicely Done, later reissued overseas by Virgin UK. That makes Moonwink a classic sophomore slump, bursting with melody but overorchestrated and overthought. Neurotic, hook-packed songs like ""Trust vs. Mistrust"" and ""Crack the Whip"" made Nice and Nicely Done sound like the Spinto Band could become the Weezer of the new wave revival, splitting the difference between Pavement's Brighten the Corners and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah. The ringing guitars and Arcade Fire-sized arrangement of Nice and Nicely Done highlight ""Oh Mandy"" find a quirkier successor in solid Moonwink single ""Summer Grof"", a handclapping, punning ditty the band describes as ""a vague tribute to the great comedienne Janeane Garofalo."" We don't know who Spinto Band's Mandy was, either, but this song's willful obscurity is typical of an album that's often too clever by half. As if to compensate for weaker songs, Moonwink lets the Spinto Band indulge their instinct toward lavishness. ""The Carnival"" has the (dizzying) merry-go-round melodies its title implies, and it's one of the more restrained examples of the album's flightly falsetto harmonies, whoa-oh melismas, and careening strings and horns. Castanet-clicking opener ""Later On"" and synth-led ""Vivian, Don't"" have some whimsical charm, but by the time Spinto Band slow down for ""They All Laughed"", it's as if Humpty Dumpty fell off the Wall of Sound. Singer/guitarist Nick Krill's high, anxious voice starts to grate between the la-las and nice guitar rave-up of ""The Cat's Pajamas"", but it's his quieter colleague, singer/bassist Thomas Hughes, who sounds like he's auditioning to be the model of a modern major general on ""Needlepoint"", one of a few highly theatrical songs here relating to attire. Moonwink wouldn't be so disappointing if Nice and Nicely Done hadn't been unusually promising. The Spinto Band even have a stirring live show. Their latest record has more instruments and lyrical or melodic turns than hooks to hold onto, but its problem is more like an excess of ideas than a lack of them. ""If I don't get your letter then I'll know you're in jail,"" Krill assures on glockenspiel-chimer ""The Black Flag""; it's as overflowing as its neighbors but-- with its ""Revolution""-esque guitar bursts and a chorus that hammers its way into your head-- a hopeful finale. Don't know much about algebra, but I hear the third time's the charm.","Bursting with melody but overorchestrated and overthought, Deleware's the Spinto Band have ideas and hooks in spades.

Neptune With Fire,Ancestors,by: Robbie Mackey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd2613d197565213b4a1/1:1/w_160/6133353e.jpg,2008-10-07 06:00:03,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12252-neptune-with-fire/,Tee Pee,"First, there's the straightforward thickness of Kyuss disciples Corrosion of Conformity. The resin-sopped riffs of Pepper Keenan's oft-overlooked stoner rock troupe seem to offer the blueprint for much of the opening track on Ancestors' Neptune With Fire. Second, there's the suffocatingly slow inertia of Sleep. The doom progeny's stillness informs the rest of this L.A. five-piece's debut, and Arik Roper, the psych-artist who designed Sleep's Dopesmoker's album art, designed the visuals for Neptune. And then, when you get away from the backbone, there's Pink Floyd and maybe even Hawkwind here as well. But it's those two immediately perceptible reference points that make for an interesting 1990s-informed take on 70s hard psyche, early doom, and art rock. The album consists of just two songs-- ""Orcus' Avarice"" is over 16 minutes, the title track is more than 20-- and both serve as launching pads for extended jams. But the soloing is supported by some serious riffs. ""Orcus' Avarice"" evokes CoC, with an urgency that brings to mind ""Heaven's Not Overflowing"" and a pace reminiscent of ""Albatross"". It's the kind of lumbering meganess that easily turns on a dime. So by the time the drums have reeled in, and the guitars ascend into outer-space, it's hard to recall the tumult that came only moments before. Ancestors, able to do more than whip up a simple fervor, spend a good six minutes inspecting the same guitar scale and a slippery blues bassline that gradually builds to climax, like creatine Pink Floyd. But the big coup here-- the game-changer, really-- is the presence of an organ. It noodles underneath the ""Orcus"" jam politely, offering texture to an otherwise head-first pound, and recasts the second, title track as a carnival-like bruiser. The wobbly notes swing upward and stall on the final intro chord of ""Neptune With Fire"", as thunder clouds descend and colossal guitars rush in. The second half of the track, with its reliance on monotone Ozzy burring, loses itself momentarily in the sort of weak revivalism that's the order of the day. But the ship rights itself over a crushing ritardando. Steel strings lurch to a crawling halt, the organ throbs, and after a lengthy bass workout, a tremolo-picked guitar sounds in the distance, slowly dragging the riffs back into the fray with post-rock's shit-just-got-real soberness. Sure, Ancestors' approach can be slightly formulaic. Groundwork is laid with a teeth-rattling riff, decibels drop for a bass exposition and an interstellar jam sesh, which then builds back out into a grinding roar. But it works well, and makes the scant divergences all the more rewarding. Take for instance, the dusty guitar twang that emerges from the midsection of ""Neptune"", where Earth's brutal blues pacing and a tree nymph female vocalist make for a witchy Morricone ambiance. It's the sort of staggering moment that makes it easy to come to Neptune With Fire for the mammoth riffs, but stay for the stretches when Ancestors take ""far out"" even further.","Combining the straightforward thickness of Corrosion of Conformity with the spaciness of Hawkwind, this L.A. five-piece shows much promise on their debut full-length.

Break Up the Concrete,The Pretenders,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd5cabf31b7dc7155f1f/1:1/w_160/5301a315.jpg,2008-10-07 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12294-break-up-the-concrete/,Shangri-La Music,"As an American ex-pat living among London punks in the late 1970s, Akron native Chrissie Hynde wanted desperately to start her own band and be part of the scene, even if the scene was changing rapidly. She and three guys formed the Pretenders and released their first album in 1980. Three decades later, The Pretenders stands as one of the best rock debuts ever, and a wellspring of durable songs like ""Brass in Pocket"" and ""Mystery Achievement"". That origin story may explain why Hynde continues to record under the Pretenders shingle instead of under her own name. Most of the band's albums have been glorified solo efforts, with Hynde's grace-and-gravel voice the only constant in a lineup that changes with every release. Each new iteration of the Pretenders allows Hynde to tweak her rock sound however slightly, to move in different directions. Break Up the Concrete-- the ninth Pretenders album and the first for Steve Bing's Santa Monica-based indie Shangri-La Music (not to be confused with venerable Memphis indie Shangri-La Records)-- features a new lineup that includes Pernice Brother James Walbourne on guitar, former Son Volt'er Eric Heywood on pedal steel, Pretenders touring bassist Nick Wilkinson on bass, and veteran session musician Jim Keltner on drums (who will be replaced by original drummer Martin Chambers on tour). Resituating the Pretenders sound in a roadhouse, the new band infuses Hynde's lefty-righteous rockers with bar-band bravado, adding a rumbling Bo Diddley beat to the title track and a stomping rockabilly recklessness to opener ""Boots of Chinese Plastic"". But they're an agile and restrained crew, adding raw gravitas to barely-hanging-on ballads like ""You Didn't Have To"" and ""The Last Ride"". Aside from some nice country flourishes, it's really the same as it ever was: The tumbling, tight-jointed riffs of ""Rosalee"" recall the punchy rhythms of early hits like ""Tattooed Love Boys"" and ""Cuban Slide"", while ""Don't Lose Faith in Me"" and ""One Thing Never Changed"" possess similarly graceful melodies and tough-minded lyrics as ""Kid"" and ""I'll Stand By You"". Even so, Break Up the Concrete seems a bit uneven: The faster numbers begin to sound the same after a while, and the album hits a slight lull halfway through. It may be the best Pretenders album since the 1980s, but that isn't really saying much. For all her rock gusto, Hynde isn't prolific. This is only her fifth album since the Pretenders' career-defining comp The Singles in 1987, and Break Up the Concrete handily skirts the studio sheen and reaching-more-than-grasping quality that defines 1994's Last of the Independents and 2002's Loose Screw. The new lineup's roughed-up sound proves a natural setting for Hynde's signature vocals perfectly and enlivens her performances. At 57, she still sounds as strong as she did 30 years ago, retaining all her brassy defiance and seductive authority. Hynde still knows how to manhandle a rocker and soft-sell a slow number, spitting the seedy lyrics of ""Don't Cut Your Hair"" as deftly as she sings the tender ""Don't Lose Faith in Me"". The title track features her loosest performance, as she dips into the low end of her range and adding some guttural sounds between choruses. That voice demands better material, though. The spiritual lyrics on ""Boots of Chinese Plastic"" don't exactly trip off her tongue, and ""The Nothing Maker"" reaches new depths of meaninglessness: ""He makes nothing,"" she sings on the admiring chorus, ""he's the nothing maker/ He's the maker of nothing."" Sense is obviously one of the many things he doesn't make. The album hinges on the slower tracks: ""Love's a Mystery"" rides its metaphor into true-crime territory, ""The Last Ride"" is a late-in-life reminiscence worthy of Neil Young's Harvest Moon, and closer ""One Thing Never Changed"" is Hynde at her most vulnerable and wounded. The years haven't touched her pipes, but they have changed her outlook, making her not just feistier but a little more straightforward and forgiving. As a result, Break Up the Concrete sounds simultaneously more agitated and more settled, a contradiction that says a lot about Hynde. True, her best and most exciting material may be long behind her, but three decades into her career, she still has a lot to say and-- despite this album's flaws-- a determinedly distinctive way to say it.","The ninth Pretenders album and the first for Santa Monica-based indie Shangri-La Music features a new lineup that includes members of the Pernice Brothers and Son Volt.

In Ear Park,Department of Eagles,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd465e6ef95969323010/1:1/w_160/a7b0c573.jpg,2008-10-07 06:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12275-in-ear-park/,4AD,"Department of Eagles have the kind of convoluted, meandering backstory that could squash a less compelling band. Before he joined Grizzly Bear in 2004, Daniel Rossen was splicing together samples and bits of unearthed sound with his NYU roommate, Fred Nicolaus; the duo's collages were released, in 2003, as Department of Eagles' eerie, twittering debut, The Cold Nose. That record was followed, in 2006, by a remix album and preceded by a series of vinyl-only singles, under the name Whitey and the Moon UK (also the original title of The Cold Nose). Not long after its release, Rossen partnered with Ed Droste and Grizzly Bear and the Department of Eagles project was put on hiatus-- until late 2007, when the DOE duo, now enlisting contributions from Rossen's Grizzly Bear brethren Chris Bear and Chris Taylor, began recording again. Unlike Department of Eagles' earlier output, which was heavily focused on sound art and electronic pastiche, In Ear Park is a sprawling pop record (complete with guitars, piano, horns, banjo, and more) that evokes Sgt. Pepper's, Sung Tongs, Van Dyke Parks, and Gene Clark. Like any good sonic experiment, In Ear Park extends with each listen, and things that once sounded small-- the piano bits on ""Teenagers"", the opening fuzz of ""No One Does It Like You"", the noirish echoing footsteps sampled in ""Classical Records""-- become epic on the fourth or fifth spin, as the album swells and expands. In Ear Park is dedicated to Rossen's late father, and while the album is hardly mournful, it is infused with a kind of omnipresent melancholy that occasionally tempers its sunshine (""I laughed so hard I fell down,"" Rossen sings in ""No One Does It Like You"". ""I curse these legs I walked on."") Opener and title track ""In Ear Park"" begins with high, twitchy acoustic guitar, which eventually gives way to an unsteady, paranoid haze; this is Department of Eagles at their freak-folkiest, and it's impossible not to hear the mesmeric whirl of the Incredible String Band (occasionally, Rossen's voice-- wispy and soft-- even sounds a bit like Robin Williamson's). Elsewhere, the band is more straightforward (reinforcing Rossen's claim that some of this material was ""too personal"" for Grizzly Bear)-- the ominous ""Around the Bay"" is a nice slice of gothic-folk, with its acoustic strums, thunderstorm percussion, and sharp, threatening vocals. Unlike a lot of side projects, Department of Eagles are remarkably self-sufficient-- possibly because Rossen and Nicolaus' partnership predates the current incarnation of Grizzly Bear. The breather between their earlier work and In Ear Park has paid off, helping Rossen and Nicolaus craft a rich, disorienting new direction for Department of Eagles. Ambitious and complex, it's stuffed with cocooning harmonies and shimmering, sunlight-smacking-the-Pacific melodies-- a languid, easy West Coast record (think Randy Newman or SMiLE), infused with classic East Coast anxiety.","After a brief hiatus, Grizzly Bear's Daniel Rossen has revived the Department of Eagles project, enlisted some of his bandmates, and created a sprawling pop record that evokes Sgt.

"Peaceful, the World Lays Me Down",Noah and the Whale,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd2313d197565213b49d/1:1/w_160/59570d85.jpg,2008-10-06 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12248-peaceful-the-world-lays-me-down/,Mercury,"Let's face it: I just don't watch 'em anymore. Movies, I mean. Six months go by between trips to the multiplex. If Netflix still turns a profit after recent financial events, it'll be because of two DVDs my wife and I have been meaning to send back (unseen) since, ohh, August. So in other words, those early Wes Anderson flicks are still pretty huge for me, even as a divided pop culture has helped big-budget schlock conquer actual film snobs. Anderson and many effective fey indie-poppers have real similarities: obsessive detail, pitch-perfect verbiage, outlandish characters, bookish humor, Harold and Maude-retro aesthetic, supersized cult followings. No surprise, then that Noah and the Whale take their name from director Noah Baumbach and his Anderson-produced The Squid and the Whale. Peaceful, the World Lays Me Down, the debut LP by the London folk-pop quartet, bites its best sensitive-indie forebears and then pukes up all the most superficial chunks. You've got your boy-girl harmonies: Charlie Fink sounds like a UK Jens Lekman covering Pedro the Lion; Laura Marling is more Amelia Fletcher. You've got your quirky, mostly sprightly arrangements: acoustic guitar, ukulele, banjo, glockenspiel, handclaps, fingersnaps, strings, horns, eccentric percussion... the full Sufjan Stevens. You've also got your trite generalities, ridiculous philosophical musings, utterly banal narrator, and, most damningly, no recognizable sense. of. humor. at. all. This is twee pop you might order in a kit, ask Dad to put together, and then leave on a shelf for the dust to cover up (the sooner the better). I'd have to be getting re-educated Clockwork Orange-style or else a paid album reviewer even to listen past sunnily ba-ba-ba-ing opener ""2 Atoms in a Molecule"", which is to the concept of metaphor what the 1980s Tampa Bay Buccaneers were to the concept of pro football: ""If love is just a game, then how come it's no fun?/ If love is just a game, how come I've never won?"" But still we press on, only to hear the similarly twee-by-numbers ""Jocasta"" fill spaces with the word ""oh"" the way us inarticulate Gen-Yers tend to say ""like"" or ""you know."" Timpani-rumbling ""Do What You Do"" and piano-backed ""Give a Little Love"" offer practical advice, generally of the ""Do what you do"" or ""All is fleeting/ Yeah, but all is good"" sort. By the time the whistling starts over ""Brimful of Asha"" chords on highest-charting single ""5 Years Time"" (""Sun, sun, sun!"" ""Fun, fun, fun!"" ""Love, love, love!""), smoking ""stupid little cigarettes"" and drinking a few boxes of ""stupid wine""-- oh, respite and nepenthe!-- sounds like the second-best activity to stupid little murder-suicide. ""We're all just matter that will one day scatter,"" Fink points out on the slow-motion, F-bombing title track. It's all ample grist for Noah and the Whale II: Vote for Pedro.","This is twee pop you might order in a kit, ask Dad to put together, and then leave on a shelf.

Prehistoricisms,Intronaut,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd2dabf31b7dc7155eb4/1:1/w_160/6020aa59.jpg,2008-10-06 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12258-prehistoricisms/,Century Media,"Intronaut is one of the most oblique bands in metal, a genre that doesn't normally reward obliqueness. The band is often compared to Neurosis and Isis, who also cultivate inscrutability. Yet concrete concerns emerge from Neurosis (the elements) and Isis (water, surveillance). Intronaut, on the other hand, are almost opaque. That's not just because of their lyrics, which are willfully abstract, and which were omitted altogether from the liner notes of Prehistoricisms. With a sound that's only moderately aggressive, the band doesn't reduce to ""victory,"" ""apocalypse,"" ""rebellion,"" ""catharsis,"" or other traditional metal themes. Intronaut's appeal is, for the most part, instrumental.
 
Virtuosity is aplenty in metal, but few metal bands have jazz fusion chops. The cultures don't align; metal is usually rigid, while fusion privileges improvisation. A few precedents exist for Intronaut's metal/fusion hybrid, like Cynic and Coprofago. But none have integrated these elements as organically as Intronaut, and with such restraint. Solos are rare; Joe Lester's bass is the most mobile instrument, while the guitarists mainly stick with chords and textures. Drummer Danny Walker is astoundingly dexterous, with agile fills, incisive cymbals, and power to spare. (He also moonlights in grindcore band Phobia.) On top are Sacha Dunable's yells, whose patterns resemble Neurosis', but are less expressive.
 
New guitarist Dave Timnick, who played as a drummer with Lester in non-metal projects, adds flexibility to an already limber lineup. (His predecessor Leon del Muerte was more grindcore-oriented.)  These are Intronaut's most adventurous songs to date. ""Prehistoricisms"" pits sheets of noise against playful bass pokings, then slams into searingly emotional chords. ""The Literal Black Cloud"" stretches one of Intronaut's fortes, a foot-dragging lurch that evokes spinning wheels in mud, into a delightful tapestry of counterpoint. ""Any Port"" is magnificently anthemic, closing with a thrilling tribal percussion jam. ""The Reptilian Brain"" opens with traditional Indian noodlings, complete with tabla (Lester is trained in Indian music), then drops into a shifting landscape of prog odd meters, pensive fusion, and trenchant metal. These departures place the metal sections in sharper relief; Intronaut have possibly the greatest command of dynamics of any metal band.
 
Unfortunately, the recording doesn't capture that. It's technically perfect; the instruments are clearly defined, with good separation between them. But the production is better suited for power metal. The drums are over-compressed, turning Walker's crisp work into thuds. As a result, the record feels flat, lacking peaks and valleys. Such production is typical in metal today, and it's not fatal in an age of iPod headphones and dubious MP3 bitrates. But to hear these songs as they should be heard, see Intronaut live. It's a deep, mysterious, and often moving experience.","Virtuosity is aplenty in metal, but few metal bands have jazz fusion chops like the oblique Intronaut, a group that makes even Isis and Neurosis seem less than inscrutable.

Islands of Ayle,Hawnay Troof,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd28c0084474cd0c2c36/1:1/w_160/2176dcb8.jpeg,2008-10-06 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12253-islands-of-ayle/,SouthernSouthern,"Vice Cooler, a suited and booted energy machine hailing from Oakland, California, is known for his brilliant, hyperactive live performances, yet his recorded output to date has felt rather thin by comparison. The template he created for himself as solo electro maniac Hawnay Troof has come close to sounding like a one-trick pony at times, but that is set to change with the release of his third album, Islands of Ayle, which was largely assembled during a 20-month world tour and features samples recorded everywhere from the Swiss Alps to Beijing. Here we can hear Cooler breaking his own mold with a fully realized album that fuses his hot-headed and fun approach to music making with some surprisingly great experimentation. The most enjoyable aspect of Islands of Ayle is Cooler's bold employment of traditional hip-hop rhythmic structures, which dishevel his more standard electro-punk patterns and allow the arrangements on this album to be completely thrilling-- this is the sound of a young musician who is not afraid to fuck with anything, or try something new, and this attitude leaves every track with an aftertaste as bright and strong as neon. The result is undoubtedly erratic, as Cooler intersperses classic common meter MCing in the style of Run-D.M.C. and Beastie Boys with unexpected breaks and fierce synth patches that burst out all over the place like the startling unpredictability of fireworks. (In fact, this record borrows so much from Hello Nasty that if Cooler wasn't so exploratory and light-hearted in his approach it would verge on ridiculous; even Jenny Hoyston sounds like Mike D in her guest appearance on ""Out of Teen Revisited"".) Unlike his contemporaries, such as Pittsburgh duo Grand Buffet and fellow west coaster Gold Chains, Cooler doesn't focus on creating anthemic melodies. His hooks are like hot potatoes: just when you get into it, he sweeps the beat to leave you hanging. The closest he comes to sticking to his guns is ""Underneath the Ocean"", which features lovely vocals from High Places' Mary Pearson. Elsewhere, tracks like the recent single ""Connection"" match bratty cat calling with intricately layered programming, and ""Bizarre Triangle"" sizzles with lyrical wildness, finishing up with a dirty edged skit that could either be about sex or cake baking (Cooler actually released his first cookbook, ""The Hungry Truth"", in 2005). Of course, underneath the silver hip-hop lining and flirtations with Kanye West style vocal samples fused with the type of dance euphoria that would make the Chemical Brothers proud (such as ""Venus Venus Piper""), Cooler is a punk rock kid still firmly rooted to the west coast DIY scene that he has been a part of since moving from Alabama in 1998. This celebration of community is imprinted all over Islands of Ayle: Cooler drafted a slew of pals, including Randy Randall (No Age), Jamie Stewart (Xiu Xiu), and Carla Bozulich, to contribute to the album proper, while a limited-edition CD offers a selection of remixes from Lucky Dragons, Mae Shi, and Soft Pink Truth. When Cooler sings ""If you've got your walk down, I hope you fully walk"" on ""Connection"" one can't help feeling that he has taken his own advice. In just over 30 minutes, he leaves an impression of a confidence that has moved beyond the ego and into a territory that enables him to get away with just about anything.","Largely assembled during a 20-month world tour and featuring samples recorded everywhere from the Swiss Alps to Beijing, the latest from Vice Cooler nearly matches his brilliant, hyperactive live performances.

Kind of Blue: 50th Anniversary Edition,Miles Davis,by: Andy Battaglia,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd505e6ef9596932302a/1:1/w_160/c0ed5d41.jpg,2008-10-06 06:00:02,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12283-kind-of-blue-50th-anniversary-edition/,Columbia Legacy,"Miles Davis's Kind of Blue belongs to that special class of album that everybody treasures immediately and then, over time, goes on to process in his or her own terms. For some, it's a masterpiece so resounding in its effect as to make the rest of ""jazz"" extraneous (or at least reasonably deferred until some later point when older or more patient). For others, it's a hallmark whose masterpiece status no amount of further exploration could impugn. Either way, everybody likes it. As Q-Tip says on a documentary included with this new 2xCD/DVD 50th-anniversary set, ""It's like the Bible-- you just have one in your house."" All of that might make Kind of Blue sound kind of boring, and indeed, part of the album's allure owes to the fact that it is among the least immediately radical paradigm-shifters you're ever likely to hear. As another bit on the DVD tells it, this one from the host of the 1950s TV show ""The Robert Herridge Theater"", a serious guy in black-and-white, smoking: ""There are many ways to tell a story, and what you're listening to now-- the music of Miles Davis-- is one of the ways."" Such matter-of-fact understatement suits Kind of Blue, an album that sounds like it's never been in a good mood it didn't consider fleeting or a bad one it couldn't brood its way out of. When Davis and his band commenced recording in 1959, they settled on a new form of ""modal"" jazz that called for improvising through scales as opposed to preordained chord changes. And even if that doesn't sound apparent to an untrained musical ear, it's suggested by a spectral sense of wandering-- an ease with uncertainty that comes across in no uncertain terms. Kind of Blue's rewards get doled out patiently and persistently, from the cool walk of ""So What"" to the magisterial glide of ""Flamenco Sketches"". The tracks that fall between-- ""Freddie Freeloader"", ""Blue in Green"", and ""All Blues""-- cover pretty much everything else. The story of them all is told to good effect in Celebrating a Masterpiece: Kind of Blue, a 55-minute documentary that anchors this new anniversary package-- which also includes a 60-page book and the album on blue vinyl. Nobody with a curious ear has hurt for Kind of Blue-related resources over the years, especially since a remaster in 1997 rescued the sound of it in fantastic fashion. The CD sounds the same in this new package, which pairs Kind of Blue on a disc with an already-released alternate take of ""Flamenco Sketches"" and nine short false-starts and studio bits, none longer than two minutes. Disc 2 cobbles together six earlier recordings by the players responsible for Kind of Blue: Davis, Cannonball Adderley, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Paul Chambers, and Jimmy Cobb. The standout is a 17-minute live recording of ""So What"" played much faster, tighter, and harder than simmering version that went on the finished album. The DVD features the full 26-minute ""Robert Herridge Theater"" show supplementing the documentary, which does an admirable job of taking the album itself as its subject. Some of the drama that surrounded the making of it enters in, but for the most part, the film focuses on how the album works and why. Much of it owes to the whole of the band. But then there's Davis-- an inimitable presence who drummer Cobb, still a bit wowed this many years later, describes as sounding ""like he was sitting on an iceberg somewhere out in the South Pole, alone."" As an album, Kind of Blue is unimpeachable, the kind of record you look forward to listening to decades down the line. As a reissue, this anniversary package (expensive at $109.98) is nice but less than essential, best for completists or those with good record players to put the new vinyl pressing to good use.","It's arguably the greatest jazz recording of all time, but this 50th anniversary edition-- which adds a DVD and an extra disc-- comes only 11 years after a wonderfully remastered edition. It's also priced at more than $100-- not exactly the best way to first experience it.

Everything Is Borrowed,The Streets,by: Mark Pytlik,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd58abf31b7dc7155f17/1:1/w_160/d97cfa0e.jpg,2008-10-06 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12291-everything-is-borrowed/,679,"A few weeks ago, in commemoration of its 40th year, the weekly arts and events magazine Time Out issued a well-considered list of 40 ""London heroes."" Among those named: celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, former two-term mayor Ken Livingstone, artist Damien Hirst, actress Judi Dench, playwright Tom Stoppard, and the Streets' Mike Skinner. It's not surprising to see Skinner in such company, but his inclusion says more about what he's come to mean to Londoners than it does anything about the quality of his current output. Despite the fact that the Streets' cultural relevance has tapered dramatically in the past few years, he nonetheless remains emblematic of a character and sub-culture that lifelong Londoners love to see reflected back on themselves. Nobody told the story of drug-hazed, middle-class, post-rave Britain quite so definitively, and for that, he'll probably always be adored. It must feel suffocating sometimes. In 2008, Skinner is neither drug-hazed nor middle-class. As it happens, he also doesn't seem particularly engaged in any kind of personal struggle. There's nary a whiff of the drug-binging, fame-flaunting, and deeply misanthropic character he put forward on 2006's overrated-by-some (sorry about that) The Hardest Way to Make an Easy Living. Instead, he's overcorrected in the other direction: Dig the motivational poster-worthy imagery of the album's campaign (none more flowery than the background image on Skinner's MySpace page, that of footsteps on a sun-dappled beach). And indeed, Everything Is Borrowed finds him in a blissed-out, meditative place: ""Just another brother trying to love my son and mother,"" he raps in ""Way of the Dodo"". ""Providing for my wife is the vibe I'm on in life."" To say this is his most adult record would be a severe understatement; this isn't just Skinner a few years wiser, this is Skinner downright happy. It is also-- not coincidentally-- one the most cringe-inducing and condescending lyrical efforts in recent years. It doesn't give me any great pleasure to reinforce the rockcrit cliché that money, fame, and happiness are inhibitors to great work-- especially not when it comes at the damage of someone as likable as Skinner-- but it's hard to dispute in this case. Without any kind of turmoil to deconstruct, friction to rub up against, or confusion to keep him humble, Skinner-- a gifted storyteller, when he has a story to tell-- reverts to a series of metaphysical parables, all of which are delivered with a from-the-mountaintop richness that belies the paper-thin insights on offer. Take, for example, his deconstruction of sin in ""Heaven for the Weather"": ""What is this 'evil', and who decides this?/ When left to devices, some humans try shit/ This is the reason we should all be tied up?/ We're just normal people exploring our minds."" The aforementioned ""Way of the Dodo"", meanwhile, manages to dramatically lower the bar for environmental calls-to-arms by solemnly informing us-- eight times-- that ""it's not earth that's in trouble"" but rather ""the people that live on it."" Worse still is ""Alleged Legends"", a sophomoric takedown of Western religion that's unintentionally hilariously soundtracked by, er, a sitar. ""Some people lead their lives by a little red book,"" Skinner raps. ""The thinking people are thinking that without this book, without these verses, we'd pillage and murder/ But following this red book word for word could lead you to actually pillage and murder/ Could it be so what we think to be right is simply the opinion that survived?"" If you think that's bad, wait for the chorus: ""Do what you think's right and you will feel alright/ Cause when you're bad you will feel sad."" Everything Is Borrowed's relentless cod-philosophizing and empty moralizing wouldn't be quite so hard to swallow if it were tempered by charm or wit. Unfortunately, there's not much of that on offer; most of Skinner's jokes fall flat, and his one or two observational lyrics [""Never Give In"", ""I Love You More (Than You Like Me)""] pale in comparison to similar material from the past. Only the grateful and celebratory title track and the delicately arranged ""The Strongest Person I Know"" manage to turn up lyrical moments befitting their arrangements. The most maddening thing about Skinner's lyrical crisis is that it's happened in concert with some of the most sophisticated and satisfying musical moments of his career. While Skinner's sampler has taken a backseat to full band arrangements, and his garage, hip-hop, and ska influences have been replaced, sometimes ill-advisedly, with touches of lounge, rock, disco, and soul, he actually acquits himself well within those new parameters. ""On the Flip of a Coin"" is an unlikely gypsy music/spy theme hybrid that fits together remarkably tidily; ""On the Edge of a Cliff"" is a slick bit of guitar-led soul that wouldn't sound out of place as a Jay-Z single; ""The Strongest Person I Know"" is a harp and oboe-led lullaby with a sweet refrain; and album closer ""The Escapist"", with its swelling horns, rolling percussions and gospel chorus, easily ranks as one of the joyous and most uplifting compositions in his catalogue. In the end, though, Everything Is Borrowed's musical high points aren't enough to save it from its lyric sheet, and that, going forward, constitutes a real problem for Skinner. Given that he's threatened repeatedly to retire the Streets after five full-length albums, it might be an issue he's already well aware of. Either way, something's got to give; another record of similarly hollow platitudes might be enough to undo his legacy.","It doesn't give us any great pleasure to reinforce the rockcrit cliché that money, fame, and happiness are inhibitors to great work, but without any kind of turmoil to deconstruct, friction to rub up against, or confusion to keep him humble, Mike Skinner has turned a bit cringe-inducing.

Villainaire,The Dead Science,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd0a13d197565213b45e/1:1/w_160/f0ba9fdd.jpg,2008-10-03 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12226-villainaire/,Constellation,"The latest album by Seattle's the Dead Science asks a lot of questions, the foremost being, ""What the fuck?"" You've got Sam Mickens' voice, which blends showtunesy brio with high-strung jitters, and makes him sound like Judy Garland in the throes of some dire psychosexual discomfort. For source material, you've got Wu-Tang Clan and Marvel Comics (the latter already looming large in the former's pantheon of mythology), leading to song titles like ""Make Mine Marvel"" and lyrics like ""Villainaire/ Ice Grillionaire."" And you've got the music itself: disarticulated guitar scrollwork full of awkwardly splayed chords and spidery progressions. The easy explanation for these juxtapositions would be indie irony-- a throwaway gag where a cynical appropriation of otherness masquerades as thematic depth-- or a parlor trick with archetypal collisions. But this isn't going to be that easy. Mickens writes insightfully about rap music for Seattle's The Stranger, and however inscrutable it is, this record has the marks of genuine investment. So again: What the fuck. The short answer is that this is music by music critics, for music critics. Dig this rather leading question that Mickens asked the RZA in a Stranger interview: ""Do you feel like Bobby Digital is a format in which you're looking at the more serious value of things like Marvel Comics-- things that people might be real deep on as kids and then come to greater understandings of later in life?"" On Villainaire, Mickens attempts to answer his own question. As someone who, approaching 30, has begun to seriously revisit the comics and rap music (especially Wu-Tang) that informed his developing perceptions of heroes, villains, power, and weakness, I'm sympathetic. It can't be a coincidence that superhero movies and the comics industry have enjoyed an incredible mainstream resurgence post-9/11, and these ostensibly childish fantasies, which reveal collective hopes and fears, are bursting with current relevance. But music is better at insinuation than analysis, and Mickens' themes seem like they'd be more fruitfully framed as a dissertation. When he sings, amid the needling guitars and ghoulish strings of ""Monster Island Czars"", ""Daydream of being married to/ A wave of bullets racing through my body,"" we at least catch a whiff of some kind of point about violence-as-fantasy, and ""gangster white walls"" is a terrifically compacted lyric that operates on at least three levels of significance. But when he quotes ""Triumph"" and sneaks in a reference to ""golden arms"" on the slithering chamber rock of ""Make Mine Marvel"", it smells of red herring. Villainaire's ambitious themes are partially stillborn, but the music itself is grotesquely alive. The Dead Science occupy a very specific and yet-to-be-properly-named caste of art-rock (I propose Theater of the Insane) characterized by queasy vibrato, tangled guitars, abstruse transgressive themes, allegiance to Scott Walker, and supplementary non-rock instrumentation (e.g. the harp runs preceding the swarming guitar attack of ""Throne of Blood (The Jump Off)""). They reside there alongside Xiu Xiu, Parenthetical Girls, and Shudder to Think. It's hard to imagine, but Mickens' voice is even more uncompromising than Jamie Stewart's or Craig Wedren's. At once lacy and flinty, it isn't softened by lush flutters like Stewart's, which is particularly apparent on ""Fabulous Muscles""-style, vanishing ballads like ""Lamentable"". Nor is it fortified by Wedren's operatic fluency, whose cameo on ""Death Duel Productions"" emphasizes how rigidly Mickens' voice sits astride the careening music. His voice is as ambiguous as his themes and shattered arrangements, all of which conspire to render Villainaire such an intriguing, exasperating, fitfully rewarding record.","Occupying a very specific and yet-to-be-properly-named caste of art-rock, Seattle's the Dead Science combine heavy duty theatrics with abundant references to comics and hip-hop on their first record for Constellation.

Worried Well,31Knots,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd1dc0084474cd0c2c23/1:1/w_160/b3d6a39b.jpeg,2008-10-03 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12243-worried-well/,Polyvinyl,"Portland's 31Knots have always been as slippery as frontman Joe Haege's guitar leads. The power trio's music reconciles math-rock's complexity and pop's punch, emo's tendon-popping angst and soul's melismatic swing, post-punk's jagged grooves and indie rock's shaggy melodies. All of this makes them worth keeping an ear on despite their spotty discography. They founder whenever their emo inclinations become too pronounced-- and, as emo tends to be the bull in any china shop it enters, their up-and-down output sags a bit toward the ""down"" side. But things are looking up: Worried Well is 31Knots' most consistent album since 2003's vigorous It Was High Time to Escape. On Worried Well, inventive song structures balancing hooky indie rock and studio-geek wizardry recall Modest Mouse, if they were fronted by a lungy belter in the Jason Molina vein rather than a mealy-mouthed croaker. As always, 31Knots dangerously skirt the line between conviction and too much, sometimes running roughshod over it. But you've got to give them credit for keeping things relatively loose and lean around the 10-year mark of their career, when many bands of their ilk start piling on the leaden string charts. Acknowledging that nothing but flag-waving burners stuffed with slithery licks-- see ""Certificate"" and ""Worried but Not Well""-- makes for enervating and monotonous albums, 31Knots nestle set pieces into and between songs, most of which are imbued with a genuine vitality and keep the album from bogging down. ""Baby of Riots"" opens the album with a confetti-burst of amp buzz and hand claps. ""The Breaks"" forgoes surging guitar chords in favor of organ fuzz and a dubby rhythm section. The underwater dirge ""Take Away the Landscape"" flirts with ambient music, and album highlight ""Strange Kicks"" has a piano-and-breakbeats feel very similar to Alaska in Winter's ""Balkan Lowrider Anthem"". ""Compass Commands"" rolls with barrelhouse piano, while ""Statistics and the Heart of Man"" bookends elaborate guitar whorls with passages of modernist stasis. This is clearly a band with some musicology under its collective belt, and its members have the technical skill to fold their diverse interests into guitar rock without forcing anything; the surprises come fast and, often, satisfyingly. But Haege's big voice puts a lot of emphasis on the prolix lyrics, which remain dismal. His cloudy pretensions float humorlessly above the eloquent music, threatening to overshadow it. I understand the need to pad out a bar sometimes, but if ""rejection,"" won't fit, there's got to be a better solution than ""the opposite of acceptance."" The second-person condemnation that opens the album-- ""You married your money and look what became...""-- sets the pedantic tone; the ideological thrust (capitalism sucks, conformity sucks, all kinds of things suck) has merit but is rendered with such self-righteous opacity and metaphysical hoopla as to gall any but the stoned-est teen poet. Haege says too much and not enough at once; if he ever manages to strike the same deft balance between bombast and nuance that he does instrumentally, 31Knots will be a much more formidable band.","Portland's 31Knots have always been as slippery as frontman Joe Haege's guitar leads, and here their math-rock complexity and emo-pop punch combine to shape their most consistent album since 2003's vigorous It Was High Time to Escape.

The Essentials,Ice Cube,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd4c5e6ef95969323020/1:1/w_160/8991288a.jpg,2008-10-03 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12280-the-essentials/,Priority,"It would be too easy to suggest that anything calling itself the essential Ice Cube should include Kill At Will, AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, and Death Certificate in their entirety. But that would denigrate what is a surprisingly noble pursuit on what could presumptively be a cynical attempt to wring one last dollar out of Cube's recording legacy: This isn't a greatest hits collection, as Cube has two of those already, including a compilation of his soundtrack work (just in case you really dug The Players Club). It's also a difficult to determine what qualifies as essential: ""It Was a Good Day"" and ""Check Yo Self"" are his most popular songs (both are included), but those didn't land Ice Cube a story in Time back when the nation as a whole was still getting acquainted with gangsta rap*--* tracks like ""Black Korea"" (46 seconds of inexcusable race-baiting that intentionally misused the point of Do The Right Thing) and ""A Bitch Iz a Bitch"" did. Against those odds, The Essentials mostly succeeds in balancing his MTV hits with trenchant deep cuts while properly weighing towards his earlier work without completely negating everything he's done since 1994. More often than not, it's a bracing reminder of a potency that's been diluted through the filter of one dubious movie choice after another-- Cube's rarely mentioned as one of hip-hop's greatest storytellers, but an economy of words and deft hand with plot have injected much of his politically minded material with a timelessness that's actually pretty sad (and not just because the boogeyman is always named ""Bush""). The petty thugs here are more likely to be dealing with the consequences of their actions instead of enjoying wealth or exploring the minutiae of their illegal dealings, something that stands in stark relief of the nihilism that's come to afflict most drug rap of the 21st century. Yes, there are endemic societal problems that leave people with no choice, but no one's absolved, especially since most of the characters realize the situation and yet find themselves dumb enough to be doing wrong anyway. It's a little disappointing that ""Who's the Mack?"" isn't included, because in each of its acts, the circumstance can be explained with ""you knew the game and you still ended up on your back."" Take the immortal first line from ""Bird in the Hand""-- ""Fresh out of school cause I was a high school grad/ Gots to get a job cause I was a high school dad."" Slowly, Cube becomes not necessarily an outlaw, but someone almost bemusedly starts living outside of the law (""Now I remember, I used to be cool/ Until I stopped filling out my W-2"") until the government has to give a shit out of custodial concern. ""What Can I Do"" works in reverse, a displaced dealer too unlucky to die young, forced to work in McDonald's as a freshly-released inmate with no marketable skills. Existing somewhere in between is ""My Summer Vacation"", which deftly explores how supply and demand (""in L.A. everybody and they mama sell dope"") leads a couple of Cali gangbangers to set up shop in St. Louis and act as one of many germ cells that spread ""gang violence where it was never seen before."" Obviously, not every cut here is prime material-- placing ""Go to Church"" first is a canny bit of sequencing, since it immediately puts you face-to-face with everything you've been trying to forget about 21st century Cube, 21st century Snoop, and the three years in which Lil Jon was forcing people into making head-bussa anthems against their best interests. Fortunately, the silly Don Mega stuff of the late-90s gets excised, but ""Supreme Hustle"" and ""War & Peace"" do little to redeem his work of the time. Even the early stuff can be mishandled-- ""Givin' Up the Nappy Dugout"", a decidedly minor cut, could've easily been replaced by the song it precedes on Death Certificate (""Look Who's Burnin'""), which denounced sexual promiscuity with a positive message that spared no one (""Got you a college boy that was worse than me/ And he probably fucked the whole university""). Despite its importance as a fulcrum in Cube's catalog, The Predator gets a somewhat awkward treatment. Wisely banking on alternative nation synergy, The Predator became the first album to debut at #1 on both the R&B and pop charts, in large part due to his inclusion on Lollapalooza (not to mention him smashing up an A-frame with the Red Hot Chili Peppers in the video for ""Wicked""). But while many saw it as a large dip in quality from AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted and Death Certificate, its context in the wake of the L.A. Riots gave him a certain sense of closure and justification (""I told you it would happen and you heard it, read it/ But all you could call me was anti-Semitic""). ""When Will They Shoot?"" is more remarkable for its titanic X-Clan derived stomp than its narrative, but it's likely the wisest inclusion over fantasies either badly dated (""Who Got The Camera?"") or aimless (""Dirty Mack""). As with any collection of this sort, the question ends up being ""who is this for, exactly?"" Cube's discography isn't the most daunting out there, and a rather solid consensus exists as to which ones are worth picking up. But as is, it's enough of a teaser to remind you of his greatness, plus all the gems left out- the searing self-analysis of ""Us"" (unfortunately co-opted by neocons like Dinesh D'Souza), Eazy-Ethering ""No Vaseline"", or even ""Bop Gun (One Nation)"", which could've at least represented the rightfully ignored Lethal Injection with Cube's most bizarre number. Still, the finale ""Cold Places"", proves Cube's rage still runs cold even if his influence has precipitously declined. Despite some stilted references to Obama and Hurricane Katrina, in a time where political apathy is considered noble since it refuses to legitimize a process that's obviously failed, maybe we need to hear from him more than ever-- even if it's just sticking with the essentials.","Against the odds, the latest Ice Cube career comp mostly succeeds in balancing his MTV hits with the trenchant deep cuts that actually made him essential in the first place.

The Week That Was,The Week That Was,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd1eea9e61561daa763e/1:1/w_160/29c3fdff.jpg,2008-10-03 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12244-the-week-that-was/,Memphis Industries,"So, as it turns out, Sunderland is not the new Seattle, what with leading lights the Futureheads and Newcastle-upon-Tyne neighbors Maxïmo Park pumping out less exciting variations of their much-celebrated debut albums, and the scene's dark horse-- oddball indie pop trio Field Music-- announcing their hiatus before their second album (2007's Tones of Town) had barely settled onto record-store shelves. But for fraternal Field Music leaders David and Peter Brewis, the end of the band does not mean the death of the brand. Citing a growing disillusion with the touring and promotional aspects of being in a band but a continued enthusiasm for the recording/creative process, the brothers have essentially split into two outfits united under the ""Field Music Productions"" banner: David was first past the post earlier this year with his boisterous new School of Language project, which closely adhered to its antecedent's post-punky guitar pop schematic, while Peter now emerges with the even more ambitious The Week That Was, whose assured self-titled debut ushers in the Brewis brothers' next phase in earnest. Perhaps Field Music's most impressive quality was how they pulled off complex, multi-instrumental arrangements in a three-piece format; The Week That Was makes those grandiose intimations real with a formidable nine-piece line-up (including David in a supporting bassist role). Opener ""Learn to Learn"" begins with a booming repeated bass-drum/floor-tom pattern that acknowledges the lingering influence of XTC (cf., ""Making Plans for Nigel""), but also serves as a telling harbinger of Peter's renewed aesthetic, in which traditional new-wave guitars and synths are de-emphasized to exploit the acoustic and percussive qualities of pianos, vibraphones, marimbas, cornets, violins, and, yes, cowbells. It’s an approach that was prefigured by Tones of Town tracks like ""A House Is Not a Home"", but given a more authoritative treatment here: the tick-tock clatter of ""The Good Life"" and the hypnotic, Congotronic vibraphone oscillations of the gorgeous ""It's All Gone Quiet"" prove to be perfect complements to their workaday narratives, while the stuttering, trip-you-up drum beat of ""The Airport Line"" makes the journey to its swooning chorus that much more rewarding. When the strings come in to soothe the staccato rhythm, the net effect is something like Big Star's Third/Sister Lovers as performed by Can. Despite the more elaborate presentation, The Week That Was sticks to the Field Music tradition of packing a surfeit of ideas into a compact package, in this case eight songs and 32 minutes; even the inclusion of a seven-minute prog-like suite, ""Yesterday's Paper"", doesn't curb momentum, those omnipresent drum rolls propelling the song through its multi-sectional turns at a brisk clip. Peter’s songwriting sensibility places him squarely in a post-psych/post-punk tradition that's equal parts Colin Newman and Carl Newman, Robert Wyatt, and Robert Pollard, but the constant tension between The Week That Was' percussive and melodic elements means that, unlike Field Music, his new band can’t be so easily aligned with contemporary indie-rock acts peddling new-wave nostalgia. Never mind the retro-gazing moniker-- The Week That Was is a band you need to hear now.","Following his brother's debut as School of Language, Peter Brewis-- the other fraternal half in Field Music-- emerges with the even more ambitious and assured The Week That Was project.

Vivian Girls,Vivian Girls,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd53ea9e61561daa76a9/1:1/w_160/a44b32e9.jpg,2008-10-03 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12286-vivian-girls/,Mauled by Tigers,"In a year when Brooklyn buzz travels around the world at lightspeed, you can probably count on one hand the number of new bands that, when the hype settles, are more than inconsequential collections of postures and exhausted second-hand styles. Vivian Girls, an all-female trio who've become overnight sensations among critics and underground rock fans, are seemingly candidates for one of those emperor's new clothes-type reveals-- after all, they hail from said borough and perform lo-fi garage rock that taps a number of fashionable historical, ideological, and aesthetic wellsprings (C86! Slumberland! Olympia! Nuggets! Spector!). They deflect the knee-jerk criticism the most effective way possible, though: with an armful of kick-ass songs. Vivian Girls' 22-minute debut for the California-based garage-rock imprint In the Red is actually a reissue of this spring's 500-copy run on the tiny Mauled by Tigers label. The original release sold out in 10 days, amping both the band's mystique and the record's exchange value: A vinyl copy ended bidding at $68 on eBay a couple weeks ago. So far, Vivian Girls seem to be taking their subcultural celebrity-- not to mention the summer departure of drummer and band founder Frankie Rose for brother band Crystal Stilts-- in stride. In the intentionally dorky video for ""Tell the World"", Cassie Ramone, Kickball Katy, and Ali Koehler address the camera, poised and unsmiling, even as they pantomime the usual humiliating music vid motions. The band's lyrics are just as purposefully passive. In his intro to Rhino's superlative box set, One Kiss Can Lead to Another: Girl Group Sounds Lost and Found, critic Gene Sculatti locates the enduring popularity of 60s girl group music in its effect: ""This music was, like a moving symphony or free-floating jazz jam, mainly about a feel, a sound. It had words, yes, but they were never intended to get in the way of the overall impact of the record."" Punk credentials aside, Vivian Girls are clearly simpatico to that gentler era's agenda. According to the band, the album is somewhat conceptual, its 10 tracks evenly split between love and heartbreak. ""No"", an angry thrash-and-bash propelled by a single lyric (guess!) is easy to place. But the LP is rarely so transparent, and Vivian Girls mainly get their message across with a murky wall of noise. Try to pry the lyrics of cacophonous openers ""All the Time"" and “Such a Joke"" from their shoegazery feedback, thudding bass, and tambourine rattle and you'll be missing the point. Without risking pastiche, the band gets plenty of mileage from its sonic references. ""Tell the World""s frantic beat recalls the jittery, chaotic rhythm of Black Tambourine's ""Throw Aggi Off the Bridge"", while the Girls' flawless, calmly executed three-part harmony counters with the satin-shoed professionalism of the Crystals. The lyrics-- this is one of Vivian Girls' few completely legible songs-- are as ambivalent: ""I'll tell the world about the love that I've found,"" they enthuse, giving public voice to teenage infatuation (an evergreen girl-group subject), while at the same time raising the Spector of out-of-whack control issues: ""He sees what I see/ He feels what I feel."" (Not convinced? Switch out the gender of the pronoun and singers.) The end result is phenomenal, one of 2008's best songs. The sweet jangled ""Where Do You Run To"" is almost as great, making pining at home seem not so bad, all things considered. The trio nabbed its name from the heroines of outsider artist Henry Darger's magnum opus, In the Realms of the Unreal. A sorority of vaguely fetishized hermaphrodite messiahs, Darger's Vivian girls are some of the most slippery, troublesome figures in contemporary art, making the band's appropriation a clever bit of self-mythologizing. The final track on their album, ""I Believe in Nothing"", purportedly endorses nihilism. But it puts the lie to its own message with heavenly madrigals and a hooky refrain that'll burrow into your brain and replay like a mantra until you do, in fact, believe in something. Even if it's just this really awesome new band.","Vivian Girls, an all-female trio who've become overnight sensations among critics and underground rock fans, deliver a lively, lovable debut album that taps fashionable aesthetic wellsprings from Phil Spector to C86 to Nuggets and, without risking pastiche, turns them into an armful of kick-ass songs.

"Stay Golden, Smog: The Best of Golden Smog - The Rykodisc Years",Golden Smog,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd17ea9e61561daa762c/1:1/w_160/62264262.jpg,2008-10-02 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12237-stay-golden-smog-the-best-of-golden-smog-the-rykodisc-years/,Rhino,"Golden Smog couldn't be just a covers band in the 1990s, not with that line-up: Gary Louris and Marc Perlman from the Jayhawks, whose Hollywood Town Hall was a benchmark in early-90s roots rock; Dan Murphy of Soul Asylum, who used to be kind of a big deal; Kraig Johnson of Run Westy Run, whose CD I almost bought back in 1995 but didn't; Chris Mars of the Replacements, members of which band should all be bronzed; and Jeff Tweedy of some obscure Chicago outfit. Obviously, any attempts to portray the band as anything but the equivalent of a pick-up game of basketball were going to be as futile as their attempts to distance themselves from the alt-country label. In that small realm, despite their best efforts to keep it all low-key-- such as those Porn Name Game aliases in the CD credits (first name=your middle name, surname=street you grew up on, etc.)-- Golden Smog were doomed to be a supergroup. But all they really wanted to do was goof off and play good ol' Midwestern rock'n'roll. Or at least that's the impression given by Stay Golden, Smog, a best-of culling from their years at Rykodisc-- in other words, from the 90s. From 1992, when the band released a covers EP called On Golden Smog, through 1995, when they released their debut full-length, Down By the Old Mainstream, Golden Smog were just as representative of certain musical movements as the New Pornographers were earlier in this decade. In 2008, however, it's pretty astounding that the alt-country tag haunted them so persistently. Like their tributary bands, they sounded less like guys raised on the Carter Family and Johnny Cash and more like boys still enthralled with 70s classic rock radio and the muscle cars that blasted those hits. The songs on Stay Golden are much more modest than ""Takin' Care of Business"" or ""Even the Losers"". In fact, at times these songs sound fairly predictable, making room in the backseat for tepid guitar solos, jangly guitar riffs, and lyrics about girls with ""troubled mind(s) and star-crossed eyes"" (which seems to be Louris' evergreen theme). And you didn't have to look beyond the members' rent-paying bands to find better versions of some of these tracks. Murphy's ""Ill Fated"" sounds like a post-Grave Dancer's Union Soul Asylum outtake, while Louris' ""Jennifer Save Me"" could have been a lesser number on any of the Jayhawks' post-Mark Olson albums. Johnson's ""He's a Dick"" is a one-play-only goof that might have been better as one of many bonus tracks on a future reissue of Mainstream. Of course, some tracks bear the fruit of this cult-historic collaboration. Opener ""Until You Came Along"" and ""V"" are two of Louris' catchiest compositions, the former ending with a barroom sing-along that's so happy it's sad. The bonus 1997 version of the song, however, trades that coda in for some fiddling and whistling that lose that sense of momentousness. Similarly, Tweedy's contributions-- ""Lost Love"", ""Radio King"", and the Brian Wilson cover ""Love and Mercy"", which is exclusive to this comp-- make you wish he were fronting a modest bar band again, and ""Please Tell My Brother"" ranks among his best songs. It's just Tweedy and a guitar, singing about traveling the road and missing his family, but it's effective in its simplicity, recalling his work with Billy Bragg on the Mermaid Avenue material. As much as they disliked the tag alt-country, Golden Smog reflected a gradual change in that genre, a growing rebellion against the strictures of roots music. In the late 90s and early 00s, the bands affiliated with Golden Smog, along with genre mainstays like the Old 97s and Joe Henry, went pop, either discovering the joys of the Beach Boys or simply opening up their sounds to newer styles. Golden Smog's final album for Rykodisc, 1998's Weird Tales, departed most significantly from their established classic rock sound, as if they had accepted obscurity as their likely fate and embraced Big Star as their patron saint. That history is lost on Stay Golden, which culls the most conservative material from Weird Tales: ""Looking Forward to Seeing You"" and ""Making Waves"" rather than the funk-rock excursion ""Keys"" or the reverby ""All the Same to Me"". As a product, Stay Golden is not only redundant (gathering material primarily from just two readily available releases), but also misleading, painting the band as stuck-in-the-mud roots rockers when in fact they did try to become something a bit different-- not a supergroup necessarily, but simply a band independent from its day jobs and with its own musical mission.","The alt-country supergroup-- featuring members of the Jayhawks, Soul Asylum, Run Westy Run, the Replacements, and Jeff Tweedy of Wilco-- gathers together highlights from its 1990s output.

Bury the Cynics,The Lovely Sparrows,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd3cc0084474cd0c2c62/1:1/w_160/84314a0f.jpg,2008-10-02 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12268-bury-the-cynics/,Abandoned Love,"I don't know whether I'm peeved or impressed that the Lovely Sparrows' debut full-length doesn't include a lyrics sheet. Head Sparrow Shawn Jones is a brainy songwriter with a gift for wordplay, unexpected rhymes, and occasionally startling imagery, and he gingerly combines indie whimsy with a personal despondency without coming across as cute. He's soundtracking Chris Ware panels, not Wes Anderson movies (cough Noah cough Whale). So it seems admirably modest that he doesn't reprint his lyrics, but instead lets them remain purely musical and slightly mysterious, as if his songs were musical rather than literary endeavors. Still, B**ury the Cynics almost demands to be digested with lyrics sheet in hand. The album's acoustic shuffle only sounds simple, but as on the Lovely Sparrows' previous EP, Pulling Up Floors, Pouring on (New) Paint, these arrangements twist and turn unexpectedly, exploring blind alleys and strange avenues as if mimicking Jones' lyrical approach. The music tends toward spare and folksy, favoring shaken sleighbells, demonstratively strummed acoustic guitars, soft-focus backing vocals, thrumming organs, and a Vince Guaraldi flute in the background that puts me in mind of Snoopy roaming the French countryside. More streamlined and subtle than those on the EP, these indie folk songs are inventive and ornate but neither busy nor showy, and even if there should be more drums to liven up some of the lulls, everything here sounds calibrated to frame Jones' sentiments in a diorama of emotional confusion. ""Love me tender, love me true,"" he sings on opener ""Wraith"" as acoustic guitars shiver behind him. It's an obvious Elvis reference, but with a new ending: ""and I'll make a wreck of you."" Although ""Wraith"" eventually contorts itself into such a state that the twin electric guitars sound perfectly appropriate, Bury the Cynics sounds more like a one-man show than a full-band album. The Lovely Sparrows, which offshot from the Austin band Larks & Owls, has clearly developed into a vehicle for Jones, which is just fine. Both his physical and his lyrical voices are particular enough to anchor these songs in his own creative space, to make them personal despite some obvious influences. He's wryer than Eef Barzelay, but less studious than Paul Simon. Which pretty much describes everyone in the world, but Jones takes enough from those and other artists to construct his own musical identity. Occasionally, he sounds a bit too clever-- too in love with his own ideas on ""Department of Forseeable (sic) Outcomes"" and the impending-apocalyptic ""Devil's in the Details"" (""I've got a feeling that the horse and the rider are the same/ And if you whistle, they'll come running""). ""Let's sign a new deal,"" he sings on the title track, ""saying this one's for the cynics and this one's for you."" A veteran of lower-level indie bands for nearly a decade, Jones knows how to navigate the minefields of the scene, but his braininess gets away from him. Still, he's bearable not simply because of the grain in his voice, but because he never sounds bitter, accusatory, or-- by extension-- self-righteous. His cleverness is a defense mechanism: hope in the face of cosmic indifference.","Led by brainy songwriter Shawn Jones, the Lovely Sparrows display a gift for wordplay, unexpected rhymes, and occasionally startling imagery on their debut album.

Shut Up and Bleed,Teenage Jesus and Beirut Slump,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd195e6ef95969322fb2/1:1/w_160/29e6827c.jpeg,2008-10-02 06:00:03,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12239-shut-up-and-bleed/,Atavistic,"The early work of Lydia Lunch often gets linked inextricably to no wave, the post-punk movement that burned through downtown New York in the late 1970's. That's accurate-- her nihilistic, audience-defying attitude helped define the movement (some claim she even coined the term). But it's also a bit unfair. Lunch's music would be bracingly unique anywhere, anytime, as would the path she took to get there. The basic plot would sound wild if it happened now, so imagine how gutsy it seemed back then: In 1976, at age 16, Lydia Koch runs away from her upstate New York home, crashes in a hippies' loft in Manhattan, befriends Suicide and the Dead Boys and foists her poetry on them, and eventually launches a band called Teenage Jesus and the Jerks. ""The driving vision behind Teenage Jesus was to castrate the tradition of melody and composition,"" she wrote in a memoir included in this disc, ""and simply vent in the most primal way possible the horrible din of my own torture."" That may sound over the top, but it's an understatement compared to how Teenage Jesus actually sounded. Over harsh, dogmatic beats, gravity-drenched bass, and exploding slide guitar, Lunch screamed out her obsessions with torture, imprisonment, and bodily harm. ""Take a bullet to my eyes/ Blow them out and see if I die""; ""Little orphans running through the bloody snow""; ""The dishes are cracked, the forks are plastic/ The food is in cellophane, and I puke elastic."" Lunch's short, spiked songs were the musical equivalent of avant-garde slasher movies. (No wonder no wave directors like Vivienne Dick and Beth and Scott B. often made Lydia the star of their films). All this blood and guts comes across vividly on Shut Up and Bleed, the most complete compilation to date of Teenage Jesus' work. (Atavistic previously released one called Everything, but it had less material, and it definitely didn't sound this good). Not that there was a lot to compile: the band released only two 7-inches and a 12-inch EP, along with an appearance on Brian Eno's compilation No New York. But Shut Up and Bleed adds the posthumous Pre-Teenage Jesus EP (recorded when future Contortion James Chance was in the band), some fiery live tracks from the earlier Lunch compilation Hysterie, and, most excitingly, two previously-unreleased live cuts. Those were recorded at the 1978 Arists' Space festival which inspired Eno to create No New York. ""Eliminate by Night"" is a 45-second stomp that fits perfectly into the band's lightning-bolt oeuvre. ""Roll Your Thunder"" is a minimalist march, with Bradly Field's lock-step snare slicing through Jim Sclavunos' monster bass and Lunch's drill-sergeant commands. According to the liner notes, the group played 16 songs at Artists' Space (including four versions of the screeching instrumental ""Red Alert""); here's hoping Atavistic can eventually unleash them all. Teenage Jesus burned out in just a couple of years (Lunch's M.O. was to make her point and move on immediately), but even in that short window, she found time for another band. Lunch intended Beirut Slump to be ""slow, torturous...a bloody drag,"" and she succeeded. Borrowing Sclavunos to play drums, she added filmmaker Dick on keyboards and siblings Liz and Bobby Swope on bass and vocals, respectively. The band's dominant elements are Dick's drones and Swope's B-movie moans. On shivery cuts like the lurching ""Try Me"" and the woozy ""Staircase"", Swope is like a musical Ed Wood, directing his group through foggy cemeteries and over-lit swamps. Beirut Slump was ultimately a footnote to Teenage Jesus (the band released one single and played just three shows), but a footnote worth reading. Shut Up and Bleed's only weakness is bizarre sequencing. It's as if someone threw the tracks into the air like a deck of cards and let the resulting random mess dictate order. Cuts by both bands are interspersed, and simple logic-- like maybe putting the two tracks from the same single next to each other-- is rarely heeded. Anyone listening with history in mind will have to craft a new playlist (and good luck reading the dark discographical symbols). But that confusion doesn't diminish the power of the music here-- music made by a singular legend at the peak of her adolescent powers.","Atavastic assembles the most complete compilation to date of these two bands fronted by the no wave legend Lydia Lunch, offering an unrelentingly harsh and bleak portrait of the artist as a young woman.

London Conversations: The Best of Saint Etienne,Saint Etienne,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd4eabf31b7dc7155f05/1:1/w_160/b44f88a9.jpg,2008-10-02 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12282-london-conversations-the-best-of-saint-etienne/,Interscope,"Compilations can be a difficult thing to assess. In addition to the quality of the music collected, other factors are in play: Is the record necessary? Who is it for? What do these particular songs articulate about their creator? For most Saint Etienne fans, the news that the eclectic trio was releasing the 2xCD 35-track London Conversations set was likely met with...""another compilation?"" (A single-disc version that even newcomers should forgo for the 2xCD set, and a package with a DVD of videos are also available.) The band has already issued the succinct early singles collection Too Young to Die, the 2xCD 34-track Smash the System, and Sub Pop's U.S.-only single-disc treatment Travel Edition. When I first learned about this set, and saw its title, I gave them the benefit of the doubt and assumed that it might be a collection of songs about the England capitol-- not a far-fetched notion from a group who has already created a film about London and for two decades has deftly balanced the shifting, increasingly multicultural, cosmopolitan, and dance-influenced nature of London and its popular culture with the romantic, 1960s, mod notion of the city. Alas, this is not a theme-centric cross-section of Saint Etienne's work. (And, wtc, it continues the group's streak of omitting one of its best songs, ""London Belongs to Me"", from these career-spanning discs.) In fact, the core of this set doesn't stray far from Smash the System's tracklist-- not adjusting for different mixes and edits, 12 songs from Smash are left out, with 13 new additions taking their places, most of them recorded since the earlier set was released. That's not much of a surprise; most of Saint Etienne's best tracks were recorded in the first half of the 1990s, and any compilation of their work without the overwhelming majority of the group's first 14 singles would be a poor intro. The hook here for longtime fans is the CD debut of ""Lover Plays the Bass"", a limited 7"" release, but, considering the depth and breadth of Saint Etienne's career, it's not a track that should leave one wanting to pay for this set in order to acquire it. Of these compilations, it's the ""breadth"" thing that's always bothered me about Saint Etienne and how they're viewed. It's been more than 15 years now since the release of their first two albums, Foxbase Alpha (1991) and So Tough (1993)-- both immediate entries into the indie hipster 101 at the time but talked about more infrequently since. Those two records, and the sadly less-considered 1994 follow-up Tiger Bay and Japanese-only 1997 release Continental represent the high point of the band's career, and despite the high quality of their singles, the records are an immersive amalgamation of decades' worth of non-guitar music. To be reductive, people label them a ""pop"" or ""dance"" band; nothing wrong with being either, but those fail to capture the effortless way Saint Etienne have molded 40 years of record-collector music such as Northern soul, dub, Tropicália, disco, girl-group music, exotica, incidental music, and French pop with more contemporary sounds like acid house, techno, Balearic, and Swedish pop. To put it another way: The simplistic tags also fail to capture how the group has flitted easily from name-dropping insiders to wizened scene vets and from delicate and blissed-out to robust and upbeat, or how they've played with notions of wit, artifice, style, and and approachable everyday glamor. In the time since, the group has stuttered a bit, releasing less-immediate records that tend to sound better in hindsight. Of those, 1998's Good Humor on Sub Pop is surely the most well-known in the U.S., and you'll find people who actually claim that's their favorite Etienne record (possibly in part because it was the intro-- hey, we all do that) which is a bit mental. Both Humor and 2000's The Sound of Water have high highs-- particularly the latter, with ""How We Used to Live"" and ""Heart Failed (In the Back of a Taxi)""-- but on the whole they've been bested by the group's relatively low-key yet cohesive work since. Truthfully though-- despite the conceptual bents that bind Finisterre (2002) and Tales From Turnpike House (2005)-- this comp does an excellent job of picking and choosing from the past 10 years of Saint Etienne's output, and for the uninitiated or less curious could serve as a proper substitution for the entire thing. Which brings us back to those questions at the top of the review. Fanboy nitpicking aside, when it comes down to it, the most important one-- Who is this for?-- doesn't apply to me, or to anyone else who actually knew what the hell ""Lover Plays the Bass"" was prior to a few paragraphs ago. And, for those who want to dip their toes in, this is an excellent place to start. At its best, the music is almost unimpeachable-- songs like ""Avenue"", ""You're in a Bad Way"", ""Like a Motorway"", ""Mario's Cafe"", and ""He's on the Phone"", among many others, deserve to be considered modern classics. It's an incomplete picture of the group to be sure, but that's going to be inevitable when it comes to packaging two discs from a band this exploratory and in tune to shifting styles and moods. With the band strongly rumored to be releasing 2xCD versions of its albums in the near future, the time to properly reassess and fully explore Saint Etienne could soon arrive. In the meantime, if you need to get acquainted you should do so asap.","Yes, another compilation from Saint Etienne, but at least they do it right: Over two CDs and 35 tracks, we hear how they so successfully molded 40 years of record-collector music-- Northern soul, Tropicália, disco, and French pop-- with more contemporary sounds like acid house, techno, Balearic, and Swedish pop.

Paper Trail,T.I.,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd4b13d197565213b4f4/1:1/w_160/bdc3c074.jpg,2008-10-02 06:00:01,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12279-paper-trail/,Atlantic,"Clifford Harris has gotten pretty good at this self-fulfilling prophecy thing. Though 2003's Trap Musik made him a regional royal in Atlanta, 2006's King accurately predicted he'd go nationwide. That record, combined with the positive reception of his film ATL the same year, gave hip-hop the legitimate multimedia crossover star it needed as interest in 50 Cent flagged. But his predictive powers worked against him on last year's T.I. vs T.I.P., a sloppy and rushed collection loosely based on the notion that no matter how firmly the rapper entrenched himself in the pop world, anything from his hustler past-- from his hotheadedness to his felonies to his associations-- could compromise his success. Which is exactly what happened: He's now staring down jail time for attempting to purchase machine guns from a federal agent in a Walgreens parking lot. T.I. apparently learned his lesson, and on Paper Trail, he's not taking any chances with an extraneous narrative. Although some recent mixtape tracks suggest we might be getting a 25th Hour-like confessional from Harris on his way to a one-year sentence in 2009 (or reality TV), Paper Trail bases itself on the assumption that everything's going to be all right for him, emotionally and financially. Breaking rank from his previous two efforts by writing down his lyrics again, he immediately shows a willingness to do something other than coast from hook to hook-- at least at the outset, on ""56 Bars (Intro)"" and ""I'm Illy"". Not that he's morphed into Pharoahe Monch or anything: His wordplay likens his weed to celery and his money-getting ability to the U.S. Treasury, which are pretty lame boasts these days. The real shift in tone, though, becomes apparent in T.I.'s eagerness to please: Even with ""Swagga Like Us"", Paper Trail hosts as many obligatory guest R&B hookmen as rappers. The conciliatory lover's rock of ""Whatever You Like"", with its near-absence of rapping, spotlights a synth pluck as flirty and debauched as a coked-up celebutante as proof that this ""Lollipop"" thing is a full-blown trend, not just a one-off WTF. And despite T.I. making an uncomfortable number of veiled threats to bloggers, Just Blaze goes all Rivers Cuomo by cratedigging in YouTube; the internet-approved ""Numa Numa"" song is now a hook via Rihanna at her most robo. (The song bottoms out on listenability even before you get to the surprisingly unctuous moralizing of its second verse.) And if you justifiably figured ""Porn Star"" would be the album's low point, wait til Tip stoops to using a ""life is like a..."" device so cornball that even Travis beat him to it. Paper Trail more often succeeds when the positivity sounds more earned than court-ordered. Beyond the fact that ""On Top of the World"" squashes a Ludacris/T.I. beef that threatened to get even more stupidly dangerous (though T.I. isn't above going at Shawty Lo on ""What Up, What's Haapnin'""), it's a perfect pairing that makes you wonder how many awesome collaborations we missed out on. Luda's verse is infectiously joyous and quotable (""We see Samuel L. Jackson, like, 'What's up motherfucker!'"") as T.I. provides the perfect foil with the weariness of someone whose fight will never be over. The same goes for ""No Matter What"", the most musically striking track, with Danja's churchgoing organ sighs and punched-up drums. While T.I. lords over wannabes that want to ""get a beat from Toomp and make a hook like shawty,"" ending with a line like ""I just let go and let God deal with it"" may seem deflating, but in the context of a rap persona that owes its success to otherworldly confidence, it's a telling display of how little control he really feels. For better or worse, ""Swagga Like Us"" defines Paper Trail. In the style of those can't-miss 90s posse cuts, T.I., Lil' Wayne, Kanye West, and Jay-Z spit over a martial beat that samples M.I.A.'s pop chart infiltrator ""Paper Planes"". What could go wrong? Unfortunately, one-upmanship gives way to self-assured competence and Khaled-inspired complacence. T.I. effortlessly bests them all, but in this track, you see how the album manages to be a more detailed manuscript of Tip's complexity: An impending incarceration has lit a fire under him, triggering an impulse to challenge himself. But T.I. has spent too much of his life fighting to get where he is, and Paper Trail's desire to play things chill suggests a different sort of trap than we're used to hearing about from him.","As he stares down a one-year jail sentence for attempting to purchase machine guns from a federal agent in a Walgreens parking lot, T.I. makes a record based on the assumption that everything's going to be all right for him-- emotionally and financially. Rihanna and Ludacris are among the guests.

Nobody Knows Anything: DFA Presents Supersoul Recordings,Various Artists,by: Douglas Wolk,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd3dabf31b7dc7155ee0/1:1/w_160/8ed3b4fa.jpg,2008-10-01 06:00:05,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12269-nobody-knows-anything-dfa-presents-supersoul-recordings/,Death From Abroad,"Supersoul is a Berlin-based label that's been releasing dance tracks on vinyl and via the internet for a couple of years; it's run by Xaver Naudascher, who has a hand in almost every song on this 2xCD retrospective, either as producer or editor. The label favors modish, retro electronic sounds-- squelchy old analog synths, together-in-electric-dreams sequencers, slightly off-kilter live drums or the fake handclaps of ancient, dusty chips. This music's native format is the 12"", and it's meant for mixing rather than at-home listening, which means it sounds great under two conditions: At very high volumes, and in small doses. But this isn't a mix: It's a two-hour-plus sequence of long pieces whose entire content can mostly be extrapolated from their first minute or so. The bulk of them are instrumentals, and the vocals in the rest are strictly pro forma. (Plastique de Rev gets some cheerleaders to chant ""Resist! Resist! We know you are pissed!""; Rosalind does a weak-tea Björk impression on the fourth installment of Mogg & Naudascher's ""Moon Unit"" series.) If you listen to it as an album, it doles out its rewards stingily. Every five or 10 minutes, you get a tiny little hook, like the three-note digital whine that anchors Strangelets' ""Riot on Planet 10"" in both the versions included here. There's a reasonable amount of formal variety on Nobody Knows Anything-- track by track, it shifts from convincing Italo-disco emulation to convincing electro emulation to convincing acid house emulation--but it's really most fun heard a single track at a time. The best piece here, Naudascher's ""Motor City"", seems to be so called because it borrows its central synth tone from Kevin Saunderson's old Detroit techno records; Naudascher's witty variation on the formula is cramming it end-to-end with showy drum fills that wander around the stereo field. If it had appeared on a compilation with neon smiley faces on its sleeve in 1989, DJs would get credibility points for pulling it out now. The selling point for a lot of Nobody Knows Anything's potential American audience is the DFA imprimatur (it's actually on the sub-label Death From Abroad), but this is the only significant stumble in that fine label's discography so far. Virtually everything here is a solid, nostalgic genre exercise: It sounds good because it sounds just like the kind of electronic records they don't make any more. But not one of these tracks lingers as a composition or upends the assumptions of a genre the way DFA singles from ""Beat Connection"" to ""Happy House"" have in the past. This is exactly the kind of dance music DFA once looked like it was meant to rescue us from: Unimpeachable but totally inbred, made for listeners who know exactly what electronic subgenres they like but can't name any artists working in them, bounded by the history of electronic dance music but never reaching beyond it.","The selling point for a lot of Nobody Knows Anything's potential American audience is the DFA imprimatur (it's actually on the sub-label Death From Abroad), but this collection from Berlin's Supersoul favors the modish, retro electronic sounds that James Murphy et al. once combated.

Some Are Lakes,Land of Talk,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd145e6ef95969322fa4/1:1/w_160/0ecfde0a.jpg,2008-10-01 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12235-some-are-lakes/,Saddle Creek,"As a newly-minted touring member of sprawling indie behemoth Broken Social Scene, Elizabeth Powell certainly has her work cut out for her. But she's not so green. Land of Talk, the band she fronts, debuted in 2006 with the well-received ""super"" EP Applause Cheer Boo Hiss, on which Powell steered well clear of the hushed pop ruminations of Emily Haines or Feist. She opted instead for steely, tightly-coiled guitar music you can see your breath in. Produced by man of the moment Justin Vernon (aka Bon Iver), Some Are Lakes, Land of Talk's proper full-length debut, is a clear-eyed expansion on the post-hardcore bridge Powell began constructing two years ago, the one that stretches between today's Montreal and the Seattle era that birthed Pretty Girls Make Graves. And while just as thorny and gnarled in parts as its bruising predecessor, Some Are Lakes' has more to offer aurally-- its calms are ultimately more haunting and compelling than its many storms. Opener ""Yuppy Flu"" arrives on a current of drums and bass before splashing into Powell's icicle guitar gusts, the three locking horns later in a stretch of white-knuckle harmonic interplay that sets the bar high very early. Unfortunately, save for the jounce of ""Young Bridge"" or poppy crispness of the title track, that stretch is one of the few moments wherein Powell's rocking doesn't feel a bit ho-hum, like territory not worth revisiting. ""The Man Who Breaks Things (Dark Shuffle)"" is a chain of minor-chord jangle without any release, while ""Give Me Back My Heart Attack"" is a wiry mess of crushed glass dissonance that hints at Sonic Youth as much as tireless punk maelstrom ""Corner Phone"" does. All three tracks contain flashes where Powell's pipes-- arguably as knee-buckling as those of her antecedents inside the BSS stratosphere-- feel fenced-in by racket. Because as satisfying as older rockers like ""Speak To Me Bones"" or even new jam ""Got A Call"" prove to be, it can feel like you're fighting for affection from these songs. Which is exactly why the Fleetwood Mac-meets-Afghan Whigs soul-pop of ""It's Okay"" is worth returning to time and again. Instantly inviting, Powell's nighttime vocals are pushed up front and left to float, weightless. As violent, plaintive, and ultimately conflicted as anything she's already written (""I know how to kill but I hate how it feels.""), many of Powell's lyrical sketches are of the blood red, open-heart-surgery variety, a word set her producer knows well. You could in fact argue that Vernon played a hand in sanding down Land of Talk's edges, mostly to the album's betterment. As on, for instance, the closer ""Troubled"", an acoustic heartbreaker sung partly in French that was actually recorded at the same hunting cabin Vernon recorded his deep woods opus For Emma, Forever Ago. It's a song with no desire to keep you at a distance or leave you standing outside. That feels pretty good.","Now a touring member of Broken Social Scene, Land of Talk leader Elizabeth Powell enlists Justin Vernon of Bon Iver for production assistance on the band's first proper full-length, and the result is a mix of the debut EP's wiry rock and affecting acoustic tracks.

"Blood, Looms and Blooms",Leila,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd3eeb335119a49ece2c/1:1/w_160/f3b02fdb.jpg,2008-10-01 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12270-blood-looms-and-blooms/,Warp,"When Warp signed the London-based Iranian DJ, musician, and producer Leila Arab to their already impressive roster, it was a smart choice for a label that has always successfully supported progressive electronic music with pop sensibilities. Leila's third album, Blood, Looms and Blooms, fits this theme well while retaining an individuality that sets it apart from its contemporaries. Featuring collaborations with notable vocalists, such as former Tricky partner Martina Topley-Bird and Specials frontman Terry Hall, this album fuses the personalities of its varied guests with an adventurous palette of sound. The combination lifts the music off familiar ground, revealing Leila as an artist unafraid to take risks that tug her further from the popular radar than would be the case if she chose to take a less-challenging path. It is the exquisite attention to the possibility, behavior, and character of sound that makes Blood, Looms and Blooms an accomplished piece of work. Leila's years of experience as a live DJ and programmer (she has recorded music on Aphex Twin's label and done live re-mixing and engineering for Björk, as well as supporting her with a DJ slot earlier this year) really come into play here. Every single noise, no matter how small in the mix, appears to be heavily treated and subjected to radical EQ-ing-- taking advantage of the opportunities offered by the Logic computer program she favors. These far-reaching, assured explorations of sound are particularly breathtaking on the album's first single, ""Mettle"", which is also one of the few exclusively instrumental tracks. The dark mood and layered rhythmic sparring is uncannily reminiscent of fellow label mate Flying Lotus, and weaves a sample of a dripping faucet that has been sequenced to sound like a beat into the tough fibres of other pleasingly combative lower frequencies. Another highlight is ""Daisies, Cats and Spacemen"", where Leila's sister, Roya Arab, provides striking vocals and lyrics, which are weighted with imagery of ancient cities and ""filthy footmarks reflecting tear-filled skies."" Blood, Looms And Blooms manages to feel strikingly singular despite being such a patchwork of different personalities, from the Beck-like indie feel of ""Little Acorns"" to the IDM-influenced ""Carplos"" to the uplifting accessibility of ""Deflect"". It's fitting that Leila's magical realism-evoking press photographs play on a Frida Kahlo-meets-crazed inventor concept. With this album she has created an experiment of enormous sonic range and openness-- at 14 tracks this leaves a lot of room in which to expand, yet the sound never strays from its essential logic and reveals something new at every turn. Leila herself has suggested that her ability to weld together so many ideas-- which may well come across as cluttered under the influence of someone else's ear and imagination-- could have been influenced by her initial refugee status upon in the UK with her family, following the Iranian revolution of 1979. In a recent interview she reflected on this idea, ""I realised very early on that people don't really belong anywhere. That's what gives me the freedom to do any kind of music...I don't feel any commitment or loyalty to anything. My commitment is to noise.""","One of the early 1990s forgotten mavericks, Leila Arab-- who has worked with Aphex Twin and Björk-- returns with a Warp-released album featuring collaborations with former Tricky partner Martina Topley-Bird and Specials frontman Terry Hall.

Murs for President,Murs,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd48abf31b7dc7155ef6/1:1/w_160/7db29c82.jpg,2008-10-01 06:00:02,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12277-murs-for-president/,Warner Bros.,"Mainstream hip-hop has little time for ordinary dudes. It works inversely to the right wing's O'Reilly-spearheaded, Palin-nominating faux-populism: Heads don't want candidates just like them, anti-elite, down-to-earth, and on your level. They want linguistically supernatural battlers, colossal egos with something to prove and plenty to back it up with, long-striding titans who own a dozen of something you'll never even be let into the dealership to look at. L.A. underground stalwart Murs doesn't really fit under any of these categories: He's subtly smart instead of look-at-me clever, cocky enough to stand his ground but humble enough to admit his faults and frustrations, expressing himself with an eccentric persona that has no time for thuggish swagger or conspicuous consumption (unless his action figure collection counts). On an indie, that might make you another voice striving to be heard above a crowd; on a major it makes you some kind of bizarre anomaly. That's why Murs for President is such a weird album to listen to in a strictly critical sense, where it stands as a more-or-less average release-- albeit in a year when being average means you stand a good chance at releasing one of the better rap records of the last couple of months. You could place some share of the blame on the whole platinum-bid major-label nature of the album, where Murs' unpretentious style is undercut by commercial concerns, complete with one of those will.i.am obvious-sample productions (Al Hirt's ""Green Hornet"" theme on ""Lookin' Fly"") and a phoned-in Snoop Dogg guest verse (""Time Is Now""). And there's not as much eccentricity and adventurousness as there was five years ago, when he rapped about skateboarding and antidepressants on his must-have Definitive Jux album The End of the Beginning. Most of the subject matter on Murs for President is a bit more workaday, mostly sticking to complaints about rap's creative decline, stories of what it's like to tour 200 days a year, and especially relationship issues-- four consecutive tracks near the end of the album are about love and breakups, which get a bit exhausting without someone like Felt-mate Slug to act as a snotty foil. But Murs' strengths are hard to undercut: He thrives on basic honesty, everyday relatability, and a plainspokenness that makes you wonder if Ice Cube had another chill, smart-assed MC cousin besides Del. His charm is still intact-- teaching rap history and sociology without condescension on ""The Science""; letting pent-up frustration dissipate into gratitude for his life as an artist on ""Can It Be (Half a Million Dollars and 18 Months Later)""; cracking wise on ""Breakthrough"" about working at Target or Best Buy for the employee discount if the album flops. He also maintains his status as a strong storyteller with a good eye for character, like he does on ""Think You Know Me"", where he steps into the roles of three different people who might be considered gang-bangers by outside sources and comes up with sympathetic characters-- a South Central youth advisor, an ex-felon frustrated at his limited job prospects, a hard-working Latino family man and business owner. And you could do worse than the collection of passable beats here. Frequent collaborator 9th Wonder contributes three solid tracks (""I'm Innocent"", ""Love and Appreciate II"", and ""Breakthrough"") that, along with this summer's worthwhile freebie Sweet Lord, prove their long working partnership still has a lot of life in it. Up-and-comer Scoop Deville turns in a couple productions-- ""The Science"", which pairs up a hard-charging beat with ethereal flutes, and the early 70s Motown Michael Jackson cut-up on ""Can It Be""-- that sound more like the work of a sample-slaying thirtysomething vet than a dude born in the 80s. Throw in Niggaracci's gospel arm-waver on ""Time Is Now"", DJ Khalil's funk-bounce acid rock on ""Road Is My Religion"", and a couple solid-enough g-funk throwbacks from Nottz (""Think You Know Me""; ""Me and This Jawn""), and you've got a pretty decent backbone for a straightforward hip-hop album. Yeah, Murs for President could be a bit better. It falters next to most of the albums Murs has released over the last few years, and it isn't even the best album he's done this year (that'd be Sweet Lord). But I hope he succeeds with it anyways, just to prove that there's still room for an unpretentious gimmick-free everyman in commercial hip-hop. It sounds like Murs is speaking from experience on ""I'm Innocent"" when he proclaims during the intro: ""Look-- don't ever let the fact that you can't be perfect stop you from doing your best."" Don't let the fact that Murs for President isn't perfect keep you from picking it up, either.","Thriving on basic honesty, everyday relatability, and plainspokenness, Murs is a true populist in a major-label hip-hop world of supernatural egos and personas.

The Power of Negative Thinking: B-Sides and Rarities,The Jesus and Mary Chain,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd4aeb335119a49ece4b/1:1/w_160/60397528.jpg,2008-10-01 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12278-the-power-of-negative-thinking-b-sides-and-rarities/,Rhino,"As life-long students of rock'n'roll history and mythology, the Jesus and Mary Chain are smart enough to know that the best way to ruin a happy reunion is to actually make a reunion album. So, since the notoriously combative Jim and William Reid put aside their family feuding-- which had initially deep-sixed their band back in 1998-- to stage a return at Coachella in April 2007, they've done everything short of a new album to keep the Jesus and Mary Chain a relevant, ongoing concern. They contributed their songs and voices to sibling Linda's Sister Vanilla band; they debuted a lone new track, ""All Things Must Pass"" on Letterman only to shunt it off to an episode of ""Heroes""; and now, they're resorting to a time-honored stalling tactic: releasing a box set, The Power of Negative Thinking, that gathers 81 non-album A-sides, plus their entire discography of B-sides, demos, and covers. Of course, it could be that the main reason the Reids are holding out on a new JAMC album is that everyone's been doing the work for them-- their influence continues to permeate the recorded output of NME-approved buzz bands (the Raveonettes, Black Rebel Motorcycle Club), indie rock iconoclasts (see: the Magnetic Fields' Distortion, Liars' spot-on 2007 homage ""Freak Out""), and up and comers (Vivian Girls, Crystal Stilts, A Place to Bury Strangers). It's a most fitting fate for a band that never made a secret out of their own hero worship, but it says a great deal about how adept JAMC were at melding and welding their own obvious influences together that they've become an instantly recognizable reference point in their own right. The Jesus and Mary Chain were a post-punk band in the truest sense of the term, feeding a litany of classic 60s signposts-- the Beach Boys, Phil Spector, Bob Dylan, the Velvet Underground-- through punk's rudimentary skill set and noise-terror insolence. They weren't the first band to bastardize the Beach Boys' sunny surf pop, but where the Ramones simply cranked up and sped up the guitar riffs, the Mary Chain took power chords out of the equation altogether, promoting distortion from mere special effect to feature attraction. However, perhaps The Power of Negative Thinking's greatest revelation is that this seemingly primordial sound actually didn't come about naturally: The first track we hear is a 1983 demo, ""Up Too High"", wherein the Reids display an affinity for New Order's immediate post-Joy Division output (circa ""Ceremony""). So when the band's first official single, ""Upside Down"" follows with a radically reoriented aesthetic-- candy-coated melody plus skull-splitting feedback, set to original drummer Bobby Gillespie's tom-tom clubbing-- that would come to define the band's early sound, its appearance here approximates the same outta-nowhere effect that the song first had in 1984. But as pure a statement as ""Upside Down"" was, the flipside finds a band still sorting out its influences: as the first entry in what would become a deep catalogue of B-side covers, the goth-garage grind through Syd Barrett's ""Vegetable Man"" marks one of the few times the JAMC pulled from a source that wasn't aligned with the continuum of American cool; perhaps not coincidentally, the track also marks the rare instance where Jim Reid would break out of his deadpan demeanour and truly lose his shit on record. By the time of 1985's debut Psychocandy, the JAMC had struck a singular balance between melody and menace, and the outtakes from the era (taking up the rest of Negative Thinking's first disc) mostly confirm what we already knew: That ""Just Like Honey"", ""Taste of Cindy"", ""Cut Dead"", ""You Trip Me Up"", and so on (all presented here in alternate acoustic arrangements) are no less disarming as pop songs when stripped of Psychocandy's intentionally provocative production. But from a B-side standpoint, the most interesting period for the Jesus and Mary Chain came during the transition from Psychocandy's sinister squall to the more cleanly presented pop tones of 1987's Darklands, wherein the departure of the Primal Scream-bound Gillespie heralded the Reids' first flirtation with drum machines and sequencers (not all that radical a shift given the early material's reliance on metronomic repetition). In contrast to MTV-ready singles like ""April Skies"" and ""Happy When It Rains"", the B-sides from this period lean heavily on the Reids' fascination with primitive American rock'n'roll, in the form of both direct covers (a Suicide-inspired take on Bo Diddley's ""Who Do You Love"", two punked-up rips through the Beach Boys' ""Surfin' USA"") and, more entertainingly, twisted tribute tracks (""Kill Surf City"", ""Bo Diddley Is Jesus"")-- all of which suggest that the Reids treat their idols the same way a grade-schooler treats their first crush: concealing their love with adversarial aggression. Post-Darklands, the Mary Chain's albums hewed ever closer to prevailing UK indie trends, from the mechanized synth-pop of 1989's Automatic to the proto-Britpop guitar rock of 1992's Honey's Dead, before settling into the relaxed countrified groove of 1994's Stoned and Dethroned. Likewise, the accompanying B-sides were less of an outlet for the Reids' extreme impulses (a corrosive cover of Prince's ""Alphabet Street"" notwithstanding) and more a spillover from the albums proper; as such, Negative Thinking's third and fourth discs can either be viewed as a testament to the brothers' consistency or their stubborn refusal to venture outside standard blues scales. The popular singles from this era aren't represented here in any form, but then you don't really miss them because each boasts a reasonable facsimilie: in lieu of ""Head On"" there's the motorik pop of ""Subway""; instead of ""Reverence"", dig the sinister cover of the 13th Floor Elevators' ""Reverberation (Doubt)""; while ""Why'd You Want Me"" (from the soundtrack to Encino Man!) plays like a dry run for 1994's Hope Sandoval duet ""Sometimes Always"". With 1998's Munki, the band went out with arguably their most eclectic and gleefully impetuous set since Psychocandy, but castaway tracks like ""Easylife, Easylove"" and ""40,000k"" remained beholden to the Stonesy stoner-rock that defined much of their post-1990 output. Then again, the Reids sound so comfortable in that mode, and the melodies so easy-flowin', it's hard to begrudge them. With these closing selections, Negative Thinking further underscores the irony that the brothers fell out at a time when their music was more traditionally ""together"" than it had ever been. B-sides and rarities collections are by nature geared toward die-hard fans, but given that a fair share of this material has already surfaced on previous compilations Barbed Wire Kisses, The Sound of Speed and Hate Rock 'n' Roll, and given the Mary Chain's carefully controlled aesthetic, there are few surprises here for close followers of the band. But then Negative Thinking is not necessarily meant for them: With its handsome hard-cover packaging, clear-plastic paper-stock photo galleries, candid liner-note interviews (conducted in early 2007), and ridiculously detailed Pete Frame-drawn family tree poster, the set provides a handy opportunity for newbies to play catch-up on the band's history-- and for anyone who first came into contact with the Mary Chain via the closing credits to Lost in Translation, only to be scared off by Psychocandy's torrential noise, the acoustic renditions of that album's best songs thus serve as convenient points of access to the Reids' hopelessly romantic/romantically hopeless worldview.","The Reid Brothers punctuate their comeback with a box set that gathers 81 non-album A-sides, plus their entire discography of B-sides, demos, and covers.

Shall Noise Upon,Apollo Sunshine,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd1113d197565213b46b/1:1/w_160/5a5cf7b5.jpg,2008-09-30 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12232-shall-noise-upon/,World's Fair,"In the age of the mp3, you have to like a band that respects your attention span and ability to sit through a 38-minute album, giving you something that works as a whole beyond its considerable highlights. Apollo Sunshine does that on their third LP, turning out an eclectic and thoughtfully sequenced running order that runs the gamut from pastoral folk to distorted-everything blues-punk to Latin-tinged indie pop to orchestral interludes. It's indie rock that wants to be and is a dozen things at once, and the band members have the songs to make it work. Jeremy Black, Sam Cohen, and Jesse Gallagher first started the band in Boston, but have since done most of their recording in the Catskills, including a bit of work for this record at Dave Fridmann's Tarbox Studios. The members swap instruments in the studio, trade off vocals, and generally record in a communal spirit, a feeling augmented by co-producer Quentin Stoltzfus and a small army of guest musicians, who help give the album its widely varied sonic stamp. One of the album's most stunning sequences is the run from ""Happiness"" through ""Money"", right in the middle. ""Happiness"" is an orchestral instrumental full of Beatlesque cello and rich woodwinds, ""We Are Born When We Die"" is an r&b track sucked into an icy black hole of doom, ""The Funky Chamberlain (Who Begot Who)"" brings the r&b to the fore with a funky beat, Rhodes piano and a long, syncopated melody, and ""Money"" is an acoustic folk fantasy about the disappearance of currency. The band sells all of those things skillfully, and there are other standout tracks scattered throughout the album. ""Fog and Shadow"" is a lazy campfire sing-along, while ""Singing to the Earth (To Thank Her for You)"" recalls one of the Ira Kaplan-sung songs from a Yo La Tengo album. They share Yo La Tengo's fondness for mixing shy, retiring indie pop with moments of ear-blistering noise, which you get a bit of during the backwards guitar outburst of ""666: The Coming of the New World Government"", a song that feels a bit like a 21st century update of George Harrison's ""It's All Too Much"". Then there's ""Honestly"", a song that sounds preposterous on paper but is actually fantastic. It has a stomping Phil Spector bass drum driving it, but it's surrounded by Latin percussion and a Mexican-influenced horn arrangement. The band's close harmonies cut from Spanish to English, and the flute in the background sounds alternately like it got lost from an English folk song or an English prog rock album. Dig the ultra-brief slide guitar solo, too. Apollo Sunshine have been driving at this sound since the beginning, and this album represents a certain maturation of their ability to construct a record. Don't read mature to mean dry or dull, though-- this is still exuberant music that celebrates its sudden shifts in direction. Shall Noise Upon is a great record, and an impossible one to digest in just one sitting. That's hardly a problem, though, because coming back to it is so rewarding.","Running the gamut from pastoral folk to distorted-everything blues-punk to Latin-tinged indie pop to orchestral interludes, this Boston-area band manages to make eclecticism a virtue on their first album in three years.

Southern Storm,Krisiun,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd12ea9e61561daa7622/1:1/w_160/626df9ac.jpg,2008-09-30 06:00:04,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12233-southern-storm/,Century Media,"The most ""metal"" metal show I've ever attended was Krisiun. Other death metal heavies were on the bill, but Krisiun blew them away. Three Brazilian brothers-- drummer Max and guitarist Moyses Kolesne and and bassist/vocalist Alex Camargo, who kept his mother's surname-- plugged into basic amp setups, then proceeded to destroy. Moyses' hands were blurs: tremolo picking, pinch harmonics, arpeggios flying up and down like brushstrokes. Electricity, hair, and light lashed the air. Volleys of riffs streamed from the brothers in unison; growls seemingly came not from Camargo but from Satan. Krisiun have had mixed success committing this energy to tape. Partially to blame are varying production values over the band's 18-year existence. (2004's Bloodshed comes closest to capturing the band's feral live sound.) Also, music based on pure force often doesn't translate well to record. (Minor Threat's Complete Discography and Slayer's Reign in Blood are notable exceptions.) Krisiun are not an especially deep band. Their power trio format doesn't allow for lush, layered compositions. Their ESL lyrics stick to metal's usual themes-- anti-religion, mythology, apocalyptic visions. As the band said in a recent interview with about.com, ""We are death metal to death, Krisiun never wimps out, we're always fast, brutal and true."" In other words, the sound is the message. But what a sound it is! Critics of Krisiun mostly cite their relentlessness. It can be a boon; live, the band resembles a euphonious jackhammer, and its first full-length, 1995's Black Force Domain, suggests Kreator on a binge of speed and guitar lessons. However, the relentlessness can get monotonous. Over the years, Krisiun have put more space into their songs, which has ironically made them more brutal. Now their signature is precise machine-gun riffs punctuated by short pauses. The sound is martial; Max Kolesne's playing often resembles drum rudiments on steroids. 2006's AssassiNation featured surprisingly catchy songs and steely production, both of which Southern Storm pumps up further. The sound is imposingly massive, though the stereo onslaught is strange for a trio. Still, studio polish adds atmosphere to the aggression. While Krisiun's ingredients haven't changed, they're more spaced out than ever. ""Slaying Steel"" alternates bursts of tritones with unaccompanied ride cymbals; such nakedness lends unpredictability to a band not known for subtlety. Max Kolesne has become a much more supple drummer. In ""Minotaur"", he deftly switches beats underneath an otherwise relentless riff. ""Sons of Pest"" downshifts into a mid-paced march that's almost groovy, then leaps into insistent syncopations, rolls, and a whirling dervish of a solo by Moyses. The guitarist's performance is disciplined but virtuosic. His solo in ""Slaying Steel"" pours forth like molten lava. In ""Sentenced Morning"", he unleashes twisting runs that seemingly intertwine like DNA strands. ""Bleeding Offers"" has brief but incendiary blues licks. Sawtoothed arpeggios cut through ""Origin of Terror"", leading to a torrentially fluid solo and a hail of blastbeats. ""Massacre Under the Sun"" closes with a flurry of Buckethead-esque whole tones, screaming pinch harmonics, and ripping shredding. This tour de force is, quite simply, the state of the art in metal. Southern Storm's only misstep is a straight read of ""Refuse/Resist"", by compatriots Sepultura. The cover isn't bad, but it's unnecessary. Sepultura long ago ceded their title of Brazil's top metal band to Krisiun. Lacking two crucial founding members and living off their back catalogue, Sepultura have passed their expiration date. Krisiun, on the other hand, only improve with time. Unlike Sepultura's exploitation of nu-metal and native Brazilian sounds, Krisiun remain unalloyed-- ""fast, brutal, and true.""","Building on the catchy songs and steely production of 2006's AssassiNation, with studio polish adding atmosphere to the aggression, Krisiun remain one of Brazil's most powerful metal bands.

WLIB AM: King of the Wigflip,Madlib,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd1c5e6ef95969322fb9/1:1/w_160/d5fd6bfe.jpg,2008-09-30 06:00:03,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12242-wlib-am-king-of-the-wigflip/,BBE,"Few independent labels are as effective with brand-extension and identity-building as Stones Throw. There's two simple reasons for that: First, they've mastered the art of the label-spanning sampler/compilation, where you're always guaranteed a mixed bag but are also given a good idea of how far they're willing to stretch their roster's personae-- blunted abstractionists, swaggering street cats, goofballs with Moogs. Second, Stones Throw artists like to hand the ball over to Madlib. It's usually a good idea to hire a producer who can build a cohesive, identifiable sonic thumbprint even while grounding himself in everything from reggae and dub (Blunted in the Bomb Shelter Mix) to Primo-stash soul jazz (Shades of Blue: Madlib Invades Blue Note) to fusion (five volumes of his Mind Fusion mix series) to Bollywood scores (Beat Konducta in India)-- dude may be a lot of things, but predictable ain't exactly one of them. So it works out pretty well to select him as the man behind the final installment of BBE's Beat Generation series, which was inaugurated (fittingly enough) by Champion Sound collaborator and close associate Jay Dee/J Dilla on 2001's Welcome 2 Detroit. Like Dilla, Madlib has the versatility to pace a solid, multifaceted album-length mix without making it sound monotonous, using his traditional mix of diverse beat styles and judiciously placed comic interludes. His range between weeded-out beats for the basement and Hennessyed-up club anthems runs rampant, often on consecutive tracks that are separated by little else than a brief interstitial comedy skit. The glimmering fusion-oid 1970s slow jam of Stacy Epps' buttery ""The Way That I Live"" jumps ahead a decade or three to the tinny, stuttering drum-machine electro of Murs' ""Ratrace"", the woozy piano soul of Georgia Anne Muldrow's ""The Plan Pt. 1"" segues into a sure-footed slab of disco-funk on Defari's ""Gamble on Ya Boy"", and the faded Kodachrome strings, dusty beats, and ambient muffled shouts on Talib Kweli feature ""What It Do"" melt into the inebriated wall of bass on Roc 'C' and Oh No's ""Take That Money""-- which subsequently drops right into the super-minimalist lunchroom table thump-clap of Frank N Dank's ""Drinks Up!"" If that sounds like a disorienting mess on paper, the good news is that the anything-goes AM-radio theme of King of the Wigflip justifies the stylistic diversions-- though like most trips through the Stones Throw rolodex, the scattershot quality of the lyricism is a nagging side effect. I'll go to bat for the no-nonsense thug-rap of Guilty Simpson, who sounds at home in the brassy triumph of ""Blow the Horns on 'Em"" and the claustrophobic drone of ""Go!"", and between Kweli, West Coast indie stalwards Defari and Murs and Organized Konfusion vet Prince Po (""The Thang-Thang""), there's a lot of experienced MCs holding down a substantial portion of the mix. And when things turn towards R&B, like they do with ""The Way That I Live"" or Frenza's Fender Rhodes-drenched love-as-weed/weed-as-love cut ""Yo Yo Affair Pt. 1 & 2"", it's reliably sleek. But there's rough patches: M.E.D.'s all-exclamation-points verse on ""The Ox (805)"" is undercut by Poke's guest spot, where he opens his verse with the questionable line ""It smell like shit at night/my peoples do a whole lot of shit at night"". Karriem Riggins' loosely-introspective ""Life"" runs on a brief string of contradictory lines (""hip hop, jazz music/Thanksgiving, the best time for family/crack pipes, dirty needles/the government lying to the people"") that might be a bit more effective if he came up with more of them instead of just repeating the same ones over and over. And even though Madlib and his brother Oh No are usually as reliable on the mic as they are behind the boards, ""I Want It Back"", their track as the Professionals, feels like they're on autopilot: it might be all right if it's the first time you've heard someone invoke the whole ""hey remember Midnight Marauders"" nostalgia impulse in the process of complaining about how hip hop's been artistically diminished-- more likely, it's the hundredth. That aside, WLIB AM has a better hit-to-miss ratio than just about any radio station you can name anyways. The freeform non-commercial radio throwback aspect to King of the Wigflip gives it this odd feeling of a really skilled bit of fucking around, a steel-trap mind hard at work with a cohesive eclecticism concealed inside what sounds like an impulsive stream of consciousness. Some might hear this as a DJ playing records only he hears the connections between. Heads know better, of course-- on this frequency, all the pieces fit together.","The final installment of BBE's Beat Generation series-- inaugurated by the late J Dilla-- finds Madlib using his traditional mix of diverse beat styles and judiciously placed comic interludes to pace a solid, multifaceted album-length mix without making it sound monotonous.

End Titles...Stories for Film,UNKLE,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd2eeb335119a49ece0f/1:1/w_160/0ef1fe22.jpg,2008-09-30 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12259-end-titlesstories-for-film/,Surrender All,"On this year's Mixtape About Nothing, Wale boasted that ""hype gets you Rick Mirer'd every single time,"" but he might want to go back to the drawing board with that one (and maybe go with Ron Powlus for the joke)-- the former Golden Dome golden boy still managed to parlay his pedigree into an uninspiring, but lengthy eight-year NFL career as a serviceable backup on generally god-awful Seahawks, Lions, and Bears teams. This sort of explains James Lavelle-- it's hard to imagine any real-life situation where Psyence Fiction somehow justified every expectation that preceded it, but thanks in part to the very memory of those expectations, UNKLE has still managed an improbable decade-plus of survival. It's a pretty sad day when the self-promoter extraordinaire Lavelle starts soft-pedaling his projects, and the gist of End Titles...Stories for Film is that we shouldn't confuse it as being ""the new UNKLE album,"" but rather as a clearinghouse of collaborative songs coming from various projects-- among them BMW commercials (""Trouble in Paradise""), Alex Grazioli's indie film Odyssey In Rome, as well as the cut-out bin from previous UNKLE recording sessions. To put it another way, it's formatted almost the exact same way the previous UNKLE LPs were, and no one's going to give a shit because DJ Shadow, Thom Yorke, Kool G Rap, and Jason Newsted have absolutely nothing to do with it. At the very least, End Titles is far more cohesive than its birthing process would imply. Yeah, the sheer statistics are daunting (22 tracks, 75 minutes), but it flows in that Sufjan way where interstitial noodling makes the longer, more trad formats fit in a mesmeric manner-- End Titles rewards just about any amount of listening investment equally, and it completely lacks sharp edges. It has acoustic guitars shaved of brassy treble, electrics coasting on reverb, and vocals blunted with foggy echo blanketing slowly modulating melodic lines. Perhaps befitting its nature as a presumptive soundtrack, it's a long listen, but not necessarily a difficult one. Of course, the reason for this cohesion is a problem that spawned perhaps out of inevitably during the sessions for War Stories; somewhere along the line, maybe intimidated by the genre-mashing present he envisioned on Psyence Fiction, Lavelle just sort of gave up, dropped any pretense of hip-hop influence and became an overseer of a downtempo and overcast Brit-rock, bland and grey as a London sky or a London steak. Needless to say, the lead singer from South feels right at home here. There's actually a sort of Curious Case of Benjamin Button shit going on here-- Psyence Fiction anticipated omnivorous fanhood in 2008 more than the actual pop music, and now Lavelle's project has backslid into 2001, when he cosigned on his first project with South's From Here On In, an album with a remarkably similar makeup of asleep-at-the-wheel instrumentals and hookless, murky songs that each run about a minute too long. Befitting his background, most of the tracks here have a percussive depth, drum tracks more breakbeat-ish than four-on-the-floor and the bass riffs usually more memorable than the ones on guitar. But the problem isn't so much about having relative unknowns as vocalists, but rather how nearly all of them (Lavelle included) play to the foggy material herein. Friend-til-the-end Josh Homme and Black Mountain make relatively notable appearances, but both of them are far more suited to the desert than the tundra of Lavelle productions. The Homme vehicle ""Chemical"" is bled cold and clammy and while ""Blade in the Black"" is perhaps the most striking cut, with a nearly soulful performance from soppy folk artist Gavin Clark and some intriguing horn stabs, but the song itself needs grease, not a coating of plexiglass. Letting Ferrara sing on obvious album exit point ""Open Your Eyes"" may be a quid pro quo, but if there was ever a time to rekindle your love with AutoTune, it's hearing him warble like Eddie Murphy's Dylan-via-Buckwheat skit over charmless coffee-house strumming. You would figure that the bite-sized instrumental portions represent a chance for them to experiment, not being beholden to song structure, but instead there's the old tautology of strings=cinematic, so thus for cinema, cue the strings. But in the end, the reason that UNKLE is likely seeking soundtrack work is the reason End Titles fails to engage as a singular experience: they've always been more about the Rolodex than the Roland and now, they're asking for an additional disconnect of ""I guess you had to see the movie."" Psyence Fiction may have been a blockbuster, overhyped or not, but at this point, UNKLE's franchise is strictly straight-to-video.","The latest from James Lavelle is being soft-pedaled as just a clearinghouse of collaborative songs coming from various projects rather than the new UNKLE project. Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme and Black Mountain are notable guests.

Snowflake Midnight,Mercury Rev,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd345e6ef95969322ff0/1:1/w_160/5ac1b02e.jpg,2008-09-30 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12265-snowflake-midnight/,Yep Roc,"This month, Mercury Rev celebrates the 10th anniversary of Deserter's Songs, the album that effectively rescued the band from oblivion and catapulted them to the frontlines of modern American music, earning them unprecedented critical plaudits, regular festival bookings, and a flood of phone calls for bassist-cum-producer Dave Fridmann's services. But while Deserter's Songs came as a pleasant shock both to newcomers and older fans more in tune with Mercury Rev's anarchic, feedback-blasted early work, the album's orchestro-rock lushness was anticipated by 1995's See You on the Other Side, an album that found de facto frontman Jonathan Donahue wrestling with his band's troubled history (marked by in-fighting, drugs, and major-label woes) and trying to harness its notoriously chaotic sound (which once got the group booted off Lollapalooza's second stage for being too loud) into something more everlasting. On See You's centerpiece track, ""Racing the Tide"", Donahue repeats the phrase, ""I'm so close, I'm almost inside,"" and with Deserter's Songs, Mercury Rev got there: A self-sufficient state that allows the band to hole themselves up in their remote Catskills digs and release increasingly conventional albums at their own relaxed pace every three or four years to a loyal fanbase that's willing to wait for them. The dark psyche-rock of 2001's All Is Dream followed, but starting with 2005's The Secret Migration it was sounding as if Mercury Rev had spent too much time on the inside, the real-life dramas and vivid New York state imagery that informed their most resonant work replaced by fairy-tale fantasias and pixie-dusted soft-rock surfaces that, in their quest to sound more mystical, robbed the band of its mystique. Oddly enough, the new Snowflake Midnight finds the band in a similar position as they were 10 years ago: Jumping ship from a crumbling pseudo-major-label (in this case, V2) to a new home (Yep Roc) and primed for reinvention after a trilogy of albums that pushed specific aesthetics (the turbulent psychedelia of the band's first three albums versus the more symphonic, classic-rock structures of albums four through six) to their limits. Their response to the situation is similar to that of some other art-rock contemporaries nearly a decade ago: in a sense, they've pulled a Kid A by turning down Sean ""Grasshopper"" Mackowiak's guitars, breaking down lyrics into mantric incantations, pulling the drumsticks out of Jeff Mercel's hands, and immersing themselves in electronic programming (spurred by experiments with an image/music randomizer program) in an effort to make Mercury Rev, well, more mercurial. But for Mercury Rev, the shift feels far less abrupt than Radiohead's deliberate anti-pop maneuver, partly because Donahue's childlike coo is still the focal point, and partly because they opt for tech-textures that are more comforting, if not downright anachronistic: The reverberating ""Born Slippy""-like piano chords that open ""Snowflake in a Hot World""; the Boards of Canada-style ambient swirls and childrens' laughter that form the center of ""Butterfly's Wing""; the ""Little Fluffy Clouds"" synth oscillations bubbling under ""Runaway Raindrop"". Had they tried something like this 10 years ago, Mercury Rev would've been branded as another rock band jumping on the electronica bandwagon; now, their adoption of these seemingly dated devices feels entirely consistent with their track record of mining the past for unlikely, unfashionable sources, from Dixieland jazz to Tin Pan Alley serenades. More than anything, the clicked-and-cut beats and fidgety sound effects are symbolic of the band's reignited sense of adventure and mischief, setting the serene scene on glitch-pop confections like ""Snowflake in a Hot World"" and ""Butterfly's Wing"" only to gradually intensify their drum-machined pitter-patter into bursts of propellered percussion to rousing effect. ""Senses on Fire"", meanwhile, is a song seemingly about exhilaration in and of itself, repeating its title over an electro-Krautrock synth bed before Donahue's playground taunt (""ready or not, here I come!"") sends the track into ecstatic overdrive. But the excitement proves short-lived: The cavernous ambience and tribal drum flourishes of ""People Are So Unpredictable (There's No Bliss Like Home)"" may evoke the 1991 Yerself Is Steam epic ""Sweet Oddysee of a Cancer Cell t'th' Center of Yer Heart"", but its prolonged, vaporous three-minute fade-out-- followed by the frosty, Vangelis-like interlude ""October Sunshine""-- signals Snowflake Midnight's meandering second act. While Mercury Rev's insular nature has allowed them to defy easy categorization and flavor-of-the-moment trends, it can also lead them astray: The slow-percolating synth build-up of ""Runaway Raindrop"" prepares us for a big pay-off; instead we get a spoken-word trip-hop break. And while the synthetic-handclapped lullaby ""Faraway from Cars"" would indicate that Mercury Rev are familiar with spiritual offspring like Animal Collective, it also shows they're blissfully ignorant of the fact that Arcade Fire explored the same theme of escapism using precisely the same vehicular metaphor on the superior ""No Cars Go"". What ultimately saves Snowflake Midnight from following The Secret Migration up the band's collective keister is the song positioned to serve as its climax, ""Dream of a Young Girl as a Flower"": The eight-minute track effectively fuses the band's cacophonous, orchestral and electronic impulses into an accelerated percussive surge, before the introduction of string effects redirects the song toward a surprisingly affecting finale. The song's late-game appearance underscores the fact that, while Mercury Rev's latest attempt at reinvention may not hit the mark as consistently as their previous try 10 years ago, its more inspired turns recapture that amorphous, curious quality that made them so intriguing in the first place. And the fact that Snowflake Midnight is being released concurrently with a web-only album of instrumental soundscapes, Strange Attractor, further reinforces the notion that the band's exploratory spirit has been rekindled. In other words, they're so close-- they're almost outside.","A decade after breakthrough LP Deserter's Songs, Mercury Rev are back where they were 10 years ago: Jumping ship from a crumbling pseudo-major-label and primed for reinvention after a trilogy of albums that pushed specific aesthetics to their limits.

We Global,DJ Khaled,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd0fea9e61561daa7619/1:1/w_160/ef6205e4.jpg,2008-09-29 06:00:05,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12230-we-global/,We the Best,"DJ Khaled is right, you guys. Pop music has been exceptionally global in recent years, whether it's New York guitar bands borrowing ideas from Africa, Sri Lankan-born singers from London keeping an ear to Brazilian favelas, Timbaland's space-age twists on bhangra going from ""Get Ur Freak On"" fresh to Hard Candy stale, or Heavy Metal in Baghdad. Kids in their bedrooms in Portland are making music influenced by German minimal techno. And instead of a British Invasion, bands from Scandinavian countries have found a place on U.S. listeners' iPods. None of which makes We Global any better-- as a catchphrase (basically what Khaled does on disc) or as an album. Whatever listeners around the world wanted to learn about Khaled's curatorship of the soaringly shallow Miami synth-rap sound, they could've gleaned from the Palestinian-American Miami radio and mixtape DJ's first LP, 2006's surprisingly coherent Listennn: The Album. If that wasn't enough, last year's rote We the Best gave us one A-list posse cut, ""We Takin' Over"", with the kind of unhinged Lil Wayne verse that made the rapper's current victory lap look all but foreordained. On We Global, Khaled surveys the world as if he owns it, too, but we provincial: Khaled owns Miami, or at least ""Miami"", an increasingly clumsily trodden musical destination he's ready and willing to run as far as it takes him. As usual, Khaled can be counted on for one star-studded summer jam, and that's first single ""Out Here Grindin'"", with another empty Akon earworm, plastic Runners synths, and Lil Boosie spelling out Khaled's slogan ""I.n.d.e.p.e.n.d.e.n.t.""-style. Boosie's weaselishly yawped half-verse outshines Rick Ross' thug autopilot, Plies' get-me-coppers rasp, We the Best signee Ace Hood's guttural bank boasts, and even Trick Daddy as shit-talking Miami elder statesman. Wayne's verse from the single isn't on the album; his personality is missed, if not his uncharacteristically pedestrian rhymes (""Regularly irregular,"" eh? Try eating fewer rappers, more fiber). Second single ""Go Hard"" is nearly as solid, with Kanye West confronting haters on behalf of ""the hood I'm from,"" alongside ""Good Life"" partner T-Pain. Here, West tests out the Auto-Tune effect he uses more memorably on Young Jeezy's great ""Put On"" and his own ""Love Lockdown"". The overall stylistic consistency that made Listennn unusual now makes for an exhausting hour. ""Go Ahead"" is what John Legend's ""Green Light"" might've been if it had been a hip-hop posse cut produced by the Runners instead of an R&B song produced by André 3000. On the garish Cool & Dre track ""I'm On"", Nas drops the political focus of Untitled to flash his expensive tastes and tell us (no, really) ""I need a vasectomy."" Timbaland protege and ""We Takin' Over"" producer Danja comes up with a slightly slinkier beat this time for ""She's Fine"", with Busta Rhymes out-nastying Missy Elliott and Sean Paul-- though really, this could've been made any time in the past few years. Jamaica gets better representation from Baby Cham, of ""Ghetto Story"" fame, whose siren-blaring collaboration with Rick Ross on ""Bullet"", is, unlike most of We Global, more impressive than its roster. Ross is on this thing four times. Fat Joe is twice. Just in case you thought Khaled's days of screaming out ""We the best"" were over, there's the title track, another Runners production with a lazy Trey Songz hook. On it, Khaled proclaims not just his newfound international status, but also his ongoing the-bestness. When producers the Inkredibles finally give us a break from sunburnt synths on soul-sampling ""Red Light"", the Game's bull charges connect even as his tendency toward name-dropping reaches new levels of self-parody (""Leonardo DiCaprio Da Vinci""). Not even the ever-reliable Bun B can save the second-tier rappers on ""Final Warning"", in which the Inkredibles go back to sounding like every other Khaled producer. Pitbull drops plenty of local references on finale ""Defend Dade"", but a more interesting defense might be to tell some of Florida's approximately 112,000 former felons they've been restored the right to vote (97,000 Floridians voted for Nader in 2000; Gore lost to Bush by 537 votes). Whatevs, we global now.","The Palestinian-American Miami radio and mixtape DJ follows the A-list ""We Takin' Over"" and his surprisingly coherent Listennn: The Album with a record lead by another outstanding posse cut and the Kanye West collab ""Go Hard"".

17 Musicians in Search of a Sound: Darfur,Bill Dixon,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd09ea9e61561daa7608/1:1/w_160/28b706b3.jpg,2008-09-29 06:00:04,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12225-17-musicians-in-search-of-a-sound-darfur/,AUM Fidelity,"Bill Dixon isn't a well-known name outside of free jazz circles, but he's been a part of those circles since the 1960s, when free jazz and open-ended improvisatory music came into their own as viable genres. Moreover, his trumpet and flugelhorn playing with Archie Shepp and Cecil Taylor helped shape the sound. He also excelled on the solo trumpet recordings he made in the first half of the 70s-- those latter recordings could be considered cousins of Anthony Braxton's solo sax work, but Dixon operated in much deeper creative and commercial isolation. He organized and produced the 1964 ""October Revolution in Jazz"" at Manhattan's Cellar Café, featuring Taylor and Shepp, Sun Ra, Jimmy Giuffre, Paul Bley, Roswell Rudd, Charles Moffatt, Steve Lacy, Alan Silva, and many others, and even attempted to organize the mid-60s wave of free musicians with the short-lived Jazz Composers Guild. He later became an educator, signing on as a music professor at Vermont's Bennington College, while recording sporadically with the likes of William Parker and Tony Oxley. There is perhaps no music that captures a more perfect combination of primal expression and intellectual thought than free jazz, and so it seems a fitting medium with which to address the ongoing war in Darfur (let's not do it the dignity of calling it a crisis, as we see it so often referred to). After all, what human endeavor so effortlessly combines intellectual justification and basic primal instinct as war? Dixon has formulated a sort of controlled burn for his large orchestra, which features seven horn players (himself included), six woodwinds, double bass, cello, drums, percussion, and vibes. The primary source of tension comes from the contrast between denseness and sparseness, and the balance Dixon strikes between the two seems predicated on keeping the listener guessing. The brutal build of ""Prelude"", for instance, begins as a soft conversation between woodwinds before evolving into a brass shouting match. The band comes together as the discord rises in volume and violence, finally reaching a point where it feels like it has to cut to silence. But it doesn't, instead growing louder and more dissonant for another 20 seconds. In this way, it echoes the conflict it's named for, a war that began with quietly given orders to kill that's since spawned an endless, static shouting match. The title track is a fine example of orchestrated chaos, with the band lurching through a series of apocalyptic swells and sparse, running skirmishes. It has the rhythm of battle-hanging dread followed by confusion, unexpected awkward silence, and deafening, disorganized noise. Darfur does these things so well that over the course of its diverse and challenging 56 minutes, one can't help but hear its statement on the war-- politicians seem to care about just enough to grandstand about it and then follow their words with a paucity of action. From a listener's standpoint, the project's tonal and textural variety and relatively simple organization makes it more approachable than a great deal of free music for newcomers to the genre, though it still takes a willingness to abandon usual structures. In fact, for its flow from violence to calm and back, it bears as much similarity to modern chamber works like Olivier Messiaen's ""Quartet for the End of Time"" as it does to Albert Ayler, Cecil Taylor and other free jazz luminaries. Whatever the associates, though, Dixon has created an outstanding work of modern jazz and political commentary.","There is perhaps no music that captures a combination of primal expression and intellectual thought more than free jazz, and so it seems a fitting medium with which to address the ongoing war in Darfur, as the esteemed Bill Dixon does here.

House With No Home,Horse Feathers,by: Stephen M.

There's not a non-string instrument between the three of them, unless you count their voices. The Portland trio is a distant cousin to groups like Chatham County Line, the Avett Brothers, and the Hackensaw Boys, only without the Appalachian influences. The traditions Horse Feathers draw from are vaguer and perhaps more recent, specifically Pacific Northwest indie (Peter Broderick has worked with Norfolk & Western and Dolorean). They pluck instead of pick and never fiddle, and percussion is limited to the arrhythmic clatter of pots and pans. The difference is crucial: Horse Feathers sound contemporary rather than nostalgic, yet retain a down-from-the-mountain sensibility as if they come into town once a month to stock up on provisions and record a track or two. Their second album, House With No Home, is folk music for hermits and misers. In the two years since Horse Feathers' reverb-drenched debut, Words Are Dead, the group has not only signed to Kill Rock Stars but has grown from a duo into a trio. Joining singer-songwriter Justin Ringle and multi-instrumentalist Peter Broderick is Heather Broderick, who subtly fills out Horse Feathers' still sparse sound. Her cello adds low end to most songs, and her harmonies with Ringle add texture to ""This Is What"" and the gentle closer ""Father"". She and her brother treat Ringle's songs almost as small filmstrips to be scored, so the strings swirl and dive dramatically, swooping and straining and adding an eerie ambience to these hard-luck tales. Even the instrumental ""Father Reprise"", with its battered piano and what sounds like a singing saw, sounds heavy with resignation, then leads into the tense and instrumentally sparse ""Heathen's Kiss"" and the sleepy-eyed ""Different Gray"". Above it all Ringle sings in a clear voice, and even from song to song, it sounds higher and coarser than expected, as if he has gone weeks without speaking to another soul. It fits his impressionistic narratives perfectly. On ""Rude to Rile"" and ""Working Poor"" he handles his hooks gracefully, keening thinly over the strings and chewing his words to suggest a regional dialect. Listen to him pronounce the word ""case"" on the chorus of ""Working Poor"", drawing out that long vowel sound into one-and-a-half syllables before easing up on the final consonant hiss. It's a minor moment, but it gives the song something like local color. Nothing on House With No Home is obvious or overwhelming; the album works more by insinuation than by outright statement, which creates a pervasive chilliness but also means that these songs sink in only after prolonged exposure. They cast a powerful spell and sustain it over 11 tracks, yet at times you wish they'd jam, or perform a cover, or do anything to break it up somehow. Maybe that says more about the listener than the band. Ultimately, that unworldliness may be Horse Feathers' greatest charm.

4,Dungen,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd105e6ef95969322f9c/1:1/w_160/e6ced521.jpg,2008-09-29 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12231-4/,Subliminal Sounds,"When I first heard Swedish psych outfit Dungen via the 2004 international breakthrough album Ta Det Lugnt, Gustav Ejstes' lyrics could've been as dopey as Neil Diamond's ""Porcupine Pie"" for all I knew. Turns out they weren't, really, but for someone who doesn't comprehend Swedish that's simply a safety net. The important thing was Ejstes' voice-- a rich, multitracked sharp/sweet melodic hum which could be non-contradictorily described as a ""beautiful whine."" Nobody else in rock sounds like him, and since he's clearly aware of the multilingual nature of his audience-- especially as a musician with an international rolodex of influences and interests himself-- he puts a strong focus on the purely musical aspect of his voice. Understand Swedish, and you get the full meaning; if you don't, you still get caught up in the striking way he draws out all those unfamiliar syllables. Yet that voice had become familiar by 2007's Tio Bitar-- enough that it was easier to catch your breath and cast a slightly more jaded ear towards the formula churning away: bucolic Scandinavian folk, fuzzed-out psych, a bit of bop-jazz elasticity, lots of Keith Moon-ish drum fills, and ringing piano chords. Even then, going from sounding revelatory to sounding reliable isn't exactly falling off, and the music still made it hard to believe that it was put together largely by Ejstes alone in a multi-instrumentalist, producer-assembled capacity informed as much by Pete Rock as Pete Townshend. 4 follows Tio Bitar, and while it's clear Ejstes has grown comfortable without getting complacent, he's managed to shake things up for the better this time around. Most notably, there's been a subtle shift to the group's dynamic-- and it is a group this time around. As much as Ejstes' one-man operation's been played up, there's a greater role for other musicians on 4, as Gustav opts to focus primarily on vocals and piano; Reine Fiske reprises his Tio Bitar role providing most of the lead guitar spark, Johan Holmegard takes over behind the drum kit, and touring-band member Mattias Gustavsson holds bass duties. 4 shows this permutation of Dungen to maintain the kind of tautness previous albums have thrived on, the end result of a touring unit assembled and honed to ideally recreate the careful constructions of a stylistically restless auteur in a live setting. The resulting lineup has come up with a tighter, more focused, and more compact record than Tio Bitar (10 songs, 38 minutes, no songs over five minutes) that still finds a way to touch on all of Dungen's sonic tendencies in lively, unpredictable fashion. Moments of mournfully wailing acid-rock beauty (the violin-tinged opener ""Sätt Att Se"") give way to gentler strains of classically influenced pop (""Målerås Finest""). The loose-fingered, high-speed freakout of ""Samtidigt 1"" is joined in progress right after the fluttering pastoralism of ""Det Tar Tid""; its partner ""Samtidigt 2""-- culled from the same full-band jam session-- soars into some kind of Deadhead exosphere only to dissipate into the soft piano/chime/flute melodies of ""Bandhagen"" (and its not-so-soft drumbeat-- like every other Dungen record, 4 is a percussive monster). And sometimes the contrasts build over the course of a single song, like when the jaunty Zombies/Kinks march-beat of ""Finns Det Någon Möjlighet"" eventually shifts from lighthearted, piano-driven frolic to a feedback-drenched trudge through creeping dread. And since the music has a renewed surprise to it, that voice does, too. Even though 4 has a greater emphasis on instrumental compositions that don't suffer much from the absence of Ejstes' vocals, it's a bit of a disappointment that they only show up in half the songs. Especially considering that they're a fine melodic accompaniment to just about anything the musicians are capable of-- crooning Byrds-inflected self-harmonies over the minimalist Motown groove of ""Ingenting År Sig Likt"", for instance, or keening through the Turkish-influenced stomp of ""Mina Damer Och Fasaner"". But even if that voice's an incredible instrument, it's just one piece of what's become an intricate structure.",,7.8,
Under a Blood Red Sky,U2,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd2f5e6ef95969322fe3/1:1/w_160/dd8b3a8d.jpg,2008-09-29 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12260-under-a-blood-red-sky/,IslandIsland,"In the early 1980s, U2 had earned critical respect and a swelling fanbase but, despite a UK #1 album, were far from superstardom. After debuting with Boy (1980), an album of strident post-punk, then following with a brief yet still promising hiccup (1981's October), in 1983 they released the more direct and overtly political War. Now tackling big themes and universal concerns with dramatic gestures and chest-beating choruses, U2 weren't yet an arena band but they carried themselves like one. What's more, they actually sounded better the bigger and brasher and bolder their music got. It's no surprise then that, in the U.S., this would-be Important Rock Group's profile and reputation became, like many other important rock groups, amplified via live performances-- the group's eye-opening 1985 Live Aid set, and the earlier mini concert album, Under a Blood Red Sky. One of the younger bands on Live Aid's Boomer-heavy bill, U2 spent more than half of their alloted time performing ""Bad"", the standout track from their then-recent The Unforgettable Fire. While most of the bands onstage in London and Philly that weekend remained aloof and distant from the enormous crowds, Bono waded into the photo pit to embrace and slow dance with a member of the audience-- a rare moment of real human connection at what was meant to be a showcase of global unity. Only Queen and their monumental performance of ""We Are the Champions"" came off better that weekend. Under a Blood Red Sky, released at the tail end of 1983, was a little less spontaneous and truthful. With its striking, scarlet-drenched cover, a shoutout to Colorado's Red Rocks on opener ""Gloria"", and the concurrent VHS release Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky (now bundled nicely as a DVD with some versions of this release), the LP was packaged to emphasize the natural beauty of the amphitheater's mountain setting. In truth, however, only two songs from Under were recorded at Red Rocks (""Gloria"" and ""Party Girl"")-- most were taken from a show in Germany, while one performance was recorded in Boston. Yet when the group performed at Red Rocks on a rainy June night, with lit torches above a panoramic skyline, the venue provided an ideal backdrop for U2's literally flag-waving music, with everything-- earth, wind, fire-- in place to maximize and heighten the drama of the moment and the songs. Red Rocks, too, began a love affair with America that carried through the rest of the decade, as the group's music began to match the spacious, seemingly limitless scope of the American countryside and they effectively explored American myths and touchstones on The Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree before carrying the approach a step too far on the bloated, pastiche-y Rattle and Hum. And, hell, it worked. MTV played the hell out of ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" and other videos from the performance, and the audio and video documents cemented U2's reputation as a commanding live band. Rather than release a full concert-- which could have resulted in a cumbersome and unnecessary record, particularly for a group with only three albums to date-- U2 wisely cherrypicked their best songs, created an out-of-order tracklisting built to maximize the LP's impact rather than accurately present a their live experience, added a solid B-side (""Party Girl"") to enhance the worth of the release to longtime fans, and let the package take on its own myth. The record itself opens with crowd noise, highlighting the bond between U2 and their fans and emphasizing the role of the audience in the group's ascendency. They were a true populist band, unafraid to make strong, direct connections with listeners at a time when many of their post-punk peers shied from such gestures. The band's strident performances here are all interspersed with recognitions of the crowd, the act of performance, and the value of entertainment, and most-- from ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" and its ""this is not a rebel song"" intro to ""I Will Follow"" to rugged, lesser-known tracks ""Gloria"" and ""The Electric Co.""-- became arguably the definitive reads of these songs. (This reissue, like the original U.S. release of the LP, features the truncated version of ""The Electric Co."", without the snippet of ""Send in the Clowns"" that appeared on some international editions.) The closing sing-along of War's ""40"" ends the record where it begins-- in the voices and cheers of the audience, a converted mass that, over the rest of the decade, carried the sound of the group back to their homes, places of work, schools. Eventually, the drive and work to be the biggest band in the world became a seriously uncool pursuit in many circles-- one could argue Nirvana punctured this sort of excess and spotlight-craving as surely as they did hair metal or indie dance. These days, many distrust guitar bands who don't reflect their own personal values, who they don't believe merely walk, talk, think, and act like them. Somehow, a group is more genuine if they're more, well, regular, or plain, even less accomplished or incurious about a wider world-- groups are often unwilling to show flashes of ability, or they'd rather preach to a choir than attempt to unify the masses, or they're happy being a big fish in a small pond. It's a weird attitude. (Good thing Americans don't ask for the same from their national politicians-- oh, wait...) But anyone interested in retracing U2's meteoric rise-- in relocating what made them an 80s touchstone at a time when their flirtations with earnestness came across more as combativeness rather than self-righteousness-- would do well to start here.","This recently reissued live album from 1983-- a key document in understanding U2's meteoric rise-- shows them as true populists, unafraid to make direct connections with listeners at a time when many of their post-punk peers shied from such gestures.

Milagrosa,Totimoshi,by: Cosmo Lee,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd08ea9e61561daa7604/1:1/w_160/31a70dbb.jpg,2008-09-26 06:00:05,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12224-milagrosa/,Volcom,"In an increasingly subgenred era, Totimoshi are anachronistically straightforward. Their sound is, quite simply, rock. The Bay Area trio evokes the bluster of early Melvins, the poppiness of later Melvins, the loose limbs of Black Sabbath, and the dry tones of garage rock. Despite their formidable live reputation, Totimoshi sound somewhat measured on record. This is partially due to production. Helmet's Page Hamilton helmed 2006's Ladrón, which was bone-dry to the point of sterility. Still, colors shone through: blues, pop, twang, acoustic guitar, blasts of fuzz.
 
Milagrosa paints more vividly with this palette. Hamilton again produced, this time with the help of engineer Tosh Kasai. Although the ingredients remain discrete, they spread out more dynamically here. In ""Milagroso"", a Jew's harp saucily tiptoes in the background like a whisper. Organ subtly backlights ""Little Bee"". Although the record never truly combusts, it beautifully balances guitars and drums, as Tony Aguilar's singing sits clearly front and center. The drum sound is a work of art. Snares snap, toms rumble, and the cymbal shimmer in ""Last Refrain"" is practically iridescent.
 
The performances are also richer than before. New drummer Chris Fugitt adds precision and taste; he punctuates the funky groove of ""El Emplazado"" with playful rimshots. Fugitt's grasp of space allows Meg Castellanos' bass to converse more fluidly with Aguilar's guitar. At first, his attack seems startlingly plain. His power chords, R&B flavored stabs, and bluesy solos are standard rock fare. Sometimes, as in ""Fall and Bound"", the songs are in fact vanilla. But Aguilar's timing is mostly perfect, laying back during verses, then accelerating into leads. The magic is in such subtleties-- tart single-coil flourishes, ebb and flow of distortion, bittersweet backing vocals from Castellanos.
 
This newfound suppleness extends to the lyrics. The theme of compassion versus violence runs throughout: ""Sound the horn, for the light it has come to me/ With give you get, but with want you are never free."" Images in the liner notes are likewise gentle: palm trees, a sunlit cemetery, a shrine to a deceased loved one. Album closer ""Dear"" wraps itself in strings, resignation, and hope: ""In the end I will lose you/ That I do know/ Perhaps our bodies as refuse/ Will feed a flower to grow."" It reaches the luminous place that Charlie Sexton's Under the Wishing Tree occupied, the union of ""roots"" and ""rock.""","The Bay Area trio evokes the bluster of early Melvins, the poppiness of later Melvins, the loose limbs of Black Sabbath, and the dry tones of garage rock. In other words, they rock. Helmet's Page Hamilton produces.

Necima,Lia Ices,by: Joe Colly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd06ea9e61561daa75fe/1:1/w_160/1989391d.jpg,2008-09-26 06:00:04,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12222-necima/,Rare Book Room,"Having deftly arranged records for left-of-center heavyweights such as Animal Collective, Black Dice, and Silver Jews, as well as tracks by several members of indie rock's intriguing freshman class (Stars Like Fleas and Telepathe, to name a few), Nicolas Vernhes is shaping up to be underground rock's King Midas. For the inaugural LP of his recently launched Rare Book Room imprint (also the name of his Brooklyn studio and home to this year's excellent Living Bridge compilation), the accomplished producer is releasing Necima, an introduction to avant-pop crooner Lia Ices. Ices (a pseudonym; she prefers not to disclose her real name), is a scholarly trained, Brooklyn-based singer and pianist who honed her chops at NYU's Tisch School for Experimental Theatre. There, she is said to have shed classicism and found her voice-- a captivating, aching alto that lives in a similar realm as Feist's, Cat Power's, and Tori Amos'-- which provides the central draw of this occasionally brilliant, sometimes frustrating debut. Able to flit gracefully between sultry, come-hither coos and emotive yelps, Ices' vocals are indeed impressive, and while most of Necima's material calls for somber intonations, she displays a knack for accessing even the hard-to-reach upper registers. Of course, beautiful singing alone does not a great record make, and here Vernhes is on hand to infuse nuance into the album's arrangements. He puts to use a bevy of divergent instrumentation-- electric guitar, bass clarinet, various organs, a Colombian hand drum, and many others-- to add texture and unexpected flourishes of sound throughout. When Ices and Vernhes find a creative symbiosis, usually on the record's shorter, pop-leaning tracks, the results are spectacular. The first of the record's successful batch is ""Half Life"", which explores stalled relationships. ""We're in the middle of something we could lose,"" warns Ices atop the crisp and elegant production. Also gorgeous is ""(Un)Chosen One"", which subsists on acoustic guitars, a swelling chorus, and (lyrically) recalls Isaac Brock's great existential rant on Modest Mouse's ""Lives"". All uplifting personal spirit and positive emotion, Ices asserts, ""These are our lives, these are them after all/ I'm not about to leave it up to how my cards are drawn."" One of the most melodically driven pieces is Necima's final track, ""You Will"", and it puts on display precisely what works about this album: Concise, delicately sung pop songs imbued with attention-grabbing orchestration. Several of Necima's tracks, although, do not fare as well as those mentioned above. Too often, the material meanders and become sluggish, most glaringly on the far-too-long (and rather tedious) ""Many Moons"" and ""Twins"". ""Reason in Remain"", which was originally featured on Living Bridge, also suffers from a length issue. Pushing the seven-minute mark, this otherwise decent track is spoiled by its refusal to close. Even album opener ""Medicine Wheel"", a piano-driven ballad that will incur the most Amos comparisons, hits lulling patches and begins to wander after expending its appealing content early on. But each sub-par track here belies a very strong one-- songs like ""You Will"" that could survive on playlists for months to come. As always, Vernhes' production here is inventive and memorable, and Ices' voice matches his distinctiveness. The work of a capable pair that has only missed the mark slightly, Necima, at the very least, has us eager to hear what comes next.","After arranging records for left-of-center heavyweights such as Animal Collective, Black Dice, and Silver Jews, Rare Book Room head Nicolas Vernhes here handles production on and releases this intriguing introduction to avant-pop crooner Lia Ices.

All the Way,Growing,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd13eb335119a49ecdd5/1:1/w_160/61cc817a.jpg,2008-09-26 06:00:03,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12234-all-the-way/,Social Registry,"I once claimed Growing were the most misleadingly named band this side of Death Cab for Cutie-- besides shrinking from a trio to a duo, had these Brooklyn-by-way-of-Olympia drone-rockers ever actually evolved? A colleague called me out on this, and he was right. I fished out a copy of Growing's 2003 album The Sky's Run Into the Sea, and was reminded of how far they've come, through diverse incarnations of ambient, noise, and drone-based music, to achieve the mature style that had erased their earlier works from my memory. ""Cutting, Opening, Swimming"" hinted at the color-saturated walls of sound with which they're now synonymous, but was light on subterranean motion, and elsewhere, they tinkered with smaller, more rickety bobbins and more indeterminate structures than you'll find in their current output. Maybe my error was somewhat understandable. All the Way concludes a conceptual arc that spans three albums (four, if you count the Lateral EP), beginning with 2006's not-at-all misleadingly titled Color Wheel. If newer Growing made me forget about older Growing, that speaks to the obliterative power of their recent music. These three albums are superficially monolithic enough that they could have emanated from the same recording session. Growing found their spirit animal-- their gaudy, squirming compositions always make me think of some psychedelic caterpillar-- and rode off into a tie-dyed sky. Armed with guitar, bass, loop station, Ebow, and sundry effects boxes, they erected garish bulwarks of hotwired glitch, with towering major chords jutting out like flying buttresses, and long, tense loops sliding in and out of phase. And even within this monolithic trilogy, All the Way distinguishes itself: Never before has Growing so prominently emphasized stomping melody and kinetic rhythm. They're this close to being a rock band while still sounding like their weird selves, which makes this their most accessible album to date. They way they blend the haywire and the anthemic often sounds like Black Dice trying to be Ratatat. ""Green Flag"" sprays a guitar line across the stereo channels in choppy flecks-- I'm not sure about the hardware involved, but you could achieve a reasonable facsimile with a cheap Boss sampler's ""slicer"" effect-- and pads them with intestinal gurgles and whizzes (the intestine is another inescapable metaphor for Growing's music, which always conveys a feeling of linear, peristaltic motion). The shimmering, filter-swept ""Wrong Ride"" is a beatless approximation of funk; ""Innit"" performs the same alchemical transformation on beveled Euro-synth techno. ""Rave Pie Only"" makes processed guitars act like metronomic percussion, marking time for the damaged lead and climactic raygun battle. Throughout it all, a formerly suppressed thrum percolates right on the surface, making this cruising music for Brian Eno fans-- no mean feat for a band that, like many others in their milieu, began as sculptors of wisps and vapors before hitting their thunderous stride.","Firing on all cylinders, Growing continue to produce dynamic post-rock, here more prominently emphasizing stomping melody and kinetic rhythm.

SM Backwards,Serena-Maneesh,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd3013d197565213b4b6/1:1/w_160/fa151246.jpg,2008-09-26 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12261-sm-backwards/,Smalltown Supersound,"Unless you regularly scour obscure Norwegian record labels, chances are Serena-Maneesh's 2005 self-titled debut-- a hulking spin on Loveless-- came out of nowhere. The group returned to Scandinavia so quickly the internets didn't even have time to forge a formidable backlash, but here to assure us they weren't a figment of our imaginations, S-M Backwards compiles S-M material from 1999 to 2003, offering up candid snapshots of a band that's otherwise been full of mystique. Backwards' two discs draw from two main sources, 2002's Fixxations EP and 2005's Zurück EP, making this less an odds'n'sods collection and more a re-release, complete with lots of remixes and alternate cuts. As evidenced by S-M's cataclysmic debut, frontman and songwriter Emil Nikolaisen draws from a vast palette, and the meandering quality of this early material attests to how carefully crafted their perfectly stormy debut was. Fixxations, the band's debut EP and Disc One here, harnesses this energy into the most accessible block of tunes S-M's released to date. On ""Drive Me Home The Lonely Nights"", Nikolaisen finds the perfect marriage between pet influences like the Velvets, MBV, and contemporaries like close friend Sufjan Stevens. Gritty psych-rockers ""Blues Like Beehive"" and ""Hear/Bleed Phil Harmonic"" are less elegant, their droning riffs less subtle and the vocals a tad too cool for their own good in an Anton Newcombe way. Disc Two blasts off into more challenging territory. Culled from very early recordings, Nikolaisen clearly overcompensates in the transition from his bare-boned 90s punk band Silver to S-M's more cerebral style. There's an incredibly sparse track, barely more than a field recording, called ""Introspection"" that, well, is made to introspect to. The surf guitar on ""Degenerate"" initially pops like a Devo cut before it becomes clear the song refuses to move off that same note for its three-minute duration. Out of context, that sure sounds annoying, but when considering the similarly stubborn monotone of later S-M songs like ""Candlelighted"", it's clear this early cut was a punching bag of sorts, allowing Nikolaisen to summon far more potent knockout blows in the future. The real diamonds in the rough, however, lie in subtly beautiful psuedo-ballads like ""Leipziger Love"" and especially closer ""Never"". While Boris could probably out-drone and out-muscle S-M and Deerhunter's got them beat on the three-minute shoegaze front, few bands today write five minute-plus songs that are simultaneously this mucky and this saccharine. Nikolaisen creates chaos around his sister Hilma's vocals without sacrificing any hooks or continuity, and the group always finds new ways to build tension without simply getting louder or packing on more sound effects. Oh yeah, and about those remixes...um, it seems the band needed to clear disk space on their hard drives and threw them on to round out the double-disc release. The ""Noise Miami Mix"" of ""Drive Me Home..."" takes several listens to notice the nuances it slipped into the original, and other bonus tracks, like the Grandsport mix of ""Oxygen, Please!"", are little more than re-masterings. At least the re-imaginings of ""Sehnsucht/Drag Me Upstairs"" and ""Leipziger Love"" serve well to emphasize S-M's true strength. Essentially tacking on a few extra minutes of spooky reverb and guitar squalls, these particular remixes try to rough up what's already a perfect pop song with a blackeye. Despite some of the growing pains here, Backwards strongly hints at the sadistic beauticians S-M would be introduced to us as in their debut, and bravely reveals the types of psych/shoegaze pitfalls they'd later learn to avoid.","Three years after their hulking spin on Loveless, the Scandinavian band compiles 2xCDs' worth of material from 1999 to 2003, offering up candid snapshots of a band that's otherwise been full of mystique.

Tim / Pleased to Meet Me / Don't Tell a Soul / All Shook Down,The Replacements,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd36c0084474cd0c2c55/1:1/w_160/e8c38ba6.jpg,2008-09-26 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12266-tim-pleased-to-meet-me-dont-tell-a-soul-all-shook-down/,Rhino,"These reissues complete Rhino's ambitious treatment of the Replacements catalogue, with all eight of the legendary (a shopworn word in rock criticism, but these guys deserve it, for reasons good and bad) Minneapolis band's official releases in expanded and remastered deluxe editions. Rhino's decision to release the records in two flights-- the first covering the Twin/Tone years, the second their time on Sire-- cleaves their career into distinct halves, a division that seems sharper now than it did at the time. Yeah, everyone back then noticed Tim's horrible record cover and weird production, but to those not tuned into major/indie politics, it just seemed like ""The record after Let It Be,"" not a talking point for a discussion on what happens when underground bands sign with a major. But returning to these four records after a lengthy re-immersion in the Twin/Tone platters, one gets a sense of exactly what had changed. The run of 1981's Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash to 1984's Let It Be, for all the variety on display, feels of a piece, the work of a wildly creative and energetic band with a strong sense of exactly who they were. Each of the Sire albums, on the other hand, seems to begin with, ""Well, I guess we can try this and see what happens."" There's no sense of continuity, nothing builds from record to record. Every one seems to come from a band starting over. Given its superior distribution and marketing push, Tim was the first Replacements album many people heard, which, as is so often the case, means that it's frequently mentioned as the favorite. And that's understandable. ""Hold My Life"", ""Bastards of Young"", and ""Left of the Dial"" are anthems, no doubt about it, real voice-of-a-generation kind of songs. But Tim also has range. The jazzy, midtempo ""Swingin Party"" is Westerberg with perfect emotional pitch-- funny (""Bring your own lampshade, somewhere there's a party"") and also vulnerable (the narrator admits to being ignorant, weak, and terrified, but if he can find someone in the same situation to hang out with, he'll live). ""Kiss Me on the Bus"" is light, melodic, and charming guitar pop, another new wrinkle. Great songs abound, but Tim has its share of issues. Something that had changed markedly-- and whether it was erratic lead guitarist Bob Stinson's rapidly diminishing role in the band or self-consciousness, I can't say-- is that the Replacements would never again sound convincing on a dumb rocker the way they had so many times over on those first four records. You take ""Run It"" from Hootenanny or ""Customer"" from Sorry Ma and place them alongside ""Dose of Thunder"" or ""Lay It Down Clown"", and the latter seem downright anemic. The Replacements were having a harder time with ""silly,"" something that was as natural as breathing in the early days, but they kept trying all the way until the end. Tim's other big problem is the sound. The remastering on all of these discs is done well, but problems with Tim go much deeper. Originally produced by Tommy Erdelyi of the Ramones, Tim comes over as thin, limp, and weirdly distant, hitting with less than half the force of the Let It Be. Ironically, since Erdelyi is a drummer, Chris Mars' percussion is especially feeble. The six bonus tracks included throw the production shortcomings into relief. The demo of ""Kiss Me on the Bus""-- recorded with Erdelyi, but it sounds live in studio-- is raw and direct. The two outtakes of ""Can't Hardly Wait""-- a song that wouldn't be officially released until Pleased to Meet Me, one acoustic and one electric-- both suggest a sonic road not taken in addition to highlighting how much Westerberg refined songs over time. Pleased to Meet Me could be heard as an overcompensation for Tim's failings. Much was made of it being a digital recording, which in 1987 was seen as extravagant, the kind of thing Peter Gabriel and Dire Straits indulged in. ""Look ma, no hiss!"" read a review discussing the moment of silence between the horn hits in ""Can't Hardly Wait"" (the fact that there were horns to hit-- not to mention strings-- was also shocking) and Pleased to Meet Me was presented as the Replacements finally ready for the big time. The reality, though, is that the record was all over the place, too schizophrenic for the band to be easily grasped, kind of like Hootenanny with fleshed-out ideas, more confidence, and way better songs. Here the Replacements were tacking cocktail jazz (""Nightclub Jitters""), wholly acoustic ballads (the gorgeous ""Skyway""), gritty proto-grunge (""The Ledge""), and paying tribute to their Memphis surroundings-- local hero Jim Dickinson produced-- on buoyant, Big Star-channeling power-pop (""Can't Hardly Wait"" and ""Alex Chilton""). Perhaps with Bob Stinson now out of the band (he died of drug-related causes a decade later), Westerberg felt freer to experiment, to try genres that would have been given an ironic reading a few years earlier. The obligatory burners (""Shooting Dirty Pool"" and ""Red Red Wine"") once again feel forced, but Westerberg more than made up with that with three of the best rock songs he ever wrote: ""I.O.U."", ""Never Mind"", and ""Valentine"". More personal and specific than their counterparts on Tim, this trio is littered with lines that bands since have built an entire identity on. Songs like ""Birthday Gal"" and ""Photo"", which didn't make the record and are now included as bonuses, suggest that Westerberg was on a songwriting roll, and alternate versions of ""Alex Chilton"" and ""Can't Hardly Wait"" are welcome. And then the bottom dropped out. Or, so the story goes, anyway. For many, Don't Tell a Soul, with its slick production-- saxophones and violins were one thing, but synths?-- and generally muted tone spelled the end of the Replacements as we knew them, and the only point to debate is whether this record or All Shook Down was their career nadir. ""End of the Replacements as we knew them"" I can agree with, but then, they were pretty much a new band with each of their two previous records as well. Don't Tell a Soul was met with plenty of derision at the time, but an even larger reason for its bad rep since likely has to do with the fact that this is the sound emulated by the Replacements worshipers that took the band's somewhere bigger, your Goo Goo Dolls and Ryan Adams types. Not to mention that you can hear echoes of Westerberg's lackluster 90s solo output throughout, and ""I Won't"" is possibly the most unconvincing rocker they ever recorded, with its wailing harmonica and a mix that sounds like four guys recorded their parts on different continents. But I submit that the softer, more careful, and certainly more polished band on display here-- one clearly hoping to straddle the gulf between college rock and MTV's ""120 Minutes"" and pop radio-- succeeds on its own terms. ""Asking Me Lies"" and ""Talent Show"" are damn catchy pop songs, and the latter is both bravely dorky (""It's the biggest thing in my life, I guess/ Look at us, we're nervous wrecks/ Hey, we go on next"") and, as especially revealed in the superior studio demo included as a bonus, has a great riff. Ballads ""Achin' to Be"" and ""They're Blind"" are a little on-the-nose lyrically, but they capture that ""I want the world to know that I'm special, but I also want to hide in a closet"" feeling endemic to being a teenager as well as anything this side of Morrissey. And ""I'll Be You"" completely transcends its production and could fight for a spot in an all-time Replacements top 10. The bonus tracks here also might be the strongest of this whole batch, with the fine country-ish ""Portland"" (its ""Too late to turn back, here we go"" chorus was cannibalized for ""Talent Show""), straightforward studio demos that show the hearts of good songs beating beneath the plastic exterior (""Talent Show"" and ""We'll Inherit the Earth""), and an appealingly weird studio goof with Tom Waits that's almost as good as that sounds (B-side ""Date to Church""). All Shook Down, originally envisioned as Westerberg's solo debut, really does feel like the end, and it's not a happy one. The acoustic guitars are out in full force, singing is hushed, and Westerberg made much of the record with studio musicians, with only a couple of tracks featuring contributions from Tommy Stinson, Chris Mars, and Slim Dunlap, (the latter replaced Bob Stinson on Don't Tell a Soul). There are some pretty good songs-- ""Merry Go Round"", ""When It Began""-- but the overall mood is sleepy, fatigued, and some of the songwriting feels rote (""Bent Out of Shape"", ""Attitude"") with melodies and chords plugged in in a predictable way. Westerberg still had a way with a heart-tugging ballad (""Sadly Beautiful"") but even then, that fine line between the affectingly melancholy and self-pityingly morose is crossed with some regularity. The bonus material here, appropriately enough, is by far the least interesting of the eight records, consisting mostly of warbly lo-fi demos. When Westerberg emerged with two underwritten, slight, but ultimately fun solo tunes on the Singles soundtrack two years later, it was like a breath of fresh air. All Shook Down is depressing in ways only partly intended. The Replacements may never have figured out what kind of band they wanted to be or how they wanted to sound after leaving Twin/Tone, but there's still a clear thread binding almost all of their work together, and that was the worldview of Paul Westerberg. He didn't just tell stories with his songs, though he could do that too; he offered a way of looking at things that seemed both disarmingly familiar and previously unarticulated. Westerberg's POV also dovetailed perfectly with his band's career arc in a way that in retrospect seems uncanny. He celebrated people with talent who were scared of growth, those ready to upset the natural order of things not out of careful consideration of power relationships-- as was the case with politically oriented punk-- but because they were either hopelessly bored, had a childlike curiosity, or were just plain afraid. The outlook he tapped into was more universal than he could have imagined, and had been underrepresented in rock music until he came along. Now, of course, they're indie rock staples. The Replacements' influence on the alt-rock explosion of the 90s has been overstated, but their approach has continued to resonate in smaller scenes, where you feel like you're experiencing music up close, less mediated by rock star iconography. Their songs touch on some heavy shit, the kind of feelings best expressed in a more intimate space, but there's also plenty of room in there for some laughs. That kind of mixed-up place is right where the Replacements belong.",,8.7,
Eyes at Half Mast,Talkdemonic,by: Robbie Mackey,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd2213d197565213b498/1:1/w_160/cc4a65e1.jpg,2008-09-25 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12247-eyes-at-half-mast/,Arena Rock,"A long time ago, Kevin O'Connor made the mistake of calling his band ""folktronic hop."" Accurate or not, the hammy moniker has followed Talkdemonic around ever since, and a cursory Google search proves that, for better or worse, the clunker has been adopted only by him. But as tacky as it sounds now, the tag sort of made its own kind of sense on O'Connor's initial bow as Talkdemonic, 2005's Mutiny Sunshine. On that album, the recently transplanted Portlandite was attempting to reconcile his love of instrumental hip-hop, electronic music, and post-rock by meshing synths and roomy drumming with all stripes of stringed instruments-- banjo, classical guitar, viola, and so forth. It was an occasionally inspired, if often clumsy, hybrid. That same tentative sound would crystallize into something much more cohesive after O'Connor called on part-time collaborator Lisa Molinaro for 2006's Beat Romantic. With attempt two, O'Connor didn't shove the sounds together so much as find common ground from which they could all shine. Panorama-wide drums supported Molinaro's hearty builds of stringed elegance, and craggy synth bass notes manned the low end while banjos rustled and skipped above. It worked surprisingly well, as each element sort of minded its own business on the way to a handful of genuinely engaging moments. But on Talkdemonic's third stab, Eyes at Half Mast, the novelty seems to be thining, and O'Connor and Molinaro finally sound limited by their tools. After all, how many times are we expected to be surprised by a synth underpinning a banjo? By Half Mast's count, six? Maybe seven? Certainly, after all these years, the duo knows how to coax pretty sounds from its instruments. They do it repeatedly here, at least early on. The first four tracks on the album are a seamlessly executed stretch, showcasing the sort of balance that propped up Romantic so well. And Molinaro's layered viola lines are alternatingly regal and melancholic. But as charming as ""Ending the Orange Glow"" is, with its skidding synth and finger-picking stomp atop a marching drum rudiment, it still doesn't compare to Beat-standout ""Dusty Fluorescent/Wooden Shelves"", which already perfected the very same formula. Indeed, save for the Jetsons streamers and banjo tickling of ""Shattered Into Dyes"", or the big ""oh, ah"" soothsaying of ""March Movement"", Talkdemonic's ""folktronic hop"" now just seems like a collection of disparate influences. Four Tet's Pause here. Fridge's Happiness there, Yann Tiersen's squeezebox, and banjo all over the place.","Talkdemonic's third stab at folk-hop travels roads most frequently associated with Four Tet, Fridge, and other artists marrying the rustic with the futuristic.

The Mighty Ship,Angela Desveaux,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd0cc0084474cd0c2bfd/1:1/w_160/adcb65c9.jpg,2008-09-25 06:00:04,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12228-the-mighty-ship/,Thrill Jockey,"Title tracks are often emblematic of the albums they adorn, but Angela Desveaux's ""Mighty Ship"" feels like a red herring on the album that shares its name. Montreal-based Desveaux is being sold as a singer steeped in traditional country music influences, yet ""Mighty Ship"" is the only song on the record that deeply reflects an antiquarian sensibility, either musically or lyrically, evoking church hymns and agrarian hardships in its portrayal of a young woman who has lost her husband at sea. Initially, this title track's singularity seems like a disappointment. So much of what claims a kinship with country in indie spheres only utilizes the genre for cosmetic purposes, ornamenting things with a little pedal steel rather than really digging into something timeless and substantial, as ""Mighty Ship"" manages with its mournful horns and sad Christian reverence. The remainder of The Mighty Ship may lack such distinctive roots, but in its place Desveaux offers something more satisfying, if less regional. Namely, much of the rest of her album is marked by punchy pop-rock and plenty of sharp hooks, retaining just enough twang for Desveaux to emerge as a worthy inheritor to Lucinda Williams and Rosanne Cash, two women savvy enough to explore ruralist attitudes without neglecting the distinct physical pleasures of well-crafted modern pop. Patently conjuring revered, bygone c&w can quite honestly be a crutch, and there's nothing artificially propping up the tight, sprightly sprint of ""Sure Enough"", the spacious riffing of ""Hide From You"" or the moody, 1980s AOR thrum of ""Shape You"". The sadder, slower likes of ""Other Side"" and ""Joining Another"" may register more closely to country by the sheer fact of their solemnity, but there's no dirt underneath their nails and that's fine, since neither song is exactly boasting a sharecropper's lineage anyway. While ""Mighty Ship"" is an aberration musically, the title track nonetheless carries lyrical concerns that resonate throughout the record. Desveaux spends the bulk of these songs examining the sobering realities of romance and the strain relationships exert on the feminine psyche. It's not an album rife with specifics, and sometimes the vagueness can be slightly maddening, like Desveaux's confession in ""Other Side"" that ""It's taking all my energy when you ask me to do something wrong,"" or the pseudo-portentous repetition of ""There's a full moon on the rise"" in ""Worried Mind."" For the most part, however, her words cut to the quick, and not just the hot-button invocations of diets and shame on ""For Design"", but also the stark-simple sentiments driving ""The Way You Stay"", where Desveaux pleads ""What do you want me to do for you/ What do you need me for,"" or the whole of ""Joining Another"", which finds her mourning the partial loss of self that's an inevitable component of any love affair. Perceived loss of self is a risk Desveaux herself takes in making music so largely bereft of easy cultural or regional signifiers, yet the keenness of her songcraft makes these hard-won, universal sentiments far more rewarding than most lazy splashes of local color.","Montreal-based singer-songwriter has just enough twang to emerge as a worthy inheritor to Lucinda Williams and Rosanne Cash without neglecting the distinct physical pleasures of well-crafted modern pop.

The Holy Pictures,David Holmes,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd155e6ef95969322fa6/1:1/w_160/5e5f97ad.jpg,2008-09-25 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12236-the-holy-pictures/,Mercury,"Since first rising up in the mid-1990s alongside the UK big-beat battalion, Belfast-bred DJ/producer has proven so adept at composing faux soundtracks to non-existant films, he's now the go-to guy for composing real soundtracks to real films, earning a permanent place on Steven Soderbergh's speed-dial after his excellent work on 1998's Out of Sight. But where soundtracks usually play a tangential role for most artists moonlighting in the medium, in Holmes' case, they serve as logical extensions of his own artist albums. Sure, Holmes' productions for Soderbergh's Ocean's Eleven series were decidedly more congenial than his own D&B-noir odyssey Let’s Get Killed (1997) and blaxploitation masterwork Bow Down to the Exit Sign (2000), but they're all built from the same rudiments, interweaving snippets of dialogue to set a gritty, mean-streets ambience that's leavened by some good-time funk-soul grooves (lest we forget it was Holmes' use of Junkie XL’s electro-Elvis overhaul ""A Little Less Conversation"" in Ocean's Eleven that set the stage for its subsequent Nike-commercial ubiquity). And out of the Vegasized vibes of his Ocean's Eleven work, Holmes has gone on to further indulge his retro-funk fetish with his side band the Free Association. But any cinephile appreciates a good surprise twist, and in contrast to a career discography that's reshaped Afro-Angloamerican music of all forms-- soul, funk, hip-hop, jazz, drum'n'bass-- Holmes' first solo artist album in eight years points to primarily European rock sources: the narcotic pop of the Jesus and Mary Chain, Primal Scream, and the Stone Roses; the swirls and swells of Spiritualized; the motoriked glide of Neu! But more so than its content, The Holy Pictures really differs from Holmes' past work in form: There's no filmic framework or found-sound dialogue linking the compact, 10-song tracklist together, and where Holmes once farmed out the vocal duties to celeb guests like Bobby Gillespie and Jon Spencer, for the first time he claims them for himself. All of this would reinforce Holmes' assertion that The Holy Pictures is a more personal work inspired by his Belfast upbringing and the passing of his mother in 1996. But rather than revealing any personal thoughts, Holmes simply revels in youthful abandon: For its first half, The Holy Pictures vividly approximates the decadent, ultraviolet-lit scene at a student-disco circa 1990, with a steady clip of head-rushed, stoned-immaculate pop songs (""I Heard Wonders"", ""Love Reign Over Me""-- the latter not a Who cover) that showcase Holmes' relaxed voice, a breathy sigh that faithfully adheres to the Jim Reid/Ian Brown flower-punk tradition. Even tracks that seem to initially conform to Holmes' film-noir track record eventually burst with kaleidoscopic color-- at the outset, the instrumental ""Story of the Ink"" mines the same nocturnal desolation as Primal Scream's Trainspotting theme, until a tremloloed electric-guitar riff and intensified frequencies gradually send the song aloft in a psychedelic splendor, as if timed for when the ecstasy sets in. But the deeper you venture into The Holy Pictures, the more distant these euphoric feelings become, and the album starts to feel like something more substantial than a blissed-out shoegazing nostalgia trip. After getting in the last of his Krautrock kicks with ""Melanie""--  whose Stereolabby hypno-rock pulse is quickened by an ascendant chorus of wordless harmonies-- Holmes steers The Holy Pictures into a triptych of serene instrumentals that seek to recapture a certain back-to-the-womb comfort (hey, one of them's even called ""Birth"") and prove an affecting come-down to the preceding songs' sunglasses-at-night swagger; the closing tribute to his parents, ""The Ballad of Sarah and Jack"" is The Holy Pictures' simplest track but arguably its most absorbing, an unspeakably somber piano instrumental that could pass for a backing track from some lost early 70s Neil Young session. In the end, despite the absence of Holmes' favored motifs, The Holy Pictures turns out to be very much a soundtrack-- but one in which heart and mind prove to be as inspiring a source as any script Hollywood throws at him.","This perpetually underrated Belfast producer, now best known for his work on multiple Steven Soderbergh films, here forgoes many of his typical motifs-- cinematic frameworks, tweaking of traditionally Afro-American sounds-- for an exploration of European rock, and he once again creates a narcotic and engaging work.

Gentleman Jesse & His Men,Gentleman Jesse & His Men,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd2bc0084474cd0c2c3e/1:1/w_160/0823a868.jpg,2008-09-25 06:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12256-gentleman-jesse-his-men/,Douchemaster,"A few seconds. That's about how long it should take to figure out why it makes so much sense that Gentleman Jesse & His Men's first live outing came as support for the Black Lips. Because just as those knuckleheads have earned stripes pissing and bashing out garage recordings that sound several years older than they are, Atlanta's Gentleman Jesse (neé Jesse Smith) & His Men have found love in the rich, power-pop offerings of the 1970s. By no means innovative, their self-tiled debut succeeds anyway, hitting pleasure centers like Ali tapped chins: quickly, often, and with oh so much care. Smith has become something of a local fixture in Atlanta over the years plucking bass for the Carbonas, a more abrasive punk outfit than the one he's assembled here. As Gentleman Jesse, Smith moves to the lip of the stage and softens up the approach. With an emphasis on pop more than say, power, Jesse & His Men re-imagine licks as dreamt up by the likes of Nick Lowe, the Modern Lovers, and the Nerves. But they aren't so much an update or study of 70s power-pop as a celebration of those sounds and all their jangling tentacles. While slightly less indebted to the punk kinetics of the Buzzcocks or Damned than the Exploding Hearts were, Smith and his bandmates still follow the same blueprint as the Hearts did so successfully and infectiously before their tragic end. Nobody has done it so well since. With little or no fat to be found anywhere amid its thirty minutes of slip ‘n slide chord progressions and jukebox mining, it's a thoroughbred pop album that struggles only when trying to slow down. It's almost as though there are too many hooks. In addition to being a buckshot opener, ""Highland Crawler"" is a worthy kid brother track to ""Roadrunner"". Also an effective aural compass, that song's drumkit closing links directly to the opening of ""Black Hole"" without seams. It's a transition that typifies the slick sequencing throughout. From the balloon animal bends of ""You Don't Have To (If You Don't Want To)"" to the Rickenbacker poetics of ""Wrong Time"", guitars double as voices for choruses in their own-very hummable-right. Not a wordsmith like much of the humorists he obsesses over, Smith tends to rely on putting up lyrical wallpaper that's heavy on babes and light on the kind of pithy humor his heroes founded cults with. But beyond that, Gentleman Jesse & His Men's major flaw isn't that that it is so unabashedly derivative or tethered so tightly to its corner in history. Many of these songs share such deep structural and lyrical similarities that they can often shimmy and bleed into one another in ways that overshadow how expertly Smith seems to have crafted them. While there isn't a truly bad song here, individual elements, when picked apart, are interchangeable. And yet, ultimately, all of that contributes to the record's familiar, and instantly lovable, appeal.","Atlanta band effortlessly and repeatedly hit pleasure centers on their self-titled debut-- the best power-pop revival LP since the Exploding Hearts' Guitar Romantic.

Journey to the West,Monkey,by: Scott Plagenhoef,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd31c0084474cd0c2c4b/1:1/w_160/28f57b23.jpg,2008-09-25 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12262-journey-to-the-west/,XL,"After two top-selling albums created under the guise of a cartoon band, artist and designer Jamie Hewlett and Blur's Damon Albarn followed Gorillaz with, no shit, Monkey. The simian in question is the lead character in Journey to the West, one of China's oldest and most endearing stories, a tale originally written in the late 16th century that's considered one of the country's four great novels. Oh and, with the help of director Checn Shi-Zeng, Albarn and Hewlett adapted it into a modern opera. On paper these ideas-- audacious, uncommercial, completely uncool-- should bomb. But Albarn has always had a conceptual bent to his projects, and after successfully acting as a conduit between African and Western music, heading a supergroup that actually worked, and the shock success of Gorillaz, it might be time to stop underestimating him. Albarn's detractors, granted, have plenty of ammunition-- after years of tabloid celebrity at home, he's aimed to turn himself into a panglobal everyman, a process that raises specters of cultural tourism and inauthenticity. Yet even if one were to sniff at his musical output, it's difficult to locate the mercenary or imagistic motivations in issuing low-key compilations of African music on his Honest Jon's label or attempting to tackle Chinese opera-- where's the superficial reward there? And yet despite being relatively leftfield to the British public, this collection of Anglo-Sino music, Journey to the West, debuted in the UK top five. With African music en vogue throughout the West, and with the possibility China could dominate this century, Albarn's cultural eye seems more prophetic than exploitative. In any event, one listen to Journey-- a record that, even by Hewlett's admission you might only want to listen to once a year-- should dispel the notions that this is some sort of token nod. Wisely choosing not to release a soundtrack of their actual opera, Albarn and Hewlett (in conjunction with the UK Chinese Music Ensemble) have instead re-arranged and re-articulated the production's music for this CD release. The project still has the feel of an accompanying piece, with titles referencing the dramatization of the Chinese story and plenty of incidental music, but it also works on a satisfying level as an experimental work or as art-pop. Written in the rigid five-note pentatonic scale that dominates many ancient folk musics (including China's), the record is inherently offkilter to those accustomed to more backbeat-oriented rock. Albarn leans heavily on electronic tones, giving the record an agile sound even at its darkest. It's also surprisingly easy to locate Albarn's melodic gifts within these songs, whether in the more passive tracks or underneath both the guttural vocalizations of ""Confessions of a Pig"" or the languid tones of ""The Living Sea"". Some of the more interstitial tracks bear more obvious Albarn touches-- the panoramic ""Sandy the River Demon"" or the electro-noir of ""O Mi to Fu"" could fit on a Gorillaz record, while ""I Love Buddha"" lightly recalls the knees-up oomp-pa instrumentals that colored Blur's Britpop-era work. The set works best, however, when it hews closest to Western pop-- the stirring ""Heavenly Peach Banquet"" could actually be a blog hit, and ""Monkey Bee"" bears the fingerprints of many of the modern art-rock bands we champion. This ability to weave his stylistic tics into his now heavily collaborative projects functions almost as breadcrumbs for those still willing to follow Albarn from record to record. Rather than writing from the perspective of a band-- or a brand name, as he arguably did with Blur-- his more exploratory instincts and nimbleness have lately come to the fore. In a sense, Blur threatened at one point to run headlong into self-parody and it seemed at the time (and still does) that it was guitarist Graham Coxon who most deftly steered them away from that dead end. If so, perhaps it was a lesson Albarn absorbed, and relatively outside of the public eye-- either by hiding behind the mask of Gorillaz or working with others, he now seems more free to carve a musical identity rather than a celebrity one. (Ironically, this was a frequent complaint I heard about The Good, the Bad & the Queen project-- a record that, to my mind, remains sorely underappreciated because its tones, pace, and tenor was closer to an Albarn solo record than the work of its creators.) Albarn wound up moving from articulating the decay of Great Britain on GBQ to exploring the roots of an ascendent cultural and political force, and the resulting album is often difficult, completely unexpected, and at time precious; with increased spins, it becomes a rather settled, even comfortable, listen. ""If you don't know it now, then you will do,"" Albarn warned on GBQ's ""History Song"", and one gets the same feeling from Monkey-- that while this is likely to be an introduction to the unfamiliar for many of those who buy it, we'll all become much more versed in Chinese culture over the next two or three decades.","Blur's Damon Albarn and artist and designer Jamie Hewlett, having teamed for two top-selling albums as Gorillaz, have now adapted a 16th century Chinese novel into a modern opera. This album, in which they've re-arranged and re-articulated the production's music, is much better than the description would lead you to believe.

The Viola in My Life,Morton Feldman,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd03eb335119a49ecdb2/1:1/w_160/bb894073.jpg,2008-09-24 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12219-the-viola-in-my-life/,ECM,"Mark Twain famously said that the maxim puts ""a minimum of sound to a maximum of sense."" This perfectly describes the music of Morton Feldman, which resounds and vanishes simultaneously, with the limitless patience of something with nowhere in particular to go. Feldman came of musical age in a postwar America whose collective faith in progress had fallen casualty to concentration camps, atomic weapons, and other unfathomable horrors. Works that favored indeterminacy, repetition, and chance operations became accurate reflections of the world, which no longer obeyed any coherent narrative. It was an artistic moment characterized, as Vivian Gornick wonderfully put it in a recent Harper's article, by ""the veneration of spiritual exhaustion."" Feldman plied the art of exhaustion alongside John Cage, his close collaborator in New York and fellow trailblazer in untraditional notation and aleatoric composition, and the abstract expressionist painters (especially Robert Rauschenberg) whose liminal works in paint and collage Feldman mirrored in sound. All of them made art upon the model of weather, shifting atmospheric occurrences that could be endlessly pondered but not fathomed. Feldman especially courted this metaphor: He was a gatherer of ominous clouds presaging storms that never broke. Like most of Feldman's music, The Viola in My Life is fractured, mercurial, and seems indeterminately shaped: the ectoplasmic music of dreams. But in fact, Viola has a prescribed shape; the illusion of randomness stems from the protracted durations that were Feldman's specialty. The work's composition began in 1970, when he was returning to circumscribed charts after a long period of working with indeterminate graphic notations. In the middle of his career, he had the confidence to exile chance from his music while still sounding inimitably like himself. This new recording of Viola's four parts, originally written for American violist Karen Phillips, is conducted by Christian Eggen and played by the Cikada Ensemble and the Norwegian Radio Orchestra (while the viola, here played by Marek Konstantynowicz, is the primary engine, the piece includes flute, violin, piano, clarinet, celesta, percussion, and more). It's a remarkably austere work, where, as Paul Griffiths says in his liner notes, it's as if ""much of the music has been washed away, and we can hear only what's left."" What's left resembles a series of stepping stones in a dark, still pool, meandering aimlessly and often leaving the listener stranded somewhere in the middle. It lacks neither meter nor tonality, but goes to great lengths to obscure them via strategic omission and glacial tempo. Single viola notes well up and quickly subside beneath a vast nothingness, so that the music seems to be continually straining to begin. Contrapuntal flecks of piano, muffled percussion, and piercing woodwinds fill in some of the blanks, but not nearly all. Until the final movement, where the viola sinks into a bed of severe but comparatively full orchestration, Feldman plumbs the depths of the uncanny quietude just this side of silence. Viola asks for your undivided attention, and even then, it takes several listens to detect the shape of its crescendos; that sense of discovery is its reward. As such, it's supremely ill-suited to the multitasked attention and rapid digestion that characterize modern listening habits. And this is exactly what makes Feldman's music relevant in 2008: For me, it's about stepping out of the fast-paced clamor of mp3 aggregators, into a slow, quiet place where the act of listening becomes more like a meditation than a frenzy.","This piece from 20th century classical composer Morton Feldman, heard here in a new recording, moves along at his distinctive glacial pace and plumbs depths of quietude just this side of silence.

How to Walk Away,Juliana Hatfield,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcfcc0084474cd0c2bd8/1:1/w_160/5e39e8cd.jpg,2008-09-24 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12214-how-to-walk-away/,Ye Olde,"When the book is finally written, you'd figure there wouldn't be much to say about Juliana Hatfield. Except the book was written, by Hatfield herself-- a memoir, called When I Grow Up-- and she has plenty to say. Factor in the detailed and thorough dissections of her songs Hatfield's been posting on her website under the heading ""An Arm and a Leg"" and you might be convinced she (both with the Blake Babies and solo) is every bit as important as Boston scene peers, pioneers, and predecessors Mission of Burma, Galaxie 500 and the Pixies, let alone welterweights the Lemonheads. Don't be. Hatfield has released some fine music but really little more than that. Yet for a couple of years there, she loomed larger than some might have predicted, certainly given the modest impact of the Blake Babies. Hatfield's gift has always been an ability to connect with the seemingly disconnected, the losers, loners, and dreamers that never had a scene of their own. That these disparate souls eventually coalesced under the alt-rock umbrella was of course out of Hatfield's control, but for a moment there she did suddenly seem in tune with the rest of the world. That was then, and this is now, and once again Hatfield has been relegated to the sidelines. The difference is that now she seems comfortable and at ease with her place, successful enough to make a living but not so much fame as to be a distraction, and that left-of-center poise has ported over to her latest disc, How to Walk Away. Produced by Ivy's Andy Chase, it's a defiantly adult record, never pretending to be something it's not and often deceptively tougher than its jangle-pop exterior lets on. Hatfield's called this album very autobiographical, and in so far as she can be trusted, the singer's obviously been burned and has forgone the balm in favor of pain. Admittedly, Hatfield's naïf act was always a little disingenuous. Here she comes across honestly wounded and resentful. In ""The Fact Remains"", lies flood a home like levees breaking. In ""This Lonely Love"", she approaches the final chorus with the ghostly whisper of ""I'm alone."" In ""Shining On"", Hatfield tries to forget ""all the mistakes, disasters and words that should never have been spoken."" Still, she doesn't try too hard. Lies, loneliness, and recrimination are the name of this How to Walk Away game. ""He used to look in my eyes and talk to me, but now we just have sex and watch TV,"" she recalls in ""My Baby..."", and if there were still any question how ""he"" has left Hatfield feeling, there are nasty couplets like the ""Law of Nature"" simile ""Flies are feeding on someone's blood/ Isn't it kind of just like love?"" or the backhanded, backtracking diss in ""Just Lust"" of ""I never said I can't live without you, baby/ I just said you look good tonight."" That sharp words like these are generally paired with bright melodies and strummy guitars may be one of pop's oldest tricks, but Hatfield applies it well (certainly better than she applies a cameo from the Psychedelic Furs' Richard Butler on ""This Lonely Love""). Yet if Hatfield is as hurt as she seems, if she's in pain, it would have been a welcome change had she, even once, let some of that lingering anger out in the music as well as the lyrics. While it obviously takes someone strong to keep their cool and composure despite all evidence to the contrary, even the most pointed songs here, like ""Now I'm Gone"" or ""So Alone"", betray little of Hatfield's punkier roots, mostly sticking closely instead to safe singer-songwriter territory (think: Suzanne Vega or fellow Boston scene vet Aimee Mann). Songs this bitter demand catharsis, but nestled in its pop cocoon, that side of Hatfield's story instead gets stifled by the soft bomb approach when what you really want is for the singer, once and for all, to explode in rage and break something.","Juliana Hatfield turns heartbreak into chiming pop, staying safely inside singer-songwriter territory while the bitter, vengeful lyrics tell another story.

It's a candyland of lilting psychedelic moods and stoner nostalgia where songs undulate, shift form, and drool into one another. Listening to the whole 45-minute record at once is like taking an extended nap. At the end you feel relaxed, revived, and maybe just slightly dazed. Personal details about Koushik are about as ethereal as his music. Born in Ontario, Canada, Koushik Ghosh apparently started DJing at the age of 14, before earning masters degrees in biostatistics and ethnomusicology from the University of Vermont. Then, somehow, he wound up here-- gently guiding a raft of vibraphone samples over a lake of reverb for Stones Throw Records. Adhering to the road map laid out on his 2005 EP collection Be With (Out My Window features that record's title track), Koushik weaves his songs together from wispy psych-soul fragments and understated pop melodies, heavily referencing the Shuggie Otis-school of slightly buzzed R&B. Despite that, the record's heart is the drowsy half-baked daze that surrounds its moodier songs. Ballad ""Corner of Your Smile"" slides slowly into focus with Koushik's romantic musings drenched in echo. ""In a Green Space"" skews funkier, bringing up the drums and adding a slinky not-quite-on-the-beat bass line. Sure, there's some cheeseball elements here-- tinkling fender rhodes, breathy flutes, wind chimes. But even those elements are saved from chill-room hell by Koushik's airy vocals. Low in the mix and often doubled to the point of inscrutability, the producer's breathy singing and paisley lyrics add hooks to even his most slippery music. The end result is a delectable pop record, with Koushik's heavy ambiance and amorphous production combining to nudge his songs to their tingling crescendos.","Canadian producer/singer/songwriter Koushik's first proper full-length, the Stones Throw-released Out My Window, is serene 1960s psych-pop filtered through a cratedigger's collage of samples.

High Places,High Places,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd2cea9e61561daa765a/1:1/w_160/0a3d9b5a.jpg,2008-09-24 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12257-high-places/,Thrill Jockey,"""Recorded at home by High Places,"" reads the back cover of the Brooklyn duo's full-length debut. At this early point in their career, that's reassuring. High Places' profile has risen steadily in the last year and they've become a fixture at a handful of online destinations, but they're still by any measure a modest little band dedicated to a narrow stripe of aesthetic concerns which lend themselves well to home recording. Singer Mary Pearson's voice may have the range of a telephone touchpad, but she uses what she's got to get what she wants, getting over on tone, suggestion, and the occasional leap up a few notes for emphasis. Rob Barber manages all the weird junkshop percussion-- the metallic pings and wooden scrapes that seem held together with chewing gum and baling wire. The duo weaves a few wispy synths and samples around the beats and vocals, but they also leave a whole lot of space, and together it adds up to dub-kissed indie pop with a surprising rhythmic verve. In his review of High Places' singles collection 03/07 - 09/07 earlier this year, Pitchfork's Mike Powell began by noting that High Places were sometimes compared to Beat Happening, the influential indie band from Olympia, Wash. I'm onboard with the comparison, but High Places remind me even more of a few of the groups that issued cassettes on the 1990s for the then-Seattle-based micro-indie Slabco. Now-forgotten acts like Sukpatch, Volume All*Star, and Land of the Loops (the latter sometimes featured Heather Lewis from Beat Happening on vocals), extended the realm of lo-fi, home-recorded 4-track music to include drum machines, turntables, and most of all, samplers. They made tuneful, childhood-obsessed pop that adopted an ultra-cheap, sloppy Dust Brothers aesthetic that, true to twee form, valued enthusiasm more than skill. Record collections weren't particularly deep and the loops might have been poorly cut, but those records had a mood and charm all their own. They felt handmade and personal. High Places have broadened their palette a little, especially in regards to percussion-- the textures of which sometimes suggest the poppier end of mid-90s IDM-- but they're also clarifying what exactly a High Places song consists of. Two short interludes aside, there's a touch less abstraction here, and more in the way of song construction. These differences are minor, though, and for the most part the songs here are of a piece with 03/07 - 09/07. Single ""Vision's the First..."" shows the band in a very good light. Its slippery percussion could almost be mistaken for Aphex Twin circa I Care Because You Do, with booming tribal drumrolls fused to a pitch-shifted sample that acts as an additional rhythmic layer. And floating above the fray is Pearson's simple schoolyard-rhyme melody, calming intoning ""Oh, how very strange,"" to suggest a state of wonder. Such sidelong glances at the music of the past are found throughout this album, and High Places often gently subvert whatever they reference. The beat of the marching ""Namer"" nods at techno but would never play by such rigid rules, so when the kick drum and shakers pause for a second, the sonic energy of the tune suddenly seems to bubble up randomly through a crack. ""The Storm"" lays the reverb thick on Pearson's voice and drops out everything but percussion, invoking an air of Cocteau/Dead Can Dance-style 4AD, but High Places could never be that serious, and you never sense that so much is at stake. Rather, High Places specialize in that moment of thoughtful contemplation, that rare time when you're able to reflect a little and let your imagination wander. At such moments, your mind goes from your childhood to the future and back again, and might even pause to linger on death and the infinite, as with the flat-out gorgeous closer ""From Stardust to Sentience"". High Places are a specialty item, to be sure; they aren't trying to be all things to anybody. On the basis of what we've heard so far, they aim to hint, gesture, sketch, whisper, and then step back to give the listener room to fill things in and construct his or her own meaning. The subtlety of their music, and the underlying confidence that brings it forth, lies at the core of their appeal.","High Places' profile has been rising steadily in the past year and they've become a fixture at a handful of online destinations; now they finally issue their debut LP, a Thrill Jockey release full of dub-kissed indie pop with a surprising rhythmic verve.

Acid Tongue,Jenny Lewis,by: Joshua Love,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcf2ea9e61561daa75ce/1:1/w_160/94612e09.jpg,2008-09-24 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12249-acid-tongue/,WEAWarner Bros.,"Plenty of the most celebrated writers of the past century, from William Faulkner and Graham Greene to Michael Chabon and John Banville, have found cause or need to periodically interrupt their more individualized pursuits and produce work that strictly adhered to a certain niche such as horror, mystery, or sci-fi. For such authors, genre-bound detours often function as tie-loosening fodder-- playful, low-stakes, persona-dodging fare. As one of indie rock's preeminent lyricists and a fascinating personality in her own right, Jenny Lewis has similarly been trying her hand at already regimented styles, particularly over the course of her two most recent albums, the 2007 release Under the Blacklight from her band, Rilo Kiley, as well as her newest solo effort, Acid Tongue. Lewis made her name with highly conversational indie pop that played up her keen lyrical and vocal facilities for conveying humor, sexiness, and humanity, yet these latest recordings have found the former child actress retreating into classic soul, pop, and rock roles that inevitably mute her most appealing idiosyncracies and predilections. What separates Lewis from the aforementioned novelists is the fear that these moves represent a significant shift in artistic direction as opposed to a momentary diversion. As with Under the Blacklight, Acid Tongue is immediately pleasurable, brimming over with hooks and songwriting techniques that announce themselves with openness and surety. The problem then is one of staying power-- Lewis does such a good job of nailing choice sounds and styles from pop's past that you can't help getting reeled in right away; only upon later reflection do you realize that much of her success lies in evoking something else great rather than achieving a greatness more uniquely her own. The spacious echo of ""Black Sand"", the crackling tension of ""Pretty Bird"", and the blues-rock hysterics of ""Jack Killed Mom"" are enjoyable mostly insofar as they reenact the prior accomplishments of Jeff Lynne, Neil Young, and the White Stripes, respectively. Meanwhile, ""Bad Man's World"" and ""Trying My Best to Love You"" resume Blacklight's fetish for girl-group and early soul (with the former, to its credit, boasting a delectable bassline). Perhaps it sounds like I'm being too hard on Lewis, and it's true that in most other hands such simulacrums would likely be more forgivable. The difference with Lewis is that she's already displayed a distinct, undeniably compelling artistry that's mostly been given short shrift here. Her solo debut, 2006's Rabbit Fur Coat, was a rambling, intensely personal document of sexual and spiritual confusion that frequently conflated and commingled the twin urges in fascinating ways. Constant soul-baring isn't necessarily a healthy tactic for any songwriter, yet aside from the self-excoriating title track (the record's clear highlight, swiping the indie-gospel vibe that helped make RFC so indelible) and the early-Rilo-evoking ""Godspeed"", the majority of Acid Tongue lacks Lewis' singularly bracing, unabashed stamp. That's not to say she doesn't cut loose with aplomb on the blistering, eight-minute country-rock medley, ""The Next Messiah"" or raise a few goosebumps with the gently lilting ""Sing a Song for Them"". The first minute or so of the shit-kicking ""Carpetbaggers"" is pretty thrilling, too, at least until Elvis Costello shows up to wheeze all over everything. The point isn't that Lewis needs to stick to dirty jokes and jaunty twang (though country seems her natural milieu). There's more than enough likeable, listenable material on Acid Tongue, yet the effect is nonetheless equivalent to Tiger Woods trying to conquer the mini-golf circuit. In these straitjacketed settings, Lewis' considerable strengths as a lyricist and performer just aren't given sufficient room to fully emerge.","Rilo Kiley co-leader Jenny Lewis takes another solo bow with this immediately pleasurable genre record, one brimming over with hooks and songwriting techniques that announce themselves with openness and surety.

Fingerpointing,The Red Krayola,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcfeabf31b7dc7155e4b/1:1/w_160/ba6b6977.jpg,2008-09-23 06:00:05,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12215-fingerpointing/,Drag City,"Like a great CEO, Mayo Thompson identifies his blind spots and surrounds himself with talented people. When Red Krayola's avant-garde sparkle wore off in the mid-1970s, Thompson began a series of collaborations: with the Art & Language collective in the 70s, with the Raincoats and Pere Ubu in the 80s, and with Chicago's post-rock scene in the 90s. Fingerpainting, the 1999 Red Krayola album that resulted from Thompson's work with David Grubbs, Stephen Prina, et al. has been widely decried as one of the worst of Thompson's career, but it's redressed here as Fingerpointing, Jim O'Rourke's edit of the Fingerpainting sessions. It's a wholly odd revision, tightening the original album's turgid ""jams"" and tidying up its songcraft, but, in doing so, trading one set of indulgences for another. Avant-garde artists are often forgiven their worst sins-- the world has turned a blind eye to Faust's post-1990 material, for example-- but it's unlikely anyone is going to absolve the Red Krayola for releasing a 40-minute ""remix"" nearly a decade after the fact, much less so telling fans that the remix, the original album, and the Red Krayola debut Parable of Arable Land can be played simultaneously, Zaireeka-style, despite three different run-times and Parable having been recorded nearly 30 years prior to Fingerpainting with a separate group of musicians. (Here, let me save you some trouble: the rhythmic sync-up isn't quite as hellacious as you might think, but it otherwise sounds very much like you would expect two-and-a-half distinct Red Krayola albums to sound when played simultaneously.)  Adding insult to...insult, Fingerpointing's modest improvements on Fingerpainting come packaged as one continuous track, wagering that O'Rourke's pruning and primping are worth the loss of self-editing. Fingerpointing's presentation is silliness and arrogance on a grand scale, but O'Rourke does improve on Fingerpainting, and in doing so encourages a rethinking of the album's maligned status. O'Rourke wisely pares down noisiest, wordless bits, converting bullshit improvisations with names like ""The Greed of a Clarinet That Is Puffy From Crying Gets Tossed in Butter and Spread by Notes"" into tolerable interludes (and re-tabbing them, in the style of Parable, as ""Freeform Freakout"" volumes). Thompson's approximations of ""proper"" songs benefit most from the remastering, lifting his plain, familiar voice above his band's bookish clatter. Mayo's guitar is rough and gray and predictable, like a sidewalk, but its crude interplay with the electronic boil-- presumably provided mostly by the Chicago folks-- is pleasantly reminiscent of a time when ""guitars + electronics"" was not manifest destiny for every young rock band with Fruity Loops and an Aphex Twin album. The slow, cartoonish beats are the programming equivalent of Thompsons' guitar playing: simple, posed amateurism. The songs, at their best, are drone-y and nervous-- ""Vile Vile Grass"" and ""Mother""-- and, at their worst, tuneless and misshapen-- ""Bad Medicine"" and ""There There Betty Betty"". The album's final suite, ""In My Baby's Ruth/ Freeform Freakout 4"" is the type of post-everything thrum that Thompson has always excelled at: absurdist lyrics, barely recognizable post-rock guitar phrases, a legion of pot-bangers gathered around him, a cloistered love-in that would get you booted from all but the most accepting hippie communes. O'Rourke almost makes it work. As such, Fingerpointing suggests a subtle massaging of Red Krayola's mixed near-history but little else for anyone not already deeply invested in Thompson's particular brand of mad-hattery.","A long-shelved Jim O'Rourke remix/re-edit of Red Krayola's 1999 album Fingerpainting finally sees the light of day.

Looking Into It,All Girl Summer Fun Band,by: Rebecca Raber,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcfbabf31b7dc7155e45/1:1/w_160/dbde9c85.jpg,2008-09-23 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12213-looking-into-it/,AGSFB Music,"Looking Into It, the third full-length from Portland's All Girl Summer Fun Band, makes me miss the 1990s. I miss that era of unabashedly rocking women. I miss being inspired by those who banded together with other girls to prove that shrieking or shredding wasn't just the provenance of those with a Y chromosome. Mostly I miss that time when it felt like you didn't have to choose between being girly or gutteral, cutesy or combative. Don't get me wrong, it's not that those of the so-called gentler sex aren't making music anymore, it's that, primarily, they are doing so as melismatic divas, sex-kitten pop stars, solo folk artists, or frontwomen in a boys-club band-- all of which is fine, but nothing beats seeing a bunch of chicks with scruffy guitars, primitive beats, and catchy-as-all-hell melodies throttle through three-minute ditties without worrying about being lady-like, seductive, or serious. And with their new disc, All Girl Summer Fun Band have made me forget how long it's been since I'd heard such an act. Though it has been five years since their last outing, AGSFB haven't changed much (save the loss of one member), which is strangely comforting. The now-trio-- the Thermals' Kathy Foster, former Softie Jen Sbragia, and Kim Baxter, who recorded and engineered this album-- is a musical democracy with each member contributing vocals, pitching in with the songwriting, and switching off instruments. Looking Into It isn't doing anything new-- it's another round of sugary girl-group harmonies layered over fuzzy punk basslines and lo-fi guitar riffs-- but its insistent, often cuddly pop is more sophisticated than these Girls' previous offerings. ""Woo""-heavy album opener ""Not the One for Me"" sounds like the infectiously sweet and sassy songs by the faux band in the movie Josie and the Pussycats (that's no dis; Babyface wrote those!). And tracks like ""Trajectory"" and ""Oh No"" blend 1960s bubblegum melodies with delightfully sloppy do-it-yourself execution, adding edge to their sweetness while bleeding their punk influences of anything remotely aggressive. With their gushy enthusiasm and chipper Lush vocals, AGSFB are at their best when blowing through their songs with freight-train velocity, bouncing along with their plucky bass throb and joyously wild drumming (as on ""Everything I Need""). But keeping the album from being a one-note collection, their slower tracks-- ""Rewind"", Sbragia's ode to her deceased brother, and ""Lost"", a dreamy, mid-tempo gem with an acoustic foundation-- show off compositional maturity and dynamic diversity. And record closer ""This Will Never End"", which opens with a call-and-response section of stingingly harmonized ""ah""s and the album's most incendiary (and surprisingly krautrock-inspired) riffs, shows off Baxter's steely guitar chops, reminding listeners that while AGSFB is often purposely messy, its three members can put on their virtuoso faces when necessary. Despite my own nostalgia for the riot grrrl days, what I love most about Looking Into It is that it isn't pushing an agenda. AGSFB are just three women who want to rock out and not make a big deal about it. Their band name says it all: All Girl Summer Fun Band are proud to be a kick-ass all-female trio, but their main objective isn't to explore gender politics, it's just to have a sunny good time.","The Portland band's third LP, full of sugary girl-group harmonies layered over fuzzy punk basslines and lo-fi guitar riffs, recalls a time (the 1990s) when female rockers banded together to prove that shrieking and shredding wasn't just the provenance of those with a Y chromosome.

Brotherman OST,The Final Solution,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd00eb335119a49ecdaf/1:1/w_160/55602c3b.jpg,2008-09-23 06:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12217-brotherman-ost/,Numero Group,"Back in 1990, Homer Simpson, fresh off an unsuccessful stint as the assistant mascot for the Capital City Capitals, wondered aloud why people enjoy hearing tales of failure and woe. It's a good question. Is it that we all, on some level, can relate? Does it just make us feel better about our own failures? Whatever the reason, there's no denying that the most compelling stories are often the sad ones, where chances are missed, success is dangled just out of reach, and circumstances conspire to create disappointment. The primary appeal of the Numero Group imprint is the great music it unearths, but there's an underlying draw in the label's focuses on the near- and not-so-near-misses to tell us stories we love to hear and repeat. The tale of the Final Solution and the would-be soundtrack to Brotherman is a classic story of people suffering failure they didn't deserve, either on a personal level or in terms of the quality of their art. The Final Solution were a Chicago vocal quartet that began life in the early 1960s as the Kaldirons, by all accounts a superb live act but remembered on wax only by a single 45 for Twinight (included on Numero's own Twinight's Lunar Rotation comp). The single was even mis-credited to the Kaldirons. Needing a fresh start in the early 70s, they changed the name to the Final Solution, completely oblivious to the phrase's Nazi implications. The quartet re-united with a friend from high school, guitarist and songwriter Carl Wolfolk, who had penned a few hits, including Tyrone Davis' ephocal Chicago soul classic ""Can I Change My Mind"". Their first opportunity to record came from an unexpected source: a group of Chicago advertising men attempting to make their first feature film, a cash-in on the Blaxploitation genre that was popular at the time. The soundtrack had proven an immensely important piece of the Blaxploitation puzzle-- indeed, with only a few exceptions, they are far better remembered and loved today than the films themselves. Fellow Chicagoans the Impressions had just scored with the OST for Three the Hard Way, and the producers of Brotherman figured they'd get the soundtrack out of the way first, bringing in Wolfolk to write and arrange while the Solution sang. The sessions lasted all of 24 hours, and only two instrumentals ever received the intended orchestration, and then, of course, the film itself failed to materialize, leaving the score in limbo until now. Truthfully, the fact that none of the vocal tunes ever got the string and horn parts intended for them is a blessing. Instead, what we get to hear now are raw, funky soul tracks with a rougher sound than most other products of 1974 recording studios. The harmonies are right up front, with only guitar, bass, and drums to back them. And what guitar parts! Wolfolk played far more elaborately than he might normally have to simulate the anticipated orchestration, and the result is wild. It's somewhat like having a fifth voice in the mix at times, and it lends a very distinctive sound to the album. The title track (not intended to be the main theme) is just thrilling, with Wolfolk's guitar jumping and diving through a chicken-scratch symphony while his cohorts gather round the mic and take his lyrics about the pusher who became a preacher in close harmony. The song has a nervous energy to it, and if the film had ever been made, we might be talking about it in the same breath as ""Bucktown"" and ""Superfly"", if not quite ""Theme From Shaft"" and ""Across 110th Street"". Wolfolk was given no lyrical direction, an implicit acknowledgement by the producers that the songs hardly needed a connection to the film, and listening, it really doesn't matter what the movie might have looked like. I'll use myself as an example: I own around 20 soundtracks for films that could be considered part of the Blaxploitation genre, and I've seen only two of the films (Shaft and Black Belt Jones, if you were wondering). This album, now that it's finally out, just skips the hard work of making a forgettable movie and gives you the tunes you would've come for in the first place. Wolfolk and co. cover a lot of ground, leaping from gritty funk tracks to suave balladry, and it's clear from the easy melodicism of the songs, the seamless meld of the voices, and Wolfolk's distinctive guitar, which sometimes sounds almost Spanish or Arabian, that these guys could have been contenders if given a fair shot. That fair shot never came though, and the story is irresistible today for that fact. The Final Solution didn't last long after the recording sessions, with one member tragically blowing his life away via syringe. Wolfolk spent two years trying to wrangle the tapes back from the failed filmmakers, who never so much as completed a final script. Then those tapes spent 30 years in a closet with little prospect for a public airing. Thanks to a series of serendipitous meetings on the streets of Chicago, though, we can finally hear them, a long-delayed happy ending for a long story of tribulation.","The Numero Group unearths a lost soundtrack recorded in 1974 by an obscure Chicago band for a Blaxploitation film that was never made.

Loyalty to Loyalty,Cold War Kids,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd25abf31b7dc7155e9e/1:1/w_160/28a5bce0.jpg,2008-09-23 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12251-loyalty-to-loyalty/,Downtown,"Cold War Kids' 2006 debut Robbers & Cowards became a hotly contested battleground for those always-delightful conceptual debates regarding bias for or against religious bands, Los Angeles bands, and blog bands, almost making it hard to remember that the record started out as a musically divisive effort. Nathan Willett's vocals (still most accurately likened to drunken Jeff Buckley karaoke) were a hell of a lot to take and the band's inexplicable decision to cover ""A Change Is Gonna Come"" hinted at soul brother aspirations that more often manifested itself in a white man's burden. If it seemed like too much was placed on the shoulders of an instantly familiar release, it's because Cold War Kids occasionally gave the hint that they're worth the trouble: They carry a topicality absent in much of modern rock and even if they fell short of honoring their obvious influences, they're the type a band can spend a fruitful career growing into. But Loyalty to Loyalty takes the lead from its bullish title, conjuring not Sam Cooke, but George Costanza by stating in no uncertain terms, ""this is the show, and we're not gonna change it."" Which considering the success of its predecessor-- about 169K copies sold and counting-- should work just fine for the Fullerton group. And besides, in a world where Dirty Projectors' Dave Longstreth and the Hold Steady's Craig Finn can play festivals, an unorthodox and even annoying voice isn't a dealbreaker. But while those others act as vehicles for inventive arrangements or stirring narratives, too much of Loyalty is held hostage by Willett's need to put himself up front at the expense of everything else, a *Speed-*like situation where he sounds like a song could potentially die if he isn't going full-blast at all times. It's a disconnect between form and function-- too often, he sounds like he's straining under the admittedly weighty subject matter rather than letting any of his stories speak for themselves. To CWK, ""soul"" is equated to unhinged belting-- it's difficult to hear ""Something Is Not Right With Me"" as genuine despair despite some admittedly funny lyrics when Willett flails about no differently than just about any other track. ""Jazz"", meanwhile is equated to circling the proper pitch like a one-winged vulture. During the interminable first half of the ""Lilac Wine""-meets-""Arm & Hammer"" fusion ""Avalanche in B"", the title is the only indication that Willett is aware of the key at all. Opener ""Against Privacy"" somehow turns out to be heavy-handed about its opacity-- you can imagine it's about Republicans from the few lines that take, but it trips up on Willett‘s conspiratorial Yorke-isms (""Forget ex-girlfriends/ We want little governments"") and a complete lack of a hook. And if there's a more concise microcosm of the Cold War Kids experience, it's ""Every Man I Fall For""-- I imagine they'll get brownie points for flipping gender roles and having Willett sing from the perspective of a woman enamored with the strong and violent type, but it's puffed up with details straight out of central casting, ""love and hate"" knuckle tattoos, winking paramours, etc. As fantasy, it's old hat and as reality, it just doesn't wash. If anything, you can admire the rhythm section thanklessly becoming a more solid team. Even if ""Welcome to the Occupation"" (not an R.E.M. cover) spends its entirety in search of a tune, the band makes the trek worthwhile with constantly shifting, percussive clatter. On sound alone, it should sidle up nicely with anyone who dug the Walkmen's You & Me, with its tom-heavy beats and chalky, reverbed guitars-- the martial beat of ""I've Seen Enough"" is muscular in a way they've never been before, summoning the venom Willett's lyrics only hint at. And when Willett allows himself to give into a good melody, the first half is stocked more palatable numbers like ""Mexican Dogs"" and ""Every Valley Is Not a Lake"", which bring the same sort of yelp-along pleasure that made ""Hang Me Out to Dry"" a standout. But ultimately, Loyalty to Loyalty leaves a weird aftertaste, and it's not just because the penultimate ""Relief"" tries to prop itself up on Willett's falsetto harangues and stuttering slap-bass, before ""Cryptomnesia"" ends the record collapsing into a rumpled heap. The band name implies unspoken conflict, perhaps between the bullshit romantic ideals afforded by youth or 200-level Lit courses and the aspiration to be an old soul, wise beyond one's years. But as anyone who's dealt with a friend who's traveled abroad and all of a sudden thought they were Hemingway (or Zack Condon) likely knows, those urges more often work hand in hand to reinforce each other.  And the result is, in short, belief in one's own hype. Proponents raved that Cold War Kids arrived fully formed, but as the band continues to stubbornly emphasize their weaknesses, Loyalty To Loyalty is proof that their detractors can say the same thing.","After the wild success of Robbers & Cowards made them one of recent years' biggest new indie rock bands, Cold War Kids return with more of the same-- weighty subject matter tackled with rhythmic agility and sledgehammered vocals.

The Hawk Is Howling,Mogwai,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd1beb335119a49ecde1/1:1/w_160/1359e2f7.jpg,2008-09-23 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12241-the-hawk-is-howling/,Matador,"In 2003, Mogwai released their fourth full length, Happy Songs for Happy People, and its reception ranged from middling to favorable. Some praised the band's scope, grandeur, and willingness to explore beyond the bounds of the quiet-loud-louder dynamic it had mastered; others lamented a lack of the same, alternately calling Happy Songs too soft, too small, or too stiff. Happy Songs now feels like a summation of Mogwai's past, graced with good ideas for its future. Unfortunately, the music that led to that nexus has been much more compelling than what has emerged from it. Mogwai's new album, The Hawk Is Howling, is the next iteration of the sound that began with Happy Songs. You get a handful of abbreviated heavy tracks, an equitable batch of somnolent drifts, and the occasional suggestive-of-the-future curveball. Just like 2006's Mr. Beast, Hawk follows an unevenly stacked 10-song structure, opening with a stately piano build (""Auto Rock"" versus ""I'm Jim Morrison, I'm Dead""), a ferocious follow (""Glasgow Mega-Snake"" versus ""Batcat""), and a drifting reverie (""Acid Food"" versus ""Danphe and the Brain"") before allowing the middle sag into vacuity. The last three tracks of both records form suites of sorts: Track eight offers a hint of menace, which is reined in on a gentle follow-up before the closer amplifies it all. It's a sensible strategy, and The Hawk Is Howling is ultimately listenable, understandable, and vaguely likable. Like the songs that shape it, though, the album just feels redundant and tenuous, like the last empty cloud trailing behind a fierce storm. Part of the problem, it seems, is that at its frequent best Mogwai's music is more than the sum of its instrumental parts. While the band's musicianship feels competent enough, the components themselves are rarely intricate or involved. Instead, the feeling pushed the songs through-- an unspoken understanding, it seems, that the band is arriving at some indefinable place, and we're just lucky enough to listen in. Neither the eerie majesty of ""2 Rights Make 1 Wrong"" nor the exhausting force of ""Like Herod"" are difficult to understand musically, but-- atmospherically-- they're brilliant, elusive, and mysterious. This partly explains why so many bands have pilfered Mogwai's trademark intervals and itinerant epic structures, even if they've gotten it wrong: Mogwai sound grand, but the stuff's not too hard to play. I mean, how many imitation Orthrelm's do you know? But over the band's six full-lengths, there's been a steady increase in production value, in making the parts sound better or more perfectly tough and mean. So, while ""Batcat"" boasts viscous guitars and, in general, good mixing, its ""savage"" parts sound too self-conscious, almost as though the song's been flooded with alternate guitar takes that are mostly just pedals being twisted and turned to maximize cacophony. Unlike ""Mogwai Fear Satan"", for instance, it seems less the product of letting go and more the waste of deliberately meeting old expectations. The appropriately named ""The Precipice"" is a seven-minute ascent through a simple guitar pattern, vaguely resembling Rhys Chatham's Guitar Trio. It sounds great, but it also sounds exactly like what you'd expect. Frustratingly, Mogwai don't seem dexterous enough to take chances within their old meme. So, of course, the band tries new sounds, which is where Hawk really slips. Mid-album pair ""The Sun Smells Too Loud"" and ""Kings Meadow"" lean heavily on electronics, and they fail epically. ""Sun"" begins smartly enough, pitting a slim, serrated little guitar riff against wide, low bass tones. But a tinny synthesizer overruns the track, its frivolous notes rattling across everything. The track goes nowhere. In fact, Mogwai miss with most of the electronics on Hawk: The static whirs beneath the opening piano bars of ""I'm Jim Morrison, I'm Dead"" are trite enough to be a Christian Fennesz plug-in for GarageBand. ""Kings Meadow"" adds a layer of paint-by-numbers digital synthesis beneath chiming piano and guitar. It's texturally boring, distracting from the song's pleasant sway in favor of a bastardized Oval plea. Mogwai don't do this stuff well, and here they try to do it beneath structures they've used for more than a decade. At the risk of contrition, I wish this wasn't the case. Mogwai-- for me and for many-- have meant an awful lot. There have been moments that I've wished all music would sound more like Mogwai-- brazen, strong, and redemptive or atmospheric, reserved, and cool. But the only reason I keep listening to The Hawk Is Howling is because Mogwai's name is attached. Hawk makes marginal stylistic advances that it could stand to omit, and it lightly retreads stuff that needs no recapitulation. I hope Mogwai make another great album soon, and I hope it sounds nothing like EP+2, Young Team, or Rock Action. Really, I wish Mogwai could just forget what ""Mogwai"" sounds like. Maybe then, they'd finally make another record that doesn't glance backward at outdated obligations. Mostly, though, I hope Mogwai doesn't make another album that sounds like Mr. Beast or The Hawk Is Howling-- that is, another bland reduction of splendid antecedents.","Mogwai's new album, The Hawk Is Howling, is the next iteration of the sound that began with 2003's Happy Songs for Happy People and continued with 2006's Mr. Beast: You get a handful of abbreviated heavy tracks, an equitable batch of somnolent drifts, and the occasional suggestive-of-the-future curveball.

Reach Out EP,Music Go Music,by: Jessica Suarez,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcfaea9e61561daa75e1/1:1/w_160/fd1c830b.jpg,2008-09-22 06:00:05,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12212-reach-out-ep/,Secretly Canadian,"The anonymous members of Music Go Music are also the less-anonymous members of another, somewhat-known indie band. They don't want to be identified, and that's fair. (Although one could argue that their label voluntarily sharing this unsolicited information, and then insisting the press keep quiet about it isn't fair to their potential fans.) But since they regard their anonymity as important to their music as their synthesizers, we'll keep the secret. It's relevant to note that Music Go Music do share their other band's fascination with mysticism and the power of love. But for all the overindulgence associated with the 1970s tropes they exploit, they're somewhat chaste in their appreciation of excess. Vocal production choices are important touchstones for Music Go Music: ABBA's overdubs are here, but so is Karen Carpenter's melancholy and Geddy Lee's high notes. Scattered across their two 12"" EPs (the first, Light of Love came out in May) are references so easy to identify that it becomes hard to tell if you enjoy ""Reach Out"" because it's a good song, or because it reminds you of other good songs. In that way Music Go Music falls somewhere between Girl Talk's memory jacking and the ""post-retro"" tendencies of the Pipettes. What Music Go Music remind you of is better off as a list: ELO and ABBA, the Edgar Winter Group and Journey. It's the drama and synthesizers, surely, but it's also the details. ""Let my voice be your guide,"" the female protagonist of ""Reach Out"" urges, but really it follows (as do the guitar and piano and bass) the same vocal line, creating a mini-tornado of drama. Each section of the song is a different flavor of schmaltz and cheese. Light as a metaphor, something used heavily in their first EP, continues across these three tracks. In Music Go Music's sunbathed world, you must face the flame (""Reach Out"") and follow the setting sun (""Goodbye, Everybody""), stepping out in the morning light (""Just Me""). It's easy to see the light as a metaphor for love, but on ""Reach Out"" lead singer Gala Bell burns not with lust, but with ""empathy."" It's a strange word choice and it sounds flat next to ""Reach Out""'s bombast. But in some ways it's more appropriate, as it furthers the idea that Music Go Music are in this sound, but not of it, curious observers trying on interesting skins. ""Goodbye, Everybody"" can't maintain the high drama of its predecessor; indeed, the point seems to be morning-after deflation. It's comparatively minimal, but just as easily placed. Nearly every line is a lyrical cliché: ""all my dreams have turned to dust,"" ""can't be right to feel so wrong."" ""Same old story, pretty sad, but true,"" it warns over piano and light orchestra strings. ""Just Me"" finishes the arc, as the speaker reminds herself that she's all she needs over a synth arpeggio that is, really, all the song needs. Music Go Music don't break character on this single. ""Just Me"", introduces a foreign-sounding male background vocal that may show some self-consciousness, but it could be just another inspired touch of authenticity. The most authentic thing Music Go Music do isn't these touches though, nor is it their appetite for excess. It's their anonymity. Each part of these songs, from the instruments, to the voices, to the lyrics, are approachable only as sounding like something else; that they themselves are only known as other people is fitting. A lot of the inspiration here came from foreign bands and foreign sounding women presented in soft focus.","The second 12"" EP from the L.A.-based Music Go Music continues their obession with 1970s pop touchstones like ABBA and the Carpenters.

Fajar Di Atas Awan,Suarasama,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd01ea9e61561daa75f1/1:1/w_160/3df0946a.jpg,2008-09-22 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12218-fajar-di-atas-awan/,RFI FranceRFI France,"The internet may be diminishing, if not outright destroying, the notion of obscurity. But from Alan Lomax to the folks at Sublime Frequencies, as long as there's someone driven enough to seek out new sounds, there will always be new sounds waiting to be discovered. The celestial jukebox is nowhere near full. Even Drag City has been on a global kick lately, via its Yaala Yaala imprint. Now comes the indie's reissue of Suarasama's 1998 Radio France Internationale debut Fajar Di Atas Awan, which is labeled a Drag City proper release. The disc could pass for something from (the Drag City-distributed) Language of Stone, or even another enigmatic project featuring D.C. house band staples Will Oldham and Matt Sweeney. But the passing resemblance of Suarasama's music to oft-cited psych or weird folk figures demonstrates that discovery works both ways. Just as music listeners in the West have spent the past several decades digging up strange, exotic sounds from the East, so are musicians in the East constantly discovering and digesting music made in the West, and from the rest of the world as well. Led by the husband-and-wife team of Irwansyah Harahap (he writes the songs) and Rithaony Hutajulu (she sings, mostly), the Indonesian group draws as much from Central and Southeast Asia, Europe, and the Middle East as it does from its Sumatran heritage, the result being a music particularly free, open, and intriguingly rootless. The album title translates to ""dawn over clouds,"" and the music does reflect that heavenly (or, more broadly, spiritual) imagery. With compositions that rarely fall short of the seven-minute mark, and one that runs twice that, the group's songs are given room to stretch and breathe, achieving a certain inner peace that overcomes whatever cultural or language barriers might keep people from connecting with them. The secret to the album's serenity may lie in its origins. Fajar Di Atas Awan was apparently born as a live RFI broadcast and reportedly never intended for official release, which may explain the relaxed pacing and loose arrangements, built as they typically are out of simple guitar or gambus patterns and embellished with only the barest hints of percussion and other peripheral elements. The results are frequently too gentle to be outright stunning, but engagingly euphonious all the same. This is patient music, never in a hurry to get anywhere in particular, yet all the more impactful when it finally reaches its destination. Tracks such as ""Sang Hyang Guru"" and ""Fajar Di Atas Awan"" are as meditative as the most ""out"" folk, while ""Habibullah"" and ""Zapin Rindu"" capture something slightly more celebratory. ""Lebah"" and ""Zapin Rindu"" are tinged with sadness and solemnity. And listening to a song such as ""Merangkai Warna"" for 14 minutes, the track may as well last 40 minutes, or 400 minutes, or 400 years. While any epiphanies are ultimately in the ear of the beholder, there's no question that the group is reaching for something bigger than itself, searching beyond borders in all directions and dimensions for spiritual truth by way of melody.","Originally released 10 years ago on RFI France, Indonesian band Suarsama's spiritual and gently free-spirited Fajar Di Atas Awan gets its belated U.S. introduction by way of Drag City.

Heavenly Bender,Sam Champion,by: David Bevan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcff13d197565213b448/1:1/w_160/a2ba11a3.jpg,2008-09-22 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12216-heavenly-bender/,North StreetNorth Street,"""Nothing is sacred, nothing gets you high anymore."" Sam Champion singer/guitarist Noah Chernin repeatedly deadpanned those words on his Brooklyn indie rock outfit's debut full-length, 2004's Slow Rewind, a rightfully overlooked slacker-rock workout that drew less favorable comparisons to Pavement than did fellow neo-classicists Tapes 'N Tapes just a few months later. Not many people outside of New York really tasted Sam Champion's tapes. So given the subsequent critical discussion on whether or not it was too soon to revive that particular aesthetic, it seems like they were right on time-- though just as short on fresh ideas. In the two or three years Heavenly Bender has taken to incubate, Sam Champion have taken to expanding their sound to recall more than the wry half-smiles and meanderings of Pavement. They've dirtied their jeans, studied the moves of Crazy Horse, grown fuses for detonating, and become a live band that make believers out of non-believers-- a feeling that has translated well to record here. Opening stretches as fruitful or sweet are difficult to come by. ""Like a Secret"" weds ten sheets of XTC-brand sparkle to bungee guitar lines that morph from monkey bars to white squall in the course of only three minutes. ""Be Mine Everyone"" is a tried-and-true roadhouse burner that lives and dies by the delicious, scuzzbucket riff that drives it. While Chernin's still a near-dead ringer for Stephen Malkmus at times, his delivery-- despite shaggy obfuscations-- has found venom that matches the teeth-gnashing of the rhythm section (Jack Dolgen and Ryan Thornton) behind him. That leadoff's pace counteracts well the droll, stubbornly mid-tempo work that weighed them down previously. It also signals more: they've become a band that's broken loose zigzagging through more decades than just one, playing cards with the Zombies as often as the Pixies. No frills, less fuss. But as clear as that opening switch to afterburners rings, much of Heavenly Bender sounds too-worn in at times, hooks still more familiar than barbed. Pitchfork's Ian Cohen noted recently in his review of Dr. Dog's latest that the album's viscosity allowed it to slide in one ear and out the other with ease. It's a problem that riddles the flatter corners of this record, particularly non-descript closer ""Commitments"". Anyone that grew up teething on grunge or classic rock can appreciate what's been done here, but will they come back to it? Still, cuts like the gorgeous, string-laden ""Lorraine"" or ""We Will Awaken"" and its combustive, Youngian coda are just as indicative of the band's growth. In the latter, what begins as a drizzly shuffle of piano and guitar turns into a werewolf of a song. It sits pretty in the middle of an album marred not by any shortage of riffage (see: ""Jealous Shakes""), but stands out as a song you could scribble Sam Champion's name on and not someone else's.","These Brooklyn indie rockers have dirtied their jeans, studied the moves of Crazy Horse, and become a more formidable live band in the time since 2004's Pavement-esque Slow Rewind, but how do these changes translate in the studio?

Motion to Rejoin,Brightblack Morning Light,by: Andrew Gaerig,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd1a13d197565213b485/1:1/w_160/0533bc42.jpg,2008-09-22 06:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12240-motion-to-rejoin/,Matador,"It's tempting to consider the title of Brightblack Morning Light's third album, Motion to Rejoin, a plea to return to a society they've left behind. The notoriously itinerant duo called Alabama and California home, but since their eponymous sophomore album for Matador put them on the map in 2006, they've moved off the grid to a New Mexico hut powered by a few solar panels. One listen to the ritually narcotic Motion to Rejoin, however, signals that all manner of shaman/hippie/Bohemian trappings are still very much the order of the day. Though it's easy to think of Brightblack as texturally homogeneous purveyors of mood music, revisiting Brightblack Morning Light reminds that Naybob Shineywater and Rachael Hughes have a defter sonic touch than they're often given credit for: songs experience movements, buoyed by the odd piano or horn section, and contain actual riffs. On Motion to Rejoin, Brightblack's compositional subtlety manifests itself in overt nods to American musics: shades of gospel, soul, and even funk are all marinated in Brightblack's low, flat tones. Hughes' thumbing Rhodes lines and Shineywater's cattail guitar remain the dominant elements of every song, but Motion to Rejoin is more tremulous than its predecessor, the same way a high-zoom photo might be blurred with a slight shake of the camera. Make whatever ha-ha-stoner jokes you will, but it takes no small amount of discipline to unravel music as consistently slow as that of Hughes and Shineywater. Brightblack have now released over 140 minutes of music without showing even a cursory interest in acceleration or haste. At this point their style seems less likely to be framed by medicinal sleepiness or amateur craftsmanship and more likely the intriguing notion that the pace of these records represents the speed at which Brightblack's world moves. Motion to Rejoin's songs therefore aren't ""drug"" or ""hippie"" music, and they don't develop so much as accumulate. On ""Gathered Years"" horns gain prominence over the course of dozens of bars and only after the vocals dissipate, as if snowballing too many elements at once might generate the type of momentum Brightblack avoid so meticulously. ""Summer Hoof"" treads wordlessly for over five minutes, slowly gathering the album's sunniest and most optimistic tones. ""Oppressions Each"" stands as the duo's most coherent statement to date, both sonically and lyrically. A piano stalks out discrete chords as minimal Stax horns give the song an almost dexterous trot. Shineywater's hazy vocals, blessed with the gospel contours of sisters Ann and Regina McCreary, tackle all manner of oppression-- ""medicine,"" ""fence line,"" ""city light,"" and ""store bought"" are all noted-- and he and the sisters' chorus (""Nobody wants oppression/ We don't need oppression"") is eerily hum-able. ""Past a Weatherbeaten Fencepost"" recalls early Funkadelic in both its slow metallic flange and swamp-soaked moans. ""Hologram Buffalo"" might be the most easily mocked Brightblack track yet-- it mentions tee-pees, clouds, rainbows, deer, and buffalo-- but after a short intro track it establishes the album's spacey ponder with a bubbling bass and Hughes' shyly playful keyboard leads. The featherweight orchestral moments of ""A Rainbow Aims"" are an obtuse nod to the West Coast psych-pop of Love or Buffalo Springfield. Of course, every reference above needs a qualifier; any time you see ""Funkadelic"" or ""Love"" or ""Spiritualized"" please mentally insert ""a crawling, paranoid, barely discernible version of,"" which is akin to saying that Brightblack still sound a lot like Brightblack. But the added signifiers-- and the glacial speed at which they float by-- lend a measure of specificity and detail to Motion to Rejoin that is wholly comforting; the musical embodiment of Shineywater detailing in the liner notes his preferred styles of tent and sleeping bag. It can be difficult to defend a band that still advocates quasi-batshit behavior like asking fans to bring crystals to its shows, but be thankful the only thing Brightblack are interested in rejoining is the wilderness: The farther they wander, the more magnetic they become.","Like a chopped'n'screwed version of Spiritualized, Brightblack Morning Light's spatial hymns meticolously unfold, revealing shades of gospel, soul, and even funk marinating in their low, flat tones.

Dear Science,TV on the Radio,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bd21eb335119a49ecdef/1:1/w_160/a86c2e63.jpg,2008-09-22 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12246-dear-science/,4AD,"Dear Science, TV on the Radio's follow-up to 2006's Return to Cookie Mountain-- a dense and textural album with an optimistic core-- is catchier, but thornier than its predecessor. Musically, it's an instant grabber: Handclaps crack like fireworks. TVOTR's horns, courtesy of the Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra, sound punchier and brighter than ever before. Vocalists Tunde Adebimpe and guitarist/singer Kyp Malone thrive as dual frontmen: They're sexy when they're angry, and even sexier when they're not. And David Sitek's production is shiny and urgent, while his harsher synths and doo-dads hang back like a commentary track. But making popular music sits uneasily with this art-rock crew, and so although this is TV on the Radio's slickest, catchiest, and potentially most popular LP, it nevertheless reeks with dread. Lyrics about the dead, death, and dying litter the album from its second line onward. Songs with sentimental titles carry the most dire lyrics-- like ""Family Tree"", a gorgeous ballad about forbidden love whose titular plant becomes a gallows. And the lyrics to ""Red Dress"" are almost childishly pouty. Assuming the role of industry-bred stars, TVOTR complain that instead of waving collective fists in the air, listeners are merely getting down to their Prince-like guitars and brash brass: ""They got you tamed, and they got me tamed."" But the self-hatred makes it engaging: ""I'm living a life not worth dying for."" The promise of dancing away all your troubles hangs over every sweaty note, until TVOTR happily yank it away. On ""Dancing Choose"", the big chorus and synth power-chords interrupt the funk and double-time vocals to remind us this is a rock band, prone to making big statements. See also ""DLZ"", a half-rap, half-primal scream from Adebimpe that sounds like it's aimed at every figure of power in the world. But how do they follow that? With a big brash song about fucking. Anthemic horns and parade drums treat the whole thing like a football pep rally, ""I'm gonna take you, I'm gonna shake you, I'm gonna make you cum."" That could be their most transparent lyric yet. ""Shout Me Out"" is the only cut that reveals any unselfconscious joy. With a chorus that borrows well from Bob Dylan's ""A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall"", it comes the closest to the raw sound of their past works: Repetitive guitar and a chiming synth loop introduce Adebimpe singing a gentle verse, as the song builds to a fantastic, frenetic release and the electric guitar crackles and rails along. This is familiar territory for them-- and they get out fast. Yes, this is shit-hot thrilling music. But it's also brainy and ambivalent, and more engaging for it. TV on the Radio remain a true Event Band, and the sign o' the times they capture here isn't audacious hope, or fierce revolution: it's confusion. They're the house band for a country that has no idea what'll hit it next, and Dear Science is a jagged landscape of self-doubt, Bush-hate, and future-fear. And once in a while, you still get some of their optimism. Take the first single and the album's fulcrum, ""Golden Age"", which ice skates to heaven on billowing horns, sweet swirling strings, a video that stars harmless dancing cops, and Malone's falsetto. Malone has said it's about ""utopia."" And he sings like he still believes in it. But he has nothing to back him up but the beat.","Musically shit-hot but also brainy and ambivalent, the latest from TV on the Radio cements them as a true Event Band, and the sign o' the times they capture here isn't audacious hope, or fierce revolution: it's confusion.

More Sad Hits,Damon & Naomi,by: Mia Clarke,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bce2c0084474cd0c2ba6/1:1/w_160/c6defb93.jpg,2008-09-19 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12197-more-sad-hits/,Shimmy DiscShimmy Disc,"When Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang's debut album More Sad Hits was originally released in 1992, it shared a sonic aesthetic with the UK shoegaze scene that had been on slow burn for a number of years. As the former rhythm section of Galaxie 500, the Cambridge, Massachusetts, duo had already identified with the enigmatic sound of groups such as Cranes, Cocteau Twins, and Slowdive. More Sad Hits continued this trade of influences: blurring boundaries with guitars that sound like synths, keyboards that sound like guitars wired to a dozen glorious chorus pedals, and massive, lush song structures. Choosing More Sad Hits as a title could well be seen as a gently sarcastic nod to this period of shoegazing, which frequently featured bleak, melodramatic lyrics-- something Damon and Naomi also craft well, though their music at this time was more light-hearted in sound than some of their more goth-influenced contemporaries. On first impressions the material on More Sad Hits can feel overly repetitive and somewhat passive compared to the extraordinary beauty of Galaxie 500's greatest moments, which makes it an easy album to navigate, but trickier to love immediately. It needs time. The vein of fragility that overrides the sound-- wistful vocal melodies, seemingly sloppy song structures-- is deceiving, because the songs gradually reveal themselves as multifaceted and deftly spun compositions that allow intrigue to flourish within even the most delicate passages. In songs such as ""Laika"" and ""This Car Climbed Mt. Washington"" (a different version was originally released in 1991, on their only EP recorded under the short lived moniker Pierre Étoile) Yang's bass lines are mixed far below the happy-go-lucky jangle of Krukowski's rhythm guitar, yet it is these low, pondering tones that ground the song, telegraphing a sense of melancholy that will be comfortingly familiar to all fans of shoegaze and slowcore. It seems odd that Damon and Naomi were met with a doubtful reception when they first started out on their own, following the departure of former Galaxie 500 vocalist Dean Wareham (who consequently went on to form Luna)-- a classic case of associating a band with its vocalist rather than recognizing the collective input of the musicians as a whole. More Sad Hits was originally intended as Damon and Naomi's swan song to music, and an album that they previously admitted they didn't think would ever get made. Sixteen years later they have released six more albums-- which includes some memorable live and recorded material with the great Japanese band Ghost. Remastered and repackaged, More Sad Hits takes Damon and Naomi back to the beginning and reignites the building blocks of a duo that continues to thrive.","Originally released in 1992 and recently re-released, the debut record from the ex-Galaxie 500 rhythm section continued the duo's dialogue with UK shoegaze thanks to blurring boundaries with guitars that sound like synths, keyboards that sound like guitars wired to a dozen glorious chorus pedals, and massive, lush song structures.

Here With Me,Jennifer O'Connor,by: Stephen M.

She sings in a capably expressive voice and fashions lyrics that sound straightforward at first but reveal tangles of ambiguities on further listening. Her previous albums have all been strong, modest, and memorable, but rarely showy. This is not to discredit O'Connor. Far from a wallflower, she simply has little patience for artifice, the lack of which lends her music the straightforward appeal of many alt-country singers, although there are few genre elements in her indie-folk-rock. Her fourth album, Here With Me, is packed with predictably sturdy guitars and predictably sympathetic vocals, yet there's no sense that her approach is losing any of its vitality. In fact, these songs do what O'Connor's songs always do: They draw you in gradually until you realize the full and intricate implications of a line like ""I won't let you go, I know you think you're safer on your own."" She sings that line on opener ""The Church and the River"", making it unclear if that is a pledge of love, a promise of protection, or a threat. O'Connor savors concrete details for their evocative powers: ""Your jean jacket had a frayed collar on that midnight shopping trip that Christmas Eve,"" she sings on the plaintive ""Valley Road 86"", about an old friend who's no longer around. That's the sort of observation that sets up a short story, but here it's buried deep in the song-- a memory that springs to mind unheeded and possibly unwanted. Despite its overtones of death specifically and loss in general, Here With Me is O'Connor's most hopeful album, reportedly inspired by a happy relationship (which inspired the album cover). ""We've got a lot of time to get this right,"" she sings on the poppy title track, but then qualifies, ""at least that's how I hope it's gonna be."" Most of these songs explore the tenuousness of any romance, an emotional give and take that O'Connor suggests is as devastating as it is rewarding. So when she admits, ""I want you here with me,"" over crescendoing guitars, she sounds breathless yet triumphantly content. Produced by John Agnello, Here With Me features a small roster of musicians, including her regular backing trio, who do a fine job of complementing O'Connor's melodies without intruding on her personal space. On ""Daylight Out"", ""Credit in the Cost"", and the Liz Phair-ish ""Xmas Party"" especially, they sound like a well-seasoned road band playing some club out in America somewhere. Still, despite Hold Steady multi-instrumentalist/mustache aficionado Franz Nicolay adding piano and accordion flourishes, the album can't quite match Over the Mountain, Across the Valley and Back to the Stars for openness and range of sound, although occasionally the band pull off a nice moment of startling invention, such as the way the scribbly guitars align into a dramatic fanfare on ""Landmine"". Ultimately, Here With Me sounds perhaps too stripped-down and murky for the Starbucks set, while naked confessions like ""I want to give myself to you/ I want to give and give and give"" may scare off indie listeners used to a little more emotional distance in their singer-songwriters. It's their loss: In following her muse, O'Connor makes not fitting sound like an incomparable virtue.","This Matador-signed, indie-folk songwriter's fourth album is packed with predictably sturdy guitars and predictably sympathetic vocals, yet there's no sense that her approach is losing any of its vitality.

The Family Afloat,Bound Stems,by: Jason Crock,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bceeabf31b7dc7155e27/1:1/w_160/c955a1df.jpg,2008-09-19 05:00:02,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12207-the-family-afloat/,Flameshovel,"Since their inception, Chicago's Bound Stems have shown that they have the ability to write great guitar pop, but they've always wanted to do more, to add layers of complexity and tension to their catchy songs. The band's first full-length, Appreciation Night, mined a lot of charm from the clutter, though its few more linear songs stood taller than the rest. Follow-up The Family Afloat is more earnestly committed to making pop out of these tricky, occasionally incongruent parts. It's in the same carefully-cultivated messiness of their debut, but it seems to strike a better balance: The production shines, the transitions are more careful and the interludes more purposeful, the vocals are fuller and more confident, the hooks swing harder, and there's even a distinct theme. The opening track makes a trip to San Francisco sound better than Disney World, but the rest of the songs come to terms with putting down roots. That opener, ""Taking Tips From the Gallery Gang"", puts Bobby Gallivan's voice right up front, with ephemeral layers of guitar fading in and out underneath. It has a typically unpredictable arrangement, but with a newfound anchor. ""Happens to Us All Otherwise,"" meanwhile, might be the group's catchiest and most direct pop song yet, bursting with jangling guitars and innocent, pleading vocals. ""Passing Bell"" and ""Palace Flophouse and Grill"" return to the lurching, unpredictable rhythms of their previous album and EP, but Gallivan and singer Janie Porche are far less tentative vocalists and can better carry the song. (Porche only gets a bewildering, borderline angsty solo spot on ""Palace""; she steps up when needed on Family Afloat, but mostly avoids the spotlight.) In a catalogue where mood is as important as songwriting, the placid piano track ""Clear Water & Concrete"" has some of their prettiest and most compelling textures yet. (It's also a welcome shift to a more meditative tone, as the band hardly takes a breath to let their hooks land at this point.) ""Cloak of Blue Sky"" has the city imagery Bound Stems often trade in and more of the affable shuffle that seems to be their rhythmic comfort zone. ""Winston"" is an even better shift in tone, with acoustic strums, a few banjo plucks, and atmospheric keyboards that are beautiful, affecting, and put together with impossible care. Closing track ""Sugar City Magic"" begins with a staccato guitar line that's more in line with the pensive math-rock that the band toyed with in their earlier, pre-Flameshovel days, though it soon shifts perspectives by handing off the baton on vocals to get a more layered view on the family in the lyrics. For all their ambition, there are still moments on Family Afloat that feel forced-- more ""Look what we can do!"" instead of simply, ""Look what we do well."" Yet Bound Stems have the rarefied ability to make that mess sound gorgeous, as if all were in its right place even when it's held together by chewing gum in some spots.","Chicago band with math-rock roots is more earnestly committed to making guitar pop out of tricky, occasionally incongruent parts on their second full-length.

Who Killed Amanda Palmer,Amanda Palmer,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcef13d197565213b420/1:1/w_160/eb68b341.jpg,2008-09-19 05:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12208-who-killed-amanda-palmer/,Roadrunner,"As the premier alt-goth Weimar cabaret rock duo, the Dresden Dolls have a lot working in their favor-- foremost a virtual lock on the alt-goth Weimar cabaret rock duo market. Duty-bound to fly that particularly lonely flag, the group's tour schedule has been relentless, its theatrical flourishes exhausting. Yet even though the Dolls paint from a deceptively diverse pallet, it's not surprising that Amanda Palmer, the group's focus and primary creative force, should start to maybe feel a little stifled and set out on her own, at least for the time being. Certainly Palmer and drummer Brian Viglione could have released whatever they wanted and called it the Dresden Dolls. The fact that Palmer didn't suggests she recognized a certain stylistic sanctity to the Dolls sound. To that end, Who Killed Amanda Palmer began as a solo outing in the truest sense, with just Palmer and her piano at the fore and the recording process itself fast and unfussy. Then fan, friend, and fellow piano-pounder Ben Folds entered the picture as producer and general jack-of-all-trades, and quickly the project and Palmer's musical purview expanded. On opener ""Astronaut"" it's easy to hear how it might have begun as just Palmer alone before a bevy of embellishments pushed it toward the borderline symphonic. The song's dynamic, dramatic, and every bit as hyper-stylized as the Dresden Dolls, and hooky as hell despite the clutter of the arrangement, which offers grunts, guitars, synths, and tons of vocal ticks among its tricks. The breathless ""Runs in the Family"" follows a similar tack as Palmer goes, literally, nuts: ""Me? Well, I'm well. Well, I mean I'm in hell. Well, I still have my health (at least that's what they tell me),"" she sings as she rushes through a litany of lyrical lunacy. With ""Ampersand"", we finally hit a track that might have been out of place on a Dolls disc, just Palmer and her piano (plus some strings, arranged by the legendary Paul Buckmaster) playing a ballad. ""I'm not gonna live my life on one side of an ampersand,"" she sings, ""And even if I went with you, I'm not the girl you think I am."" While it seems Who Killed Amanda Palmer sets out to tell a story (it's even divided into two acts), and the song itself could work as a rallying cry of independence from within any smothering relationship, the confession could also serve as a sign of frustration at being stuck with the Dolls. In truth Who Killed Amanda Palmer spans a decade of songwriting, and by ""Leeds United"" the disc has revealed itself as a broad collection of rich character studies born of Palmer's lyrical acuity, likely laced with personal touches that nudge some of the material toward the at least loosely autobiographical. In the track, blasts of horn (courtesy the awesomely named Born Again Horny Men of Edinburgh) punctuate Palmer's own hoarse, histrionic shouts as her protagonist drowns herself in booze, pop culture, and shopping. In the somber ""Blake Says"", the titular Blake (following in the footsteps of Lou Reed muses Stephanie and Caroline) struggles with depression and loneliness, ultimately choosing isolation (and maybe death?) rather than bear the weight of the world. Similar themes course through the school-shooting chronicle ""Strength Through Music"" (reportedly written after Columbine but recorded the week of the Virginia Tech shooting) and ""Guitar Hero"" (which features the Dead Kennedys' East Bay Ray in a tale of someone choosing fantasy over reality), a return to rambunctious, theatrical rock. The subtly apocalyptic ""Have to Drive"" is about that most primordial of rock themes, escape (replete with operatic men's choir, and delivered with particularly literary bent). ""What's the Use of Wond'rin'?"" (from Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""Carousel"", and featuring St. Vincent's Annie Clark) underscores that musical's creepy undercurrent of submission and supernatural sublimation, and therefore fits right in. Too bad its creepy power is undercut by the blithe, bubblegum, mostly obnoxious ""Oasis"", a rape and abortion ditty-- ha!-- that gives irony a bad name. (In her defense, Palmer once considered the track ""too silly,"" but Folds convinced her to include it-- he should have known better, since his own abortion hit ""Brick"" was a lot more effective and affecting.) Fortunately it's followed by another powerful, riveting portrait, ""The Point of It All"", which once again emphasizes Palmer's strengths as a lyricist, while ""Another Year"", with its distant echoes of ""Nightswimming"", manages to be a touching song of unrequited love and to namedrop Bill Hicks. Both of these tracks emphasize why Palmer may have wanted to go it alone. It's not that they would have been lost in the Dresden Dolls, but casting them in a separate spotlight does make them easier to locate, and maybe find new listeners as well.","The Dresden Dolls' Amanda Palmer could have done whatever she wanted to do and called it the Dresden Dolls, but instead chose a solo detour with ample assistance from Ben Folds and songs (drawn from over 10 years of demos and drafts) that highlight her incisive lyrics.

"They Shoot, We Score",Yo La Tengo,by: David Raposa,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcf15e6ef95969322f5e/1:1/w_160/81b74c60.gif,2008-09-19 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12210-they-shoot-we-score/,Egon,"The awesomely titled They Shoot, We Score collects Yo La Tengo's film score work for four low-profile films-- a convenient way for fans to grab some unreleased tunes-- yet it doesn't lend itself to start-to-finish listens. After all, this CD compiles music composed for a range of flicks-- a drama centered around the 1986 World Series (Game 6), another about two old friends on a camping trip (Old Joy), a story about a big-city/small-town dysfunctional family (Junebug), and a ensemble piece about strangers in New York making connections through sexual exploration (Shortbus)-- and the music they wrote reflects the disparity between these films. Though four films are represented, the majority of the disc is taken up with the work from Old Joy and Game 6. Junebug's presence is mostly comprised of a handful of minute-long interpretations of ""Green Arrow"", from I Can Hear The Heart Beating As One. ""Ashley"" features the song's melody on piano, while ""Madeline"" features a string section, ""George"" a vibraphone, and ""Meerkats"" a woozy violin accompanied by maraca. They're all gorgeous, but it gets a little repetitive, even in small doses, and these interstitial bits also get in the way of the few actual pieces of original music from the film, like the whimsical woodwind-abetted (and very un-Tengo-like) ""A Roomful of Ladies"". Shortbus, on the other hand, is represented by only four tracks, one of which (the Casio-nova'd ""Wizard's Sleeve"") is available on the official soundtrack for the film. That leaves two nearly indistinguishable versions of the pensive and warbling ""Panic in Central Park"", and ""Isolation Tank"", a fantastic and all-too-short somber bit of jazz. The Game 6 section of the disc includes a truncated version of ""Spec Bebop"" (another I Can Hear The Heart... track), and most of the music takes its cues from that track's smoky atmosphere. Whether the music is more rocking (like with the would-be rave-up of ""Game Time"") or more pensive (as on the dramatically swelling ""Buckner's Boner"", a track title that probably brings a smile to Mets fan Ira Kaplan's face), there's a sense of the grime and heart of a city that permeates this work. It's a sharp contrast to the tracks from Old Joy, which are imbued with a rustic, panoramic laid-back vibe. Though the tracklisting certainly make logisitcal sense, for such a low-key release, I wish the group had shook things up and reworked They Shoot, We Score to make it more album-like/ After all, co-mingling folky tracks like ""Getting Lost"" and ""Driving Home"" with the city-slick Game 6 offerings and some of the other highlights from this album (even a few of those ""Green Arrow"" rewrites) would create a pretty faithful facsimile of a legitimate Yo La Tengo LP, which speaks volumes about the quality of the work here.","Following records devoted to the Sounds of the Sounds of Science or years worth of WFMU pledge-drive covers, this is the latest intriguing low-key release from Yo La Tengo-- a compilation collecting their work on four indie films, including the critically acclaimed Junebug (starring Amy Adams) and Old Joy (Will Oldham).

On their self-titled full-length debut, percussionist/vocalist Nisa Venerosa and keyboardist/saxophonist Jarrod Zlatic follow post-punk's original inclinations. They embrace bass frequencies instead of treble, easy tempos instead of manic energy, and a full-bore penchant for the macabre. But where similarly minded Southern Hemisphere contemporaries like Naked on the Vague brandish sharp edges and jagged textures, Fabulous Diamonds songs are smooth enough to run your fingers over. On their self-titled debut LP, Fabulous Diamonds fight a losing battle with focus; the picture is always blurring and the plot is always slipping in and out of perspective. Venerosa handles the majority of the vocals, but she doesn't sing so much as chant in an unsettling tenor. ""Patience and virtue are two things you don't have/ Guideless, spineless, lacking in conscience,"" she says on ""2"" over a primitive rhythm while Zladic alternates two chords on a buzzy keyboard. Slowly the song drifts out of shape-- evaporating into a washed out haze of delay that's anchored only by the ritualistic thump of a drum machine. Four minutes in all that's left of ""2"" is low-level hiss. Clever inversions and variations on this formula fill out the rest remainder record. On ""5"" gauzy vocal drones gradually coalesce into form, briefly drawing Venerosa's voice out from the bog only to have it wander back into a wilderness of echo. During ""6"" Zladic substitutes a croaking jazz-student saxophone melody for the vocals, creating an oddly funky instrumental that ripples with warbling ambience, like Fela Kuti leading Young Marble Giants. Yet even as songs may glide in and out of view, Fabulous Diamonds maintain their sharp consistency of mood. Venerosa sums up the record's feel in ""7""s quasi-Danzigian mantra: ""Local cemeteries whisky witch ceremonies/ Acid casualty has mangled me,"" she sings. Gloom is Fabulous Diamonds' dingy muse. But it's so elegantly portrayed here that it's hard not to be drawn to it.","Siltbreeze's Fabulous Diamonds follow post-punk's original inclinations, embracing dub, drone, and atmosphere over something more simplistic or tangible.

Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams,Solange,by: Tim Finney,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bce95e6ef95969322f4d/1:1/w_160/84926bd7.jpg,2008-09-18 05:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12203-sol-angel-and-the-hadley-st-dreams/,Music World,"The landscape of contemporary R&B is littered with the bones of self-styled mavericks-- Imani Coppola, Lina, even Kelis of late. So it's with trepidation that I endorse Solange Knowles' second album; its cryptic, wordy title already promising a fatally over-ambitious statement at odds with the more mercantile concerns of mainstream pop. In reality, Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams is more familiar than its title and cover-art might suggest, most of it riding the classicist Motown framework repopularized by Amerie and producer Rich Harrison. Instead, Solange's vision and, depending on how you look at it, pretension manifests in an aesthetic of excess: On ""Would've Been the One"", the sudden rhythmic contortions, the dizzying chord progressions, the too-bright dazzle of Solange's vocal and the excesses of her harmonies combine to form something gloriously surplus-to-requirements. Likewise, the conflicted ""T.O.N.Y."", with its circular lyrical fixations (the one-night-stand that got away) and lurching groove, at first feels somehow top-heavy before snapping into place with a charming short-circuit of restless confusion and explosive conviction. At her least, Solange can be too mannered, knocking out flawless period pieces that float past without leaving a trace, her wispy voice, plush arrangements, and oblique, counter-intuitive hooks offering too much of a good thing-- no one except nu-soul enthusiasts wants that much studious classiness. And there are times when everything gets surprisingly arch: the toe-tapping jazz-ballet patter of ""I Decided, Pt. 1"" sounds a bit like an off-Broadway paean to Motown, its deliberate facsimile of a facsimile of soul signifiers relying on Solange's declamatory performance to carry it to victory. But it's when she abandons the rigorous structures of soul revivalism that this too-clever vibe can get a bit too much-- see ""Cosmic Journey"", a soft-centred glitch-pop ballad whose swooning loveliness is tarnished slightly by its heavy-handed title and unnecessary ""psychedelic"" techno-trance coda. Many will applaud the daring of the handful of electronic tracks here-- album closer ""This Bird"" is even built around a Boards of Canada sample-- but I'm afraid we'd consider this same thing juvenile from, say, Imogen Heap. In fairness, Solange isn't lapsing into cliché here: The arrangements are unpredictable, and the lyrics even more so; on ""This Bird"" she sighs over how ""your dad drives a foreign car and your momma looks like a beauty queen,"" in an inscrutable tribute to Gershwin, before delicately advising the listener to ""just shut the fuck up."" But there's a tinge of diaristic adolescence in the way she inevitably fuses these sonic journeys with a thematic obsession with boundlessness, her incomparable surpassing of all expectations and limitations. Predictably, then, it's when Solange slows down and lets the world catch up that she's most arresting. On ""I Decided, Pt. 2"", a straight-to-the-point remix of its predecessor by erstwhile commercial house merchants the Freemasons, she unabashedly embraces streamlined pop form, her sassy performance somehow finding a new urgency amidst the very anonymity of the song's sugary, Phil Spector-meets-glam arrangement. Call it ""generic,"" but here the term is a compliment: Any hint of eccentricity would be a blemish marring the song's perfectly proportioned, irresistibly svelte figure. It's not a case of Solange performing best when she jettisons her ambition, but rather her need to find a way to let her avant inclinations work with rather than against her pop instincts, and maybe the best way for that to happen is to let the former emerge organically through the latter. Only marginally behind ""I Decided, Pt. 2"" in terms of impact (and, perhaps, marginally more loveable) is ""Sandcastle Disco"" its light-as-a-feather summertime funk strut leavened by an utterly magical chorus. A bid for chart success? Undoubtedly, but Solange makes it her own with a crescendo performance like a bubble of terrified elation swelling up in your chest. When she can do scrunch-faced joy so purely, so superlatively, why bother with window-dressing?","Beyoncé's little sister issues her second album, most of which rides the classicist Motown framework repopularized by Amerie and producer Rich Harrison.

Hey Ma,James,by: Joshua Klein,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bce113d197565213b3fd/1:1/w_160/1bf1ec22.jpg,2008-09-18 05:00:02,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12196-hey-ma/,Decca,"James started out in the early 1980s as just another Manchester band trying to make it big, struggling for attention for the better part of the decade before 1990's Gold Mother finally closed the deal and made them famous. But it wasn't until James reinvented themselves with producer Brian Eno for 1993's largely acoustic Laid that they were revealed as more substantive than their broad-stroke arena-ready rock previously indicated. Out went trumpet player Andy Diagram, in came a sound close to what the Waterboys deemed ""the big music,"" songs at once anthemic and spiritual, though rarely explicitly so. Whiplash kept the ball rolling, but by the time James reconvened with Eno for the underrated Millionaires and its follow-up Pleased to Meet You, it was clear the band had peaked. Singer Tim Booth departed for a solo career (as well as some ill-advised adventures in facial hair), the rest of the group went on hiatus, and the world moved on. A James reunion a mere six years later seems a little lame at first, even if the band never officially broke up, but at least the group has tried to keep things interesting. Hey Ma actually represents the reunion of the band's pre-Laid line-up, with Diagram back in the fold as well as guitarist Larry Gott, who had departed after that disc. There's also a sense of unfinished business, given the lukewarm reception to James' last two records-- neither Millionaires nor Pleased to Meet You initially even merited a U.S. release-- so one might presume James went into the studio with both everything and nothing to prove. Most intriguingly, James have split the difference sonically on Hey Ma, at once recalling their crowd-pleasing roots and their subsequent experiments. In a way it's not unlike the compromise U2 have struck with their own recent work, except that James have never fully been able to buy into that band's brand of bombast and bullshit. Indeed, amidst the platitudes and vague social commentary coursing through much of Hey Ma is a renewed sense of mirthfulness that cuts through much of the pretension. This is the same band, after all, photographed in dresses eating bananas on the cover of the otherwise ultra-serious Laid. Not that James (or at least Booth) aren't above the occasional burst of bullshit or pretension. The title track may be the most belated response to September 11th imaginable, even if it does make the unlikely chorus of ""Hey Ma, the boys in body bags, coming home in pieces"" come off like some surreal rallying cry. Later, in ""72"", Booth takes aim at religion, and particularly Muslim fanatics, with his rhetorical jab ""You're going to murder in the name of god/ What kind of god you dreaming of."" Lines like this seem distractingly contemporary from a band not always known for being topical, while at the same time oddly backdated, as if this song (or these ideas) had been sitting around for a while only to be aired now. The new ageisms of ""Waterfall"" are ultimately banal as well, but there's still a refreshingly earnest confessional honesty to Booth's apparent crisis of middle age. ""My mirror's laughing at me, says, boy, are you getting old,"" he sings, getting straight to the point before getting in touch with nature, hugging horses, and dreaming of Mexico as an antidote to 21st century materialism. In ""Whiteboy"", Booth even gets off one of the all time great self-deprecating lines about aging, ""My mum says I look like Yul Brynner/ Too old for Hamlet, too young for Lear."" It's hard to imagine someone like Bono ever singing that. Lyrics like those make up for the clunkers, but more importantly, the music itself sounds shockingly vibrant for a band only recently taken off ice. It's hard to remain unmoved by Booth proclaiming ""I'm alive!"" as ""Bubbles"" matches the sentiment by reaching ever more grandiose and inspiring heights. The chorus of ""Waterfall"" is huge and hopeful, while ""Oh My Heart"" is somehow even bigger. Even the literal-minded ""Hey Ma"" rides a hook every bit as singalong huge as the band's iconic ""Sit Down"". On the softer side, ""Semaphore"" and ""Of Monsters and Heroes and Men"" would have been unthinkable were it not for the band's atmospheric Eno years. Certainly they're more convincing as mellow anthems than Coldplay's recent attempts, undercut as those are by the subtle sense of self-loathing that surrounds Chris Martin. Tim Booth has no such compunctions, which is how he's able to deliver such rousing power ballads as ""Upside"" and ""I Wanna Go Home"" with all the conviction of someone who has found god and wants nothing more than to share that beauty with everyone he meets. Even at this late stage, the band's out to make believers of us all.","Best known in the U.S. for their 1993 alt-rock hit ""Laid"", James return after a six-year layoff with their 10th album.

Ferndorf,Hauschka,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcecc0084474cd0c2bb8/1:1/w_160/95c6b2c4.jpeg,2008-09-18 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12205-ferndorf/,Hauschka,"The previous records I've heard from Dusseldorf-based pianist and composer Volker Bertelmann, who records as Hauschka, have revolved around the titular instrument of his 2005 release The Prepared Piano. That album seemed to crystalize certain connections between the modified piano and later developments in experimental music. Bertelmann began with an approach to piano popularized by John Cage, who in the 1930s placed screws, pieces of rubber, and other objects between strings in order to turn the instrument into a kind of miniature percussion orchestra. As with avant-garde mainstays like Christian Wolff or David Tudor, Bertelmann in concert has been known to climb inside the piano itself between pieces to modify its innards, adding treatments and monkeying with the wires in search of new textures. But unlike any of these composers, he prefers melodies with a folk-like simplicity, pieces you can hum, with the comforting repetition of Glass/Reich-style minimalism serving as a rhythmic underpinning. So Bertelmann transports these innovations into a more melodic neo-pop context, while also adding some light electronic processing as a tip of the hat to the possibilities of computers. He's showed how familiar music can be transformed and made new by manipulations in the physical and virtual realms, but his music is easily enjoyed by listeners with no time for classical music. While previous records focused on piano, Ferndorf, while keeping that instrument at its center, finds Bertelmann expanding his palette further. He's joined here by various combinations of a violin (by Sabine Baron), cello (by Insa Schirmer and Donja Djember), and trombone (by Bernhard Voelz). Sometimes the short pieces-- most are between two and five minutes-- are fleshed out the way you might expect from a small chamber ensemble, with the strings adding counterpoint or extending melodic ideas. And sometimes, like on ""Barfuss Durch Gras"", which incorporates about eight or nine different textures-- buzzes, trills, scrapes, and drones-- it's hard to tell who might be playing what. While the latter is abstract enough to remind me of the electro-acoustic experimentation of Ekkehard Ehlers, Joseph Suchy, and Franz Hautzinger on their 2004 album Soundchambers, ""Barfuss Durch Gras"" is an anomaly; the bulk of Ferndorf reflects the vibrant, cheerful pastoralism of the record's title (it translates as ""distant village,"" a reference to Bertelmann's childhood in rural Germany). For example, deadened bass strings form a pulse that could almost be described as ""groovy"" on ""Rode Null"", and when the strings fall in and the melody begins, it has the charming, easy swing of a Vince Guaraldi number. ""Neuschnee"" is more lyrical, with an underpinning of yearning, as it moves from big swells of sounds to hushed contemplation. And then the closing ""Weeks of Rain"", which finds Bertelmann alone at the piano, is as romantically melancholy as its title, bringing to mind a half-drunk Bill Evans in a sentimental mood playing a Chopin nocturne. Ferndorf as a record isn't something to get you hearing music in a new way or an open up a new world, but it does succeed very nicely for what it is. Bertelmann takes an approach to piano founded in mid-20th century avant-garde, brings along a few other instruments form the classical world, and pushes the whole in the direction of simplicity, remaining unapologetically musical and getting over on chords, melody, and a little bit of texture. How appropriate that the record comes to us from the Fat Cat label, home of Max Richter and Mice Parade. Like these artists, Bertelmann has a way of pulling aspects of several genres not necessarily known for their accessibility into an instantly likable whole. Ferndorf is the sort of record that can brighten any room.","Transporting the innovations of John Cage, Christian Wolff, and other avant-garde mainstays to a more melodic neo-pop context, Dusseldorf-based pianist and composer Volker Bertelmann pulls from a variety of genres not necessarily known for their accessibility to create an endlessly listenable modern classical record.

Lightbulbs,Fujiya & Miyagi,by: Adam Moerder,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcf0abf31b7dc7155e2c/1:1/w_160/2c0c636e.jpg,2008-09-18 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12209-lightbulbs/,Deaf Dumb and Blind,"Fujiya & Miyagi get off on the subtlest kinds of bait and switch. They're not Japanese, they're English. They're not a duo, they're a quartet. They're not really a krautrock band either, they just play danceable pop music with one hell of a deadpan expression. In that sense, they're basically a Hot Chip that impishly cribs the most stoic of musical styles, and fittingly their punchline hits with a lot less precision. Transparent Things succeeded by keeping a particularly unflappable poker face and not letting the calcified rhythms sound like a ""Sprockets""-style send-up of German art culture. Lightbulbs doesn't exactly flash a ""LAUGH"" sign to its audience, but its constant tongue-in-cheekiness is kind of like Andy Kaufman's Great Gatsby gag-- funny in the abstract but frustrating to actually sit through. Like Transparent Things, the track list here reads like a mix of medical charts and warehouse inventory reports, but the fusion of technology and biology is heavier on the flesh this time around. David Best's vocals drip with breathy overdubs and long, whispered phrases, a significant change from the staccato, almost robotic delivery on past releases. If gasps of falsetto and an increasingly throbbing rhythm make ""Dishwasher"" sound like Serge Gainsbourg making love to a kitchen appliance, what chance at chastity do songs with sultry titles like ""Uh"" and ""Goosebumps"" have? F&M's dance credentials have always been iffy, and despite playing up their hushed lothario act here, the most kinetic tracks on Lightbulbs tend to be the most boring and predictable. The naughty ""Uh"" comes closest to capturing the hip irony of LCD Soundsystem or !!!, but its garden-variety bassline and melody gets hemmed and hewed for repeated use on ""Pussyfooting"", a barely memorable song except for its post-chorus scat transition. This isn't to say F&M don't have a dance track in them, but Lightbulbs's slick production is offset by an anticlimactic detachment from the band, who can only show us the dancefloor by filtering it through the stubborn wallflower's vantage point. A few of these tracks find that sweet spot where fun and krautrock intersect, and predictably these are the bright spots. Opener ""Knickerbocker"" chugs along the same motorik beat as earlier single ""Ankle Injuries"", though Best hams it up quite a bit, spouting off non sequiturs about ice cream flavors, Lena Zavaroni, and Dietrich Knickerbocker in a catchy rave-up that feels like a thought experiment combining Neu! and ""Love Shack"". ""Pickpocket"" and ""Pterodactyls"" both lyrically and musically veer into the chill, winking dance territory ruled by artists like Hot Chip and White Williams, while instrumental closer ""Hundreds & Thousands"" recalls the opener's steady four-on-the-floor heartbeat, this time with a dramatic (at least for these guys) farewell flourish added by the keyboards. While not guilty of carrying any true bombs, Lightbulbs does reveal how the band's stand-offish approach can serve as both a safety net and an anchor. F&M have yet to write a song that evokes any sort of melancholy, or really any kind of emotion for that matter. Even Can had stuff like ""Sing Swan Song"". Until then, though, the band seems content giving listeners blue balls and their songs ironic names and austere backdrops. I just hope that if or when they ever do decide to deliver the payoff to these dry setups, audiences are still interested enough to listen.","Like Hot Chip and White Williams, this English group made a name for itself impishly cribbing stoic musical styles, a poker-faced trick they repeat on their sophomore album.

Cold Fact,Rodriguez,by: Joe Tangari,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcd9abf31b7dc7155df9/1:1/w_160/4120c1ed.jpg,2008-09-17 05:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12189-cold-fact/,Light in the AtticLight in the Attic,"The hardest thing about telling the story of Sixto Rodriguez is deciding whether to start in Mexico, South Africa, Australia, or Detroit. He was born in Detroit to Mexican immigrant parents and spent his entire musical career there in the 1960s and early 70s. Rodriguez made two albums of socially conscious rock, which flopped, in part because his label, Sussex, was distributed by Buddah Records, an AM radio powerhouse that had little access to the adventurous FM spectrum for which Rodriguez's music was better suited. Though he was shut out from his audience at home, a curious thing happened in the Southern Hemisphere. The blunt urban commentary and the unique sound of his debut, Cold Fact, struck a chord in Australia and New Zealand, to the degree that in 1979 and 1980, Rodriguez, who had built himself as a musician playing dives, gay bars, strip clubs, and other out-of-the-way corners of Detroit, was able to mount a theater tour in Australia. The real surprise, though, was lying thousands of miles across the Indian Ocean, in South Africa, where Cold Fact became a counterculture hit and was accepted as a rock classic. It sold about 60,000 copies during the Apartheid era (very good numbers for South Africa) and was bootlegged many more times than that. So how did that happen? Well, the reasons are all audible on the record-- for one, there's the aforementioned uniqueness of its sound. The album is a patchwork of folk, psychedelic rock, and pop production, built around a workman-like voice and simple melodies. Co-producers Mike Theodore and Dennis Coffey were Detroit veterans who worked with Harry Balk's Impact label, and later Motown after it gobbled up Impact (Coffey played the iconic wah guitar part on the Temptations' ""Cloud Nine""). They'd chosen to work with Rodriguez for the simple reason that they liked his music, and they brought their considerable arranging and playing skills to bear on Rodriguez's ultra-basic guitar/voice compositions. The more direct reason his music spread so widely in South Africa, though, was the lyrics, which played as unbelievably subversive to young (predominantly white) South Africans living under a cultural system that was so repressed it considered the entire medium of television too corrupting to be allowed into the country. In a police state like that, songs with lines like, ""I wonder how many times you've had sex/ And I wonder do you know who'll be next""-- never mind the drug-dealing references and anti-establishment messages-- had automatic currency, the kind that caused listeners to circulate it amongst their friends. Ironically, the military was the most fertile ground through which music like this spread, as compulsory service for whites spread records throughout the male population by easy word of mouth. Listening to this excellently remastered reissue of Cold Fact (a reissue of the follow-up, Coming From Reality, is apparently in the works), it's not difficult to hear why so many South Africans placed it on the shelf next to Black Sabbath and the Beatles and figured that's what the rest of the world was doing, too. It is one of those rare lost albums that turns out to be a genuine classic. ""Only Good for Conversation"" is a startling rocker with heinously distorted guitar, ""I Wonder"" sets the gravest of concerns to a carefree beat with a swinging bass line, ""Rich Folks Hoax"" is wonderfully dark psych-folk, and the subtle, varied orchestration on ""Crucify Your Mind"" and ""Inner City Blues"" helps highlight the message. Opener ""Sugar Man"", a plea to a drug dealer to ""bring back all those colors to my dreams,"" surrounds a hypnotic vocal with a complex psychedelic arrangement complete with horns, oscillators, strings, and xylophone. Though its concerns were timely for its day, Cold Fact wears very well, and never sounds particularly dated at any point. Since being contacted by persistent South African fans (one of whom tells his story in the generous liner notes), Rodriguez has toured there, selling out 5,000-seat venues, a feat he'll probably never repeat at home. This reissue, the first time any of his work has appeared on CD in the U.S., takes a step toward gaining him some of the deserved recognition that's eluded him.","A flop when originally issued in 1970, Rodriguez's debut-- a patchwork of folk, psychedelic rock, and pop production, built around a workman-like voice and simple melodies-- found an unexpected audience in the Southern Hemisphere, due to its blunt urban commentary and unique sound.

The Airborne Toxic Event,The Airborne Toxic Event,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcdbea9e61561daa7593/1:1/w_160/38c28479.jpg,2008-09-17 05:00:03,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12191-the-airborne-toxic-event/,Majordomo,"I probably couldn't get anyone here in Los Angeles to admit it, but the city lacks a flasgship upstart indie band and wants one in the worst way-- one both a little fresher than Spin cover stars Beck and Rilo Kiley and with more mainstream potential than the bands from the Smell. The onus would likely fall on the folkier, cuddlier Silver Lake/Los Feliz scene, but over the past three years it feels as if the area's bands have failed to rise to the occasion. It's no surprise that many are betting the house on the Airborne Toxic Event-- their debut album is lyrically moody, musically sumptuous, and dramatic. Their name is even a transparent DeLillo reference, and every one of the 10 tracks sounds like it can be preceded with radio chatter. The Airborne Toxic Event have done their homework. But unless you're a certain French duo, homework rarely results in good pop music, and The Airborne Toxic Event is an album that's almost insulting in its unoriginality; while the sound most outsiders attribute to Los Angeles has been marginalized to Metal Skool and the average customer at the Sunset Boulevard Guitar Center, TATE embodies the Hollywood ideal of paying lip service to the innovations of mavericks while trying to figure out how to reduce it to formula. Throughout, the Airborne Toxic Event show a surface-level familiarity with early 00s critics lists, but aren't able to convey what made those much-lauded recods emotionally resonant. Can't convert unthinkable tragedy into cathartic, absolutely alive music like Arcade Fire? Just steal the drum pattern from ""Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)""? Can't connect with the listener with the same fourth-wall busting intimacy as Bright Eyes? That's when you trot out the run-on sentences and get all tremulous when you mean it, man. And that's just the first song. Not privy to the Strokes' accidental poetry and concise songwriting? Get a distorted microphone. Want a hit as big as ""Mr. Brightside"", but take yourself too seriously to conjure a semblance of juicy melodrama? Grab a half-assed disco beat and boom, you're now ready to write the limpdicked cuckold behind ""Does This Mean You're Moving On?"" And while it's understandable that a debut should owe such enormous debts, what really rankles is the unrelenting entitlement that assumes cred via sonic proximity-- it's the musical equivalent of showing up to a bar with a bad fake ID and throwing a hissy-fit when you get carded. While lead singer Mikel Jollett can alternately sound like Paul Banks, Win Butler, Conor Oberst, or Matt Berninger, what ties the LP together is quite possibly the most unlikeable lyric book of the year, rife with empty dramatic signifiers, AA/BB simplicity, and casual misogyny. If Social Distortion did Bruce Springsteen instead of callow Johnny Cash fan fic, you might get the lock-limbed anti-rock of ""Gasoline"", but my god-- ""We were only 17/ We were holding back our screams/ Like we tore it from the pages of some lipstick magazine."" Before you can comprehend just how clichéd and yet somehow meaningless that line is, by the next hook he's replaced ""screams"" with ""dreams"" and ""lipstick"" with ""girlie,"" before he's ""only 21 [and] not having any fun."" Then something about ""bullets from a gun."" If only that were the low point. It pains me to pan ""Sometime Around Midnight"" on concept alone because, man, we've all been there. Stop me if you think that you've heard this one before: There's a club if you'd like to go...except maybe when you go home and cry and want to die, and it reduces you to putting your thoughts on paper in rhyme form. The next morning, you thank god no one's seen it but you. The Airborne Toxic Event aren't so private, alas. As the ill-fated narrator sees his ladyfriend in a ""white dress"" ""holding a tonic like a cross"" while ""a piano plays a melancholy soundtrack to her smile"" (what bars do these guys go to?). He imagines holding her naked ""like two perfect circles entwined."" After five minutes pass, she leaves with ""some man you don't know"" and then your friends look at you ""like you've seen a ghost."" There's a possibility this is just a po-mo exercise, writing a song about writing a song about how some girl not wanting to fuck you is some sort of epic human calamity, but judging by the out-of-nowhere string section that opens the thing for the first minute, I doubt these guys are playing. It begins a stunning about-face that finds the band spending the rest of the record trying to be Jimmy Eat World. In a way, The Airborne Toxic Event is something of a landmark record: This represents a tipping point where you almost wish Funeral or Turn on the Bright Lights or Is This It? never happened as long as it spared you from horrible imitations like this one, often sounding more inspired by market research than actual inspiration. Congrats, Pitchfork reader-- the Airborne Toxic Event thinks you're a demographic.","Lyrically moody, musically sumptuous, and dramatic, this L.A. band's debut has commercial prospects-- it shows a surface-level familiarity with early 00s critics lists.

A Flowering Tree,John Adams,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bce3abf31b7dc7155e13/1:1/w_160/2ef66e7b.jpg,2008-09-17 05:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12198-a-flowering-tree/,Nonesuch,"The venerated American composer John Adams may hold the dubious honor of being the world's only uncool minimalist. Philip Glass and Steve Reich are still considered mandatory in the education of aspiring hipsters, and will remain so as long as art students smoke pot and watch Koyaanisqatsi or minimal techno producers namedrop Reich's Music For 18 Musicians. But Adams has none of this cachet. He doesn't write film scores like Glass; he has no tenuous associations with the Velvet Underground like La Monte Young; he has never dabbled in disco à la Arthur Russell; and he has none of Lou Harrison's West Coast hippie mystique. Indeed, despite having written some of the most moving, resonant works of the past 25 years, Adams probably also bears the unfortunate distinction of being the most important American musician the majority of non-classical listeners have never heard of. Part of the problem might be his un-Googleable name, which manages to confound even a simple Wikipedia search. But a larger problem is that Adams isn't really a minimalist. A Harvard-educated New Englander, he came to the movement the way Elvis Costello came to punk: late, after the bloodiest battles had already been fought. Indeed, alongside his black-clothed contemporaries, who were dabbling in shamanism, tripping on acid, and hanging out with Yoko Ono, Adams has always seemed a little tweedy-- but it often takes an interested outsider to bring an aesthetic movement to the next level. (Bad Brains, for example, were jazz-rock fusionists before bassist Daryl Jennifer brought some Damned albums over to vocalist's H.R.'s house and they decided to reinvent hardcore.) Adams rejected minimalism's trappings but eagerly soaked up its creative energy and the seemingly endless possibilities of its primordial pulse, which courses through even his most elaborate works. A Flowering Tree, his latest opera, demonstrates how far you can stretch the basic language of minimalism-- former Village Voice critic and composer Kyle Gann once called minimalism's repeating melodic cells ""sonic Silly Putty, capable of taking impressions of world music, reggae, birdsongs, whatever""-- without losing its basic shape. In A Flowering Tree, minimalism takes the impression of Mozart's final opera The Magic Flute. The work, which premiered in Vienna in 2006, was part of a festival celebrating Mozart's then-250th anniversary, and along with his longtime collaborator and producer Peter Sellars, Adams chose as text a South Indian folk tale in which a prince in a ""far-off land"" marries a woman named Kumudha who has the ability to transform into a tree. The fairy-tale mysticism of the story recalls Mozart's Flute-- transformation, and, eventually, betrayal and love conquering all-- but Adams also shows Mozart's gift for darkening a backdrop of fantasy with shades of pain, regret, and fear. The opera's autumnal mood is established immediately, with a chilly gust of strings blowing in the orchestra. This perpetual-motion, chattering violin figure flows beneath the story like some ancient river, resurfacing repeatedly as if to remind us it will surely outlast all the players on this stage. The narrator, meanwhile, sets the stage for a romp in the style of the Shakespearean comedies, in which a lovers' paradise, abruptly overturned, is quickly and painlessly restored-- ""Children, I want to tell you a story of love, and then pain, and then love again,"" he sings. But in this telling, the love and pain seem to all have bled into each other, making it impossible to separate when one ends and the other begins. Even when the music is joyful-- and there is plenty of joyful music here, with bells, chimes, gongs, piping recorders, and rough-and-tumble pizzicato passages-- persistent dissonances tug at the corners like nagging memories of past hurt. Adams' score is almost narcotic in its gorgeousness. Like the lead character, the orchestra shape-shifts, transforming from full-blown clamor to eerie, hollow whines. Despite the aural splendor, the dread and unease behind the story never dissipates. When Kumudha undergoes her first transformation, the moment is less Cinderella than Frankenstein's monster; Adams turns it into some kind of terrible pagan rite, accompanied by fearsome, hair-raising tribal chanting (""Flores Chorus""). When Kumudha later finds herself trapped in a grotesque hybrid state, in ""Kumudha Once More..."", woodwinds and horns twist mournfully around each other like flower petals drifting to earth. Adams has written far more pop-friendly works in his career, so if the sound of full-bore operatic singing causes you to shift uncomfortably in your seat, you might be better off initiating yourself with his stripped-down, hypnotic solo piano pieces like Hallelujah Junction, which are far closer in spirit and sound to Reich's Different Trains and Terry Riley's In C than his operas. A Flowering Tree, by comparison, has more in common with early 20th century works like Schoenberg's ""Verklärte Nacht""-- and you know how kids today love them some Schoenberg. But just because buying opera tickets falls on most indie listeners' priority list somewhere between ""check out that medieval renaissance fair"" and ""attend Promise Keeper's rally"" doesn't mean that Adams should continue languishing in pop-culture obscurity. There are few living American composers writing works as universal and relevant as John Adams-- and that deserves everybody's attention.","The highly underappreciated John Adams-- less well-known than the more famous Philip Glass and Steve Reich-- here demonstrates how far you can stretch the basic language of minimalism without losing its basic shape.

Exit,Shugo Tokumaru,by: Chris Dahlen,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bced5e6ef95969322f53/1:1/w_160/3064fa34.jpg,2008-09-17 05:00:01,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12206-exit/,Almost Gold,"It's nearly autumn in the States. The leaves are turning, the air has cooled right to the point where you don't notice it, people are looking to settle into an easy, neutral gear. It's also the perfect time for the U.S. debut of Shugo Tokumaru's Exit, the first of his records to get a proper American release. Fans of Tokumaru's previous LPs, 2004's Night Piece and 2006's L.S.T., will find no surprises on his latest-- he's still gently mining 1960s pop from around the globe and capturing it with a soft production and a sense of humor. Tokumaru builds each of his 10 tracks around a perfectly constructed melody. With an affection for folk and acoustic and found instruments-- he reportedly has over 100 music makers in his bedroom, not counting toys-- he makes eclectic choices in the arrangements, but he never distracts you into inventorying them. Wooden flutes, accordions, tinkling percussion, and brisk acoustic guitars all come together on Tokumaru's bedroom Mac. Clanging percussion and a melodica chase each other through ""Green Rain"" or during the frenzy of ""Future Umbrella""-- featuring more western and eastern fretted instruments than this reviewer can identify-- which comes off as a light whimsy. And the album's near-rocker, ""Clocca"", taps psychedelia with backward guitar samples, a disoriented harmonium, and baffled flutes. Woven through it all is Tokumaru's easy tenor. It's too laid back to be evocative, but isn't merely soothing, either; maybe the best way to peg it is that evokes a feeling of being soothed. He plays humble in interviews, but on record he comes off as effortless, even cool. And it takes a special kind of cool to borrow so many familiar and loaded styles without looking like you're merely dabbling. There are enough instrumental interludes and understated melodies here to make the record a grower, and it eases into the sunset for much of its back half. Album-closer ""Wedding"" has as fine a melody as any of them, but there's a palpable sense that Tokumaru's perfectly content as a warm-up act for the crickets. And after three albums of such pleasurable, well-crafted music, it's churlish to wonder if Tokumaru will budge from this routine-- if he'll push into new directions, or keep making even-keel pop that's ever-more perfect and ever-more effortlessly sews up its influences. At this rate, the most nostalgic thing about listening to a Tokumaru record in the future might be the memories they bring back of his earlier ones.","The first of his records to have a proper U.S. release, Shugo Tokumaru's latest once again finds him gently mining 1960s pop from around the globe and capturing it with a soft production and a sense of humor.

The New School,The Tough Alliance,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bb8cabf31b7dc7155aff/1:1/w_160/009195c9.jpg,2008-09-17 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12183-the-new-school/,ServiceService,"A band is like a team is like a gang is like an army. Swedish electro-poppers the Tough Alliance are just a duo-- Eric Berglund and Henning Fürst-- but their name can suggest all of those meanings. So can their music, albeit through sweet melodies, shiny dance beats, and blindingly idealistic self-expression. Last year's A New Chance and 2006's New Waves EP explore a broader sonic palette, developing the dreamier qualities of 2006's mostly instrumental excursion Escaping Your Ambitions, but never have TTA sounded more muscular or dance party-ready than on 2005 debut The New School. The New School has a hidden track with a Liverpool crowd thundering out the terrace anthem ""You'll Never Walk Alone"". ""Tough II"" could be TTA's own theme song, an inspirational opening with choppy, pitched-up vocals and imposingly high synths. ""In the Kitchen"" finds the duo in ""pole position"", where they shout such future Nike slogans as ""life's a mission""; bird-backed ""My Hood"" puts on for Fürst and Berglund's city. But lest you think all the titles could double as R. Kelly songs, TTA are family-friendly enough to have their own product endorsement of sorts: ""Koka-Kola Veins"", with its ""blah blah blah"" chorus and ""just wanna have some fun"" credo, remains the duo's catchiest and most dancefloor-friendly track to date. When TTA declare, ""Against my baseball bat/ No one has a chance,"" on the joyfully delinquent ""Make It Happen"", though, it's safe to assume they aren't bragging about reading Charlie Lau, Jr.'s The Art of Hitting .400. ""Forget about labor/ It's time to wake the neighbors,"" they add. The setting could be a party, a fight, or a rowdy sexual encounter, and the song's original placement on an EP with a 50 Cent cover doesn't provide as much helpful context as you'd think. On ""Koka-Kola Veins"" they tell us, ""We've got our own jihad, if you know what I mean."" I don't. ""Break the rules,"" suggests ""Keep It Pure"". Now we're getting somewhere. ""Don't test us,"" TTA threaten on ""Forever Utd."", but there's more bliss than menace in their cameraderie. Both here and on the coral reef-lush ""Keep It Pure"", TTA hint at their blissed-out future, evoking the imagery of compatriots Studio, Air France, and the Embassy. Time spent with the right person can be paradise, the beatific ""Holiday"" suggests, but this kind of escape, made dazzlingly vivid in the three videos included with the new The New School, also has a childlike quality. ""We can't feel as good as when we make believe,"" they claim on ""Koka-Kola Veins"", staking out imagination as part of the sincerity-as-ethos embodied on A New Chance. For all their cheap pop thrills on one hand, and lofty interview pronouncements on the other, TTA are just a band. Berglund and Fürst acknowledge this like fans, hiding Easter eggs alluding to rock, hip-hop, and pop  in their songs for their most obsessive listeners to find. They nod twice to Spacemen 3, their careening, circus-ready electro-pop cover of Primal Scream's ""Velocity Girl"", renamed ""Velocity Boy"", appears on the reissue as another part of the hidden track, and elsewhere they slyly recall Pink Floyd, the Paragons, Blondie, and the Notorious B.I.G. This practice is made explicit on bonus track ""Take No Heroes"", modeled on Daft Punk's name-dropping ""Teachers"" (and later sampled by Jens Lekman). ""Take no heroes, only inspiration,"" TTA advise, and for this divisive, galvanizing, all-or-nothing band, it could be its rallying cry. The message also should ring true for your band, team, gang, or army. Kick over the statues. The shoulders of greatness are there for the standing. When you make the next leap-- even if you fall flat on your face, or change directions in mid-air-- your accomplishments will be (sincerely) yours, win or lose. And only losers lose.","Sweden's best/worst (delete where applicable) band follow the U.S. releases of last year's A New Chance and 2006's New Waves EP with an expanded edition of their more muscular, dance party-ready 2005 debut, The New School.

Kitsuné Tabloid,Digitalism,by: Mike Orme,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcd45e6ef95969322f21/1:1/w_160/a44a9dde.jpg,2008-09-16 06:00:05,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12185-kitsune-tabloid/,Kitsuné,"If the electro-house proffered by new Euro-powerhouse labels Ed Banger and Kitsuné Records doesn't yet have a proper rite of passage, it oughta be the mix CD. Ed Banger's premiere acts-- label head Busy P, DJ Medhi, and Justice-- can often be found chopping up and re-imagining favorite records, so you'd think we'd see more high-profile DJ mixes coming out of the Parisian ranks. But other than Justice's (rejected) Fabric mix, which eventually circulated last year as a re-packaged Christmas boot, there's just not much out there. Distinctly non-Parisians Digitalism, who run in the same blog-house circles as Justice and Simian Mobile Disco, are a logical act to kick-start this trend, so Kitsuné sent the Hamburg duo out to proffer the flagship release of their new Tabloid personal mix series. Kitsuné established Tabloid in order to give its artists the opportunity to tell a story via a DJ mix. It's a little surprising, then, how rushed this story plays out: all but three of the cuts here were released in the last two years, and only the Human League and the Jonzun Crew date before the turn of the century. The mix does well to re-expose current electro-house producers-- mostly Kitsuné stalwarts-- to a new audience, but the duo does little to convince listeners that Kitsuné's got a new Fabric or DJ-Kicks on their hands. With the oldest sound on the mix seeming to be the hilariously dorky Todd Rundgren sample on the Hot Chip selection ""Shake a Fist"", this story feels less like an epic and more like pulp. As expected, Tabloid hits the hard beats of a club that might have sounded revolutionary three years ago, but there's a distinct sense that something is missing. When the duo is mixing Zongamin's ""Tunnel Music"" and ""Raise Me Up"" by Hercules & Love Affair, it feels like a self-conscious transition rather than a confident break from the rhythmic guitar sample of the former. The drama that accompanies the buzzy change-overs-- the squeaks and squelches and buzzsaws put up by the best of the scene-- doesn't unify the Kitsuné cuts that deserve a fiery welcome. On the DerDieDas mix of Digitalism's track ""The Pulse"", there's just a bit of this immediacy: a sustained spark that carries itself all the way through, then re-imagines itself in the phoenix-like re-birth of the Midnight Juggernauts track ""Ending of an Era"". But the drama that's so airily created and so obviously appreciated by the duo isn't sustained throughout the record. Digitalism really seem to want to introduce a larger world to their acerbic disco throb, but their payoffs hit like a wave of anticlimaxes. They tell a story on Tabloid of their meteoric rise and of the current state of electro-house and nu-rave through the Kitsuné lens, with many of the featured artists having already seen release on the label. It turns out that Digitalism's Tabloid does a decent job tracking the evolution of this strange, percussive dance-rock hybrid, but the narrative they offer isn't especially compelling.","The first entry in Kitsuné's personal mix series comes from Hamburg's Digitalism and documents the rise of the electro-house scene, with tracks by Muscles, Midnight Juggernauts, Hot Chip, and Hercules & Love Affair.

Even then, Icelandic singer Emilíana Torrini (her dad's Italian) has never seemed sure just where in the middle she wanted to be. Love in the Time of Science was tinged with trip-hop. 2005's Fisherman's Woman was spare folk à la Beth Orton, somewhat hazy but far from crazy. And now, with Me and Armini, her sixth album, Torrini has shifted gears once again, however slightly, to that middle-of-the-road spot most rife for subversion-- amorphous, soul-jazzy adult alternative. The move fits her. Torrini's voice is pleasant but also pretty anonymous, so it's therefore well-suited to any number of (mostly mellow) musical settings. Against a backdrop of generally acoustic guitars and gentle backbeats, Torrini doesn't aim to shake you up but to settle you down. Hers is a voice built to soothe, and the unobtrusive grooves of Me and Armini serve a similar purpose. Yet, like those slightly raised reflectors running alongside the dotted yellow line, even the middle leaves some room to stick out. Without going too far leftfield, Me and Armini manages to reshape the mold ever so slightly, thanks to some savvy production choices that keep the songs from becoming too dull. ""Birds"", for example, begins as yet another introspective fingerpicked bore before it's transformed by an unexpected space-rock interlude. ""Heard It All Before"" is a torch song set against a strikingly off-beat backing track, a bit like ""Summertime"" by way of recent Radiohead. ""Ha Ha"" occupies rueful territory not unlike that occupied by glum queen Lisa Germano, with Torrini milking her voice for maximum breathiness, while the stacked vocals that kick in half way through ""Beggar's Prayer"" save the song. The cool studio tomfoolery of ""Dead Duck"" subsumes, chops up, and spits out Torrini's vocals like they're just another instrument swimming in the mix. It's not all interesting, however. Songs like those are countered by tracks like the insufferable ""Big Jumps"" and ""Jungle Drum"", each featuring annoying onomatopoetic ticks that come off more cute than clever and cast far too much attention on some terrible lyrics (at least the latter ends with some raucous guitar and tops off at barely two minutes long). Elsewhere, the milquetoast ska of the title track plays it too safe, sounding like Morcheeba a decade late, while ""Hold Heart"" recedes further into the background by going the banal bossa nova route. But for all its various and relatively varied highs and low, towering above the record is the snarling, ear-catching and miraculously not totally out of place ""Gun"", a song that drips with tension, atmosphere, and Serge Gainsbourg-meets-Polly Harvey cool, earning extra points for steadily, perversely inching toward a huge release that never arrives. It's a remarkable little dirge, all bared teeth menace that makes you wish the rest of the album had more bite. It's enough to perk you up from your skim latte and wonder what the hell it was you just heard before turning your attention back to perusing the morning paper.","Icelandic singer Emilíana Torrini makes room in the middle for just enough sonic ingenuity to help her stick out in the crowded field of jazzy/folky singer-songwriters.

The Preface,Elzhi,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcd7c0084474cd0c2b8a/1:1/w_160/4df7120e.jpg,2008-09-16 06:00:03,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12187-the-preface/,Fat Beats,"So an MC who's been recording for over a decade, appeared on three albums and a mixtape as part of Slum Village, and released a top-notch, buzzed-about tour CD earlier this year goes and calls his newest album The Preface, like he hasn't even started the first chapter and spent his whole career using roman numerals as page numbers. But it's a pretty good sign when the most disingenuous thing about an album is its title, as though Elzhi's solo debut were some kind of explanatory introduction for an unknown rather than a well-built veteran effort at the top of a very long resumé-- and even then, he acknowledges and expands that contradiction in the album's intro track (""This is only a beginning/ Everything I've been in is included, though""). The other crux of that brief intro track is that the radio sucks, people don't know what real hip-hop is, water's wet, etc. But after you've listened to The Preface more than once the standard anti-industry complaints sound more and more like a defiant lead-in for a legitimately independent-minded, focus-group-averse piece of work. Elzhi's one of those cats who's great at the whole headnod/battle underground ""rapping about rapping"" thing, and no matter how shitty the industry gets it seems like there's never a shortage of seriously lyrical-minded MCs flying under the radar. It's just that he's especially good at it, able to cover ground as an acrobatic-flowing word-twister, a high-concept storyteller, and a tell-it-like-it-is everyman. Elzhi displays these strengths clearly over The Preface's hour-and-change running time: he's got a couple of sharp gimmick tracks that tweak language fluidly, like the bait-and-switch word-splitting of ""Guessing Game"" (""They claim they the best/ Hey, you ask me, I say maybe they were OK, yes.../ terday""), the GZA-style Crayola-box exercise ""Colors"" (""Got them boys in blue with blackjacks locking the new youth/They sell purples through Blackberries with the Bluetooth""), or the second verse of ""D.E.M.O.N.S."", where he spits out strings of alliterative lines without getting in the way of clarity. But even if most of the tracks are of the verbally gymnastic, big-up-self mold-- other highlights being the fiery Royce Da 5'9"" collab ""Motown 25"" and the Detroit underground all-star ""Fire (Remix)""--  there's also a warmth here that most other semi-underground lyrical-lyricist rapping machines keep tucked away. You can hear a shining gratitude in the flossing of ""Brag Swag"", pure lovestruck bliss in ""Transitional Joint"", and the autobiographical ""Growing Up""-- where, like many MCs, he states that hip-hop saved his life, but throws in enough details on his family and his neighborhood upbringing to help it ring true. And Black Milk's production has a lot to do with this humanity, too: post-Dilla resplendence, manifested as midnight gospel (""Brag Swag"") and seething, subterranean boom-bap (""Hands Up""). It's tight enough to help me forgive the minor case of hot-verse-flat-hook syndrome that seems to crop up in lyrically-focused albums like this, and given that the Elzhi/Black Milk partnership brings enough variety and energy over the course of The Preface to make it that rare 16-track CD where nothing feels expendable, it's easy to look forward to the possibility of a small-scale but strong dynasty. Couple this with the aforementioned tour CD Europass (which it shares a few tracks with), and you've got some of the year's most vital underground hip-hop: this isn't just an introduction, it's the start of a new phase- and hopefully this one will reach an audience that desperately needs it.","Rhyming over beats by producer Black Milk, this MC-- known for his work with the Detroit-based Slum Village-- covers ground as an acrobatic-flowing word-twister, a high-concept storyteller, and a tell-it-like-it-is everyman.

FabricLive 41,Simian Mobile Disco,by: Nate Patrin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bce6eb335119a49ecd7e/1:1/w_160/954ba50a.jpg,2008-09-16 06:00:02,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12200-fabriclive-41/,Fabric,"Indie culture's post-DFA embrace of dance music in all its forms-- acid, minimal, disco, and so on-- has been sneered at by some anxious veteran ravers for its apparent new-jack bandwagoneering, as if louver-shade kids are gonna go around smearing guitars all over everything with their Axe body spray-stained fingers. But the best ideas often come from people with an outsider's idea of-- and, better yet, a flippant disregard for-- scene and genre rules. And if these outsiders wind up connecting a few new dots-- even if by some naïve, happy accident-- well, that's how stasis gets disrupted, ain't it? Not that James Ford and Jas Shaw are clueless interlopers or anything. It's just that going back and listening to pre-Mobile Disco-era Simian albums like Chemistry Is What We Are and We Are Your Friends-- in dance terms, vaguely Madchester at best-- makes a mix like their installation in the FabricLive series, even in the wake of their acid-savvy Attack Decay Sustain Release, sound like the end result of one hell of a metamorphosis. But FabricLive 41 doesn't reveal much in the way of curriculum-- few tracks betray anything that might have informed Ford and Shaw in their transition into nu-rave vanguards, and it's mostly front-loaded with recent and soon-to-be favorites from the past year or two. Which makes it, at worst, a likeable contemporary dance mix with flashes of leftfield brilliance. Their tweak of Tomita's 1976 Stravinsky-gone-digital interpretation of the Firebird Suite selection ""Infernal Dance of King Kastchei"" is a sly intro, and slipping in Metro Area's 2001 classic deep electro-house ""Miura"" amidst a block of more recent material proves a nice bit of context without jolting listeners out of the block of current hotness they'd spent the previous twenty-plus minutes building up. For the most part, however, the mix stays firmly in 2007-08 turf, and as a symposium on modern house and techno it sounds remarkably cohesive in its diversity. It helps that it's mixed superbly and seamlessly, even as it jumps from the massive rave anthem Serge Santiago mix of Hercules & Love Affair's ""Blind"" into a glib, arcade-bound acid-house two-fer from Smith N Hack (""Space Warrior"") and Discodeine (""Joystick"") or fuses Moon Dog's minimalist marimba/glockenspiel composition ""Suite Equestria"" with Fine Cut Bodies' maximalist house track ""Huncut Hacuka"". While it passes the test of a versatile, well-assembled mix-- sounding smooth-flowing as a whole, but varied enough to sound weirdly choppy and jarring if you skip to each successive track after a minute-- FabricLive 41 also has the benefit of boasting two major peaks, one early, one late. The aforementioned ""Blind"" bleeds its way into the outro of new SMD cut ""Simple"" (a sharp bit of retro-pop-lock Detroitness), then burbles and crests over seven and a half minutes of epic slow build that firmly anchors down the mix's momentum four tracks in. It's bookended sharply by a manic segue between two mid-90s classics, Plastikman's military drumroll arm-flailer ""Spastik"" and the insistent panic-attack thump of Green Velvet's ""Flash"", and the ensuing rattling stampede makes it the ideal climax to a mix that largely builds itself on a indie-friendly revival of predecessors like these. This peak is then awkwardly followed up by the actual set-closer, the Walker Brothers' vaguely Roxy Music-esque 1978 disco bid ""Nite Flights"", which drags that jittery intensity out into the middle of the street and runs it over with a car (albeit a really sleek-looking Lotus Esprit)-- but that's the risk you take with the nu-rave vanguard, and FabricLive 41's reward-to-risk ratio is high enough to recommend it easily.","Mostly sticking to tracks from the past year or two, Simian Mobile Disco prove their wheels of steel cred with a versatile, well-assembled entry into one of Fabric's two mix series.

Only By the Night,Kings of Leon,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcea13d197565213b413/1:1/w_160/5ca58770.jpg,2008-09-16 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12204-only-by-the-night/,RCA,"After years spent building a career on the enduringly romanticized Stillwater archetype, Kings of Leon have laterally shifted from one easily understood linear narrative (festival band) to another (arena rock band). Dropping the transparently hayseed act, the band could have turned an artistic corner; yet the first single from Only By the Night is called ""Sex on Fire"", so if there was any debate about whether Kings of Leon are in on their own joke, I think it can be put to rest. If we're misreading them, we're missing out on one corker of a comedy album based on an ""SNL""-level premise: What if Bono got lost in the Blue Ridge Mountains and was replaced by a local yokel? (Suggested band name: Y'All2.) But even the move from ""southern Strokes"" to ""southern U2"" is way better in theory than in practice-- these are the same clunky Kings of Leon songs, just now presented in an incredibly weird context. It all starts with Caleb Followill's never-ending need to play to type, and if you've kept up to this point, you know the drill-- though his band has toured the world several times over, dude can't see past his own dick. He sings terribly on Only By the Night, any modicum of youth and young manhood compromised by ""real talk"" overemoting and an accent that seems to have no geographical origin. But why go on when Followill is more than happy to hoist himself on his own petard, doling his typical mix of stock characterization, open misogyny, and bizarre non-sequitirs. You can hear the brooms sweeping as the lonesome guitars of ""Revelry"" attempt some sort of last-call poignancy, but it's spoiled from the time Followill opens a mouth full of Meatloaf-- ""What a night for a dance, you know I'm a dancin' machine/ With the fire in my bones and the sweet taste of kerosene."" This goes on before you get the dominant KoL ethos on the chorus: ""With the hardest of hearts I still feel full of pain/ See the time we shared it was precious to me/ But all the while I was dreaming of revelry."" It's basically ""The One I Love"" with no riff and no irony. Meanwhile, ""Sex on Fire"" turns out to be disturbingly literal, while the dopey travelogue of ""Manhattan"" has Caleb waxing with the naïve enthusiasm of a senior yearbook quote: ""We're gonna set this fire we're gonna stoke it up/ We're gonna sip this wine and pass the cup/ We're gonna show this town how to kiss these stars,"" and it's nearly impossible to stifle your laughter when he punctuates each verse with a smarmy soul-papa ""I SAAAAIIIID!""  All that's missing is the attendant video where Caleb walks the NYC streets and gives dap to passers-by while the band taps away at their idea of funk. You'd figure ""17"" would be right in their wheelhouse, because what's a better Kings of Leon topic than underage pussy? But after the first line (I'll spot you ""Winger"" as a hint and let you guess what it is), it just sort of trails off, leaving the last memorable moment of an album that still has about 20 minutes to go. No longer steeped in Dixieland signifers, Kings of Leon now weirdly owe a debt to Washington state. If the rumbling toms, splashy cymbals, and cascading synth strings of songs like ""Notion"" or ""I Want You"" sound familiar, I'm willing to bet you have a copy of Sunny Day Real Esate's The Rising Tide or a recent Death Cab record. Strange bedfellows, and not really the right ones-- while the latter two were trying to adjust their modest hooks and personal lyrics to a larger scale, Kings of Leon have always been as emotionally cavernous as the drum sound here, and when the tempo slows, ladies and gentlemen, we are floating in swamp. Followill is haunted by all that he can't leave behind, trying to have it both ways with riffs that are supposed to bellow with reverb and bite with distortion. The band never soars, instead mostly muddling in a bog of muffled echo that liberally applies Caleb's cottonmouth to every other instrument. At its best, Only By the Night at least gives the impression that Kings of Leon is actually an interesting band that would be exponentially and immediately improved with someone even average at the controls (call it the Tavaris Jackson Corollary). Musically, ""Closer"" sets the bar unrealistically high for the rest of the album, building on squeaking, modulated keys, tricky polyrhythms, and a solid melody unfortunately piledrived by Followill's self-pity (""You took my heart and you took my soul.../ Leaving me stranded in love on my own""). ""Crawl"" could pass for something off the first Secret Machines record with its hydraulic, distorted bass and hotly mixed percussion, but even before they can seal the deal with some dubious conspiracy mongering (something about the red, white, and blue crucifying you), you get the usual KoL idea of sweetalk: ""You better learn to crawl before I walk away."" Next thing you know, ""Sex on Fire"" starts and Kings of Leon's fourth album has peaked after seven minutes. Surely, we can do better for the platonic ideal of a rock band than four guys gunning for a spot rightfully inhabited by My Morning Jacket but instead coming up with the best songs 3 Doors Down never wrote.","Kings of Leon have laterally shifted from one easily understood linear narrative (festival band) to another (arena rock band), turning themselves from the Southern Strokes into the Southern U2.

Portal,Alexander Tucker,by: Grayson Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcd35e6ef95969322f1f/1:1/w_160/791191a0.jpg,2008-09-15 06:00:05,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12184-portal/,ATP,"Enjoyment of Portal, the fourth album from English one-man psychedelic sound-show Alexander Tucker, lasts about as long as it takes you to read the biography included in its one-sheet: ""But if we must draw comparisons then let's say Chicago musician/composer Jim O'Rourke,"" it reads. ""Both are unparalleled in their pairing of the 20th Century avant-garde techniques of composers like Stockhausen and Steve Reich with the archaic sounding free-folk of John Fahey, Robbie Basho and Loren Connors."" Really? So, Tucker shares marked similarities to three of the musicians in my personal Top-10-Ever Club and to three of its A-list alternates? Sign me up. Oh, if only one could live in this fantasy land while actually listening to Portal, a record that has almost nothing in common with these referents: Aside from the fact that he plays guitar, Tucker shares mostly nothing with Fahey or Connors, two guitarists whose distinctive styles bear more personality and intricacy than Tucker's paint-by-numbers, up-neck/down-neck repetitive maneuvers. Like Basho, Tucker sings, and the lyrics are sort of vague and cosmic, but that's about it. As for his similarities to Stockhausen and Reich, well, all I can think is that Tucker uses keyboards and bells and electronic layers. And then there's the problem with that O'Rourke comparison, of course: O'Rourke pretty much quit music several years ago, meaning the bulk of the work in question was made before Tucker released his first disc way back in 2000. If we're (untruthfully) comparing Tucker to his predecessor, then the dude's not exactly unparalleled. Yes, you can hear O'Rourke's precedents in his work-- the acoustic guitars and the jazz structures and the incisive lyrics, or his all-out noise or modern classical trips. At his best, O'Rourke sounded like a sharp, deliberate, focused outlet of distilled influences. Portal, on the other hand, sounds like the work of a neophyte enthusiast with a big record collection and an overly tamed menagerie of effects pedals. Maybe this stuff works live thanks to the one-man band spectacle, but that just makes Tucker an unentertaining Bob Log III. Portal is ultimately a long trip to nowhere. It's dangerous, of course, for an album to be discounted because of the unfulfilled promises of its press materials, and Portal is no different. It's just bad, expectations or no. Imagining a record that will almost be universally labeled as ""psychedelic"" while aiming more squarely for the center of the road seems impossible. Being a one-man band demands a balance between restraint and gumption, and Tucker either faults heavily on the side of the former or he's that short on ideas. He counters songs that aren't written very well with thick textures that aren't very interesting, his Marc Bolan air abutting sounds you've heard better from contemporaries Bardo Pond, Pelt, and Six Organs of Admittance and predecessors from Simon Finn to Terry Riley. If Pentangle and/or Pink Floyd interest you, Tucker's map will sound familiar, though un-evolved and without real risk. Over an acoustic guitar and neon waves of a distorted electric on ""Tusks"", he aptly repeats, ""Why do it""/ It's only wasted air."" ""Omni-Baron"" plays sinister with manipulated vocals, a brusquely played 12-string guitar and a snarling lead line sandwiched between the two. ""Energy for Dead Plants"" is bedroom ""minimalism,"" essentially pairing a softened violin drone (La Monte Young...) with bells that splash (Reich...) a pedestrian little melody over the proceedings. Portal, then, is as listenable as it is harmless, a combination that lends itself to the record becoming a blog-psych favorite, especially given Tucker's name-droppable work with Stephen O'Malley and JOMF. And that gets us back to the one-sheet: The overwhelming volume of music being produced now and its shifting methods of distribution mean we all have to be more vigilant in listening and thinking and responding. None of us will ever be able to hear everything, so the temptation to roll with a booster's hyperbolic-is-a-euphemism praise gets stronger daily. But don't be fooled by the self-made hype. There are dozens of records directly in Tucker's lineage that will take you places Portal brushes right by. Had someone I trusted referenced Fahey and O'Rourke in praising Portal, double goose eggs wouldn't have contained my disappointment. This is background music that withers in any sort of spotlight, empty ideas tacked carelessly to other vacant cartridges. Indeed, listen carefully-- just not to this.","English guitarist and singer-songwriter, who has collaborated with Stephen O'Malley of Sunn O))) among many others, returns with an idea-deficient fourth album.

Girls and Weather,The Rumble Strips,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bce8c0084474cd0c2bae/1:1/w_160/7d9ef9b6.jpg,2008-09-15 06:00:04,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12202-girls-and-weather/,Gigantic,"It's safe to say that, some 50 years after its birth, rock'n'roll has become a mostly interpretive art form, where ingenuity is measured not by the novelty of an idea as it is by ripping off the right people at the right time. Where bands like the Rapture and Interpol initially earned their hipster cachet for resuscitating then-dormant death-disco progenitors like Gang of Four and Joy Division, respectively, an emerging band today peddling those same influences would be laughed off the Lollapalooza side stage. However, given the stylistic depth and breadth of post-punk artists bubbling up in the UK in the late 1970s and early 80s, there are still plentiful untapped sources for new bands to plunder and thereby distinguish themselves-- and right now, Devon quintet the Rumble Strips have the Dexys Midnight Runners-revival field all to themselves. For many (on North American shores particularly), Dexys are an 80s footnote survived only by periodic, oldies-radio rotation of their 1982 hit single ""Come on Eileen"", but the band's overlooked 1980 debut, Searching for the Young Soul Rebels, is as vital a document of the era as any, even as it traded post-punk's traditionally icy veneer and ominous thrust for 60s-soul-inspired brass-blasted exuberance. And like their most obvious antecedents, the Rumble Strips are a band equally out of time-- in stark contrast to the prevailing nu-rave set's asymmetrical haircuts and cocaine cool, they project the polite, congenial demeanour of impoverished, neighbourhood newsboys. But if the Rumble Strips closely resemble Dexys both in sound and vision, they've also got a frontman, Charlie Waller, brimming with enough personality to match Kevin Rowland's ample charisma. Where Rowland's default mode was impassioned pleading, Waller opts for charming self-deprecation-- right off that bat, he addresses the age-old conundrum of white performers appropriating black musical forms by baldy declaring, ""I ain't got no soul!"" Originally released as a 7"" on Transgressive Records in 2005, ""No Soul"" serves as the most logical entry point to the Rumble Strips' long-gestating debut album, Girls and Weather, immediately establishing the band's favorite devices: Waller's soaring to-the-rafters vocals, a cavalry of chirpy trumpets that accelerate the action, and dramatic pauses that both heighten the tension and make the finales that much more triumphant. It's a formula the band repeat with equal aplomb on their winning 2007 single (also reprised here) ""Motorcycle"", a song about humble means (""if only this bike was a motorcycle"") that, over four minutes of starts and stops, rev ups and breakdowns, achieves a hard-won grandeur, like Queen's ""Somebody to Love"" recorded on a busker's budget. A whole album of these sort of showy gestures would likely prove exhausting, but the Strips are careful not to overdo it, and Girls and Weather is stacked with singles that condense the band's energy and enthusiasm into more compact bursts of joy: the cheeky anti-work song ""Alarm Clock"" (""I don't like doing things/ That other folks tell me to do/ So I hit 'em with a hammer""), and the irresistible ""Girls and Boys in Love"", which assumes a skiffle-band take on the classic ""Heatwave"" swing. It's no coincidence that Girls and Weather is named for what are the most interesting and the most boring things to talk about-- as its underdog anthems handily attest, the most mundane backdrops make the good things in life seem all the more glorious.","Given the stylistic depth and breadth of post-punk artists bubbling up in the UK in the late 1970s and early 80s, there are still plentiful untapped sources for new bands to plunder; the Rumble Strips have the Dexys Midnight Runners-revival field all to themselves.

Lunglight,The Shaky Hands,by: Amy Granzin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcddea9e61561daa7598/1:1/w_160/332cd022.jpg,2008-09-15 06:00:03,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12193-lunglight/,Holocene,"""Likable"" could be the most withering epithet in the book of faint praise. So the promotional strategy pursued on behalf of the Shaky Hands by Kill Rock Stars and Holocene-- pitching them as Portland's best-liked combo, a band for which no one in the community utters a discouraging word-- is potentially dangerous. If no one hates you, you've gotta be doing something wrong, right? That goes double for rock bands. But the Shaky Hands deserve more than a Miss Congeniality sash or a success-smothering ""band's-band"" tag. Even when they trade in clichéd themes and done-to-death sounds, they're really good. Even if it doesn't offer such immediately appealing tracks as ""Whales Sing"" and ""Why and How Come"", the Shaky Hands' second LP, Lunglight, is consistently strong. While the debut scrapbooked four years in the local trenches and cobbled disparate influences and enthusiasms, Lunglight is a coherent, well-sequenced collection of often-ferocious, usually catchy, and occasionally sinister tracks. The band is still indebted to early R.E.M., Mission of Burma, and other first-generation American post-punks, but they've kicked the winsome jangle and amateurish faux folk to the curb and pounded a case of Red Bull. ""A New Parade"" leads the charge with violent chipped riffs, clipped snare beats, and vocalist Nick Delffs' nervy quaver. The record gets more raucous, with guitars bounding, lunging, thrusting in songs like ""Air Better Come"" and ""Settle On"", and the percussion throughout skittering like an Iditarod dogpack barreling down a hardwood hallway. Drowning pop compositions in jittery polyrhythms is indie rock's move du jour, but the Shaky Hands aren't trendy; they make fine-boned, classic rock'n'roll in the Strokes' vein. In fact, Delffs does a spot-on close-mic'ed and breathless Julian Casablancas on ""You're the Light"" and awesomely named bassist Mayhaw Hoons knows Nikolai Fraiture's tricks-- most striking in the carpe diem ode ""We Are Young""-- for tightly controlled propulsion. Obviously, both the Strokes and the Shaky Hands were weaned on the Velvet Underground, but while the former adopts VU's soigné minimalism and self-conscious art pose, the latter takes up the urbane Americana surveyed on Loaded and, in Lunglight's relentless pounding-piano banger ""Loosen Up"", ""White Light/White Heat""'s Lower East Side blues. The band's lyrics are getting grittier, too. OK, ""We Are Young"" scans thematically facile, but ""Neighbors"", punctuated by the pitiless refrain ""everything is lost"", and ""World's Gone Mad"", laced with deception and insanity, should put to rest any erroneous assumptions that the Shaky Hands are sunshine in a bottle. Though to be fair, I think I can understand why the residents of gray, rainy Portland might be looking for a feel-good-quick fix.","The Shaky Hands, Portland, Ore.'s most likable band, return with a solid, promise-fulfilling successor to last year's self-titled LP. Often ferocious, usually catchy, and occasionally sinister, these tracks recall early R.E.M., Mission of Burma, and other first-generation American post-punkers.

The Second Original Silence,Original Silence,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bce5abf31b7dc7155e16/1:1/w_160/ab275f36.jpg,2008-09-15 06:00:02,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12199-the-second-original-silence/,Smalltown Superjazz,"If the success of a sophomore album should be measured by whether it includes a potential hit (it shouldn't, but humor me here), then The Second Original Silence has struck gold. Not that a six-piece improvisational noise/jazz/rock ensemble has much chance of scoring chart action, but if it did, opener ""Argument Left Hanging - Rubber Cement"" would fire a bullet into any top 10 it came close to. Shooting out of the gate with scratchy guitar, gut-rocking bass, and a stuttering beat, the track at first resembles a Captain Beefheart jam, then hits shades of electric-era Miles Davis, and ends with a trail of dense electronics. Throughout, Mats Gustafsson's sax wraps the din into a ball of rhythmic noise, suggesting it's actually possible to dance to free-form improv. The rest of the album (pristinely recorded at a 2006 Italy performance) doesn't match that crackling open, but it's still pretty great. And while it may not have the relentless energy of the group's debut, it trumps that effort in terms of sonic variety. Full-throttle sprints trade jabs with sparser stretches, and recognizable sounds blend with noise so abstract, it actually gets scary. Much of this diversity comes from the increased prominence of Jim O'Rourke's electronics. Pushed forward in the high-speed mix, his ripples and slashes are somewhat stock, but the way he deploys them gives each piece tangible shape. Connecting the high-end of Gustafsson and guitarists Thurston Moore and Terrie Ex to the low-end of bassist Massimo Pupillo and drummer Paal Nilssen-Love, O'Rourke strings constellations out of his colleague's starry sounds. His strongest moment comes on ""High Trees & a Few Birds - The Doll's Reflection"", a 19-minute piece in which he serves as de facto bandleader. It opens with five minutes of O'Rourke solo, swinging from bursts of noise to cricket-like ambience. When his bandmates each get shots at splattering on his sonic canvas, they all dole out their sounds with disciplined restraint. There was nothing quite this tense on the group's debut, and it works to near-perfection. Gustafsson's slow moans in particular mesh tightly with O'Rourke's blanketing sheen-- during the ending climax, the pair's dying-animal screech is unnerving. The Second Original Silence concludes with ""Crepescular Refractions - Mystery Eye"", ramping back up into a pounding jam akin to the album's opening salvo. Where The First Original Silence was one sustained shot of adrenaline, its sequel shows the group can travel in an arc as well as straight line. Which makes the prospect of what new shape they might take on a potential Third Original Silence that much more enticing.","Pristinely recorded at a 2006 Italy performance, this is another outstanding work from Thurston Moore, Jim O'Rourke, and Mats Gustafsson's improvisational noise/jazz/rock ensemble.

Seaside Rock,Peter Bjorn and John,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929bcdaabf31b7dc7155dfd/1:1/w_160/afd31acd.jpg,2008-09-15 06:00:01,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12190-seaside-rock/,Almost Gold,"Peter Bjorn and John are known for crafting shimmery, lovelorn pop songs, so the idea of the mild-mannered Swedish rockers recording an instrumental (ish) album isn't really so far-fetched. As evocative as the lyrics often are on 2006's Writer's Block, the bongo drums and whistled hook on ""Young Folks"" (to name just the group's most well-known track) spoke to listeners around the world in ways words never could. Since then, PB&J's Björn Yttling has produced some very good records in his own right, including Lykke Li's Youth Novels, Shout Out Louds' Our Ill Wills, and Taken By Trees' Open Field. Meanwhile, Peter Morén-- the band's most distinguished lyricist-- fell comparatively flat this year with a solo album. Still, the best parallel to the limited-edition Seaside Rock comes from not the trio's own Stockholm, but over on the west coast of Sweden. There, in 2006, Gothenburg electropop duo the Tough Alliance followed their Swedish hit debut, The New School, with a limited edition release of a similarly instrumental(-ish) LP called Escaping Your Ambitions-- an ambient voyage through the nature sounds and aquatic sonic imagery that had already become a ""thing"" in their seaside city's scene. It would give the band an escape from the burdens (self-imposed and otherwise) of the dreaded sophomore album. Likewise, on Seaside Rock, PBJ's Morén, Yttling, and John Eriksson delay the inevitable pressures of following up Writer's Block with an album of dreamy, morning-after beach-party comedowns all their own, to mixed success. At its best, Seaside Rock-- like Escaping Your Ambitions-- sounds less like a band chasing a trend than having bubbling sounds rise to meet them. As distant as the Air-like bass grooves of the drumless ""Favour of the Season"" may seem from Writer's Block, the song's details show a sensitivity to pop elegance and eloquence that's altogether different from the nu-disco spaciness of fellow Swedish seafarers such as the Studio. On ""Needles and Pills"", the staccato guitars of Balearic music swell to an orchestral crescendo akin to Morricone played by school children. Jangling, harmonica-led finale ""At the Seaside"" sounds almost as good as the Go! Team's near-instrumental ""Feelgood by Numbers"" if covered by the Chills. And it's not hard to imagine Morén cooing over the ocean sounds and rumbling pianos of ""Barcelona"". PB&J take subverting expectations too far, though, with three tracks featuring guest spoken-word monologues in three separate Swedish dialects. It's sort of like the Scandinavian equivalent of the Fiery Furnaces bringing out Grandma for 2005's Rehearsing My Choir. With its sauntering acoustic guitars and harmonics, ""Erik's Fishing Trip"" (a possible play on the Daydream Nation title) would grace the opening credits of some post-Napoleon Dynamite comedy indie-flick-- if not for the man murmuring over it in Swedish. ""Norrlands Riviera"" swaps his voice for a woman's, some bird noises, and very little actual music; the darker ""Next Stop Bjursele"" is where the album's concept of kids just learning to play instruments is most evident, with martial woodwinds squaring off against foghorns at a march-like pace. ""Rock me, rock me, rock me, rock me,"" this track's monologuer concludes (in English). As beautifully assembled as parts of Seaside Rock are, a couple of genre-specific tracks underscore its stopgap nature. ""School of Kraut"" is basically what its title implies: a bit of krautrock motorik topped by childishly innocent orchestration. But ultimately, it just leaves a craving for the real thing (teachers, leave those kids alone). And the calypso-flavored ""Saying Something (Mukiya)"", with its simple, repetitive steeldrum melody, would work almost disturbingly well as the score to a Little Mermaid video game. For all Seaside Rock's stubborn contrariness, there are few signs that PB&J are actually suffering from writer's block quite yet; with luck, they're just biding their time.","Peter Bjorn and John follow their breakthrough record with an album of palette-cleansing instrumentals, drawing inspiration from downtempo electronica and their homeland's current infatuation with Balearic music. A proper follow-up to Writer's Block is due in 2009.
