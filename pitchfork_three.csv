Sunchokes,Remember Sports,by: Abby Jones,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd2f5d8c858bd0008ba2335/1:1/w_160/sunchokes.jpg,2019-11-19 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/remember-sports-sunchokes/,Father/Daughter,"Had Carmen Perry known her haphazardly formed rock band was fated to gain widespread attention, she might’ve chosen a better name than Sports. The quartet quietly self-released their debut full-length, Sunchokes, just for the hell of it; this was 2014, when Perry and her bandmates Catherine Dwyer, Benji Dossetter, and James Karlin were all still enrolled at their liberal arts college in Ohio. They expected little more from the album than a time capsule to share with friends, but instead, Sunchokes spread by word of mouth until it caught the ear of Father/Daughter, the label that would release Sports’ next album, All of Something, a year later. But that celebratory moment ended up being anticlimactic: Sports broke up shortly after. Dossetter pursued medical school and Karlin relocated to Arizona, while Perry and Dwyer moved to Philadelphia together. Sports never toured All of Something, and had no plans to make music together ever again. That is, until last year, when Sports returned with a new lineup, a new album, and new name to differentiate them from the Oklahoma synth-pop trio they were often mistaken for. Slow Buzz marked the first record for Remember Sports as they exist today, with their current lineup of Perry, Dwyer, guitarist Jack Washburn, and drummer Connor Perry. The updated name pokes fun at the band’s jinxed past, but it has a new resonance now that Father/Daughter has reissued a remastered deluxe edition of Sunchokes to commemorate its fifth anniversary. It’s a timestamp to testify how far Remember Sports have come, but also a salute to their beginnings that made them beloved in the first place. Remember Sports make punky indie pop, combining scrappy guitar shredding with Perry’s brazen vocals, which often border on flat-out yelling. They’re most immediately reminiscent of Camp Cope’s Georgia McDonald, fiercely evocative and angrily bereft. Sunchokes showed her in a more lovelorn place: “I’m always wishing you good luck when you’re gone/And I keep trying to fit in with you where I don’t belong,” she admits on “When Morning Comes.” “When did you stop missing me?” she inquires on “Liked You Best,” before confessing that it took “three long years” to stop missing her subject on the title track. She’s self-deprecating, calling herself a jerk and arguing that she’s not worth getting attached to, but even her most crude put-downs are wrapped up with a tongue-in-cheek spunk that confirm she doesn’t need your pity. “So what if I’m lazy?/I like it that way,” she asserts on “Clean Jeans,” following it up with a kiss-off to flame all Instagram gym rats: “I could be at crossfit like you/But I’d rather be dead!” But it’s impossible to talk about the origins of Remember Sports without mentioning Addie Pray, Perry’s solo project. This reissue includes five original recordings of Addie Pray songs that would later be fleshed out for Sunchokes or All of Something. The best of these—and most emotionally revealing—is “Get Bummed Out,” an ode to a romantic interest she’s trying to get over before they’ve even made it official. She originally uploaded the track to Bandcamp in 2012, and there’s a clear shift in her sentiments between this and the gutsier Sunchokes: “I’m in love with how you make me feel like I’m not so alone,” she sings, suggesting she might be more smitten with the idea of the relationship than the person. The final moments of “Get Bummed Out” bring forth one of Remember Sports’ best lyrics: “Just make a mess of me, I’ll always clean it up,” Perry confides, as her solo acoustic guitar goes silent. Stark moments like these remind us why we listen to indie pop: Music made without the intention of necessarily being heard can yield the type of songwriting that needs to be heard most.

II EP,TNGHT,by: Noah Yoo,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5daf8669383ae400085346fc/1:1/w_160/TNGHT-II.jpg,2019-11-18 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tnght-ii-ep/,WarpLuckyMe,"In 2012, Hudson Mohawke and Lunice’s joint project TNGHT burst into the public consciousness with a singular goal: Write bangers. After months of building excitement off the back of a legendary live debut at SXSW, they released their beloved self-titled EP, bridging the gap between experimental club music and Southern hip-hop while inadvertently becoming standard-bearers for the burgeoning “festival trap” sound that had begun invading American EDM. With their eye-watering bass and surgical drum programming, TNGHT classics like “Goooo” and “Higher Ground” set a new watermark for such obnoxious, body-shaking tracks. Soon enough, big record labels began to swarm the duo like koi fish flocking to flakes. Then, at the height of their influence, TNGHT hung up their hats until further notice, wary of becoming pigeonholed and unwilling to associate themselves with the “bro-ish” bombast of DJs imitating their sound. The break was inevitable; after all, TNGHT was always an outlet for HudMo and Lunice to embrace the base desires they rarely indulged in their solo work, a fun side gig where “first thought, best thought” was the undergirding principle. Now, at a time when electronic acts have grown increasingly obsessed with crafting imaginary worlds to contextualize their conceptualist music, TNGHT have returned with a new set of absurdist dancefloor weapons. Irreverent fun is the primary ethos of II. Listening to the EP’s eight tracks, you can practically imagine HudMo and Lunice in the studio, cackling and egging each other on as they scroll through a software synthesizer’s tackiest presets: How ridiculous is that sound? Wouldn’t it be hilarious if we used that one? The stiff flutes and chintzy brass on the dembow cut “First Body” sound like they’re straight out of GarageBand, but in HudMo and Lunice’s capable hands, they’re warped into an addictive hook. Cheesy rave synths dominate the mid-album highlight “Club Finger,” which feels like a spiritual successor to their last pre-hiatus single (and arguably hardest-hitting tune to date), “Acrylics.” It’s obvious that TNGHT are no longer concerned with whether rappers (or anybody, for that matter) can follow along with these beats, which only grow increasingly erratic as II goes on. Having opted out of the trap wave, the two producers now channel their experimental spirit into more varied tempos and genres. “Dollaz” is probably the closest thing to a pure return to form: A trunk-rattling sternum-shaker built around incessant vocal samples that lodge themselves into your brain. Elsewhere, they dabble in SOPHIE-esque distortion (“Gimme Summn”) and crushed trance breakdowns (“I’m in a Hole”). Much of the latter track, with its distorted subs and tight snares, is reminiscent of Kanye West’s menacing single “All Day,“ which HudMo helped get to the finish line during his time in the G.O.O.D. Music camp. In the years following their break, TNGHT’s legacy was defined by their outsized influence on rap-influenced EDM, as well as another Kanye cut, “Blood on the Leaves,” the breathtaking Yeezus standout that sampled the duo’s unreleased song “R U Ready.” In comparison to II, the early releases now sound borderline ostentatious—not because they’ve aged poorly, but because hordes of copycats, from SoundCloud wannabes to soft-drink brands, have dulled the edges of a once novel idea. But that’s what happens when you’re an innovator; everyone tries to jack your style, even if they only scratch the surface of what makes you special, diluting the quality of the sound you pioneered. Released from all possible constraints—no obligations, no “scene,” no hype machine behind them—HudMo and Lunice are now free to pursue every imaginable whim. There might be no going back to 2012, but there will always be new ways to fuck up some nightclub speakers.","After bowing out at the peak of the trap wave they helped usher in, Hudson Mohawke and Lunice return for their first EP in seven years, sounding as irreverent and unruly as when they started.

Mind in Camden 2,Enchante,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dcb14e28732e700086c2057/1:1/w_160/mindincamden.jpg,2019-11-18 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/enchante-mind-in-camden-2/,Jolly Discs,"The British duo RAP’s EXPORT arrived earlier this year like a manila envelope with no return address, the intent as cryptic as the contents. The music was a mixture of stern techno and melancholy synth-pop that, depending on where you dropped the needle, might recall ’90s trance, Dutch gabber, the ambient pianist Harold Budd, or the doleful poise of Pet Shop Boys. (There was no rap in it at all.) The songs had an uncanny way of making a coherent whole out of odds and ends; the whole thing bore an outsider’s fingerprints, as though this were music made out of pieces that were never meant to fit together in the first place. And yet: It was sleek. White Londoners making left-field dance and indie pop don’t call their outfit RAP unless they intend to raise eyebrows; the musicians’ art-world ties suggested a knowing approach to their references and juxtapositions. (Not necessarily an ironic one, however; the music was too genuine, too affecting, for that.) Meanwhile, members Guy Gormley and Thomas Bush’s many extracurriculars—a welter of spinoffs and side projects, via the Jolly Discs label and elsewhere—hinted at a garden of forking paths that lay hidden from view. The whole thing was seductively inscrutable. Enchante is Gormley’s solo project, and Mind in Camden 2, his most substantial release under the alias so far, is similar in spirit and vibe to EXPORT. Traversing nine tracks in 33 minutes, it weaves together field recordings, ambient sketches, and club beats in a way that flows intuitively, if not always logically. The album’s sonics aren’t all that far from what you might find on a label like Dial, Hivern, or even L.I.E.S.—the production is rooted in the no-frills sound of hardware synths and classic drum machines—but Enchante nevertheless feels provocatively out of step with the broad sweep of contemporary dance music. The album’s materials can seem unusually spartan, the repetition particularly mind-numbing. Gormley’s got a way of making a stretch of kick drums feel like walking on hard pavement in cheap, thin-soled shoes. And on several tracks, he seems to delight in outright wrong-footing listeners, programming drum sequences of unusual lengths and then dropping or adding beats seemingly at random. These aren’t the mind-bending time signatures of Autechre; they’re beats that seem conventional until you try to count them, and you’ll wonder how math so simple could go so wrong. Sometimes, for good measure, he’ll fuck up a groove entirely, mimicking a turntable stylus as it bounces across a rutted record. Gormley released his first EP under the Enchante alias in 2011, on Joe Goddard’s Greco-Roman label. The record was bursting with ideas—vintage house, old-school rave, grime, dancehall, dub—but its playful approach was still recognizable as belonging to the UK’s dance-music tradition. His music has gradually gotten more idiosyncratic over time. Mind in Camden 2 is nominally the sequel to Mind in Camden, a 2017 EP of minimalist house and oddball ambient, but the new record is exponentially stranger. Like RAP, Enchante has become a medium for private obsessions, oblique snapshots of everyday life. Just after “St. Michael,” a lovely sketch for quivering organ and the kind of wordless soul-diva wail you might have once found on a 4Hero record, a fellow with a heavy London accent barks: “I want to see some more lighters, see it, come on! Come on! That gas ain’t expensive. It’s very cheap!” It’s not just what he says that’s so disorienting, it’s the way he says it, his voice dripping with derision. What the hell is he on about? The song that unfolds around him is a sad, meandering meditation for acoustic guitar and folky faux-flutes. Over a dirge-like syn-drum beat, a computer-generated voice recites a poem: “On the cold streets I find what I’m looking for/… /To scream in pleasure and in pain/To walk in the open when I choose/And to die in no one’s arms but my own.” Then the shouting man returns, still shouting. “Come on, come on, we’re holding a vigil!” Who is he and where are we? We are left in the middle of this matrix of connections, feverishly trying to make sense of it all. For all its backward glances, EXPORT didn’t seem nostalgic, exactly—more that it was evocative of a sense of place. Mind in Camden 2, named for the London neighborhood where Gormley grew up, is too. In fact, the album is structured to take the form of a journey. The opening “Enter” sets the scene: footsteps on gravel, a steady downpour, the sound of a car door closing. Suddenly we are in the driver’s seat, rain drumming on the windshield as a navigation voice chirps, “Destination set. Planning route: To Hackney Downs Station, Hackney, London.” The car conceit returns throughout the album, as tracks abruptly break off into the sound of rainfall or freeway noise, sometimes narrated by the eerie, almost-human voice of the GPS. “Turn right,” she says at the end of the title track, and we hear the turn signal clicking; the pounding beat of the song that follows picks up the blinkers’ nervous cadence. Later, “Cleanzing Interlude” is almost certainly a recording from inside an automatic car wash—fifty seconds of whir and chug, suburban noise repackaged as a sound-art readymade. It all comes to a head with “Vigil,” one of the few tracks that could easily hold its own in any context. That most of these tracks wouldn’t make sense outside the context of the album hardly matters; the pleasure comes from being immersed in them, carried along by the twists and turns of Gormley’s mini epic. “Vigil,” though, is a small ambient masterpiece, as moving as it is unassuming—six minutes’ worth of a single synthesizer spun through a delicate web of delay. When he’s got you fully hypnotized, Gormley brings in a contrapuntal synth melody, soft and sad. It’s as fine an encapsulation of rainy-day melancholy as I can imagine. And then, almost as though embarrassed by this moment of unabashed sentimentalism, he takes us through the car wash and finishes with “Rise to Infinity,” a hypnotic, eight-minute minimal-house jam. It feels like an epilogue to the record: our final destination, and also a reminder that, despite all the trickery and intrigue, Gormley is no stranger to purest and most enveloping of dancefloor vibes.","RAP’s Guy Gormley weaves together field recordings, ambient sketches, and club beats in a way that feels provocatively out of step with contemporary dance music.

Exhaust EP,Lee Gamble,by: Ruth Saxelby,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dcc207b3551170008d8ccd4/1:1/w_160/exhaust.jpg,2019-11-18 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lee-gamble-exhaust-ep/,Hyperdub,"There’s a line on Lee Gamble’s Exhaust that really gets under the skin. It pops up on “Naja,” named for a genus of venomous snakes better known as cobras. Against a backdrop of spa-time sounds, an emotionally blank but texturally fried voice says, “You can breathe, forgive yourself, and move on.” It calls to mind online privacy notifications, issued in accordance with Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation, that assume the expectant stance of a playground bully making the lunch-money rounds: “Accept and move on.” In other words: This is just the way things are now. Exhaust can’t accept, won’t accept. The prevailing tenor of the UK artist’s new album is a deep-seated frustration with the paralyzing effect of late capitalism. It’s something that Gamble snarkily signposts with digitally voiced statements throughout the record’s eight tracks. They include “Look around, look around/We sell perfumes and cosmetics for £1…” on opener “CREAM,” and “I am so excited to help you pick out your next luxury vehicle,” delivered in an ASMR-like whisper at the beginning of “Shards” before the track breaks out into machine-gun snares and the satisfyingly gruff tongue twisters of a ragga MC. “Glue” employs a similar play, setting up a somewhat placid scene—the chatter of what sounds like an outdoor market offset by birdsong—only to raze it with a synth as subtle as a pneumatic drill. Abrasive drums and an alienated rave vocal sample complete the track’s disquieting portrait of metropolitan life. In the release notes, Gamble references “the semioblitz,” a term coined by the late critic and cultural theorist Mark Fisher. A portmanteau of “semiotics” and “blitz,” Fisher used it in a blog post to describe the “capitalist semiotic pollution” that swirled around the London 2012 Olympic Games. The primary function of the semioblitz, explained Fisher, “is to make it seem that capital’s involvement is a precondition for culture as such.” Gamble—who is exploring the impact of the semioblitz across three releases, of which Exhaust is the second—extends its meaning to reflect “the aggressive onslaught of visual and sonic stimuli of contemporary cities and virtual spaces.” It’s not hard to draw comparisons with James Ferraro’s 2011 album Far Side Virtual, which addressed a similar theme from a different angle. While Ferraro handled the sonics of our newly augmented reality with glee, Gamble uses the musical languages he has been steeped in for decades to critique the pace, temperament, and manipulative objectives of our interlocking online and offline existences. On “Envenom,” he erratically channel-hops through rave, techno, and breaks in a high-speed, contextless tour through dance-music history. In the last 30 seconds, a ringing bell, like the kind found on old-fashioned shop counters, serves as a subconscious reminder of how seamlessly corporations subsume subculture. The consumerist FOMO of “CREAM” (“these prices are only for today”) is not as effective as it could be, however; the vocals are too heavy-handed, and the intro’s siren and broken glass are overplayed tropes. While there are moments on Exhaust that are pleasurable (the arcade-game grime of “Switches,” for example, or the unpredictable collage of “Saccades”), the album’s overwhelming sense of frustration often makes it a difficult listen. Of course, as Gamble alluded to in conversation with Simon Reynolds, that wasn’t without intention: “‘Brexit was happening, Trump was happening, and I was like, Am I now supposed to make an ambient record for everyone to just zone out?’ he says. ‘In these times, making music about escapism would be a cop out.’” What I hear above all else when I listen to Exhaust is an exasperation with music as product. The emotion of the liberating anthems that Reynolds is nostalgic for has been co-opted time and time again. What’s more, as Liz Pelly has so incisively detailed in her reporting on both Spotify and Sofar Sounds, venture capitalists have played a big part in softening the edges of our experience of music, turning themselves into the stars in the process. If the most widely available music is also the most easily digestible, then it is no wonder that artists like Gamble are so keen to grapple with music’s purpose beyond entertainment—to be an art form in fierce dialogue with the present.

"Bachelor No. 2 or, the Last Remains of the Dodo",Aimee Mann,by: Judy Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dcf05702c290700080ad407/1:1/w_160/dodo.jpg,2019-11-17 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/aimee-mann-bachelor-no-2-or-the-last-remains-of-the-dodo/,Superego,"“Unpopular pop.” That’s the phrase Jon Brion used in 1999 to describe the music scene at Largo, the 120-seat venue in West Hollywood where he ran a weekly residency for more than a decade. Every Friday night, seated at a secondhand piano (that at some point acquired a decorative Viking helmet) and walled in by arcane analog instruments, the star producer, composer, and musical polymath put on a show. Among frequent guests were some of Brion’s most distinguished collaborators: Fiona Apple, Rufus Wainwright, and Aimee Mann. On any given night, John Paul Jones, Jackson Browne, or even Kanye West could appear on the tiny, rug-covered stage. Owned by Mark Flanagan, a towering Irishman with discerning taste in music, Largo became a haven for the eclectic, sophisticated pop sound Brion championed, played by performers who’d long ago outgrown open-mic nights. Flanagan also filled out bills with pillars of LA’s stand-up scene: Zach Galifianakis, Margaret Cho, Sarah Silverman. Music-loving filmmakers like Paul Thomas Anderson and Michel Gondry were in the mix, too. Largo became an ersatz salon and fostered some of the greatest collaborations of its time. This is the environment that nurtured Mann’s brilliant 2000 album Bachelor No. 2 or, the Last Remains of the Dodo. The traditional narrative around Mann’s career frames her as an aberration. Over the course of four decades, she has been a pop flavor of the week who reinvented herself as a singer-songwriter; a folk-rock traditionalist who refused to posture her way into a self-consciously edgy alternative idiom; a woman whose persona isn’t seductive or enraged so much as pensive and, at times, embittered; an artist in a youth-obsessed industry who started doing her best work sometime in her late 30s. All of this made her an outlier in the music industry at large. But at Largo, Mann was among her people. The gimmick-free nature of her music and public image perturbed sexist, unimaginative major-label executives in the ’90s, when the industry was still printing money and every act was expected to break out with the same velocity as Nirvana. At the beginning of that decade, Mann’s band ’Til Tuesday—a new wave act that had peaked with the breathy 1985 hit “Voices Carry”—broke up, and she launched a solo career. Her power-pop debut, 1993’s Whatever, and somewhat more muted 1995 follow-up I’m With Stupid proved she was a witty, self-possessed songwriter, even as sales in the low six figures disappointed the suits. By the time she made her third album, Bachelor No. 2, Mann was known for clashing with the industry. In 1999, The New York Times Magazine sent reporter Jonathan van Meter to observe her struggle to get her label to release the record over their protests that it lacked a single. “A single is a record company’s job: to pick out a song that they think is good and make sure people hear it,” Mann complained. “It’s also incidentally, their job to come up with a way of selling records if, say, I don’t have a single at all.” She wrote the deceptively winsome piano ballad “Nothing Is Good Enough” about this exhausting back-and-forth. “It doesn’t really help that you can never say what you’re looking for/But you’ll know it when you hear it,” she sings. The lightness of her vocal lends a hint of irony to her scornful lyrics, which offended her A&R rep. He assured the Times that not only had he given her specific feedback on choruses that “weren’t working,” he’d also made her a tape of better ones. Mann eventually told van Meter that she’d heard Interscope head Jimmy Iovine had listened to Bachelor No. 2 and demanded, “Aimee doesn’t expect us to put this record out as it is, does she?” At various points during the recording process, Mann attempted to churn out the hit that would liberate her other songs from the vaults at Interscope. But she still ended up with a release steeped in the aesthetics and values of Largo, a place so hospitable to her sound that Flanagan once jokingly called it “Aimee Mann’s clubhouse.” Out of step though it might have been with a testosterone-damaged late-’90s rock marketplace dominated by Mann’s Interscope labelmates Nine Inch Nails, Limp Bizkit and Marilyn Manson (not to mention a pop sphere populated by and targeted entirely toward teens), the intricately crafted Bachelor No. 2 was a gift to the crowd Brion called “song sluts,” who lined up outside the club every Friday. More than any album Mann had made up to that point, it’s a showcase for the detail she builds into her music before the recording process even begins. “I kind of like it to sound like a complete song before I get to the studio,” she explained to Performing Songwriter magazine in 2005. “I work hard to make sure both the melody and the words are strong before thinking about recording or production.” The approach suits her unpretentious attitude toward music-making, which she treats as a craft as much as an art. Throughout her career, Mann has shown little patience for the idea that there’s something mysterious and alchemical behind creativity. “People are a little too in love with this idea of the crazy genius,” she said on the podcast Beyond and Back. “That it’s effortless, that it’s flowing, that you’re born with it. Because songwriting is a skill.” Yet Mann’s songwriting, particularly on Bachelor No. 2, has its share of magical elements. She has the ability to sublimate a simple folk melody into something weightless and soaring. Her slinky “Calling It Quits,” an initially spare, glum resolution to resign from the rat race, gets an infusion of energy and wonder at the moment she invokes F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novella “The Diamond as Big as the Ritz”; Mann is as wary of the priceless gemstone as Fitzgerald was, but a few regal trumpet blasts (provided by none other than Flanagan) and the crash of cymbals capture its sparkling allure. Throughout the album, a handful of producers, including Brion and Mann herself, add dimension to her finely wrought melodies and words. Each recording feels like a faithful translation of her rousing performances, with sing-along refrains and strummy intros intact. As a result, despite its scattered genesis over several stints in the studio, Bachelor No. 2 has the organic flow of a late-night set in a small, hushed room. There’s a piano-bar feel to the instrument’s low, steady ramble on “Driving Sideways.” Keyboards clink like a pair of wine glasses on “Satellite,” underlining Mann’s gentle, devastating diagnosis of a confidant’s loss of perspective: “Baby, it’s clear/From here/You’re losing your atmosphere.” Though they’re by no means minimalistic, these arrangements establish a sense of intimacy that’s hard to find on full-band rock records that aren’t deliberately, performatively lo-fi. The archetypal bar—not the club or the stadium but maybe Largo on a slow night—makes an ideal imagined backdrop for 13 songs bound together by the kind of world-weary wisdom pop culture associates with such settings. Sometimes Mann is the regular slumped over a tumbler of whiskey, wryly enumerating her many disappointments. Other times, she plays the bartender—listening closely, dispensing no-nonsense advice, offering a gruff sort of comfort. Bottled-up energy builds to explosive choruses in “Ghost World,” smashing the veneer of detachment that surrounds Daniel Clowes’ comic-book heroine Enid Coleslaw, a seen-it-all barfly in the body of a teen girl. As early as “Voices Carry,” Mann had an ear for sudden, surprising hooks. That talent manifests enchantingly on “Red Vines,” a rumination on the meteoric rise of her younger friend Paul Thomas Anderson that starts out placid but lifts off on Mann’s intensifying vocal before the first verse is through, then crescendos straight into a chorus that lingers on dilated vowels.  The dark side of “Red Vines” is the way it frames Mann, still under 40 but a decade past her own bright-young-thing years, as both a cheerleader of Anderson’s success and the only one who foresees his inevitable fall from grace. (That she was wrong in using her experience to predict a downfall that never arrived probably says less about their respective outputs than it does about pop music’s youth bias and the misogyny that pervades all corners of the entertainment industry.)  She’s constantly anticipating the misfortunes of others. She knows when they’re bound for disappointment, when they’re deluding themselves, when they’ve lost the plot entirely and need to be cut off for the night. The best song on the album, and the one that most thoroughly embodies its wary, bruised point of view, is “Deathly.” Warmed up by whispered backing vocals from Brion and Juliana Hatfield, it’s a preemptive rejection from someone who’s been hurt too many times to risk heartbreak again. “Don’t pick on me/When one act of kindness could be deathly,” Mann pleads, her emphatic down-strums and simple rhyme scheme inviting a cathartic sing-along. She repeats the brief but evocative title so many times, it finally morphs into a word that’s even more devastating by virtue of its finality: “definitely.” Because she chooses her maximalist moments carefully on Bachelor No. 2, the song’s stratospheric, almost overblown minute-long instrumental outro lends an epic scale to what amounts to Mann’s refusal to keep experiencing emotions. It was “Deathly” that inspired Anderson to complete the circle of inspiration, making Mann’s music the centerpiece of his 1999 film Magnolia. It makes up the bulk of the soundtrack, alongside a score from Brion (whose history with Anderson dated back to the director’s 1996 debut Hard Eight, on which he collaborated with Mann’s husband, composer Michael Penn). Unfolding over a night punctuated by violent L.A. rain—and culminating in a biblical cloudburst of bullfrogs—Magnolia follows an intersecting cast of lonely, angry, wounded and regretful characters. In one scene, an abuse survivor and addict named Claudia (Melora Walters) abruptly ends what looked to be a promising first date with a kind, embattled police officer (John C. Reilly) by speaking the opening salvo of “Deathly”: “Now that I’ve met you, would you object to never seeing each other again?” (“I heard that line and wrote backwards,” Anderson recalled in an introduction to the shooting script. “This ‘original’ screenplay could, for all intents and purposes, be called an adaption of Aimee Mann songs.”) The film hinges on this ugly but understandable impulse, to hurt anyone you could potentially care about before they gain the power to hurt you. Of the nine songs Mann contributed to Magnolia’s soundtrack, including an apt cover of “One” recycled from a Harry Nilsson tribute album, four also appear on Bachelor No. 2: “Driving Sideways,” the muted woman-to-woman warning “You Do” and an instrumental version of “Nothing Is Good Enough,” along with “Deathly.” Magnolia drew more attention to non-album tracks “Wise Up,” which the cast sings in one surreal sequence, and the emotional steamroller “Save Me,” which earned an Academy Award nomination. (Mann got to perform it at the Oscars, but it lost to Phil Collins’ saccharine “You’ll Be in My Heart,” from Tarzan.) Written for Bachelor No. 2 before being appropriated as a Magnolia single, it’s the flip-side of “Deathly.” Mann’s narrator—“a girl in need of a tourniquet”—begs, or maybe dares, an object of affection to pluck her “from the ranks of the freaks/Who suspect they could never love anyone.” Mann has said that Bachelor No. 2 could’ve come out as early as 1998, but a combination of label gridlock and the marketing cycle around Magnolia, whose soundtrack hit stores just before the film’s December 1999 theatrical debut, delayed its release until the following May. In the meantime, on tour, an impatient Mann sold homemade EPs of her new music, in what she has characterized as a “real DIY fuck-you-record-company-I’m-selling-it-myself” gesture. And after the no-confidence vote from Iovine, she bought back her masters from Interscope, founded the label SuperEgo, and put out Bachelor No. 2 on her own. That courageous move presaged a future where artists with dedicated fan bases wouldn’t need corporate middlemen to access them. With a boost in name recognition from Magnolia and the Oscars, sales of the album soared past 200,000—easily outperforming I’m With Stupid. (This was an especially decisive victory for Mann: In 1999, then-Sony VP Gail Marowitz had told the Times that “if Aimee sold 70,000 records independently, she would be making more money than if she sold 300,000 on a major label.”) It was in collaborating with Anderson on a movie that eventually played in more than 1,000 theaters that Mann finally found a wider audience primed to appreciate her pithy, disenchanted songs. Largo’s is the rare story of a small, independently owned music venue that has a happy ending. Flanagan and friends left the original venue for a larger one, Largo at the Coronet, in 2008. Eleven years later, Brion maintains a monthly Friday-night residency, and in December, Mann and Ted Leo are scheduled to play three nights of Christmas shows. “For a while there,” Mann once said, “I was actually going to call the record Underdog Day.” Bachelor No. 2 or, the Last Remains of the Dodo probably makes a grander, more elegant name for a contemporary classic. But the alternate title certainly would have fit.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

It Should Be Us,Andy Stott,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc5e210a9726900084045de/1:1/w_160/stott.jpg,2019-11-16 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/andy-stott-it-should-be-us/,Modern Love,"The vanguard club sounds of the past decade have tended to favor gleaming surfaces and vivid shapes rendered in crisp high definition, affording dazzling visions of the technological sublime. Andy Stott’s It Should Be Us is a report from the opposite extreme. No spotless chrome expanses, rippling LED arrays, or algorithmic pulses here: The Manchester producer takes us deep into the catacombs to explore a vision of club music at its most damaged—of busted samplers, waterlogged wax, cracked cement, and lumpy sandbags. None of this is new for Stott; he’s been mining the vein for nearly a decade now. But It Should Be Us might be his most provocative attempt yet to throw a shovel of dirt on the idea of techno-futurist utopia. It has been three years since Stott’s last LP, Too Many Voices, and eight since he put out a pair of consecutive double-packs that radically redefined the sound that, until then, he had shared with many of his Modern Love labelmates—a nuanced, warehouse-ready strain of techno that balanced Detroit’s expressive release with Berlin’s dub atmospheres. Passed Me By and We Stayed Together pulled the rug out from beneath dance-music convention, slowing the tempo to a rickety crawl and wrapping his synths in a layer of grit. It was less deconstruction than exhumation, with zombie beats trudging dully forward, dead-eyed and caked in earth. Stott reached his peak with Luxury Problems and Faith in Strangers, infusing slow-motion techno with hints of goth and bass music; at its best—particularly on songs featuring the vocalist Alison Skidmore—the results suggested the lo-fi trap remix of This Mortal Coil you never knew you needed. On the slightly scattered Too Many Voices, it sometimes felt like Stott couldn’t decide where to go from there—to choose light or shadow, movement or stasis—but with It Should Be Us, he plunges straight into the wreckage and never looks back. If the new record is billed as an EP, despite its length (eight tracks on the 2x12"", nine on the digital release), it might be because these feel less like songs than experiments in pushing Stott’s habitual techniques to the breaking point. Agonizingly slow machine beats shuffle like a shackled convict, their syncopated accents turned painfully halting. It’s not just the pace: The sound design also contributes to the mood of mortal exhaustion. Stott’s basslines are hardly recognizable as such—less a progression of notes than a mournful shrug. A synth lead might be a broken foghorn or a swarm of bees; pads droop listlessly, like vines after the first frost. Stott’s sound palette has always veered toward distressed textures, but on It Should Be Us, the quality of his drums—a kind of powdery crinkle, diffuse and ill-formed—sounds almost like he’s been sampling 32-kbps stream rips. Hi-hats rustle like a sticky wad of cellophane; bass drums don’t so much kick as cough, heaving like diseased lungs. We tend to associate lo-fi techniques with analog tools: things like tube distortion and vinyl hiss that, for whatever reason, contemporary listeners tend to find satisfying on a gut level. Not many artists have waded into the waters of digital lo-fi yet. Stott’s wheezing, phased shakers don’t always sound pleasing to the ear, but that might be part of the point. He’s clearly out to disorient us. Again and again, his beats challenge your ability to parse them: Snares, claps, and cymbals thrash and jerk according to a logic that seemingly only they understand. Then the kick drum drops and all the stray elements seem to snap into place around it. Sometimes his beats can be truly devious: “Ballroom” drags itself out of the gate like a wounded animal until a wordless vocal loop sets the true tempo somewhere way up in footwork territory. Even then, the collision of arrhythmic woodblocks and rapid-fire hiccups resists any attempts to make sense of it, suggesting a caffeine high gone dangerously wrong. What’s missing from It Should Be Us are the moments of beauty that defined Luxury Problems and Faith in Strangers. Stott has backed away from the airy vocals and the muscular post-punk that, combined, made songs like the latter album’s title track so compelling, and he hasn’t quite figured out how to replace them. Here, the pitched-down vocals often sound like placeholders for a fresher, more distinctive idea; Burial and his imitators have already wrung that trope pretty dry. But at the level of rhythm, texture, and atmosphere, It Should Be Us marks a step into the unknown. Most promisingly, it takes post-punk’s bleak worldview and reformats it for the 21st century, mimicking corrupt files to create a new music of technological failure. Stott’s enervated club music, a fitting way to cap a decade of increasing fatigue, doubles as a timely reminder that our apps won’t save us.","The Manchester producer’s latest songs take us deep into the catacombs to explore a vision of club music at its most damaged.

OOFIE,Wiki,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dcb11a20e83ce0008cbb48c/1:1/w_160/woofie.jpg,2019-11-16 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/wiki-oofie/,Wikset Enterprise,"With his sprawling XL debut No Mountains in Manhattan, Wiki seemed primed to break out of the NYC underground he had spent so long toiling in, but the years that followed would prove tumultuous. He formed the indie rap supergroup Secret Circle with Lil Ugly Mane and Antwon but disbanded it in disgust after Antwon was accused of sexual assault, shelving years of work in the process. And he left XL Recordings—the British label that signed him to his first record deal with his group Ratking—releasing his last song for them (“Cheat Code”) in February. So while Oofie is Wiki’s second full length, it finds the 26-year-old MC weary, reflective, and somewhat mature. The gap-toothed hoodrat who used to revel in drunken debauchery now favors nights at home with his girl and their cats. He sounds almost contrite recounting the night in Stockholm when, hyped off a DMX song, he punched a window out in a club and spent a night in jail (“Dame Aquí”). His last LP was a high-water mark, distilling concepts he’d been exploring his whole career into a clear and forceful statement. But he’d become disillusioned with life at the label that launched Adele’s career and counts Radiohead and Sigur Ros among its roster, telling DJ Booth he felt like “a small fish in a big sea.” Rather than shop for a new label, he went independent, availing himself of his old label’s basement studio as he got to work returning to basics, which for Wiki means beats and bars, as raw as possible. If NMIM was Wiki’s magnum opus, Oofie is just some rap songs. It’s less ambitious but just as focused, with tight, diaristic raps and vignettes and grimy production. His departure from XL seems to have been amicable; Much of the album was recorded at XL’s studio in Manhattan by the label’s in-house producer Alex Epton, but Brooklyn’s Tony Seltzer makes frequent appearances (“Pesto,” “4 Clove Club,” “Back Then,” and “Dame Aquí”), as does the drummer Michul Kuun, who performs as NAH. The muddy production is sparse but never simplistic, often disguising nuance that reveals itself on repeated listens, like the security alarm on “Downfall,” or the tamboura lurking in the shadow of a squeaky trumpet on “Freaks.” Lyrically, Wiki seems to hint at a mid-life crisis, which sounds strange until you realize he’s been recording since he was in high school. He laments how critical acclaim doesn’t always equal a massive audience (“Reviews strong, not enough views on the songs,” he raps on “Pesto”), and notes on “Promises” that he can’t afford to rest on his laurels (“I still ain't made enough for my ass just to stay indoors”). New York City is still a main character, but he’s not so much crowing about the city’s supremacy as he is artfully exploring its mundane details with a microscope, the minutiae that makes it unique, the signifiers of what makes it his home as well as his muse. The sentiment is clearest on “Back Then,” in which he resists the urge to romanticize its past at the expense of its future, joining Queens’ Lansky Jones in reminiscing on both the good (“We knew the delis that sold you brew”) and bad (“You never got ass then/You was always sad then”). If there’s any disappointment to Oofie, it’s that it finds Wiki running in place, flexing his considerable lyrical chops without extending himself. In a way, it’s a step back from his debut, though that step is clearly intentional—an attempt to shake off the pressures of a label while he figures out his next steps. The record would likely feel stronger if sequenced with some of the loosies he’s dropped in 2019, namely the filthy Madlib production “Eggs” or “Fee Fi Fo Fum.” But that would seem almost beside the point. If the album has any concept, it’s one of perspective; those songs are in the past, and Wiki’s gaze is firmly planted forward. Because as strong as it is, Oofie still feels transitional, a waystation for a rapper still plotting his next move.","The NYC rapper, having left his label, shakes off the pressure of his tumultuous last few years with a set of straight-ahead, grimy rap songs.

New Hell,Greet Death,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dcec8052c290700080ad3cd/1:1/w_160/newhell.jpg,2019-11-16 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/greet-death-new-hell/,Deathwish,"Dixieland was only a somewhat misleading title for Greet Death’s 2017 debut—the Flint, Michigan trio wasn’t pulling a Kid Rock, but paying tribute to a hometown flea market while they gleefully rummaged through used Midwestern relics. They incorporated the Smashing Pumpkins, Mark Kozelek, and Jason Molina at their most uncomfortably numb, broad-shouldered heavy acts like Cloakroom and Pelican, and even pulled some old Bob Seger records off the shelf. Even when songs were built on lyrics like, “Waking up dead on sheets of white,” or, “I’m going down,” Dixieland was oddly uplifting, three guys finding their purpose by reclaiming some of the bleakest music of their lifetimes. The reference points haven’t changed on their second LP, but Greet Death sound like they’ve actually lived them this time around, enough to justify making an album called New Hell on a label called Deathwish. More than a realization of Dixieland’s promise, New Hell can be seen as the culmination of a decade where a wave of like-minded bands were lumped into shoegaze despite seemingly inverting its entire aesthetic of cocooned bliss. Instead of soft-focus vocals wrapped in sheets of trebly, white noise, acts like Greet Death bludgeoned with bottom-heavy production and guitars that sound forged from molten steel, only sharing shoegaze’s aim for sensory domination. Pedalboard gawkers might show up to a Greet Death gig a half-hour earlier to get a look at their distortion rig, but New Hell isn’t dirty or grimy itself, more comparable to heavy machinery coming up against the stubbornness of nature. The instrumentation of “Circles of Hell” variously resembles a bulldozer stalling against a massive pile of rubble or a power drill hitting impenetrable bedrock. The earth is a cold dead place on the frostbitten dirge “Entertainment,” as Sam Boyhtari’s guitar thuds like a shovel against solid dirt. The hyperbolically spiteful “Do You Feel Nothing” is the end result of all this digging, New Hell’s one moment of release that comes off like an extended, three-minute mudslide in the “Bullet With Butterfly Wings” video. But the success of New Hell is mostly attributable to Greet Death’s newfound ability to synthesize Boyhtari and Logan Gaval’s distinct head voices—Boyhtari sings directly through his nasal passage, while Gaval moans in a DayQuil haze. On Dixieland, they did the logical thing and separated the two almost completely. Here, both make the most of their unique tones to represent the opposing forces of abject depression: Gaval is the voice of dejection, the one best suited for lyrics like, “I would kill myself completely out of spite,” or, “I sit around and I wait to get high,” as what comes across in his lethargic, drawn-out sighs is the inability to immediately access those maladaptive forms of relief and the impotent longing to speed up the process. Meanwhile, Boyhtari is the sound of rejection, why the caged rat sings. Unlike Gaval, he relishes the idea of wasting all of his days as revenge against everyone who cares about him: “I hate my friends ’cause they don’t hate themselves,” he snarls on “Do You Feel Nothing?” justifying getting fucked up because he’s young, it still works, and it’s pretty much all he’s got going right now. Impressive and imposing as Greet Death are in teardown mode, all the above serves as the foundation for “You’re Gonna Hate What You’ve Done” and the closing title track—towering, nine-minute monuments to self-pity. Both are structured similarly and depending on your mood, they’re either offering ascendance one layer of fuzz at a time or boring deeper into the earth’s core. Either way, it’s an escape from the limbo that’s so painfully and accurately captured throughout New Hell. Having someone to help out is the one thing that keeps you rolling that boulder up that hill despite every temptation to just let it roll over you.

Trophy,Kate Davis,by: Cat Zhang,Executive Editorial Assistant,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dcb18cd2c290700080ad09c/1:1/w_160/trophy.jpg,2019-11-16 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kate-davis-trophy/,Solitaire,"If you were a tightly wound perfectionist who spent her formative years shuttling from award ceremony to award ceremony, conducting life as if it were graded by rubric, then you probably stumbled into adulthood craving freedom. The former jazz prodigy Kate Davis graduated from high school a Presidential Scholar in the Arts, scored a full-ride to the Manhattan School of Music, and performed at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center. But she wasn’t satisfied, sneaking in time to experiment with more emotionally liberating indie rock. Now 28 years old, Davis has resurfaced with the clever and heartfelt debut, Trophy. Trophy is a winking salute to adolescence, that chaotic period when your body is illogically proportioned and you’re not sure who you’re supposed to be. This turbulence has been fertile ground for sharp, empathetic indie rock for approximately forever. Davis has a good ear for it: she co-wrote Sharon Van Etten’s howling masterpiece “Seventeen,” and her own work basks in that wide-eyed nostalgia, radiating a sincerity that feels almost anachronistic in these bitter, irony-poisoned years. Unlike the pouty adolescents now seen on television, Davis’ teenagers aren’t sarcastic, lewd, or indifferent. A nervous boy spots a girl he likes at a party in “Dirty Teenager,” a droll Courtney Barnett-like track that finds poignancy in Miller Lites and scattered trash. Davis, cutting through swirling electric guitar and drums, sings “I just want to be your friend” so sweetly and earnestly that it‘s devastating. Everything about Davis screams early 2010s — both the kindly, sincere messaging and the Pandora-approved singer-songwriter flavor of her music. Davis’s songs often start languorously, wading into gentle, lapping folk before plunging into noisier grunge-rock. She has a pleasant, lilting voice to listen to while resting your head against a window. But these slow-moving repetitions—a few plucked strings, a murmured confession—leave you hungry for grittier self-scrutiny. Romantic metaphors of open heart surgery and stars aligning can come off saccharine, as do melodramatic declarations to a lover to “meet me in the morning, indigo skyline twilight.” The stakes often come into focus halfway through, paving the way for urgent, earnest questioning. After much toothless meandering on “Burning Accidents,” Davis growls at the thought of “wanting more”; the guitars swerve into a drone, and tender hopes of reconciliation splinter into visceral anguish at breaking apart. On “Did You Love Somebody,” Davis’ voice leaps and thins as she repeats the question. You can imagine someone avoiding her gaze, a little unnerved by the directness. The emotional centerpiece of Trophy is “Daisy,” a wrenching song Davis wrote following the death of her father. Launching with the same guitar chug as Liz Phair’s “Fuck and Run,” it charmingly captures the aimlessness and dread of growing up. Davis lists off virtues she doesn’t have: “Neither am I good nor pure, neither am I wise.” When she repeats “I keep fucking up,” she reminds us that we’re all little kids with lipstick smeared on our faces, masquerading as grown-ups.","A former jazz prodigy emerges with a clever and heartfelt indie rock debut that pays winking tribute to adolescence in all its agonies and small glories.

I Made a Place,Bonnie “Prince” Billy,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dcb07195246650008bf7de9/1:1/w_160/imadeaplace.jpg,2019-11-15 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bonnie-prince-billy-i-made-a-place/,Drag CityPalace,"On January 13, 2018, an emergency alert lit up phones throughout Hawaii, warning of a ballistic missile approaching the island. “SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER,” it read. “THIS IS NOT A DRILL.”  Among the recipients were Will and Elsa Hansen Oldham, who had recently arrived at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park as artists-in-residence and who were suddenly preparing to spend their last moments together. Calmly, the couple ate some THC-infused blueberries that they had been gifted by a friend—why let them go to waste?—and Will began writing a whimsical new song to calm his nerves. “When life is tough and very scary,” it went, “My wife and I/We chomp a blueberry.” By the end of the song he distilled its message to just three words: “We’ll be fine.” And so they were. About forty minutes after the alert was sent, it was revoked; a result of human error. Life went on. When the Oldhams returned home to Louisville, Kentucky, Oldham painted his entire body blue and shot a video for “Blueberry Jam,” a song whose giggly absurdity in the face of death turned out to be the only rational response. It was not the only thing he wrote during his time in Hawaii, but for the time being it was all he felt comfortable sharing. A full album was coming together—his first official collection of new Bonnie “Prince” Billy songs since 2011’s Wolfroy Goes to Town—but he had mixed feelings. With a deep hatred toward streaming services and the internet’s infinite content scroll, he described his reluctance toward releasing new original music like a parent leaving a teenager at a party. It felt irresponsible. Now that he’s released it, I Made a Place gives insight into his trepidation. It’s careful, contemplative music. But that doesn’t mean it’s unguarded. While peers and collaborators like Bill Callahan and Phil Elverum have evolved toward songwriting that lays bare their most primal worries and beliefs, Oldham has only burrowed deeper into life’s mysteries. His work remains defined by its complexity, as many of these 13 songs take the form of advice delivered like riddles. “Put your body on and get a new memory box,” goes the chorus of its opening song. “I got the eye of the squid/It ain’t not there, it’s just hid,” is another. Early in his career, Oldham’s merging of traditional folk music with his willfully obscure persona felt like the epitome of indie dedication: his invite-only universe away from the status quo. In 2019 it feels arguably even more anachronistic. The band he assembled for these songs helps bring him down to earth. The always-riveting duo of singer-songwriter Joan Shelley and guitarist Nathan Salsburg offer a soothing counterpoint, like concerned friends during a bad trip. Take “You Know the One,” an autumnal highlight, where he sings about devotion to “the one” that could be either spiritual or romantic (“Complete transfiguration is what the one is bound to bring”). Shelley’s soft, resolute harmonies and Salsburg’s trilling riffs expose the warmth in these words—what true connection feels like. The darker, second half of the record is buoyed by Jacob Duncan’s clarinet and saxophone, making it pleasantly difficult to tell where one song ends and the next begins. The lived-in sound of the record belies how different some of this music is for Oldham. “Look Backward On Your Future, Look Forward To Your Past” is a song unlike anything in his deep catalog, a morality tale that seems to take inspiration from both John Prine and William Faulkner. You don’t expect a narrative with a beginning, middle, and end from Oldham’s songwriting (even the song title, repeated throughout the record, seems to fight against this formality). But with his lively solo acoustic delivery, he makes it feel as natural as a country standard. Often his writing is best at its simplest. “Dream Awhile,” which shares a melody with “Triumph of Will” from his 2013 self-titled release, prescribes combating stress with a good night’s sleep, a jar of cookies, and a loved one to spoon. It is the most settled Oldham’s work has ever sounded. So while “Blueberry Jam” doesn’t actually appear on the record, its themes of simple pleasures and persistence echo through the music. In the last few years, Oldham became a father, and he has noted how these songs were the first that his daughter heard. His message of hope to the next generation rings clearest in “Building a Fire,” a psalm-like ballad that closes the record. His best work in this style includes some of his barest love songs—say, “I Gave You” or “I Called You Back”—but this one follows a stranger path through the darkness. “Yesterday was a lark/And today is a bear,” he sings. “Tomorrow is an octopus/You can look for me there.” It’s a funny send-off to one of Oldham’s most complicated albums, but it’s also poignant in its way. If you’re left confused or disoriented, that’s exactly Oldham’s point. Welcome, he seems to say, we’ve been waiting for you.

King of R&B,Jacquees,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dcb04412c290700080ad095/1:1/w_160/jacquees_kingof.jpg,2019-11-15 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jacquees-king-of-randb/,Cash Money,"When Atlanta singer Jacquees crowned himself the King of R&B last year, his self-coronation was met almost entirely with jeers and dismissals. Despite his vague caveat (“for this generation”) and its clear intentions (for Jacquees to psyche himself up), haters, talking heads, and all the once and never Kings gathered en masse to dogpile the poor guy. It was only The-Dream, a singer-songwriter who can stake his own claim to the throne, that came at the comments with any sense: “That’s how you gotta talk, man,” he told Beats 1. “I did the same thing before I wrote ‘Single Ladies.’ ... Everybody took that as me being asinine at the time. They didn’t know like ... No, he’s trying to psych himself out to do some great shit.” Jacquees makes a similar clarification on “King,” the opener to his sophomore album, which he dedicates to all the kings that came before: “Every day, a star is born/And if we talkin’ kings, there’s more than one/You should clap for ‘em,” he sings, reworking the hook from JAY-Z’s “A Star is Born” to reframe himself as just the latest in a long line of R&B royals. King of R&B, an hour-long, 18-track practice of the genre’s techniques, is Jacquees’ job application. He doesn’t write any songs as great as “Single Ladies,” but his ambitions are crystal-clear. Of the R&B singers under 30 that Jacquees could feasibly call his competition, he is the most well-rounded. He might not have the massive crossover appeal of Bryson Tiller, or the experimental range of Daniel Caesar; his music isn’t as rap-infused as the alternative R&B of 6lack, and he’s nowhere near the songwriter the Internet’s Syd is, but he is as fundamentally sound as any of his peers: he understands R&B songs at their basic components and he is easily the most gifted singer of the bunch. In his clash with one such contemporary, Tory Lanez, on the album cut “Risk It All,” Jacquees steamrolls the Canadian mimic with bigger melodies and bolder come-ons. Throughout, he tries on Trigga-era temptations, Usher-sized confessions, and nearly everything in between. He is still more reliant on mood than actual scene-setting, but his songs are broadening in scope. His debut album, 4275, was all about the anticipation of sex—trying to connect with someone after coming home from a long tour, yearning for a lover during a late night at the studio, the final moments just before sealing the deal. There was a song called “House or Hotel” that focused primarily on sneaking around with women in relationships. Titillation was all he could muster. The new album fills out these vignettes, not just rolling around in the sheets (“Round II”) but also navigating the interpersonal exchanges that come with it. On the apologetic “Cross the Line,” he finds himself renegotiating boundaries after getting caught cheating. “Warning” proposes an entirely new construct for him, one where he is not in control: flipping the “one that got away” trope on its head. Past Kings of R&B have always negotiated a fine line between raunchy pleasure-seeker and hopeless romantic, and Jacquees is learning how to balance that emotional equation. From the sleek, body roll enticements of “Come Get It” to the starry-eyed Summer Walker duet “Superstar,” these are carefully crafted totems from an admirer of the form. In a bit of irony, Jacquees sounds most comfortable on King of R&B among melodic rappers. He sucks Young Thug and Gunna into his orbit on “Verify,” their raps serving as accents for his croons. The strobing, synth-led “What They Gone Do With Me” sponges up some of Future’s bravado. Alongside Lil Baby, on closer “Your Peace,” he turns the throwback bounce of hip-hop soul into a middle ground. On “New New,” he filters down Thug and Travis Scott-ish vocal takes into a serenade, basically purifying a rap song into an R&B one. Even straddling the hip-hop world, he never loses the smoothness R&B requires. At a time when so many pride themselves on being genre-benders, he remains a formalist. There may be room to debate who the King of R&B is or what that even means, but with King of R&B, Jacquees formally accepts his place within a storied lineage.","The self-appointed (and much-derided) new King of R&B attempts to live up to his own hype with a slick and ambitious new LP.

Becoming Peter Ivers,Peter Ivers,by: Madison Bloom,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dcb0df62c290700080ad098/1:1/w_160/peterivers.jpg,2019-11-15 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/peter-ivers-becoming-peter-ivers/,Rvng Intl.,"The late songwriter Peter Ivers had a rich life long before he relocated to Southern California in the 1970s—as a Harvard student, a harmonica virtuoso, and a Van Dyke Parks-groomed solo artist—but his legacy wasn’t sealed until he made a home on the West Coast. It was there that Ivers composed “In Heaven” for David Lynch’s debut film Eraserhead, hosted the public access variety show New Wave Theatre, and recorded numerous demo cassettes and reel-to-reel tapes, leaving a mess of pop oddities at the time of his still-unsolved murder in 1983. On Becoming Peter Ivers, RVNG Intl. presents a collection of his bizarre and beautiful recordings, some of which have never before seen the light of day. It is an embarrassment of riches that crowns Ivers as the weirdo king of bedroom pop, decades before the genre existed. “Demos are often better than records,” Ivers once wrote. “More energy, more soul, more guts.” Becoming Peter Ivers is a testament to that doctrine. The compilation presents 25 tracks culled from over 500 recordings that Ivers laid down at his Laurel Canyon home and studios in L.A. in the mid-to-late ’70s (four songs that appear on Ivers’ earlier albums are absent from the digital edition). Lovingly compiled by RVNG’s Matt Werth with Matthew Sanders, Ivers’ friend Steve Martin, and Ivers’ longtime girlfriend Lucy Fisher, the songs feel close and warm. Opener “Take Your Chances With Me” is one of the record’s most intimate and modern offerings. Ivers’ small voice is pinched into an airy whisper, supported by a scaffold of acoustic guitar and the cry of a distant siren. It’s such a spare piece of music that any additional arrangement would threaten to crush its delicate bones. “Even Stephen Foster” takes a similar approach, uniting subdued piano and Ivers’ half-sung confessions. Not every song on Becoming is so stripped down, but they all possess an unpolished charm. “I’m Sorry Alice” is a disco-funk romp with horns, harmonica, and back-up singers. “Miraculous Weekend” is even more decadent; Ivers takes a page from Marc Bolan’s book and slips into a trembling falsetto, rhyming “fabulous” and “miraculous” with tossed-off elegance. These tracks are some of the most decorated entries on Becoming, but they sound loose and spontaneous, as if performed live at a house party. At the opposite side of the spectrum, the brief “Untitled” is among the album’s best songs, with a simple keyboard progression and wordless melody that, though written prior to the band’s debut, sound oddly like the Cure. Tracks like “Alpha Centauri” present a middle ground in Ivers’ work—the production is pared back, but the combination of skronking sax and Ivers’ shrill voice lends it an air of absurdity. Comfortably transitioning between lo-fi love songs and full-band glam rock, Ivers’ chameleonic songwriting reflects his professional life: He hosted punk bands like Fear and Dead Kennedys on New Wave Theatre while also befriending Hollywood mainstays like Harold Ramis and composing the theme for Ron Howard’s 1977 film Grand Theft Auto. Becoming feels assembled from an endless bag of Ivers’ tricks, as delightful and deceptive as Mary Poppins’ suitcase. Just when you think you’ve seen the bottom, Ivers pulls out an umbrella. One such surprise is late-album gem “Happy on the Grill,” a tender track sung from the perspective of a frankfurter. “I’m a little hot dog on the grill,” Ivers sings. “Your love is hot, but there’s the thrill.” No matter how sweetly it’s sung, the line is quite masochistic and strange. Ivers’ dark sense of humor is present throughout, particularly in “Conference Call at Four,” a snide send-up of corporate culture that details a very important phone meeting. “Suppose a baby’s born tonight, or a flood hits, or a gun,” Ivers lilts. “You can bet your bottom dollar, Jack, that they’ll all still be on.” It is the spiritual sibling of Harry Nilsson’s “Good Old Desk,” a cheeky reprimand of those who live to work as opposed to the other way around. One gets the sense that Ivers understood both modes of living—and that he knew where his true allegiance lay.

Matthew J. Rolin,Matthew J. Rolin,by: Fred Thomas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc989d80e83ce0008cbb3d8/1:1/w_160/matthewjrolin.jpg,2019-11-15 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/matthew-j-rolin-matthew-j-rolin/,Feeding Tube,"In the 60-some years since John Fahey christened his self-taught approach to fingerstyle guitar “American Primitive,” generations of new players have aspired to the mesh of rustic mystery and technical excellence he brought to his surrealistic country blues. Columbus, Ohio-based guitarist Matthew J. Rolin, however, was already deep into his own take on the sound before he heard of Fahey. Inspired by later refractions of Fahey’s influence rather than the original source, Rolin’s crooked path to solo guitar bypassed the rural affect and music-school stuffiness of many fingerstyle disciples. His work transfigures American Primitive’s backwoods vibes into something decidedly DIY. Rolin’s exploration of folk guitar began in experimental circles. In addition to his solo work, he’s collaborated with Detroit noise band Wolf Eyes and performs alongside dulcimer player Jen Powers in the pensive electro-acoustic improv group Rolin/Powers Duo. His self-titled album is his third proper full-length, joining two slightly more polished sessions that swim amid a Bandcamp page filled with phone-recorded live jams and one-off cassette releases. While his new release is Rolin’s most fully-realized work to date, it maintains his raw first-take energy and unassuming home-recorded production. The moving “One Day I Will Be Free” opens the album with organ drones and field recordings of distant sirens and rushing traffic that give way to a wash of acoustic 12-string. Ringing chord clusters fade in and out of intricate fingerpicking, cycling through phrases of free sprawl and doleful melodic figures that build into an immersive meditation. The song wanders reflectively for 11 and a half minutes, but it comes off less like a contemplative creekside stroll than a haggard walk home after missing the last bus. Much of the album lives in similar emotional territory, tempering joy with frustration. Other than the occasional found sound snippet, a tambourine on “Cold Rooms,” and Jen Gelineau’s violin scratches on finale “Blue Columbus Moon,” Rolin’s solitary guitar is almost always the only instrument. The blare of a passing jet all but overpowers the music in the beginning of “Two Fourteen”; once that interruption fades, a bath of muddy tape delay drowns increasingly discordant playing. The competition of pretty acoustic guitars with noisy disruptions recalls Joan of Arc’s early experiments dismantling folk music. While Rolin hardly qualifies as emo, he shares a distinctly midwestern melancholy. Restless, dissatisfied melodies swaddled in tape hiss make even his brightest compositions sound weary. While the rainy spirit and homespun quality of Rolin’s music separates him from more academic fingerstyle contemporaries, he can’t quite be classified with other unplugged noise dudes, either. There are echoes of Bill Orcutt’s shattered blues in the dizzy rumble of “Rivets” and a stripped-down reading of Ryley Walker’s freefalling astral pop on “Neverendingness,” but Rolin’s songs never ramp up or even attempt to launch. Instead, they trudge steadily forward. A soft argument between hope and defeat runs through the album, and Rolin presents it with the calm resolve of someone who’s probably sat alone with an acoustic guitar as the first of five acts at a basement gig. Unconcerned with virtuosic technique or reincarnating the ghosts of past guitar heroes, Rolin’s overcast instrumentals convey the reality of his own encounters with folk blues.","The Columbus, Ohio-based musician approaches fingerstyle guitar with first-take energy and unassuming home-recorded production.

Hot Pink,Doja Cat,by: Lakin Starling,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc5dfa3ddb62f0008c2dd14/1:1/w_160/hotpink.jpeg,2019-11-14 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/doja-cat-hot-pink/,RCA,"Doja Cat can’t be boxed in. A little over a year after her kooky viral hit “Mooo!,” the 24-year-old rapper-singer and songwriter is still full of personality and endless wordplay. On Hot Pink, her second album and her first full-length since achieving viral fame, Doja cements her voice as the most crucial part of her sound. Depending on the track, her tone can be ultra-soft and chill or peppy, almost frantic as she fires off verses. But it’s her sarcasm and cheek that cut a more dynamic figure in pop music. “PLEASE DO NOT BUY MY ALBUM IF YOU BUY MY ALBUM I WILL PEE IN YOUR LAP,” she wrote alongside a video of her dancing to celebrate the release. She’s in her bag, giving us her kinky, soulful, pop queen, and not-to-be-fucked with sides all at once. Hot Pink runs the gamut of a sound that’s still taking shape. Doja’s equally capable as a rapper and a singer, but it’s her understanding of melody that makes the project flow. On “Like That,” featuring Gucci Mane, Doja weaves easily from rap mode into a whispery chorus with an upbeat R&B groove reminiscent of early-2000s Janet Jackson. It’s the perfect soundtrack for a backyard party. “Rules” captures a more serious—though hardly humorless—mood, pairing eerie old-western bass with Doja’s memorable command: “Play with my pussy, but don’t play with my emotions.” (Both songs were co-written with Dr. Luke; Doja Cat is signed to his imprint Kemosabe.) Other songs, like bubbly opener “Cyber Sex” and the Blink-182-sampling “Bottom Bitch,” explore Doja’s potential as a pop star. Their imaginative videos cast her as a playfully raunchy android or a rebellious, milkshake-throwing skate punk, attention-grabbing themes designed to illustrate distinct musical aesthetics. To some, tracks like these could seem ultra-commercial, but Doja’s earned the right to flex her duality. Her pop songs complement her more intimate music without diluting it. Throughout the rest of the LP, Doja leans into her softness. The dreamy soprano she introduced on 2014’s Purrr! EP cradles the ear like a fluffy pink pillow. It’s when Doja slows down or lightens her bars with her silky rasp that she sounds the clearest. “Shine” dazzles with spurts of tasteful Auto-Tune as she brags about her jewels and her pearly whites in an enchanting blend of rap and breathy lullaby: “What’s that drippin’? No, baby, I’m not cryin’/Baby, that’s my diamonds, everything so vibrant.” It’s not hard to picture her recording a ballad like “Streets” from within an all-pink lair. She’s even more serene on the penultimate “Better Than Me”: Surrounded by slinky, psychedelic guitar, her voice is soothing and slightly coy as she sings to a man who needs a reminder that there’s no one above her. “The best pussy/Comes from wifey,” she coos, elongating every word so he’s sure to hang on. It’s a Doja love song: a tinge of heartache and vulnerability with more than enough confidence to drown out the sadness. Doja’s versatility is a gift, but as varied as the album is, Hot Pink doesn’t feel scattered or semi-rushed like her debut Amala. And though there are moments where a new tone or inflection runs the risk that Doja might be mistaken for someone else, the album’s anchor in her R&B and soul background creates a tender space for her to stack and reveal her layers. Hot Pink doesn’t demand that Doja figure out the totality of her sound right now. It’s a continuous process and her recipe for success is to honor it.","On her first full-length release since her viral breakout, the rapper-singer and songwriter proves that her real gift is her versatility.

No Other,Gene Clark,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dcaf6b95246650008bf7de6/1:1/w_160/noother.jpg,2019-11-14 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gene-clark-no-other/,4AD,"For those that knew him, there seemed to be two Harold Eugene “Gene” Clarks, each contradicting the other. There was Gene Clark the country boy from Tipton, Missouri and Gene Clark the mid-’60s L.A. rock star and frontman for the Byrds. He had the chiseled looks to earn the nickname “Prince Valiant” and looked every bit the ideal frontman, yet suffered crippling stage fright. While his band took sterling Bob Dylan covers to the top of the charts, Clark penned songs that earned the admiration of Dylan himself. He was humble and quiet, yet since he wrote all the Byrds’ early songs, his first royalty check allowed him to wheel around town in a maroon Ferrari while the rest of the band was still broke. His last songwriting credit for the band during their heyday was “Eight Miles High,” and he departed soon after due to a “fear of flying.” Even with his posthumous cult fandom, Clark’s visionary composite of country and rock doesn’t command the same reverence as erstwhile fellow-Byrd Gram Parsons. His solo career always seemed snakebit; his albums under-performed while covers of his songs sent the Eagles and Linda Ronstadt towards superstardom. Yes, the Byrds’s 1973 reunion album on David Geffen’s Asylum Records was an all-out critical and commercial disaster, but it was Gene who emerged from the wreckage with the album’s strongest songs and performances, to the point where Geffen gave him a recording budget of $100,000 to realize his masterpiece in 1974.** For one glorious moment, it seemed that Clark’s solo fortunes had finally turned, and you can hear almost every single one of those dollars poured into No Other, a deliriously opulent, rococo work in a decade filled with them. But when it was time to play the album for Geffen, he took one look at the eight songs on the vinyl and yelled at Clark: “Make a proper fucking album!”, throwing the test pressing in the garbage without even listening to it. No money would go to promote the album and No Other tanked, all but ending Clark’s career. One of the most exquisite spiritual seekers in song, Clark was dead by the age of 46, ravaged by alcohol and heroin. Misunderstood for decades, No Other’s audience slowly emerged. 4AD founder Ivo Watts-Russell revered the album, and supergroup This Mortal Coil (featuring members of Cocteau Twins and Dead Can Dance) covered two Clark songs in the ’80s. In 2014, Beach House, Fleet Foxes, the Walkmen, Grizzly Bear, and Wye Oak convened to perform the album in full. While on the surface it seemed like a curious tribute –those bands’ collective discography has less ornamentation than one song on No Other– the emotional weight of it has resonated with a new generation. “Some of the lyrics [...] just destroy you,” Beach House’s Alex Scally told The New York Times. “There’s something really touching about it.” So it makes sense that this gorgeous and profound reissue of No Other now comes in a lavishly detailed and loving box set on 4AD (Geffen never even bothered to release the album on CD), featuring an 80-page hardbound book, extra sessions, a 5.1 surround mix of the album, and a documentary by Paul Kendall. Perceived at the time as an example of cocaine-fueled excess, No Other was actually written during a reflective, sober, family-oriented time in Clark’s life. Holed up in Mendocino, Clark slowly pieced the songs together while gazing out at the Pacific Ocean then took the songs to L.A. producer Thomas Jefferson Kaye. While his previous album, 1971’s White Light, was a spare and sublime acoustic set, this album featured seemingly infinite layers. By the time you’ve reached the end of the first song, “Life’s Greatest Fool,” you’ve already been walloped by a galloping backbeat, pedal steel, big gospel choirs, and Clark’s voice hitting a previously unheard high register against the backdrop of 16 supporting players. Every moment on the album finds Clark reaching higher and digging deeper, Kaye’s arrangements goading and challenging him at every turn. Clark took cues from the spiritual uplift of Stevie Wonder’s Innervisions and the moral squalor of Rolling Stones’s Goat Head’s Soup; fittingly, No Other explores the dichotomy of mankind’s potential for higher consciousness and the luridness of its lower half. Clark hinted that the foreboding slink of “Silver Raven” was about aliens and flying saucers, while the book reveals it was Gene’s nickname for his wife Carlie’s dancing shoes. The delirious “Strength of Strings” is a tug of war between euphoric highs and crippling depressive states, with Clark and backing choir oscillating between the two extremes “on the cosmic range.” Clark was notorious for never picking up a book, and his ideas of the cosmos and Zen philosophy mostly arose in conversation with friends and filtered down into his songs, but they were profound and deeply felt nonetheless. Throughout, Gene details his struggle to pierce the smog of ‘70s SoCal decadence. The breezy country rock of “The True One” explores the precarity of delusion: “Just walk upstairs and ask/ You’ll be likely directed down/Into the reality/Of what you are doing,” Clark sings, adding: “Sometimes it’s so hard to see/ Which one is the true one.” On the heartbreaking “From A Silver Phial,” his subject is a woman who puts “her faith into the moon and stars” yet finds herself imprisoned in a toxic relationship. By song’s end, her sole means of survival comes from making her master’s “lower self worth while.” Even soul-seeking has its own perils, as on the album’s eight-minute brooding centerpiece, “Some Misunderstanding.” The lyrics stem from a dream that roused Clark in the middle of the night, meditating on interconnectedness and the dual vision of “every expectation/And...what I realize.” As Kaye erects a mountain of keyboards, acoustic guitars, piano, steel guitar, fiddle, and choir, Clark reaches the summit only to come to the understanding: “If you sell your soul/To brighten your role/You might be disappointed/In the lights.” The album ends with “Lady of the North,” a sublime ode to Clark’s wife propelled by piano, pedal steel, and an electronically phased violin line that drifts away like a pink cloud at album’s end. But even amid the joyful sounds, there’s a sorrowful undertone, as if Clark himself doesn’t quite believe in the happiness he’s found. When No Other suffered its ignoble fate, Clark never quite recovered; both his career and marriage crumbled soon after. It’s easy to draw a comparison to frustrated country-rock saints like Parsons or Townes Van Zandt. But as Alex Abramovich wrote in London Review of Books about Clark, these songs “carve their own, canyon-sized niche.” The adoring repackaging covers every facet of the album. No aspect of it goes unexplored, from details on every player to the reason Greta Garbo owned a copy of the album. There are pages devoted to the mansion where the album photo shoot took place, as well as a story explaining how the ruggedly handsome Gene Clark wound up on his own album cover in drag. There are outtakes of all the songs (including a few passes at Clark’s “Train Leaves Here This Morning” that the Eagles had tackled on their first album), but after hundreds of spins of the original, it feels odd to hear these lavish songs strippeddown, like glimpsing the Sistine Chapel through scaffolding or seeing Prince in a pair of sweatpants. The cumulative effect both demystifies No Other while exalting it. Tragically ignored during its time, the album takes its rightful place it alongside Love’s Forever Changes, Judee Sill’s Heart Food, or Van Morrison’s Astral Weeks, bringing together the conflicted, clashing aspects of Gene Clark’s art into a cohesive whole.

2019 EP,Lucy Dacus,by: Peyton Thomas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc5eccb0e83ce0008cbb337/1:1/w_160/2019.jpg,2019-11-14 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lucy-dacus-2019/,Matador,"Nothing ruins Mother’s Day quite like the death of one’s own mother. I suspect that the month of May has been ruined for me forever, that I’ll be averting my eyes from pastel window-dressings every spring until the good Lord takes me. A friend of mine struggles similarly with Halloween. And no holiday is more fraught, in this era of child separation and travel bans, than the Fourth of July. Taylor Swift went so far as to cancel her party this year, citing a “disillusionment with her country.” Fittingly, in the holiday singles of her 2019 EP, Lucy Dacus isn’t throwing a party. She adopts a tone similar to Sufjan Stevens’ yuletide songs, sifting through the kitschy refuse of culture for little sentiments only she knows how to share. Mother’s Day becomes a moment to reflect on and heal from generations of matrilineal trauma. The opening lyric of “My Mother & I”—“My mother hates her body/We share the same outline/She swears she loves mine”—never sounded more gorgeous than when she performed the song alongside her own mother, during a Mother’s Day show in Asheville. On “Fool’s Gold,” New Year’s Eve fades into New Year’s Day, and Dacus sits alone and anxious in the ruins of the party she threw. And the Fourth, her favorite holiday, loses its luster as she asks listeners to consider their own complicity in American atrocities. She treats her weighty subjects with careful concision: short lines, simple phrasing. These are among the best songs she’s ever written. For a host of other holidays, she opts for covers over original compositions, from a wry Halloween rendition of Phil Collins’ “In the Air Tonight”—according to her, “the best eerie bop of all time”—to a swooning, utterly sincere take on the Valentine’s Day standard, “La Vie en Rose,” sung first in French and then in English. Dacus’ singular voice—the warm, honeyed quality of her lower register, especially—sounds even better spilling over French syllables than English ones. Her greatest effort, though, is a punchy romp through Springsteen’s “Dancing in the Dark,” recorded for the Boss’ birthday. In a recent essay titled “The Queerness of Bruce Springsteen,” critic Naomi Gordon-Loebl praised Bruce as something of a dykon, “so practiced and so precise that he might as well have learned it from the oldest lesbian at a gay bar.” There’s a special thrill, then, in hearing one of his standards rendered so lovingly by a queer woman like Dacus, especially given the long years she spent “in denial” about her sexuality. She comes closest to really celebrating when she’s channeling Springsteen; it’s the sound of a young woman who’s wanted to throw her arms around another girl for the longest time finally allowing herself to do so. The collection’s one real dud is a riff on “Last Christmas,” which sounds, to borrow Dacus’s own phrasing, “a tad psychotic.” The fast, furious pace of the arrangement is meant to draw out the song’s long shadows, but it’s got about as much bite as one of those mid-2000s Punk Goes Pop compilations. Still, a single misstep in a year full of superb work is easy to overlook, and her “Last Christmas” is far from the most cringe-worthy offering of the season. Dacus intended 2019 EP as something of a diversion from her usual work, a series of stand-alones intended to flex new musical muscles. Perfect as these songs are for our moment, there’s an unmistakable staying power to them, too.

Mummer Love,Soundwalk CollectivePatti Smith,by: Mina Tavakoli,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc98c7bddb62f0008c2ddfb/1:1/w_160/mummerlove.jpg,2019-11-14 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/soundwalk-collective-patti-smith-mummer-love/,Bella Union,"To the uninitiated, Sufi mysticism can seem vaguely new age-y. It’s a misguided but not unreasonable thought—like voguish strains of body healing therapy, meditation, or most dance music, its raison d'être is that of psychic obliteration. Arch and ascetic, the Sufi aims to dropkick their consciousness into a state of dizzy ecstasy in the name of reaching God’s warm, annihilating glow. The methods of getting there, however, are myriad, and passageways steeply sloped. The Sufi tradition— various as it may be—believes that man is the middle slice in a Venn diagram that junctures divine command and divine creation, and access to either side of the model is earned through sweaty rite. A famous faction of Istanbuli Sufis whirl while chanting, reaching somatic exhaustion by exhaling Quaranic verses as they spin in white linen skirts and tall hats—which, en masse and from a distance, appears like a human-scale vision of whipped meringue—whereas some Syrian, Iraqi, and Ethiopian divisions pray and recite passages for marathon hours to reach what in Arabic is referred to as a state of tawajjuh, or “orientation.” A meeting with the limits of a mind is the only path to egoic liquidation; worthiness, in other words, granted through discipline and self-erasure, is the key to becoming one with something greater. A troupe known as Soundwalk Collective has explored a version of this idea since their conception in 2000. Over the past nineteen years, their belief in the primacy of raw, unmediated connection to a higher source has led them to a series of magpie collaborations in pursuit of the unknowable. There have been elegant payoffs in the past, some more tasteful than others. Now, they’ve assembled a colossus—Philip Glass, a titan of minimalism; Mulatu Astatke, creator of the term ‘Ethio-jazz,’; Patti Smith, polymathic punk ad-libber; and the Sufi group of Sheikh Ibrahim, whose muscular voices suggest the love of God incarnate. Together, they’ve produced Mummer Love, a large, baroque gesture toward the act of what it means to purposefully lose oneself. The second in a triptych the Soundwalk team has termed “Perfect Vision,” Mummer Love summons the usual Sufistic tropes of memory, imagination, hallucination, and desire via incantatory repetition. Recorded onsite in the holy city of Harar, Ethiopia—an epicenter of Sufism in Africa—the field recordings and ambient pickups bear the faint whiff of travelers visiting a foreign place in active quest of truths not found in the usual metropolitan studio. This is not necessarily a bad quality. It’s easy to be caught in the spirit of the squad’s spiral toward rapture. The poetry of Arthur Rimbaud—whose work scans “Oriental Sufi” in spirit—serves as a conduit for their explorations. Rimbaud’s relationship to what he referred to as his “beloved Harar,” and the traces he left there, refract through the voice of Patti Smith, who riffs hard with his words as source text and prayer. At times, it feels as if control is ceded entirely to Smith. Like the title of her praise poem to the poet, the track at the core of the work, and the source of the album’s namesake, the record is a genuinely tender performance of “Mummer Love.” (Mummering, per an old Newfoundlandian tradition, is a wintertime custom that involves participants dressing in disguise, visiting neighboring villages, and imploring strangers to guess their identities.) For decades, Smith has been a perma-mummer of Rimbaud’s, taking elements of his literary and physical corpus—the wide, lambent eyes, the haystack hair, the love of a bestial turn of phrase —and inhabiting them all like a comfortably cut suit. The throughline between them here is direct, and the fit perfect. These are expressions of the same Smith who, early on, traded her muse in Bob Dylan for the French enfant terrible (and, lest one forgets, the title of her indelible “Piss Factory” is an oblique paean to the poet after she earned a swirly for reading a copy of his first collection, Illuminations, on the shift at work); the very Smith who still finds ways to incorporate urine, her favorite abject fascination, as a connective to the man she calls her sage (in the title track: “I will piss in the urinal you pissed in, a young man cursing existence, [...] piss and tears and urine”); the exact Smith whose eccentricities are always controlled, whose metaphors remain clipped and brutish, whose voice still sounds like the tumbling of stone and soil. (Her, again, on rain: “the piss of the angels.”) Smith’s gleam also highlights, perhaps unintentionally, the detachment within the team, who operate less as one, and more like distinct actors in a multi-act theatre performance. The wild pile-up in, say, “Bad Blood,” breeds chaos, not singularity: identifiably, there’s Glass, the Sufi troupe, Astatke’s touch, Smith’s voice, but they never truly merge, only exist in parallel. In some moments, the super-groupy nature of the entire outfit feels precisely like what it is: the sum of its parts.  It frankly works best when the Sufi team stand on their own—take the hugely reverential “Aw Abadir”—but there is something of the plurality within the all-hands performances that feels like ideas swarming, not swimming. An oft-used metaphor in Sufi poetry is one of a raindrop falling into the ocean as an accurate portrait of proper submission to God: once the drop joins water, it cedes its identity as droplet and becomes annihilated into the sea. The mystic’s goal is to surrender the “I,” and instead become one with divine glory. The “I”— or, rather, Smith’s “I,” Collective’s “I”—throughout “Mummer Love” never fully submerges, but remains afloat. Despite the earnestness of their chase for transcendence, it remains a chase. They are too there to dispossess themselves of themselves; too present to yield to something bigger. There are glimmers of this idea, though. “La Maison de Rimbaud” is perhaps the most consummate attempt at spiritual capitulation, as recordings of the adhan (the Islamic call to prayer) bubble alongside Philip Glass on the keys, quiet, airy and sacred. There are sparrows, footfalls, murmurings, ambient chatter, hallucinations of Harar at dusk. “Suddenly,” as Rimbaud may have put it, “dyeing the blueness, delirium, were slow rhythms under the streaking of daylight.”","The experimental troupe gathers Patti Smith, Philip Glass, and Mulatu Astatke for a sometimes-glorious, sometimes-chaotic attempt at attaining spiritual rapture.

Lost Wisdom pt. 2,Mount EerieJulie Doiron,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc1c92a28b1d50008ee92b3/1:1/w_160/lostwisdom.jpg,2019-11-13 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mount-eerie-julie-doiron-lost-wisdom-pt-2/,P.W. Elverum & Sun,"We cling, briefly, to bits of good news, reminders that happiness still exists outside of corrupt power vacuums. The 2018 marriage of songwriter Phil Elverum and actress Michelle Williams felt like some flotsam floating in a sea of prevailing despair. It was an offering of hope for and from people who needed a second chance. A decade ago, Williams’ estranged partner and her daughter’s father, Heath Ledger, died from a drug overdose. And in 2016, Elverum’s wife and his daughter’s mother, Geneviève Castrée, died after a yearlong battle with cancer. The fallout of Castrée’s death—Elverum’s struggles with solo fatherhood, self-identity, and an aversion to artistry in the face of actual crisis—became the thread of two subsequent albums (2017’s A Crow Looked at Me and last year’s Now Only), harrowing explorations of what it means to be the survivor. But on Lost Wisdom pt. 2, Elverum reckons with a different sort of lost love: an impending divorce. Less than a year after their small ceremony, news leaked that Elverum and Williams had separated. These eight songs are as close as either has come to a public explanation. In one sense, Lost Wisdom pt. 2 is the third volume in a lovelorn trilogy that began with A Crow, the album on which Elverum faced off with Castrée’s death as though it were a monster, sitting in the same crowded room. Here he is again, a single man squaring up to impossible sadness, telling us about how many text messages invaded his space when word of the split went public. But this is also the sequel to Lost Wisdom, a 2008 series of duets with patient songwriter Julie Doiron, the great singer of Eric’s Trip. On these songs, she is his foil and confidant, the friend keeping him company as he cycles again through stages of grief. Elverum’s writing on Lost Wisdom is less direct than that of A Crow or Now Only—there are no wrenching tales about the backpack his wife ordered for their daughter before she died, no existential eruptions outside of Skrillex’s tour bus in the Sonoran Desert. It is mostly coded with suggestion and allusion, with Elverum calling Williams not by name but by situation—their vulnerable moment in a bookstore’s second-floor nook, their uncomfortable conversation about growing unease with the need for privacy amid the surveillance of paparazzi. Elverum confesses his wonder-at-first-sight moment with Williams, calling her “a god who walks among us…angelic, miraculous.” He saves the savage details for himself, like when he confesses to showing up at a widow support group unkempt, smelling like salmon, and on the verge of a breakdown. But that kind of specificity is the exception for Lost Wisdom, where raw feelings are shrouded in symbol and simile. Perhaps because the circumstances of Elverum’s last two albums were so extra-ordinary, these sad songs feel, at times, pedestrian in their drama. However exquisitely rendered they may be, and however strange their circumstances may seem, these are breakup songs. When the guitar suddenly conjures Bon Iver’s “For Emma” a minute into “Love Without Possession,” it all seems a tad obvious and bathetic—a flinch from the sting of an ember cast by the bonfire of love, as Elverum’s steadfast metaphor would have it. Doiron’s presence, though, is a welcome balm, warming these cold realizations and offering Elverum a steadying hand for some of the most difficult moments. She trails his voice into the final verse of “Belief,” when the impending breakup reframes his life: “Homelessness enthroned us and all the kids, wind-blown.” And she harmonizes with him for every word of the deathly still “Pink Light,” a beautiful bit of poetry where Elverum wonders if this world will keep spinning without him. What’s more, Doiron’s voice reminds us that there are two parties to this heartbreak, two people contemplating what it means to move past a failed partnership. They deliver the final verse of “Real Lost Wisdom”—an answer to “Real Death” and to the question of what we can learn from colossal hardship—slightly out of sync, like actors split between screens, singing the same epiphanies to one another from different sides of the world. During “Enduring the Waves,” they sing crisscrossing lines, each offering a different take on the same pained realizations. The effect is as vertiginous as heartbreak itself. At one point, Doiron revisits a line from a Galway Kinnell poem that reportedly gave Williams hope after Ledger’s death. “‘The wages of dying is love,’ like the poem says,” she softly offers. “It almost was,” they answer in close harmony. It is a mutual admission that no one here is to blame, a moment of astounding grace for a world always in need of more.

Rod grew up on Gates’ tender street rap, and paid tribute to his idol in a recent interview: “You made me understand people like us could actually go far, people like us could actually do it in the game. Just the fact that you could take your pain and turn up with it.” Rod Wave’s Ghetto Gospel is very much in the mold of the Baton Rouge star’s music; Gates even executive-produced it. Like YoungBoy Never Broke Again, JayDaYoungan, and other Southern rappers belting about their struggles, Rod Wave was amassing millions of plays on YouTube even before Kevin Gates’ involvement. The sound of Ghetto Gospel—bloodletting over somber pianos and country guitars—isn’t far off from earlier singles like “Popular Loner” and “Heart 4 Sale.”But his storytelling has a new clarity, and his voice has developed so much range that I’m surprised he hasn’t already recorded an NPR Tiny Desk. The heaviest single on the album is “Close Enough to Hurt,” touching on the PTSD that he’s mentioned on-record before. On “Poison,” he digs deep to tell tales of the terrors that keep him up at night. “Late at night, I been roaming, I ain’t getting no sleep/It’s hard to stay focused when that pain running deep,” he wails. Ghetto Gospel features two Gates collaborations. These moments feel like Gates passing the torch in real time, as Rod Wave howls like he’s stuck in the begging-for-love-in-the-rain era of ’90s R&B: “When I think about my past, that shit give me chills.” Compared with Gates, Rod’s hooks are glossy, but he can also strip his music down, like the drumless, acoustic guitar-heavy “Chip on my Shoulder,” that sounds like his street spin on a country-pop record. Rod is at the forefront of an unofficial subgenre of rap called  “pain music,” and it’s been developing since the days of Boosie and Webbie. Artists working in this vein have also found a way to integrate country and pop sounds into their hip-hop in a way that’s considerably less performative than that song about horses. What’s next is a superstar. Numbers-wise the answer is YoungBoy Never Broke Again, though legal troubles will always hold him back. And Kevin Gates is now a thirty-something that’s sliding into a Gucci Mane-like role. Rod Wave may or may not be that person. If Ghetto Gospel makes anything clear, it’s that nobody sings about their pain like him.","The Floridian singer-rapper delivers tender anthems about his pain and inner demons on his debut LP, executive produced by Kevin Gates.

Thousand Knives of Ryuichi Sakamoto,Ryuichi Sakamoto,by: Daniel Martin-McCormick,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc1b19f70cbce00082b8bcd/1:1/w_160/thousandknives.png,2019-11-13 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ryuichi-sakamoto-thousand-knives-of-ryuichi-sakamoto/,Wewantsounds,"By the time 1978 rolled around, electronic music was old hat. Switched On Bach had hit shelves a decade earlier, Tangerine Dream had already made their best work, and Kraftwerk had cruised the Trans Europe Express. The Minimoog, released in 1971, no longer sounded so novel, and genre-defining pieces of gear like the TR-808, SP-1200, and DX7 were still a few years off. Punk rock, meanwhile, was laying waste to prog rock’s noodly, keyboard-augmented excesses. One could be forgiven, nearing the dawn of the 1980s, for dismissing all the bleeps and bloops as just a fad. “I really don’t see it” said Lester Bangs. “A lot of these synthesizer groups… Kraftwek did it a lot better a half decade ago.” Perhaps not seeing it was the point: Many of electronic music’s greatest innovations occurred in the shadows, through misuse, amateurism, or accident. Phuture invented acid house when they stumbled upon design quirks in Roland’s TB-303; hip-hop was born at a block party; and, in 1978, one of electronic music’s most distinctive voices got his start in a parody group. At the time, Ryuichi Sakamoto was a respected session musician in Japan, working his way through the industry, when he was recruited by Haruomi Hosono for a one-off album of electronic exotica. The point was to send up the ridiculous orientalism peddled by artists like Les Baxter, reclaiming a fanciful Western take on the far East. The result was the historic self-titled debut album from Yellow Magic Orchestra. But before it was released, Sakamoto slipped out an album of his own: Thousand Knives of Ryuichi Sakamoto. Though the record was quickly eclipsed by his band’s smash success, this reissue serves to reintroduce the world to an overlooked gem by a now canonical voice. As with all of Sakamoto’s work, there’s no distinction between pop and experimentalism. Nearly a decade into his career as a sideman, Sakamoto’s musical fluency is in full effect here. Each of Thousand Knives’ six pieces swerves with a deft touch through complex arrangements, playful voicings, and cheeky key changes. The title track opens with a reading of a poem through a haunting vocoder, drifting with gentle restraint in a field of silence. The mood is somber and yearning, but then the music locks in, and it’s a fusion-tinged instrumental whose main theme is just a little too heavy for an elevator ride. One can imagine the cosmic-disco DJ Daniele Baldelli’s ears perking up—the chugging tempo and twisting atmosphere were a perfect match for the sound he was pioneering in Italy at that time. And, perhaps responding to the disco craze well underway, Sakamoto also lets the track run long. At nearly 10 minutes, his opening salvo is a slo-mo barnburner soaked in guitar solos, breezy melodic flourishes, and gloopy drums. It’s wonderful. But then “Island of Woods” changes course. A collage of nature sounds, atonal synthesizer squiggles, and new-age flourishes, it answers the ebullient fizz of “Thousand Knives” with a funky take on musique concrete. What stands out is how well the two songs mesh. One senses an intuitive bond—Sakamoto works less in contrasts than in connections. As with Can before him, there’s no friction between dancefloor groove and laboratory explorations. YMO’s exotica remains in full effect on Thousand Knives; listeners with an allergy to kitsch perhaps need not waste their time. But it’s a winking kitsch, a garish beauty. “Plastic Bamboo” takes supreme delight in a melody that seems best serves for a farcical chase scene. Though exquisitely crafted, it’s silly as hell. The closing song’s title, “The End of Asia,” evokes a number of interpretations: Japan had not so long ago been devastated by the atomic bomb. The influx of the West was radically changing society, and in Japan the economy was exploding, thanks to the surge of technological production that provided many of the instruments Sakamoto used on Thousand Knives. Then again, in line with YMO’s inversion of exotica, perhaps “The End of Asia” refers to the death of a hazy, romantic dream of the Orient. The song, syrupy and effervescent, reprises the shredding guitar from the album’s opening. Is it serious work or a sweet confection? Sakamoto gets to have it both ways. In a recent interview, he says, “At that time, my view of technology was still very positive —I believed in technology, even though I was looking for a dark future.” Thousand Knives foregrounds blinding light, but it’s the subtly traced shadows that give the album its enduring depth.

Leaving Meaning,Swans,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db1d8f6fd8a1f0009ad5923/1:1/w_160/leavingmeaning.jpg,2019-11-13 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/swans-leaving-meaning/,Young GodMute,"In 2017, Michael Gira dissolved Swans, putting an end to its most stable configuration in 35 years of the post-punk brutalists’ on-again, off-again existence. It wasn’t the first time that Gira had started over. He first did it in 1997, after a 15-year stretch of constant evolution in which Swans grew from atonal bloodlust worshippers (Filth) to blissed-out neo-folkies (The Burning World) to self-flagellating maximalists (The Great Annihilator). Titling the band’s posthumous 1998 live album Swans Are Dead was Gira’s way of laying a boulder on the lid of the tomb—at least until 2010, when, after a decade at the helm of his psych-folk project Angels of Light, he rolled back the stone and brought Swans back to life. Now, on his first Swans album since 2016’s The Glowing Man, Gira has reshuffled the deck once again. Players from throughout his various projects’ histories have rejoined him here, including several of Angels of Light’s core members (Christoph Hahn, Dana Schechter, Cassis Staudt, Larry Mullins) and pretty much the entire recent Swans lineup. As has frequently been the case over the years, Gira has swelled the group’s ranks with guest players: organist Anna von Hausswolff and her sister Maria; noise musician Ben Frost; shock-headed former street harpist and neo-cabaret singer Baby Dee; Australian improvising trio the Necks. (The latter, praised for their minimalistic attention to detail, make for an unexpected fit: When it comes to sustaining a single repetitive groove for endurance-testing lengths, the Necks are the pianissimo yin to Swans’ pile-driving yang.) The chief difference between the recently departed Swans and their reincarnation here boils down mainly to method. Where heavy touring turned Swans’ 2010-2017 incarnation into something like a living, breathing organism—in which the band’s pummeling, long-form concert performances informed the shape of successive studio recordings, and vice versa—for Leaving Meaning Gira returned to his role as a producer, ringleader, and foreman, laying down basic tracks on his own and then inviting his contributors to fill in the blanks as they best saw fit. Sonically, the album backs away from the dirge-rock rave-ups that defined the group’s last four albums. That’s a welcome development: By The Glowing Man, a record that often seemed intent upon dwarfing the horizon itself, they were running out of new things to say on such a scale. Leaving Meaning is shorter and simpler. Where Swans’ last three albums were all two-hour behemoths, this one clocks in at a relatively manageable 93 minutes, and only one song breaks the 12-minute mark—a significant departure from their recent habit of digging in for 20 or 30 minutes at a time. The new record is sweeter, too, shifting its focus from raging catharsis to eye-widening beauty. Instead of the hammer-on-anvil force of recent albums, the largely acoustic palette leans toward plucked strings, brushed percussion, and sighing choirs. At least two songs are in an uncharacteristically chipper major key, and one of them (the radiant “What Is This?”) summons a sparkling beatitude reminiscent of Cocteau Twins’ Heaven or Las Vegas. The gorgeous title track is a highlight. It’s one of two featuring the Necks’ ruminative piano-and-contrabass improvisations, and while Gira’s songwriting gravitates toward his usual contradictions (“I can be it/But not feel it/I can steal it/But not keep it/I can break it/But not heal it”), he sounds uncharacteristically calm, purring like an old cat in a bookstore window. He’s as charismatic a ranter as they come, but to hear him so sedate makes for a nice change. “Amnesia,” which first appeared in radically different form on 1992’s Love of Life, here becomes a fingerpicked ambient waltz for strings, tympani, and choir. And when he digs into the barrel-chested depths of his register on songs like the tender, elegiac “Annaline,” he evokes the kind of weary tragedy endemic to sad drunks and wastrels. As a lyricist, Gira has always conveyed an irreparable brokenness, and in songs like this one—“Let’s burn in a fire/Let’s clean what is true” he groans—he embodies the image of a fallen man. (Rape allegations against Gira—denied by him, but never retracted by his accuser—will forever draw an uncomfortable shadow beneath Gira’s portraits of repentant sinners.) It’s not all so gentle or so gossamer. “The Hanging Man” and “Some New Things” both reprise the pounding rave-ups of the band’s recent records and live shows, while the overdubbed chants and chain-gang rhythm of the closing “My Phantom Limb” recall the agonies of the Greed/Holy Money years. And as always, the apocalypse hangs heavy over songs braided from the strands of Gira’s holy trinity: sex, death, and the infinite. The lyrical themes here are all familiar by now: Lovers claw at each other, seeking self-annihilation. Salvation is an illusion. Negation is the only certainty. “The Nub,” the other song with the Necks’ at its center, seems at first to be about sexual pleasure. But as it drifts and droops, and Baby Dee sings of krill, bleached fluid, and putrefying flesh, the song comes to resemble an audio portrait of a whale fall. Scavengers may feed on the decomposing meat for months; the skeleton then becomes a source of sustenance to mussels, clams, and microbes for years or even decades to come. Whether or not it’s what Gira had in mind, this ruined, rotting grandeur is a fitting metaphor for Swans’ ongoing body of work. Swans died so that new life may flourish.

Sea of Worry,Have a Nice Life,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc97deba972690008404689/1:1/w_160/seaofworry.jpg,2019-11-12 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/have-a-nice-life-sea-of-worry/,The Flenser,"Dan Barrett and Tim Macuga live double lives. To a rabid subset of the notorious 4chan forum /mu/, they are the mysterious co-founders of Have a Nice Life, whose debut record, 2008’s foreboding, gauzy Deathconsciousness, is regarded as beyond reproach; its accompanying 70-page manifesto has since begot reams of stoned hermeneutics. But man cannot survive on 4chan fame alone; Barrett and Macuga have day jobs, and day lives, with families and children who might be less enamored by the creation myths of Christian cults. Their follow up, 2014’s The Unnatural World, raised uneasy questions about settling into the tedium of adulthood. Five years later, Sea of Worry presents disquieting answers. Have a Nice Life’s early work had a tendency to shape-shift, presenting as garage rock on one track only to unravel into ambient noise on the next. On Sea of Worry, these shifts are more abrupt; the pace of the record suffers as a result. The momentum of the triumphant, shout-along choruses on “Sea of Worry” is flatlined by “Dracula Bells,” a track rendered exhaustingly slow by awkward rhythmic shifts, multiple melodic tangents, and a painful dash of free jazz. It’s nearly grating enough to make a new listener pull the plug altogether, which would be a shame—Sea of Worry finds the band honing in on the metallic sheen of goth rock, a subgenre consistently in the mix on previous records but never given its due. With a propulsive bassline that gives way to shimmering guitars, “Science Beat” sounds like “Everybody Wants to Rule the World” as helmed by Pere Ubu’s David Thomas, Barrett’s atonal sing-speaking cutting through the blinding brightness. “Lords of Tresserhorn” plays with the same elements—twinkling synths, thrumming bass, clipped vocals—but simmers them slowly, not so much building to a chorus as painting layers of scenery. But these ambitious experiments are paired with concessions to an active fanbase that is terrified of change. Two of the album’s seven tracks are re-recordings of demos already familiar to diehards, padding a relatively short record with old material. “Trespassers W,” originally a brooding post-punk love song with muffled vocals and a bassline ripped from “Transmission,” justifies its inclusion with a full-band remake. The new version represents what online fans feared for the band, with crunchy, overdriven guitar and full-throated yelps that are more indebted to Superchunk than Bauhaus. But the song benefits from the crisper recording, which highlights impressive chord changes and structural twists that were previously buried. “Destinos,” with a lengthy sample of a sermon about the evils of Satan and Hell, is more similar to its original version; as a closer, it makes a disappointingly safe choice for a dramatic exit. As Have a Nice Life learn to embrace professional studio recordings and bigger audiences, perhaps the band’s most defining quality will prove to be its lyrics, a potent expression of what one might call dad rage. Sea of Worry addresses the anxieties of adulthood with vengeful indignation. “I opted out by never really opting in,” they sing on the title track, finding simultaneous freedom and sadness in the idea. But the sharpest commentary on the nihilism of total independence comes from “Lords of Tresserhorn”: “I can stay up late whenever I want,” Barrett sings, “but other than that, it’s nothing like I thought. I guess I thought I’d know what I’m doing by now, but I know nothing.” Where Matt Berninger might be ruefully fondling his argyle sweaters, Have a Nice Life eyes revolution: “I am mortgaged to an irrational thought: that we are always on top, and nothing will ever go wrong.” After two records about death, Macuga and Barrett have landed on something truly terrifying: finding oneself, inexplicably, still alive.

A Fossil Begins to Bray,Hiro Kone,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc59d6d0e83ce0008cbb330/1:1/w_160/hirokone.jpg,2019-11-12 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hiro-kone-a-fossil-begins-to-bray/,Dais,"Nicky Mao knows her way around a modular synthesizer, but she isn’t a techno person. She doesn’t really come from an electronic music background, either. A San Francisco native who also spent significant chunks of time in Hong Kong, Mao came of age in the Bay Area punk and DIY scene, but it wasn’t until she moved to New York in 2001 that she fully engaged with electronic music. Even then, it wasn’t dance music that caught Mao’s ear; instead she gravitated toward the dissonant sonics of groups like Gang Gang Dance and Black Dice. Nearly 20 years later, Mao still likes aural discord, but now she’s the one manipulating the machines. As Hiro Kone, she’s spent the bulk of this decade honing her craft, repeatedly delivering passionate, politically charged bursts of crunching electronics while gradually moving from rudimentary synth and drum-machine experiments into the arcane realm of modular synthesis. (That particular affinity is something Mao picked up in part from frequent collaborator and former Coil member Drew McDowall; the two teamed up on a 2018 EP called The Ghost of Georges Bataille.) Mao’s latest album, A Fossil Begins to Bray, continues that evolution, yet it also feels like the start of something new. Mao has upped her production game to a point where it no longer sounds like she’s experimenting. The music here is determined, confident, and occasionally downright threatening. Mao has never been shy about her politics—a casual browse through her Twitter feed might turn up thoughts on the BDS movement, Black Lives Matter, wealth inequality, American militarism, police brutality, or a number of other hot-button progressive topics—but A Fossil Begins to Bray feels like the first time that her rage and her dread have been fully harnessed in her music. The LP is the best thing she’s done. A Fossil Begins to Bray has been billed as a rumination on absence, and more specifically its power in the face of what Mao describes as a “time of looming and unrelenting techno-fascism.” Faced with a world that’s full of noise, much of it downright terrifying, many artists have chosen to embrace chaos or indulge in full-blown escapism. Mao, however, has gone in a different direction, stripping her work down to the studs and leaving only a sturdy, focused framework that packs a hell of a wallop. That wallop hits especially hard on “Fabrication of Silence,” a track that pairs sternum-rattling bass drops with ominously looming synth oscillations and razor-sharp sound design. “Feed My Ancestors” is another hard-hitting tune, its booming kicks veering into techno territory as slithering static and moody pads add a palpable sense of fear and apprehension. There’s a subtle ferocity to these tracks, yet Mao never lets the music run wild. A Fossil Begins to Bray may be menacing, but the album’s composure never falters. Much of this can be credited to Mao’s extreme attention to detail. The droning “Iahklu” is a wonderfully grim exercise in controlled chaos; the unintelligible vocal snippets are a particularly unnerving touch. The album’s most technically accomplished offering is probably “Submerged Dragon,” which lives up to its imposing title. Creeping sheets of static and distortion stand in for the creature’s sinister breathing, which intermittently erupts into ferocious blasts of terrifying, Lightning Bolt-esque noise. In the hands of a novice, it would be easy for a track like this to fall flat, but Mao has clearly gotten to a point where her electronics have become a natural extension of her artistic vision. At times, that vision becomes more cinematic. The brooding “A Fossil Begins to Bray” feels like the soundtrack to the surveillance state, its lurching synths, wispy waves of static, and mournful, vaguely North African strings steadily sweeping back and forth across the song’s churning underbelly. “Akoluthic Phase” takes a similarly widescreen approach, spiraling skyward in a flurry of thundering rhythms and dark synth crescendos. The magic of this album may be in its details, but A Fossil Begins to Bray certainly isn’t afraid of going big. Mao’s alias is an Iroquois phrase that roughly translates to “I have spoken.” It’s a fitting moniker for an artist as outspoken as she is, but on A Fossil Begins to Bray, her music finally matches the intensity of her message. Mao’s success here stems from her ability to block out excess noise, focus on what’s important, and leave the rest on the cutting-room floor. Absence may have been her inspiration, but A Fossil Begins to Bray is all about essence.

Own Pace,Medhane,by: Matthew Strauss,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc97c83a972690008404686/1:1/w_160/IMG_3613.jpg,2019-11-12 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/medhane-own-pace/,self-released,"Medhane repeats himself, making his unhurried way through his verses and remaining intent on humble pursuits—fiscal and spiritual comfort, avoiding distractions and vices, snakes or serpents, he might say. If he’s focused on his delivery, maybe then you’ll really hear and understand him. And so he repeats; that’s how Medhane works. The young Brooklyn rapper is a friend and collaborator of Earl Sweatshirt and MIKE, and, like his peers, he makes his voice heard by lowering it. On his first solo full-length, he sounds stern but forgiving, his buttery flow gliding atop dampened soul samples. Medhane’s work is largely about determination, an attribute you can hear reflected in the amelodic nature of his rapping, where each line moves with a similar tempo, not too fast, not too slow. There’s also a softness to Medhane’s writing that complements the bluntness of his pacing. He writes in unsentimental broad strokes, making his lyrics feel like synecdoches for all living. “I know what I need,” he says on “On Me,” keeping the thought internal. Interiority is everything to Medhane. His deepest insights arrive with the simplest combination of words. “Taking small steps/Trippin’, trippin’, I ain’t fall yet,” he says on “Smallsteps,” calmly, as if the utterance is itself part of his undetermined journey to somewhere, a place he can’t yet envision but will continue striving toward. He offers variations on progress, steady pacing, hope, and gratitude. “Changes and growth all I know,” goes another line, showing Medhane ready to embrace any turmoil or spoils ahead. Medhane’s tone has changed just a bit since last year’s Ba Suba, Ak Jamm EP. On the brief, 13-minute release, Medhane spoke more about hard work and gain, like he couldn’t look up from the grind. The beats were more chaotic. The new project has a murmuring slickness, a mantric quality. “Remembering the times I couldn’t describe what’s inside,” he raps on “Affirmation #1.” Own Pace is Medhane’s non-stop constant trip to the center of his inner self, filled with the imperceptible detours and contours of the mind.","The young Earl Sweatshirt and MIKE collaborator makes deeply internal and contemplative rap.

Down in Jamaica – 40 Years of VP Records,Various Artists,by: Wayne Marshall,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc5a02419422100082f9686/1:1/w_160/jamaica.jpg,2019-11-12 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-down-in-jamaica-40-years-of-vp-records/,VP,"Celebrating 40 years of growth in a fickle, fast-moving industry, VP Records’ Down in Jamaica draws from the label’s practically unrivaled catalog to honor the story of Chinese-Jamaican entrepreneurs Vincent and Patricia Chin, whose trajectory was remarkably synonymous with that of dancehall reggae itself. Launched from an ice-cream parlor in downtown Kingston, the Chins’ business (originally called Randy’s Records) grew from a one-stop shop for local wax into a bustling recording studio, the world’s largest independent reggae label, and a major arm of the global reggae industry, after the Chins relocated to Jamaica, Queens, in the late 1970s and turned their focus to foreign markets. Over the years, VP became the premier international distributor of Jamaican music, issuing hit singles, Grammy-winning albums, and such popular compilation series as Strictly the Best, Reggae Gold, and Riddim Driven. Few labels have played so central a role in reggae’s modern era, documenting the rise of rapping deejays and digital riddims, and in the 21st century VP has continued to grow, acquiring onetime international rival Greensleeves in 2008 and building a catalog that includes the lion’s share of dancehall hits among its 25,000 sound recordings. As such, a 40th anniversary compilation from VP offers a vital a representation of Jamaican popular music since the late ’70s.  This particular selection is held together by its depiction of dancehall’s development, the genre’s relationship to the “roots and culture” scene, and the perseverance of reggae as a national feeling, style, and brand. More than a greatest-hits collection based on data or settled narrative, the compilation aims for a well-rounded portrait of VP’s role in reggae history. Still, hits abound. Nearly every song was a big tune in Jamaica during its day and remains a perennial standard wherever reggae is played. Those unfamiliar with dancehall reggae will find a fine introduction in the 82 tracks spread across four CDs, while longtime listeners will revel in the number of cherished songs. For devotees, the compilation also includes four 12"" and four 7"" records featuring re-pressed versions of obscure 12"" “disco mixes” from the late ’70s along with unique mixes of dub classics like the Congos’ “Fisher Man,” produced by Lee “Scratch” Perry, whose Upsetter label was distributed by VP. Such deluxe sets are often over-the-top grabs at the collectors’ market, but for a label that has spanned the vinyl to digital age (and back), the multi-format throwback vibes seem apt. While some amount of in-house production by the Chins and their sons added to the label’s stockpile, because VP was a reliable one-stop for Jamaican producers, they licensed, manufactured, and distributed many of the biggest songs coming out of Kingston’s many studios, including tracks by all of the most successful and influential producers of the last few decades: Steely & Clevie, Gussie Clarke, Philip “Fatis” Burrell, Bobby “Digital” Dixon, Dean Fraser. Among others, VP cultivated an ongoing partnership with notorious producer Henry “Junjo” Lawes in the early 1980s, distributing the massive dancehall hits on his Volcano imprint to the wider world, with audible consequences for reggae, hip-hop, and pop. The collaboration with Junjo gave rise to tunes and riddims that echo across popular music to this day. Of the many collected here, two of them feature what has come to be called the “Diseases” riddim, after Michigan & Smiley’s catchy brimstone chant of the same name about women wearing trousers (not good, in their view) and elephantiasis (also not good). On that song, the duo inveighs over bare, bouncy dub-funk by Junjo’s house band the Roots Radics—tight, spare drums, driving bass, and a jangly guitar riff that, just a few years later, would add rudeboy edge to Boogie Down Productions’ “Remix for P Is Free” and, even later, lend poignancy to Black Star’s elegiac “Definition.” Doing his own inimitable thing on a customized flip of the riddim, Yellowman offers up one of the stickiest earworms of all time on “Zungguzungguguzungguzeng.” First crossing into hip-hop as one of BDP’s weaponized reggae references, the chorus melody has since turned up in over 60 other recordings, spanning reggae, hip-hop, rock, and electronic music, most recently rearing its head in Lizzo’s “Truth Hurts” and Megan Thee Stallion’s “Ride or Die.” (The compilation includes other worthy riddim pairings, like Wayne Wonder and Bounty Killer on Lenky’s iconic “Diwali,” and Jah Cure and T.O.K. taking turns on Don Corleon’s “Drop Leaf.”) While the collection represents the dancehall era’s dazzling search for new sounds, from dubbed-out live bands to digital riddims to post-millennial pop crossover, the musical through line that unites it all is the persistence of the roots reggae sound and its righteous messaging. This thread ties together the Wailing Souls bearing witness on “Fire House Rock” in the early ’80s; protests of hypocrisy in VC’s turn-of-the-millennium “By His Deeds”; and the past decade’s “new roots” of Jah9, Chronixx, and Raging Fyah. Banner-bearing revivalists such as Garnet Silk, Buju Banton, and Luciano all bring their booming voices to the project of reinfusing dancehall with Rastafarian ideals, while roots reggae’s trademark upbeat bounce gives lift to a set of sweet songs about love and heartbreak, including Junior Kelly’s “Love So Nice,” Beres Hammond’s “Rockaway,” Sizzla’s “Just One of Those Days” and Tarrus Riley’s “She’s Royal.” (On the other hand, the likes of Ninjaman, Cutty Ranks, Spragga Benz, and Mavado assure some “badman” representation, while Sanchez, Sean Paul, and Gyptian sing of love in more secular terms.) Although the resilience of roots against a restless dancehall backdrop emerges as the central theme, the collection also touches upon the wider variety of music VP has issued, including soca and R&B fusions. (VP’s Gold Disc imprint even released early records by proto-reggaetonero El General in the early 1990s, though none appear here.) These and other recent productions round things out, in a sense, but they can seem slight next to dozens of time-honored dancehall anthems. The relative scarcity of women artists also calls attention to the challenge of doing justice to a wide swath of Jamaican music while reflecting the established canon. Although the ratio improves over the last two decades of releases—nearly one-third of the artists on the fourth disc are women, while only four appear on the first three discs—this feels like a missed opportunity.

In the Court of the Crimson King (50th Anniversary),King Crimson,by: Ryan Reed,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc05342d8e09f00087f62d6/1:1/w_160/kingcrimson.jpg,2019-11-11 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/king-crimson-in-the-court-of-the-crimson-king-50th-anniversary/,DGM,"It’s all there in the Schizoid Man’s face. Barry Godber’s cover art—a man mid-scream, nostrils flared, gaze fixed on a horror we can’t see—teases a manic, transformative head trip. In the Court of the Crimson King marks a vast fault line in the geology of rock music, refining a nascent genre into a pinnacle of the progressive rock form. The Moody Blues’ symphonic grandeur, Brian Wilson’s expansive production, the psychedelic experiments of Pink Floyd and the Beatles—these are some of prog’s essential building blocks. But with their first record, King Crimson shaped those pieces into a monument, wielding a sorcery unduplicated in the five decades since. The band summoned that collective force—a hybrid of menacing rock, classical sophistication, pastoral psychedelia, and free-jazz mania—quickly, almost instinctively, guided by what guitarist Robert Fripp has called “the presence of the Good Fairy.” The original Crimson lineup emerged from the ashes of short-lived psych-pop act Giles, Giles and Fripp in January 1969, with guitarist Fripp and drummer Michael Giles linking up with bassist-singer Greg Lake (future frontman of prog juggernaut Emerson, Lake & Palmer), keyboardist-woodwind player Ian McDonald, and lyricist Peter Sinfield. The quintet assembled in a cramped rehearsal space in London’s Hammersmith district, working on songs for three months before their proper live debut at the city’s Speakeasy club. By that summer, they’d even made a fan of Jimi Hendrix, who showed up for their gig at the Revolution Club and, as Fripp has frequently recalled, exclaimed, “This is the best group in the world!” Within months, the band had developed into a formidable live act—even supporting the Rolling Stones at Hyde Park in July. But they were struggling in the studio, failing to make progress during two sessions with Moody Blues producer Tony Clarke. In a move equal parts brave and absurd (given Clarke’s high profile at the time), they decided to end that collaboration and helm their own material: They reconvened at London’s Wessex studio, armed with a handful of songs worthy of Hendrix’s standing ovation. Like Godber’s cover image, much of their music was designed to provoke and scare. “It’s meant to be frightening,” an unidentified band member notes during the in-studio chatter of “Wind Session,” a newly mixed bonus track on Crimson King’s lavish 50th Anniversary reissue. In that previously issued leftover, the musicians workshop the discordant sci-fi woodwind noises that kick-start “21st Century Schizoid Man,” clustering exhalations into what sounds like TV static and future dial-up modems. After much gentlemanly discussion, they arrive at suitably “diabolical sounds.” What follows “Schizoid Man”’s airy intro is even more jolting: seven minutes of nuclear proto-metal riffs, stuttering jazz-rock drum fills, wailing alto saxophone, and Lake’s distorted shriek—capped off with the paranoid prophecies of Sinfield, who used images of burning politicians and starving children to survey the destruction of the Vietnam War. While King Crimson later evolved through a series of lineups under Fripp’s mysterious guidance, they achieved a rare level of creative intimacy on their debut. The four musicians composed “Schizoid Man” as a unit, practically breathing down each other’s necks in their rehearsal spot: They reacted to each other’s riffs and arrangements in real time, weaving old ideas (McDonald’s strutting sax section, lifted from a tune he wrote during his days in the Army jazz band, “Three Score and Four”) into new ones (Lake’s heavy main riff, countered by McDonald’s chromatic, ascending lick). The final version of that song, which Kanye West famously sampled for his 2010 single “Power,” would be enough to cement King Crimson’s legend. And the 50th Anniversary edition offers a revelatory alternate version, building from a recently discovered backing track recorded in June 1969 during the aborted Clarke session at Morgan Studios. It’s a mutant of old and new, mingling 50-year-old parts (Giles’ violently demented kit-bashing, Lake’s finished vocal from the official LP) with a pair of modern-day overdubs (current members Mel Collins and Jakko Jakszyk doubling placeholder sax and guitar solos, respectively, with stereo-panned lines). King Crimson have reissued In the Court of the Crimson King so many times, the album’s Discogs entry boasts more listings than a phone book. And considering most fans shelled out for the 40th Anniversary set one decade ago, this 3-CD/Blu-Ray is a tough sell for anyone who can’t name all of the band’s three present-day drummers. If blindfolded, most fans would have trouble distinguishing between Steven Wilson’s new stereo mix and the original they know by heart. And since the vaults have been mostly cleared over the years, the package’s real value boils down to a handful of unreleased gems. The centerpiece is a mostly a capella rendition of the morose ballad “Epitaph,” underscoring the wide dynamic range of Lake’s voice. Building from a fragile croon to a crackling, full-throated roar, it’s one of prog’s canonical performances. Other bonus tracks are revealing but lack replay value—like the instrumental, bare-bones version of closing epic “The Court of the Crimson King.” (Listening to this track without the wordless vocal theme or the Grand Canyon-sized mellotron is physically painful, though intriguing as an in-progress footnote.) There’s also a faster alternate take of “Moonchild,” the album’s experimental descent into psychedelic texture and free improvisation—the sorta thing you’ll savor a couple times out of collector’s guilt but probably forget about within a week. The original LP itself is enough, and always will be: Its fingerprint is so distinct that even imitators—including the entire prog-metal movement—can’t even accidentally sound like it. “You must have gathered it’s good,” the Who’s Pete Townshend wrote in a half-page advertisement promoting Crimson King. “But in some ways too good too soon if that’s possible.” He was right in a practical sense: King Crimson’s jarring upward velocity could only carry them so far. The band crumbled after their first U.S. tour, leaving Fripp to rebuild as their de-facto maestro—restructuring the line-up again and again in search of “Good Fairy” dust. They found it, of course: Many of their subsequent records (the percussive pummel of 1973’s Larks’ Tongues in Aspic, the interlocking guitars and new wave sheen of 1981’s Discipline) glimpsed galaxies of new ideas as Fripp endlessly re-tooled his vision. But all roads branch out from the mighty Court.

Analog Fluids of Sonic Black Holes,Moor Mother,by: Adlan Jackson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc1ac60e15e890008907653/1:1/w_160/analogfluids.jpg,2019-11-11 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/moor-mother-analog-fluids-of-sonic-black-holes/,Don Giovanni,"The Philadelphia poet and musician Camae Ayewa, as Moor Mother, seems to be on a mission to give form to our collective grief. Death is so big, and Black deaths are rendered so small, that it leaves a remainder, a trace that refuses to simply disappear. It lives within us, it builds, it demands release. Conjuring this rage, ignored but implacable, Moor Mother makes music that feels halfway between necromancy and warning. In comparison to 2016’s Fetish Bones, Analog Fluids of Sonic Black Holes, is a refinement. The archival tapes appear again: Moor Mother tracks awaken the spirituals, poems and spoken words of mostly anonymous Black souls as wraiths, primed for revenge. In “Shadowgrams,” she spits, “they have killed our heroes and we forget their names.” These songs are a rejoinder to that erasure, and a proposed antidote to an anti-Black capitalism that insists cultural debts be forgotten. The sound is as omnivorous as it is unforgiving, produced by Ayewa herself alongside King Britt and noise musician Mental Jewelry, with whom Ayewa collaborated on a joint EP in 2017. The collaborators are largely from Philly, yet Analog Fluids arrives at a moment when, in the cities of the northeast, ideological connections are becoming aesthetic ones. Hardcore, punk, noise and hip-hop are being compressed into a smear. A through-line runs from Philadelphia to New Brunswick and Brooklyn, uniting genres under the boots of unrelenting gentrification, intractable corporate power and unheard anger. Whether rapped or sung, played on digital or analog instruments, the sound is of heads hitting concrete. Moor Mother is never satisfied to do anything other than confront. Less abrasive textures—strings, a tinny vocal sample, a wandering trumpet—are always distant, and instantly overwhelmed by Moor Mother’s vocal delivery, grim and booming. Her lyrics seethe with revelatory clarity: “I don’t believe in lies, I don’t believe in truth/I need their head as proof,” she seethes on ""After Images."" Calm arrives only in the closing track “The Passing of Time,” produced by Abstract Black and featuring the sweet vocals of Brazilian singer Juçara Marçal. But over this reverie, Moor Mother recites a steely, bitter truth: “My grandmama, my great-grandmama, my great-great-grandmama, they picked so much cotton they saved the world.” Ayewa includes Moor Mother in her ongoing collaboration with fellow Philadelphia artist Rasheedah Phillips, Black Quantum Futurism, which Ayewa has called “a new language of healing, memory and justice that can be transmitted and used as a technology.”# Analog Fluids of Sonic Black Holes, likewise is an afrofuturism, or maybe an afro-inevitability. This is the part of healing that looks into the gaping wounds. “The end is happening and it keeps happening, and you keep looking at the clock as if time ever protected you,” Ayewa says in “Shadowgrams,” and Analog Fluids of Sonic Black Holes arrives with a presentlessness, existing in a cataclysm that is coming, that is then and now. “Don’t Die,” an excruciating listen, is screamed, wept, and then finally gasped as the song cuts off. Bass creeps, voices moan, wail and shake. The sound is relentless, seasick. Moor Mother reminds us of forces beyond control, that are still out there, waiting.

One of the Best Yet,Gang Starr,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc1af2f70cbce00082b8bca/1:1/w_160/oneofthebest.jpeg,2019-11-11 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gang-starr-one-of-the-best-yet/,Gang Starr Enterprises LLC,"There wasn’t supposed to be another Gang Starr album. From 2006 until his death, Guru was adamant that the group was over and that there wouldn’t be a comeback, even calling DJ Premier his “Ex-DJ.” He seemed to be longing to recreate himself, to put distance between himself and his legendary partner. He was growing edgy about being asked questions about Premier all the time, and even refused to answer them. He had started a new label with a new DJ named Solar, with whom he seemed conjoined at the hip, and his death only further complicated the matter. Controversy surrounded a note allegedly written by Guru on his deathbed disassociating himself with Premier specifically and praising Solar. An oncologist testified that Guru never woke up from his coma and couldn’t have written a letter, so Solar was forced to forfeit everything pertaining to Guru’s estate. Solar later sold 30 unreleased Guru recordings to Premier—“Some of them had two verses, some of them had a verse, some of them just had a hook and then faded,” Premier told the New York Times. The producer molded them into One of the Best Yet. While the circumstances of the album’s creation remain a point of contention, it’s undeniably awesome to hear the two artists together again. On the intro to One of the Best Yet, the first Gang Starr album since 2003’s The Ownerz, Premier turns an interpolation of “DYWCK” into a sample tour of the group’s storied catalog—“Mass Appeal,” “Work,” “Code of the Streets,” and “Full Clip,” among others—as a little reminder of all they accomplished. The diehards who have dreamt of this throwback will salivate over “Hit-Man,” a Q-Tip-assisted cut that approximates vintage Gang Starr, wherein Guru plays rap assassin and Premier adds a touch of menace, and “From a Distance,” with Guru and Jeru the Damaja barring out over a swelling Premier sample. There are Foundation members at nearly every turn, and they sound very grateful for the opportunity to be a part of another Gang Starr project. There are other things to be grateful for, too: the second Guru verse of closer “Bless the Mic,” the J. Cole appearance on “Family and Loyalty,” a series of carefully devised beats designed to salvage Guru’s afterimage. Once the initial thrill of the reunion wears off, though the album starts coming apart. Gang Starr was all about balance; Guru’s feel for how best to wade through Premier’s vandalizing, resourceful, and visionary sample work was stunningly natural. With Premier trying to reverse-engineer that process, much of the intuition and congruence is lost. In his prime, Guru was a rapper of singular monotonic charisma. He was so calm and clear and collected that his raps were a balm, and his rhymes themselves felt like proverbs. Bigger names rapped over Premier beats, but no one was better at finding their place in them, navigating their moving parts precisely. There isn’t the same effortless proficiency in these songs. Premier does his best to make sure they don’t sound like a hastily cut-together craft project of scraps, but they are missing a soul. On “What’s Real,” an in-form Royce da 5’9’, who has become DJ Premier’s new partner in recent years, displays just how hollowed-out many of these Guru verses sound. If there is a theme to be gleaned from these leftovers, it’s that Guru had clearly grown disillusioned with the industry and was sounding its death knell. Gang Starr has always been about rap purism and outing sellouts; a song like “Mass Appeal,” its joke aimed squarely at radio, commercial interests, and posers, set a standard for such meta-mainstream rap crit. But that wasn’t the only thing on their minds then, and their claims were bolstered best by the quality of songs they were making. Here, there are mostly gripes about how fucked up the game has gotten, swipes at lesser rappers, and curmudgeonly grousing about how nobody really raps anymore. “Word to God, if Big and Pac were still here/Some of these weirdos wouldn’t act so cavalier/We all know that the game has changed/It’s crazy out here and rap’s got a bad name,” Guru raps on “Bad Name,” and that’s the hook. “Think about it, what if bling never happened/And the true artists were gettin’ rich from rappin’?/Word to God, some should give/Let’s delete the politics so real hip-hop can live.” Where these moments were once radical, renegades challenging the status quo, they now just sound like old, out-of-touch men yelling at kids to get off their lawn. There are moments when it’s hard to imagine that at least some of Guru’s ire wasn’t aimed at Premier, a man he’d sworn off working with in life but now gets the final word on his legacy in death. It’s no secret that Guru felt betrayed by the machine that devoured the genre he loved, and came to see Premier as part of that machine, but there’s little disputing that his music is better off in Premier’s hands than Solar’s, either. Through all of this chaotic history, DJ Premier is trying to patch together an album that will pass the smell-test, and he does a decent job. Anyone who held out this long for a Gang Starr album will likely be pleased with the results: Premier meets his standards for sampling and scratching, and it’s just close enough to not feel wrong. Still, doing a tag-team album when your partner can’t consent feels like the kind of breach of trust that ended Gang Starr in the first place. This isn’t exactly a hologram tour, but it reasserts an imbalance. A secondhand Gang Starr album may be better than none, but it’s far less than the sum of its parts, and even less than the late Guru deserves.","It’s thrilling to hear them again, but once the glow wears off, there’s a hollowness to this posthumous project, cobbled together from unreleased Guru vocal takes.

Hitler Wears Hermes 7,Westside Gunn,by: Reed Jackson,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc3372919422100082f951c/1:1/w_160/westsidegunn.jpeg,2019-11-11 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/westside-gunn-hitler-wears-hermes-7/,GriseldaEMPIRE,"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo recently boasted that the Buffalo Bills are the only true-blue NY football team, as they’re the only one that actually plays in-state. (Both the Giants and Jets play in a stadium in New Jersey). Buffalo rapper Westside Gunn has been trumpeting a similar claim in the realm of rap, dubbing himself the “New King of New York” despite being from a city upstate that’s more known for its snowfall than hip-hop. But while MCs from the NYC boroughs have tried to shake the dust off their sound with trap hi-hats, Gunn and his Griselda Records cohorts have proudly embraced the loops and drum breaks of the city’s “Golden Age” and revamped them. So much so that the richest rapper to ever make it out of Brooklyn recently gave them a management deal. On Hitler Wears Hermes 7, the formula doesn’t change, with Gunn rapping ruthlessly about life on the streets of Buffalo over glistening barely touched samples. With each edition of the series, the bars seem to get a little harder, the beats a little prettier, and Gunn’s persona comes further into focus. The project opens with DJ Drama, whose Gangsta Grillz mixtapes once served as proclamations of stardom for artists like Lil Wayne and Young Jeezy, decreeing that the “Buffalo kids done did it.” It’s a sentiment Gunn circles back to often on Hermes 7 with crass lines like, “First nigga in my city with a Rolls/Fuck two bad bitches at the Lowe’s,” injecting a conventional rap boast with some of his hometown’s blue-collar attitude. Gunn’s voice is a nasally high-pitched yap, somewhere between Brooklyn rappers AZ and Troy Ave, and is perfectly tuned for talking shit. “At the Roc Nation brunch with my tool on, don’t disrespect us,” he cooly warns on “GONDEK.” Elsewhere, on “Connie’s Son,” he crows that he’s “made half at least half a mil’ ridin’ Mega buses,” a clever reference to the cheap bus service that’s been exposed more than once as a tool used by traffickers to run drugs across state lines. Griselda crew members Conway The Machine and Benny The Butcher show up to deliver equally gritty verses, as well as a surprisingly in-form Fat Joe, who harkens back to his DITC days on “Kelly’s Korner” by lamenting how he once got his hand put in a meat grinder for stealing a mafia Don’s car. The production, handled by a who’s who of boom-bap aficionados like Alchemist, Statik Selektah and Griselda in-house producer Daringer, is as lovely as the lyrics are ugly. The swirling keys on “Broadway Jones” sound more like something jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi laid down for A Charlie Brown Christmas than a backdrop to an ode to cooking crack. The soaring vocal sample on the frontend of “Undertaker vs. Goldberg,” meanwhile, throws Gunn’s violent “doot, doot, doot, doot” adlibs into a warm swirl. The only moments the beats come up short are when their simplicity veers into redundancy, like a few minutes into “Undertaker,” which could have been bolstered by some drums. This could be said for other aspects of Hermes 7 as well, a project that’s endearingly straightforward but has a firm ceiling as a result. By its midpoint, you pretty much know how each song will unfold, a one-note dish that’s tasty on first bite but starts to lose its flavor by the end. Make no mistake, this is who Westside Gunn is: He makes one kind of song and does it well. Putting out a niche product has ironically led him, along with the rest of Griselda Records, to a larger audience. But even recipes for success can be improved upon.","The Buffalo rapper continues to build his grimy, boom-bap brand, one endearingly straightforward release at a time.

Madonna,...And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc0568389a8cd00087857a8/1:1/w_160/madonna.jpg,2019-11-10 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/and-you-will-know-us-by-the-trail-of-madonna/,Merge,"Superstar producer-turned-Interscope Records impresario Jimmy Iovine didn’t discover ...And You Will Know Us By the Trail of Dead in a club, or through college radio, or in a stack of demos. He found out about the Austin, Texas enfants terribles in the same place a lot of people discovered new bands before the internet: the magazine section at a Borders bookstore. But those mundane circumstances say a lot about Trail of Dead’s peculiar situation back at the turn of the millennium. While the band’s second record, Madonna, had received a wide North American release through Merge, their combustible art-punk was received more warmly in Europe—and upon flipping through an import copy of NME, Iovine became fascinated with this unknown American band who looked like a demonic Beatles and were developing a fearsome reputation for their unhinged live show. “It was the best magazine I ever bought,” he would later tell the L.A. Times in 2001, after signing Trail of Dead to a major-label deal, underwritten with his personal commitment to support their long-term development. “I don’t care how long it takes,” he said. “We’ll sit there and let them do their thing. They have the talent.” The one thing I’ll always have in common with the 13th richest power broker in Hollywood is that, like him, I had also become obsessed with Madonna, and was willing to go to great lengths to indulge my fandom. In March of 2001, I traveled 1,500 miles from Toronto to see Trail of Dead play in Austin for 15 minutes, at what was supposed to be their triumphant homecoming show at South by Southwest. By the time they took the stage, the bar’s back-patio area was vibrating with anticipation, and Trail of Dead uncorked that festering energy with a new song that, about a year later, we’d recognize as “It Was There That I Saw You,” the titanic lead-off track from their Interscope debut, Source Tags & Codes. But the moment of glory was short-lived: Jason Reece had busted his kick drum in the middle of the song, leading to a sheepish request for another act on the bill to loan them a replacement. When no one stepped forward to help, Reece tried to make do by placing a small rack tom on the floor in front of his kick pedal—a savvy bit of MacGyvering, but one that effectively forced the band to play this hyped-up show with one hand tied behind their back. Four songs in, Trail of Dead teed up Madonna’s cataclysmic showstopper “A Perfect Teenhood,” which seemed like a weird choice to drop so early, because it’s the sort of song that only makes sense as a set-closer. But that’s what it was: Even before singer Conrad Keely could fire off the song’s infamous, machine-gunned procession of “fuck you”s, Reece was hoofing his makeshift kit into the crowd, while Keely tossed his guitar aside to tear down the venue’s beer-sponsor signage, narrowly escaping the clutches of some seriously pissed-off bouncers. (Guitarist Kevin Allen, meanwhile, picked up one of the many beer bottles tossed onstage and used it to coax more ungodly noise from his instrument as if nothing was amiss.) Once the chaos subsided, I wasn’t sure if I had just witnessed the worst or greatest rock‘n’roll show I’ve ever seen. On the one hand, the band’s SXSW massacre could be seen as an impulsive, heat-of-the-moment response to a frustrating technical setback; on the other, it was precisely what the crowd came to see. Whatever national attention Trail of Dead had acquired at the time came largely through their first television appearance in 2000 on the USA Network program Farmclub. Launched by Iovine with Universal CEO Doug Morris, Farmclub was an early attempt by major-label execs to muscle in on the nascent, post-Napster digital-music landscape: it was part online-music portal for unsigned bands, part old-school variety show—or, more accurately, paid Universal infomercial—featuring live performances and couch cameos from Iovine’s rock-star pals. After getting a pep talk from Bono, Trail of Dead performed a particularly rangy version of “Richter Scale Madness” from their 1998 self-titled debut, while the show’s poor go-go dancers tried to keep their rhythm to the sound of a drum kit being destroyed. Reece later admitted those Farmclub shenanigans were staged—as avowed fans of the Who, Trail of Dead were simply using their moment in the spotlight to plot their very own Smothers Brothers spectacle. But if instrument-smashing has come to be seen as an unnecessarily wasteful act of rock-star excess (heartland troubadour John Hiatt was calling that shit out back in ’93), it remained the most accurate means for Trail of Dead to communicate the emotional tumult and manic ferocity coursing through their early records. All of Trail of Dead’s sonic signatures were already in full effect on their 1998 self-titled debut: the gliding Daydream Nation guitar jams, the rapid-fire tom rolls that sound like you’re being besieged by an overhead warplane, the throat-shredding vocals from Keely and Reece (who also routinely traded positions on guitar and drums). The band clearly had grand ambitions, but was constricted by murky, low-budget production (not to mention limited distribution—the record was among the final releases on Butthole Surfers drummer King Coffey’s Trance Syndicate label before it went under). Madonna was another shoestring operation, recorded by Spoon producer Mike McCarthy during his off-hours before the group had finalized or received an advance from their Merge deal. But in every possible aspect—sound quality, songwriting, sequencing, visceral power, dramatic impact—Madonna represented a super-sized upgrade. Now that the Strokes/Stripes garage-rock renaissance of the early 2000s has been officially canonized, it’s completely overshadowed the preceding golden age of less retro, more aggro bands who were reanimating rock’n’roll in the late ‘90s. Trail of Dead belonged to a loose aggregate of kindred spirits that included At the Drive In, the (International) Noise Conspiracy, Rye Coalition, Hot Snakes, Les Savy Fav, the Icarus Line, and the Blood Brothers—bands whose music was rooted in post-hardcore abrasion, but who had enough swaggering attitude and appreciation for old-school showmanship to court audiences beyond misanthropic punk kids. With Madonna, however, Trail of Dead distanced themselves from the pack. If their debut positioned them as devout, guitar-stabbing students of Sonic Youth, Unwound, and Fugazi, Madonna revealed they were more philosophically in tune with bands like Smashing Pumpkins, Jane’s Addiction, and Nine Inch Nails—groups that carried the torch for the lavishly packaged classic-rock magnum opus into the ‘90s. Survey a random group of Trail of Dead fans about the band’s greatest album, and the widely celebrated Source Tags & Codes will likely emerge as the consensus pick. But Madonna is like the Revolver to Source Tags’ Sgt. Pepper’s—it captures the thrilling moments of transformation that precede the more formalized masterpiece. Madonna was released in October of 1999, a time when the ugly specters of Columbine and Woodstock ’99 loomed in our collective psyche just as Manson and Altamont did 30 years prior. And with news programs devoting vast blocks of airtime to Y2K-bug prognosticators and survivalists loading up their cellars with non-perishable food items, the media was intent on making you feel paranoid even if you were fairly certain your purple iMac would boot up just fine on January 1st. As such, Madonna acquired all the grim gravitas of a proper fin-de-siècle soundtrack, a seamless song cycle that both channeled the unbearable pent-up tension of the era and released it through moments of scorched-earth anarchy. But for all its timestamped qualities, Madonna is ultimately fueled by universal, eternal anxieties and grievances: the searing salvo “Mistakes and Regrets” renders romantic longing as an apocalyptic event, while “Totally Natural” rails at a world where celebrity is forever valued over art. (Though the latter was reportedly inspired by, of all things, Keanu Reeves’ moonlighting stint in his alt-rock band Dogstar, Keely’s murderous contempt can easily be redirected to Instagram influencers who score lucrative book deals.) “Totally Natural” wrote the playbook that countless other Trail of Dead songs would follow: a flash of hardcore ultraviolence that quickly flames out, only to slowly reignite and burn even brighter. It also signals Trail of Dead’s own metamorphosis over the course of Madonna, where the discord gradually gives way to disarming, piano-gilded balladry (“Clair de Lune”) and multi-part, Wall-sized suites (the “Up From Redemption”/“Aged Dolls”/“The Day the Air Turned Blue” sequence on side two). The band’s debut album showed they could handle more delicate material—particularly the eight-minute shoegaze reverie “Novena Without Faith”—but here, they were no longer expressing their most tender feelings in hushed whispers. And unlike Trail of Dead’s subsequent adventures in prog, Madonna’s most elaborate gestures are still executed with a scrappy intensity. This is the sound of a band storming the castle before they became comfortably ensconced within it. One reason why Madonna flows so smoothly through its peaks and valleys is that the singers’ roles had yet to codify. From Source Tags onward, Keely would become the resident art-rock architect responsible for the band’s most melodically sophisticated turns, while Reece would deflate the pomp with jugular-bursting displays of fury. But on Madonna, they’re more accomplices than foils, harnessing the album’s careening momentum through performances that teeter between vicious and vulnerable. And for further evidence of a band firing on all cylinders, consider that Trail of Dead’s two principal songwriters weren’t even responsible for Madonna’s centerpiece track. Bassist Neil Busch’s lead-vocal turns with Trail of Dead can be counted on one hand (he left the band in 2004), but on their early records, he was a crucial cool counterpoint to Keely and Reece’s more volatile personalities, bringing balance to the band’s dichotomous musical universe. With “Mark David Chapman,” Busch delivers an arresting chorus-free anthem that meditates on punk’s empowering kill-your-idols philosophy and the heinous actions of those who’ve taken those words to their literal extreme. (And, fitting for a band that’s always tried to reconcile classic-rock mythology with indie pragmatism, the song sounds just like Sonic Youth’s “Schizophrenia” as interpreted by a young Rod Stewart.) By invoking the name of John Lennon’s assassin, Trail of Dead seemed to be issuing themselves a warning that the pursuit of rock sainthood comes with unwanted consequences. Of course, that didn’t stop them from shooting for the moon and beyond on later records, even after Iovine stopped returning their calls, but on Madonna, the most epic moment is also the most unforgiving. The album climaxes with “A Perfect Teenhood,” which is at once an over-the-top caricature of an anti-authoritarian teen-angst punk rant, and the platonic ideal of an anti-authoritarian teen-angst punk rant. Emerging from the foreboding piano interlude “The Day the Air Turned Blue,” the track is prefaced by the sound of idle chit-chat in a crowded bar, the patrons blissfully oblivious to the onslaught that’s to come—an eerie invocation of the benign moments that occur before disaster suddenly strikes. What follows is essentially a 90-second hardcore rager that’s stretched out to over three times that length, thanks in large part to an extended, endlessly crashing finale showered in enough “fuck you”s to turn the song into the indie-rock “Killing in the Name.” Alas, the world didn’t come to an end on January 1, 2000. But as media-fuelled hysteria over a predicted computer apocalypse has given way to legitimate fears of an actual environmental one, Madonna still sounds as ominous and unsettling as ever.

Moon Trip Radio,Clams Casino,by: Noah Yoo,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc1c60f97386400095bc82e/1:1/w_160/Cover%203000px%20FRONT.png,2019-11-09 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/clams-casino-moon-trip-radio/,self-released,"Many prominent rap producers parlay their notoriety into touring careers, taking checks to spin their hits on the road, or they lose their signature sound and become “super-producers,” bending their sounds to fit the needs of a given artist. Not Clams Casino. After helping invent cloud rap near the beginning of the decade—lending his hazy, arcane beats to A$AP Rocky, the Weeknd, and Vince Staples—the New Jersey producer born Mike Volpe has devoted himself to refining his oft-copied brand of atmospheric beat music. After 2016’s major-label debut 32 Levels, featuring vocal turns from singers like Kelela and Future Islands’ Sam T. Herring, it seemed like Volpe was ready to consolidate his own star power. But the album came and went, and Clams Casino was no more a household name than before it was released. This, it seems, is just how he likes it. The following year, he returned to his long-running Instrumental Mixtape series for a fourth edition, and now he’s released his second album, Moon Trip Radio. No longer beholden to the requirements of a major, he eschews features; instead, Volpe gives us an unadulterated stream of his ambient hip-hop amalgam. By now, the Clams formula is an essential part of 2010s rap canon. His legacy can be felt in the druggy, washed-out productions of SoundCloud rap producers like Ronny J—drums forward, bass up, atmospheres of druggy malaise smeared across the background like black paint and perpetuated by lo-fi samples. Moon Trip Radio’s opening track (and lead single) “Rune“ instantly feels like classic Clams, an ominous and alien-sounding vocal sample perfectly setting the tone for granular textures to come. It sounds like it could have been made at any point of his career. Nonetheless, there’s a clear arc throughout the album, and by the midpoint, Clams—who used to source new sounds by typing search terms like “cold” and “blue” into LimeWire—is offering some of his warmest-sounding music. The songs are as sonically destroyed as ever, bristling with digital flotsam and tape hiss—see “Twilit”—but the patient harmonic changes give the doomy atmospheres a certain sentimentality. Chopped breaks and angelic electric piano noodling on “Cupidwing” and “Fire Blue” invoke the lovelorn works of DJ Shadow, while “Lyre,” with its lonely guitars and wildlife recordings, reframes Clams as hip-hop’s own Daniel Lanois. He’s said that he’s ready to get back to making “some fun rap shit or something” now that this new solo release is finished. But the album highlights the difference between Volpe and the myriad imitators in his wake: Anyone can oversaturate some moody samples and chalk it up to a “vibe,” but few can weave those disparate elements together in a compelling way that inspires the listener to fill in their own narratives.","On his second album, the cloud-rap innovator hones the decaying instrumentals of his mixtape series to make some of his warmest-sounding music to date.

Supermoon EP,Charly Bliss,by: Vrinda Jagota,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dbb2092ac499900082d1899/1:1/w_160/CharlyBliss_SupermoonEP.jpg,2019-11-09 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/charly-bliss-supermoon-ep/,Barsuk,"On their second album, this year’s Young Enough, Brooklyn power-pop band Charly Bliss documented the simultaneous pain and ecstasy of growing into a better version of yourself. Buoyed by soaring guitar riffs and glittery pop choruses, the album was a self-critical and self-affirming coming-of-age meditation. The songs on their new EP, Supermoon, were recorded at the same time, before the band settled on a final track list. These outtakes provide insight into the ethos behind Young Enough, filling out a mood board of anxiety and romantic alienation. As a study in the process of writing and editing a record, Supermoon is interesting. But on its own, it doesn’t have the same impact. Similar yet slightly grungier than Young Enough, the songs on Supermoon are dense and sweet like a tub of frosting. The chorus of “Slingshot” hits with the heart-swelling force of a Third Eye Blind anthem and the guitars on “Supermoon” chug like a heartbeat. There’s never a moment that reaches the unbridled euphoria of Young Enough’s “Capacity” or “Blown to Bits,” though. These songs feel unravelled, less determined to deliver neatly packaged hooks. The greatest departure is in Supermoon’s lyrics. Slivers of bodies, relationships, and emotions—uncrossed legs, twisted arms, festering resentments, declarations of love that sound like threats—shine bright. But you have to squint to see the constellations they form, the bigger picture they’re building towards. “Feed” creates a chorus out of the line, “I would feed the whole world if I could.” It’s a hard sentiment to argue with, the kind that tells us almost nothing about the person saying it. Sandwiched between imagery of expired milk and melted trophies, it’s hard to know exactly what we’re supposed to feel. “Supermoon” and “Slingshot” are similarly opaque, evoking emotional chaos without establishing origins or intentions. It’s understandable that these songs didn’t make the cut for Young Enough, where every track encapsulated the joy of overcoming trauma and practicing self love. There are still moments when Charly Bliss’ songwriting strikes with full vulnerability and force. On Supermoon highlight “Heaven,” the lyrics are simpler, often only a few syllables per line. Over gauzy, distorted guitar, lead singer Eva Hendricks relays dreamy romantic contentment, culminating in a triumphant declaration of hope: “I’m gonna buy a house and fill it/With daughters and daughters and daughters.” The bright guitar lines of “Threat” coyly conceal the aggravation of a comfortable but unfulfilling romantic relationship. Heartbreaking lines like, “I’d rather be dead than have it be true/That no one can ever love me more than you” are hidden in plain sight. Creative writing instructors sometimes encourage students to develop a better understanding of their characters by describing the contents of their trash cans. But this kind of exercise is usually one step in a creative process, not the end product itself. By presenting their outtakes, Charly Bliss offer superfans the chance to better appreciate Young Enough by hearing what songs it isn’t. New listeners may wish to start somewhere else: Though fun and propulsive, the songs on Supermoon don’t match the time-stopping, soul-affirming exhilaration that make Charly Bliss’ best music so special.","These outtakes are less determined to deliver neatly packaged hooks, but there are still moments where the band strikes with full vulnerability and force.

Call for Location,Jubilee,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dbcab09a294dc0009cac1d4/1:1/w_160/callforlocation.jpg,2019-11-09 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jubilee-call-for-location/,Mixpak,"The cover of Jubilee’s Call for Location may be adorned with an illustration of a gecko—a salute to the South Florida native’s tropical upbringing—but perhaps a chameleon would be more appropriate. Jubilee (Jessica Gentile) has largely built her name in the DJ booth, adhering to an old-school approach and adapting her sets to the requirements of the room. Dancehall, hip-hop, UK bass, electro, hip-hop, R&B, Miami bass, grime, reggaeton—it’s all in her crate, which might help explain why she’s just as comfortable playing an Opening Ceremony fashion event as she is a Fool’s Gold hip-hop party or a Mixpak bashment rave during London’s Notting Hill Carnival. While her music (and her gig calendar) may be varied, there are two constants in her work: fun and a serious love of bass. The Mixpak label crew, Jubilee’s primary affiliation, is a perfect home for her genre-hopping sensibilities. Headed up by Dre Skull, a producer who’s worked with Popcaan, Vybz Kartel, WizKid, Burna Boy, Future, Santigold, and numerous others, Mixpak has been at the forefront of bringing the dancefloor sounds of the Caribbean and the global South into the larger international pop sphere. Jubilee has been releasing music with the label since 2012, and her first album, After Hours, dropped in 2016. A largely instrumental affair, the LP pulled heavily from the bouncy electro, breaks, and Miami bass that soundtracked Gentile’s youth, while also offering some woozy trap cuts and a delightful bit of dancehall pop (“Wine Up”) voiced by Bronx MC Hoodcelebrityy. Three years later, Jubilee has returned with Call for Location, a title that flashes back to the hotlines that once guided her along many late nights out as a teenage raver in South Florida. Musically, the album occasionally nods in that direction, particularly on “Disconnected,” a thundering bass-techno hybrid that pairs its relentless low end with a cascade of synth stabs that could have been lifted straight off a 1990s UK hardcore record. The nostalgia is palpable, but the track’s beefy construction is more than suitable for a modern dancefloor. Echoes of Miami appear elsewhere on the album, most notably in the snapping breakbeats of LP closer “Let Go,” the churning rhythms of “I Don’t Think So,” and the buoyant, pastel sounds of “Call for Location,” which sounds like an ideal soundtrack for cruising down Collins Avenue in a white Cabriolet with the top down. “Speed Limit” opens with a drum pattern that could have kickstarted an old freestyle record, but then suddenly shifts gears with a sinister bassline and a series of warbling, drawn-out synth melodies that wouldn’t be out of place on a Dorian Concept or Jacques Greene production. These kinds of hybrids help make Call for Location not just an enjoyable listen but also a stronger album than After Hours. At this stage in her career, Jubilee has learned to harness the best bits of her influences, but she also knows how to transcend them, bringing in other sounds and genres that she’s encountered during her many years in the DJ booth: grime, dancehall, hip-hop, breaks, ambient, synth-pop, and countless flavors of electronic music, some of which are a total surprise. “Liquid Liner” is a stompy, industrial-leaning techno romp whose dark and crunchy EBM rhythms have got pretty much zero to do with South Beach. More impressive still are the LP’s three singles, all of which feature guest vocalists and return to the same sort of pop (or at least pop-adjacent) territory Jubilee traversed on “Wine Up.” While many dance producers struggle to work with MCs and singers, Gentile understands that success with these kinds of collaborations often requires stripping things back, laying a sturdy foundation, and then largely getting out of the way. “Shots,” a dreamy, heads-down tune excellently voiced by South London grime MC P Money, might be the best of the bunch, but the bubbling pop dancehall of “Fulla Curve” is similarly excellent, with UK artist IQ sing-rapping over the song’s warmly sashaying riddim. “Mami” also has a bit of a dancehall feel, albeit with a more rigid, electronic strut and a healthy dose of fierce bilingual sass from Bronx vocalist Maluca. As a DJ, Jubilee has long been fusing seemingly disparate genres into single, cohesive statements, but on Call for Location she applies that same skill in the studio, often within the context of a single track. Whether or not she heads further down the pop production path—and with her Mixpak connections, one would assume that door is open—Jubilee has already focused and sharpened her work without having to cut loose any of the elements that make her a special talent.","The South Florida native’s second album is a tribute to the regional raves of her youth, filtered through the wide array of global club styles that defines her style as a DJ.

MAGDALENE,FKA twigs,by: Julianne Escobedo Shepherd,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dbb1aaeb4386a000828699d/1:1/w_160/twigs.jpg,2019-11-08 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fka-twigs-magdalene/,Young Turks,"From her first video, 2012’s mesmerizing “Hide,” the singular focus of her vision was apparent, a holistic project that rendered FKA twigs’ operatic approach to club beats inextricable from her astounding art direction. In the seven years since, she has made her art into a kind of theatrical multimedia experience, crafting elaborate shows and videos that intertwine and smudge the lines of classicism and the avant-garde. She is astonishing, ambitious, and seemingly good at everything, singing over her own ticker-tape beats, self-directing wildly conceptual videos, and ravenously hoovering up dance disciplines (apparently up to and including Chinese sword fighting) until she masters them. Yet in spite of twigs’ distinctive soprano (spectral and often papery) and her experimental production (stunning and often bellicose), her music has resonated best as a part of a whole, a piece that propels her full-blown artistry but does not totally comprise it. Chalk this up to twigs’ innovation in the Eyeballs Epoch, but even 2015’s incredible M3LL155X EP—a brooding and serrated read on genres like industrial, ballroom house, and triple-time rap—centered adventurousness over melody. It let the fullness of her art bring the beats along with it—weird bangers meant to challenge patrons of the most interesting nightclubs—but was probably best experienced while watching French artist and polymath Michèle Lamy rendered as a deep-sea anglerfish. The gesamtkunstwerk of twigs sometimes overshadowed the music itself, in part because so much of twigs’ presence is her world-class athleticism as a dancer. She imbues voguing and lyrical ballet with such grace and sensuality that the emotion of her music emanates directly from her body. MAGDALENE, then, is a fucking revelation. FKA twigs’ first album in four years, and her best work by far, is as introspective as anything she’s written, but more obviously centers her voice as a conduit for plain emotion. Written during a publicly scrutinized relationship with a famously reluctant vampire, as well as a more private recovery from the removal of fibroids from her uterus, she has said she found solace and inspiration in the story of Mary Magdalene, among the New Testament’s most reviled and misunderstood character, whose complexities were rewritten by centuries of chauvinist churchmen into a fallen-woman side note in Jesus’ story. By locating herself in Magdalene’s lineage, twigs, a Catholic school alumnus, explores the ways deeply conservative expectations trammel women; in doing so, she locates a version of herself within these ancient and oppressive archetypes, upending and transcending them through the power of her songwriting and the sheer magnetic pull of her presence. “thousand eyes” opens MAGDALENE with twigs singing in the austere polyphony of Medieval church music, a meditation on the moment before a permanent departure (“If I walk out the door it starts our last goodbye”) that, with repetition, reveals itself as a hymn. It’s a prologue for an album whose songs are produced like narratives, with a beginning, climax, and denouement. She grapples with survival—psychic and physical survival—the way a woman who lives to move might respond to being laid out by tumors on an organ that facilitates birth. She is furious in parts, attacking tracks like the sweet “home with you” and snarling standout “fallen alien” with virility and self-preservation. Even if shit went south, she refuses to saddle herself with the burden: “I’m a fallen alien, I never thought that you would be the one to tie me down,” she seethes. “But you did in this age of Satan/I’m searching for a light to take me home and guide me out.” MAGDALENE is visceral and direct, but despite featuring a trunk-thumping Future collaboration (“holy terrain”), this is not a play to make pop music in the charts-humping sense. It’s a document of twigs’ marked achievements in songwriting and musicality as she elucidates her melodies without sacrificing her viewpoint. “sad day,” one of MAGDALENE’s most astonishing tracks, finds twigs properly genuflecting at the altar of Kate Bush, clearly having learned from her ability to translate inner sanctum into cinematic, Shelleyan alt-pop. The production by twigs, Nicolas Jaar, Skrillex, and benny blanco is utterly sublime: Skittering toms build onto an oscillating space-synth, the beats a proscenium for twigs’ voice and, especially, her lover’s desperation. Even if “sad day” doesn’t tell an explicit narrative in its lyrics, its production and twigs’ delivery tell an emotional one, that of the last desperate grasps at love in a power imbalance; we’re at the center where the story turns, teetering towards its inevitable end. That the album stands alone is not to say the totality of her vision is truncated; twigs has already released three videos to accompany its nine songs. The first, “cellophane,” set the tone for the project, showcasing her pole-dancing skills to a dissonantly sorrowful ballad. (That she apparently finds it funny is a testament to her character—serious artists who can’t laugh at themselves are the worst.) The armchair interpretation of “cellophane” is as a meditation on the virulent racism that disgusting British tabloids and the worst of Twilight stans lobbed at twigs during her relationship with Robert Pattinson, but it’s equally a mournful reflection on the insecurities that dog any inequitable relationship. The imagery twigs has associated with “cellophane”—pole dancing, a feat of physical strength set perpendicular to the emotional strength she sings about lacking—calls up the idea of performing for others’ pleasure. It’s a sad solo dance by someone both fully present in herself and aware that she's toeing the line between agency and subjugation. As the final track on this deeply thought, deeply felt album, “cellophane” acts as a rejoinder to “thousand eyes”—how sickening it must be, a woman artist constantly watched by bigoted tabloids interested in tearing you down from the man you love, how they did Mary M. and Jesus—and underscores the sorrow woven through MAGDALENE. The fact that sorrow spurred a musical growth this formidable, though, is evidence enough that twigs will always find her way back home.

MAGDALENE is not just on the vanguard of pop, it’s in a breathtaking class of its own.

"Travelin’ Thru, Featuring Johnny Cash: The Bootleg Series Vol. 15",Bob Dylan,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dbc5461ba7e000008b7b2db/1:1/w_160/bootleg.jpg,2019-11-08 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bob-dylan-travelin-thru-featuring-johnny-cash-the-bootleg-series-vol-15/,ColumbiaLegacy,"Weighing in at a mere three discs—last year’s More Blood, MoreTracks was twice that size—Travelin' Thru is a relatively trim installment in Bob Dylan’s ongoing Bootleg Series. Instead of opening a door onto a secret history, it adds color and texture to an already well-known story: Dylan's late-’60s sojourn in Nashville, the period in which he recorded John Wesley Harding and Nashville Skyline, capped off by his performance on The Johnny Cash Show in 1969—his first television appearance in nearly five years. Dylan knew precisely what he wanted for the Harding sessions: just his guitar, bass, and drums. Producer Bob Johnston brought bassist Charlie McCoy and drummer Kenneth Buttrey into the studio, persuaded Bob to add steel guitarist Pete Drake to a couple of tracks, and the entire thing was finished within nine hours. The swift session means there were only a handful of outtakes left behind. Just seven alternate takes made the cut for Travelin’ Thru and apart from Dylan fussing with a few words, these aren’t far removed in form or feel from the versions that made the final album. The outtakes from Nashville Skyline—which includes the unheard song “Western Road,” a loose-limbed blues that happily plays with some well-worn tropes—also aren’t markedly different than what made the cut on the finished LP. The differences here are subtle—”Lay, Lady, Lay” seems a bit muted without its busy percussion and sighing steel—but it’s fun to hear Dylan groove along with these Nashville pros, working up a head of country-funk steam on “Country Pie” with the help of guitarist Charlie Daniels. Unfortunately, there aren't many of these Nashville Skyline outtakes. A bunch of masters were lost when CBS Records Nashville neglected to pay the fees for a storage facility, and while Sony recovered some tapes in a 2008 auction, many reels are still missing, which means the eight cuts on Travelin’ Thru are all that could be salvaged for official release. All this means that the heart of Travelin’ Thru lies in the session Dylan held with Johnny Cash on February 18, 1969, just after he finished work on Nashville Skyline. The pair tested the waters the day before, stumbling through a version of Cash’s “I Still Miss Someone” and playing Dylan’s “Don’t Think Twice, It’s Alright” simultaneously with Johnny’s “Understand Your Man,” a song that lifted the melody from “Don’t Think Twice.” It’s a clever idea, albeit slightly confusing in practice—at one point, Dylan messes up his lyrics and slyly suggests he should be singing Cash’s words instead—but the mash-up illustrates how the two icons were operating on a similar wavelength. More than that, they were on equal footing in 1969. Each had spent the past decade changing the sound of American music by deviating from conventions, each building an image that verged on mythic. What's appealing about their duet session is how it deflates those myths: it’s merely two mutual admirers figuring out how to play music together. Raised on old folk, country, and blues tunes, not to mention rock & roll, Dylan and Cash shared a similar vernacular, but speaking it in a sympathetic fashion took some effort. Although a version of “Girl from the North Country” wound up opening up Nashville Skyline, the duo generally avoided Dylan’s songbook. They also attempted “One Too Many Mornings” and Bob unveiled “Wanted Man,” a tune he wrote specifically for Johnny that played upon Cash’s Man In Black mythos. This tentative, good-humored read-through is the only known recording of Dylan singing the song, and it arrives fairly close to the end of the session, after the pair realized Bob didn't know how the country standard “The Wreck of the Old 97” went and that he couldn’t remember the words to Cash’s “Guess Things Happen That Way.” Discovering such gaps was part of the process, as was Cash feeding lyrics to Dylan: on the old Appalachian folk tune “Mountain Dew,” he instructs Bob how to deliver a line so it has the impact of a punchline. Hearing Cash and Dylan attack the same lyric from different angles provides a striking insight regarding the pair's vocal styles. Cash barrels forth, commanding attention with his booming baritone, while Dylan sounds slippier, as if he’s suppressing a laugh. These two join together on the chorus but they don't harmonize, exactly: they’re fellow travelers on the same road, headed to the same destination but getting there at different speeds. This scenario repeats itself throughout the session, as the pair trade lines and graciously make space for their partner, yet neither willing to abandon their own stylistic quirks. Where they find common ground is on a selection of spirituals, standards, and Jimmie Rodgers tunes, plus a lively reading of “Matchbox” featuring Carl Perkins, who wrote the song back in 1957. None of this amounts to a cohesive session, so it's not a surprise that it was largely shelved in 1969. Yet its genial raggedness is the very reason to listen to it decades later; it feels bracingly human. Dylan and Cash reunited a few months later when Bob stopped by The Johnny Cash Show.. Dylan was plugging Nashville Skyline, singing “I Threw It Away” and reprising his “Girl From The North Country” duet with Johnny, and it’s remarkable to hear how at ease he is here.. The same crew supported Dylan a couple of days after this May 1, 1969 taping, playing “Ring Of Fire” and “Folsom Prison Blues” with a similar gusto and bonhomie, a vibe that carried Dylan through to the clutch of 1970 recordings with bluegrass banjoist Earl Scruggs that close off this set. Comparing the Scruggs cuts and the funky, swampy Cash covers with the austere John Wesley Harding outtakes that begin Travelin’ Thru is illuminating. When Dylan began his Nashville years, he was cautious, a sentiment befitting an artist who purposely withdrew from the spotlight, but the singer on the 1970 sessions is playful and alive, clearly enjoying the company of other musicians. Dylan may not have returned to Nashville to record—as the title suggests, he was just passing through the town—but he kept that communal spirit close at hand in the music that he’s made over the years.

The Juice Vol. II,Emotional Oranges,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc335295246650008bf7901/1:1/w_160/juice2.jpeg,2019-11-08 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/emotional-oranges-the-juice-vol-ii/,Avant Garden,"The theme of pop in 2019 seems to be stripping it all down to shiny exoskeletons. Tones and I’s “Dance Monkey” hums up the global charts. Shaed’s sleek “Trampoline” is the zenith of Spotifycore—Zayn just hopped on the remix. Enter Emotional Oranges, an anonymous group making oozy, drifting R&B. They refused to state how many performers were in the group until their first tour sold out; then, two singers performed in masks, revealing at least the number of primary vocalists. They’re well-connected in the music industry, serving as writers, producers, and A&Rs for other projects, and they seem to have calculated the catchy, lo-fi haze that succeeds on streaming. On their second project, The Juice: Volume II, their smokey bass and throbbing beats sound pristine and precise. But the care and craft stop short of their lyrics. This is an album made to sing along to, with words embarrassing to sing out loud. As a production exercise, “Your Best Friend Is a Hater” is stunning: sparse guitar, creamy layered vocals. But the lyrics read like petty tweets from 2012. “Your best friend is a hater, and you’re a hater too,” they croon, attempting to wrench out a meaningful statement. “My swagger is my dagger.” Cringey descriptions of sex squelch throughout the compact, eight-track album. “Let me lick and taste it,” they intone on “Don’t Be Lazy,” imploring a woman to “take it” and “go down.” Another brags, “My baby likes to get me off,” a lazy and obvious throwaway layered over immaculate beats. The shyest track, “Heal My Desires,” is also the weakest, as they chant the title over wilting chords. The sex sounds terrible, but that isn’t the problem; it’s the constant bludgeon of dull words over the shimmering sound that makes listening to the album so frustrating. To their credit, the group surpasses the curse of most streaming bait: spitting out the same shade of song over and over. On The Juice: Volume II, they prove they can handle “Songs About Jane”-era Maroon 5 acoustics just as well as synth-drenched R&B. Each song is dissolving but discernible: a computerized beep-heavy track bleeds into a curling hip hop song. Slow guitars melt into sped-up synths. “Just Like You,” is a bouncy romp about masturbation, while “Sundays,” a response to a friend’s divorce, unfurls like a yawn. There is an emotional center somewhere in this music, rippling out in glinting chords and sighs, but the group struggles to articulate it. The mood is clear; its roots are not. Just two releases into their trajectory as a band, Emotional Oranges are so certain of becoming famous that they’ve stayed anonymous in order to preserve their “normal lives” out of the public eye. “We’re going to be the biggest band in the world,” they’ve said. They might achieve that title through raw metrics, shooting across streaming services and then manifesting on your “Discover Weekly” once every three months. They’ll slump into ubiquity on playlists you’ll hear in a coffee shop or at the bar. But even if you listen closely, you won’t know who they are.","On their second project, the group’s hazy R&B sounds pristine and precise, but the care and craft stop short of their lyrics.

Cartas Na Manga,DJ Nigga Fox,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dbb23a1240be10008ccef80/1:1/w_160/djniggafox_cartasnamanga.jpg,2019-11-08 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dj-nigga-fox-cartas-na-manga/,Príncipe Discos,"In early 2015, Radiohead’s Thom Yorke posted a few tracks he was taken with at that moment, ranging from Kool A.D. to musique concrète master Bernard Parmegiani, pummeling UK techno to Caribbean soca. But even among these eclectic selections, DJ Nigga Fox’s “Weed” stood out. At a time when few knew about Portugal’s Príncipe label and their hand-painted 12” releases, Yorke helped introduce the rest of the world to the bewildering polyrhythms of Rogério Brandão and his labelmates, all of them representatives of Lisbon’s Afro-Lusophone diaspora. Their sound, batida, has since traversed the globe: Nídia appeared on Fever Ray’s Plunge, DJ Marfox has mixed with DJ Rashad and DJ Spinn, and Nigga Fox released an EP on Warp last year. But for the most part Príncipe and its artists have kept their mix of kuduro, semba, and kizomba relatively close to home and defiantly undiluted. Brandão has restlessly continued innovating—just see his 15-minute single “15 Barras,” an outlier in a scene full of two- and three-minute songs. But with the nine-track Cartas Na Manga, he returns to the label for the first time in two years to drop his most exploratory set to date. It retains the woozy instability of his prior work while folding in startling new timbres. “Sub Zero” shows off Brandão’s skill set from the jump, juggling a number of incongruent bleeps, claps, gurgles, and alien tones for its first three minutes and allowing them to build. Then, in an instant, he flips it all on its head like a Jello mold, whole and wholly coherent. Nigga Fox’s gymnastic knack for inverting everything and still nailing the landing carries across the set. In that way Cartas Na Manga emulates its modular cover art, by in-house designer Márcio Matos, whose sticker shapes can be assembled in any number of ways. Throughout the album, new shards of sound jump out: horn fanfare, piano, electronically warped exhalations, even flute and synthesized woodwinds. The pummeling that opens “Nhama” soon careens into plonky piano, marimba, and flickering vocals, fracturing into numerous small elements yet still holding together as a track. “Faz a Minha” flashes a number of telltale sounds from different subgenres of dance—acid gurgle, house low end, itchy experimental electronics—then spins it like a carousel so that it all blurs into giddy release. “Talanzele” is the most straightforward dancefloor track, but even then Nigga Fox makes it feel permeable, letting a flute amble in and then an array of kitchen-sink percussion march across it. “Água Morna” takes the trademark knocking Príncipe beats and injects the kind of minor-key apprehensiveness that Lalo Schifrin or Quincy Jones would add to a soundtrack to heighten tension. If you ever wondered what Nigga Fox would sound like if he turned pensive and absurd, there’s closer “5 Violinos.” Thrummed metal gives the track its dreamy shuffle, while his voice is screwed up and down, cartoonish one moment, a drugged warble the next.

Charlie’s Angels (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),Various Artists,by: Eric Torres,Editorial Producer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dbb12b2a294dc0009cac080/1:1/w_160/charliesangels_ost.jpg,2019-11-07 06:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-charlies-angels-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/,Republic,"Pop music shows up in prominent and irreverent ways within the Charlie’s Angels universe. The original TV show’s brassy theme song is as indelible as the image of the franchise’s three detectives in silhouette, and the campy film reboot in 2000 used a wealth of inspired syncs: a high-flying alleyway battle set to the Prodigy; Sam Rockwell shimmying in his evil lair to Pharoahe Monch; even Cameron Diaz doing the whitest Soul Train routine of all time to Sir Mix-A-Lot. That lovable version of the crime-fighting Angels, of course, also brought about “Independent Women (Part 1),” Destiny’s Child’s inescapable tie-in empowerment anthem that became the longest-running No. 1 of that year and the group’s most successful crossover single ever. It’s an inevitably long shadow for Ariana Grande, who enters the fray this month by executive producing the soundtrack for an Elizabeth Banks-directed update coming to theaters. Brought in to represent “not just the theme of the movie but the audience,” Grande is a natural fit for 2019’s Angels, with enough effortless charm and cultural cachet to hold court over the soundtrack’s assembly of high-wattage, all-women guest stars. Yet for all of its promise in the wake of Grande’s slinky, accomplished thank u, next earlier this year, Charlie’s Angels instead smooths over any and all hard edges, opting for big-budget pop grabs and glossy filler that undermine the impressive lineup of talent. Grande addresses the “Independent Women” elephant head-on with “Don’t Call Me Angel,” a drab pop collaboration between herself, Miley Cyrus, and Lana Del Rey. With a narcotized delivery and hammering metallic bells, “Don’t Call Me Angel” will absolutely be forgotten in each artists’ respective discographies within the year, and for good reason: Where Destiny’s Child organically drew on female empowerment by speaking directly to a generation of working women and encouraging them to command authority, Grande’s song slings demands exclusively at men in its confounding bid for control. It’s only empowering at the most remedial level. The balmier pop-R&B cut “Bad to You,” with Grande regulars Normani and Nicki Minaj, coasts on better chemistry and Normani’s swooning voice, plus some outsized Max Martin production. Nevertheless, with Minaj sleepwalking through her verse and lyrics that once again exclusively chide male partners, it barely rises above mid-tier. The rest of Grande’s braintrust of collaborators fare better: Victoria Monét joins her for the trappy “Got Her Own,” bouncing featherlight vocal runs off each other like they’re in a round of badminton. And “How I Look on You,” Grande’s only solo feature, is a self-reflexive dark pop highlight, ripped through with a sluggish guitar line, trap snares, and sharp rejoinders to a character who finds her star power more appealing than her personality. It may be microwaved thank u, next, but it’s still a solid reminder of Grande’s songwriting finesse when she isn’t mobbed by guests. Because for as stacked as the Angels tracklist is, listening to it in full feels unhinged: There’s “Nobody,” a forgettable house-pop song with Chaka Khan that somehow bears zero relation to “Ain’t Nobody” and which not even Khan herself can bother feigning excitement for. It’s as doomed as an obligatory EDM-lite remix of Donna Summer’s “Bad Girls,” or the overproduced squad feature that opens the album with literal fanfare, “How It’s Done,” which finds Kash Doll and Stefflon Don trying their best under Kim Petras’ big, shouty chorus. That kind of keyed-up energy that spans the soundtrack might be electrifying—or at least make some sense—during an action sequence in the film. On its own, it just scans as low-grade exhausting. The most vexing aspect of this Charlie’s Angels soundtrack is that the levity and camp at the heart of the series never comes into focus. The truth is that Grande is a perfect choice for the film and its audience: a bona fide pop idol, wunderkind, and businesswoman with a sharp sense of humor and a cohort of multitalented women in her inner circle—all elements that could have led to an artfully playful soundtrack that breathed new life into an iconic, female-fronted, big-budget action machine. But with an outcome this ordinary, it just sounds like Grande is cashing in.","Ariana Grande executive produces the latest entry into the pop-camp franchise, but the collection feels warmed over, too glossy, and only remedially empowering.

Athena,Sudan Archives,by: Allison Hussey,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db8b4aca294dc0009cabe95/1:1/w_160/athena%20.jpg,2019-11-07 06:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sudan-archives-athena/,Stones Throw,"As the Greek myth goes, the goddess Athena sprang fully formed from Zeus’ forehead, wearing a suit of armor. Her purview included wisdom, the arts, wartime strategy, and cities, and she was revered as a model of righteousness and justice; her namesake city endured as a space for exploratory thought and bold ideas. The Ohio-born, Los Angeles-based Sudan Archives is the latest in a centuries-long parade of Athena enthusiasts, christening her first full-length album with the goddess’ name. The songs, her best yet, have the quality of revelation, and the album earns its namesake. Between her 2017 self-titled EP and last year’s Sink EP, Brittney Parks—the woman behind Sudan Archives—had already exhibited palpable growth as a musician. She one-upped the looping charm of songs like “Come Meh Way” and “Paid” with the rippling lilt of “Nont for Sale” and “Escape.” Those songs now feel more like sketches against Athena. Parks keeps her toolkit of hip-hop beats, millennial R&B gloss, and self-taught fiddling inspired by Sudanese and Ghanaian traditions. On Athena, she fuses them with even greater acuity, building songs that boast an impressive depth of field. The bass scoops lower, the grooves get deeper and funkier, and the layers of her violin parts give the illusion of a full orchestra. She shares producer credits on most of her songs, joined by Washed Out’s Ernest Greene, Scottish producer Rodaidh McDonald (the XX, King Krule, Sampha) and Paul White, a London-based producer whose credits include work with Open Mike Eagle and Danny Brown. Collectively, these big-deal producers never tip the scales too far in any direction. It’s a testament to Parks’ own vision that she can work with so many producers within a single album and emerge with her singular creative voice intact. Within her highly synthesized songs, Parks details sumptuous natural imagery in verdant metaphors (“Iceland Moss”), and in her parallels between a youthful relationship and the unorthodox grace of sea birds on “Pelicans in the Summer.” “Glorious” feels like a prime contender for crossover —a guest verse from rapper D-8 comes and goes without any serious impact, but the track builds a stronger case for her secret-weapon capabilities as a hip-hop collaborator. It’s a rare thrill to be able to hear an artist making leaps and bounds in their work in such a short span of time, to follow along as their explorations get deeper and weirder. Having developed a sound so distinctly her own, Parks has liberated herself from any preset expectations of genre or style. She warns listeners as much on Athena opener “Did You Know,” where her reflections on childhood ambitions to rule the world are muddled by adult insecurities. Her resolution is promising within the context of the song as much as her whole catalog: “At the end of the day, I’mma get my way.” (Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)","The L.A.-based singer and violinist makes her boldest and most fully formed statement yet.

One Life,Malibu,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc32b0f3af4630009dbe423/1:1/w_160/onelife.jpg,2019-11-07 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/malibu-one-life/,Joyful NoiseUNO NYC,"One of the highlights of Mono No Aware, an ambient compilation released in 2017 by the Berlin experimental label PAN, was “Held,” a beguiling track by a relatively obscure French producer named Malibu. The song moved through four distinct movements in just six minutes; its careful juxtaposition of elements—filmic synthesized strings, ASMR-grade whispers, an eerily Auto-Tuned lullaby—was reminiscent of an immaculately arranged terrarium. But despite the promise contained in that verdant miniature world, for anyone wanting more from Malibu, pickings were slim. There was a vaporous abstraction on the Astral Plane label’s Psychotropia compilation, from 2015, and a milky ambient sketch, “i can see hills,” that Malibu had self-released on Bandcamp at the beginning of 2017. (Bizarrely, the cover art was a screenshot of the logo of Bedrock Records, John Digweed’s famously emotive progressive-house label, suggesting that for all the seeming seriousness of Malibu’s music, she did not lack for a cryptic sense of irony.) A year after Mono No Aware, she returned to Bandcamp with an Auto-Tuned cover of José González’s “Crosses.” But aside from a few early, exploratory pieces on SoundCloud, that was pretty much it. One listener eager for more was the ambient composer Julianna Barwick, who discovered the French producer’s music in the background of an Instagram video. “I let the video cycle seemingly endlessly as I thought, this is maybe the most beautiful music I have ever heard,” Barwick writes. “Once I found out who the maker was I scoured the internet for whatever I could get my hands on. It ended up being a treasure hunt—finding bits of her voice and textures hidden in mixes, compilations, and radio shows.” Barwick, a guest curator of Joyful Noise Recordings’ White Label series, the label’s platform for “undiscovered or underappreciated bands,” tapped Malibu for a record. Malibu’s early music took prettiness—which conventional critical wisdom typically has deemed inferior to more “serious” attributes, like complexity or nuance—and raised it to the level of the sublime. One Life is no exception. If anything, the five-track mini-LP further accentuates the wide-eyed rapture of her early work. Its primary materials are lush strings, endless reverb, and the suggestion of vastness that the pairing of the two implies. It is unabashedly atmospheric, right down to the sounds of rolling surf that accompany two songs (a tribute, perhaps, to Malibu’s oceanographer father). It’s not hard to hear the ways that Malibu is inspired by film music; any of these songs could work wonders as soundtrack cues. The yearning cycles of the opening “Nana (Like a Star Made for Me)” are reminiscent of Ennio Morricone’s score for The Mission, but melody here is generally secondary to mood. She favors long, held tones that arc wistfully toward the horizon; at most, we get a rising, three-note figure like the one at the heart of “Lost at Sea”—less a song than a clothesline from which to hang the airiest of emotions. Malibu’s formless melancholy shares something in common with Grouper, but where Grouper is lo-fi, Malibu is hi-def. I could be wrong, but her washes of strings typically sound synthesized or sampled, in any case ersatz—they’re a little too smooth to be the sound of a real orchestra. But this quality adds to their nostalgic air; in their too-perfect surfaces, they echo those films that didn’t have the budget for a full orchestral score, and instead made do with synths and software. This isn’t vaporware, but it faintly resembles that genre’s obsolete-media sheen. Another point of comparison is Wolfgang Voigt’s GAS project, though where he typically swirled his symphonic samples into murky gloom, Malibu’s music gleams. One Life’s simplicity can be deceiving. A little like a quartz crystal, what at first looks like a radiant, unblemished surface turns richly contoured when viewed up close. The interplay of contrasting textures is most vivid in the forlorn “Lost at Sea,” one of several tracks to feature the British cellist and songwriter Oliver Coates. For several minutes, the widescreen sweep of piano and strings swells and recedes, tiptoeing right up to the edge of maudlin. Then, faintly, the resiny scrape of Coates’ bow rises in the mix, sawing rapidly away, as though cutting against the grain. The overwhelming consonance turns microtonal; around it all wordless voices hover, diffuse as a sunrise mist. It might just be, as it was for Barwick, the most beautiful music you’ve ever heard. The gorgeousness of it is almost overwhelming. But squint a little, and a world of microscopic detail flashes into focus.","The ambient, five-track mini-LP from the French producer further accentuates the wide-eyed rapture of her early work.

A Life of Crime,Office Culture,by: Jazz Monroe,Associate Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dbca787ba7e000008b7b34b/1:1/w_160/alifeofcrime.jpg,2019-11-07 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/office-culture-a-life-of-crime/,Whatever's Clever,"On their second album of sardonic soft rock, Office Culture stage a doomed venture into the big city. Deals are brokered, schemes devised, savings drained; love withers and melodies teeter; everything, it seems, is collapsing together. The title is A Life of Crime. Maybe the crime is stealing time back from the metropolis, or not scamming hard enough. The city sounds exhausting, the band thrilled to be there. When Office Culture recorded their debut, I Did the Best I Could, in 2017, the Brooklyn outfit was building on the scrappy solo demos of Winston Cook-Wilson, a songwriter and journalist. (Full disclosure: Cook-Wilson is also an occasional contributor to Pitchfork.) The follow-up’s lavishness suits him: Office Culture at large sound clumsy yet suave, as if honoring the social imperative to project extravagance while scrambling to get by. A Life of Crime toys with this and other modern ironies, not least in its palette of schmoozey lounge jazz for jittery loners. Flirtatious licks sneak beyond the songs’ borders and into illicit fifth bars. Synths gouge space from under the vocals, Cook-Wilson crooning and pirouetting like a drunk trespasser in the Hamptons. The vocals are theatrical, the sophistipop textures faintly ludicrous. But what might scan as faux sincerity transpires to be heartfelt affect, perhaps with an air of class performance. Money isn’t a theme of the record so much as the water in which its characters swim. Some of Cook-Wilson’s sharpest lyrics are relationship riddles that riff on the deceptions of the free market, like the whirlwind romance styled as a “Ponzi scheme for two” on “Monkey Bone.” His transactional wordplay gestures toward a millennial quandary: the way precarious living conditions and hyper-monetization test our faith in love, too. As received wisdom lets our industries fail and planet burn, why cling to any old myths at all? Drift and instability trickle from the lyrics down into the music, tilting schmaltz into the realm of the uncanny. Hovering between Talk Talk bliss and the netherworld of Scott Walker’s Climate of Hunter is “Diamonds,” a Silicon Valley satire over a morass of slap bass and brass. “A Sign” is so smooth it haunts, somehow suggesting a sax solo that isn’t there. It’s sleek music for a cursed place, opulent like a ritzy hotel lounge. Given its soft-rock lineage, A Life of Crime could probably bluff through a shift on the strip-mall speakers, but it pitches to the nerds and crate-diggers, by turns summoning the Blue Nile, Gaucho-era Steely Dan, and the Destroyer of Kaputt. “Diamonds” delights in antic concepts and cadences (“Munching on that crudité…. pogo-sticking ’round the Valley”), though where a songwriter like Dan Bejar would exude playful self-assurance, Office Culture’s camp feels desperate to please, as if Cook-Wilson were a bumped-up understudy for some less florid singer. His vocal calligraphy might be overbearing were it not for the luminous backdrop, where no note is wasted and economy is king. The result, a jaunt around the urban imagination, could scarcely be better company. Like cigar-jacket city pop or a penthouse Postcard Records, the music charms as it pontificates, swept up in the alchemy whereby songs redeem otherwise terrible places. On the right backstreet, a tune like “Hard Times in the City” could exorcise an abandoned building and make its ghosts sing, elevate the dive bars and the loneliness we take there. For all its intricacies, A Life of Crime plays like a half-remembered travelogue, comprising diary entries from the cities you passed through while finding your way home. How far we can drift, it muses, even when it feels like we’re sinking.","Winston Cook-Wilson’s second album of sly, extravagant sophistipop is sleek music for a cursed place, and a heartfelt cry for lonely city strivers.

Myths 004,Cate Le BonBradford Cox,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db9cf80f08dde000956f3eb/1:1/w_160/myths004.jpg,2019-11-06 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cate-le-bon-bradford-cox-myths-004/,Mexican Summer,"Every year at the Marfa Myths festival in Texas, a pair of musicians assemble to produce an off-the-cuff EP, which Mexican Summer then releases as part of its Myths series. Like Bon Iver and the Dessner brothers’ PEOPLE platform (now called 37d03d), it offers a low-key opportunity for well-known acts to try out new collaborations that might last, or might not. Either way, it quietly insists that process is important, and that low-stakes team-ups can sometimes yield beautiful results. Bradford Cox’s Myths release with Cate Le Bon captures the pair of tender oddballs affirming their commonality. While they hail from the disparate environments of working-class Atlanta and rural Wales, they share an aptitude for unshowy beauty, idiosyncratic freakouts, and surrealist punk humor. They invest themselves fully in each aspect of their craft, never treating the less-realized elements like a sideshow. Le Bon also co-produced Deerhunter’s eighth album Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared? during those Marfa sessions, drawing out the poppiest side of the band in some time. Myths 004 has a woolier charm, running on antic, inventive rhythms that suggest a Rube Goldberg device. Most impromptu collaborations have an air of “you had to be there.” But Myths 004 creates a magnetic and singular world from the beginning, aided by collaborators Stella Mozgawa, Stephen Black, Tim Presley, and Samur Khouja. “Come ride with me baby, I’m long in the tooth,” Cox croaks on “Canto,” while a rhythmic motif creaks like a bad rotator cuff; every time he sings “your eyes your eyes your eyes” (which is to say: many times), the hard “Z” of “eyes” pairs with the sharp scrape of a cabasa. The effect is unsettling and absorbing. What’s missing from Myths 004 is the opportunity to hear Cox and Le Bon singing together. Other than barely-there backing vocals, their voices only share space on “Secretary,” and their parts don’t interlace, which is a shame given that the song seems like a quiet hymn to togetherness. At first Le Bon sounds distant, then she softens into a comforting refrain as she offers to “put you through to everyone or anyone”; the song concludes with Cox offering an oblique monologue full of arresting imagery (“mascara brushed across the planes”), like a Rushmore-style high-school savant staging a labored-over play comprehensible only to him. Though their individual work doesn’t suggest people who need encouragement to get weird, there’s a freewheeling silliness to parts of Myths 004 that suggests two conspirators egging each other on (a quality also in evidence on Le Bon’s records with Tim Presley as DRINKS). “Fireman” is quite disturbing: they set a pitched-down sample of (presumably) an actual fireman narrating the story of a blaze that claimed a family but spared their puppy against jittery piano and Le Bon’s blank-eyed incantations (“fire in the kitchen … fire in my mind”). And yet, it might be more disturbing to hear the distinctively poised Le Bon coming undone amid the queasy guitar of “What Is She Wearing” as she recounts a litany of daily indignities in a stilted tone that suggests pure improvisation and a unique comic eye. It’s a post-punk Falling Down: She rails about taking the bins out, forgetting to bring bags to the supermarket and having to pay 5p for a new one (a British environmental policy), wearing a shitty t-shirt under a sweater only for the hot weather to play “a cruel trick” on her, forcing her to remove her upper layer and reveal the shitty t-shirt underneath. Each offence is followed by the blunt exclamation: “THAT IS NOT NICE.” Then the neighbors chime in, commenting on her nest-like hair and affirming her suspicions that everyone is looking at her “as if I have committed a crime.” It’s the last track on Myths 004, and after marinating in Le Bon and Cox’s headspace, it might strike you as the funniest song ever recorded. But it’s the friction in this fevered vignette that makes it as satisfying as a scratching post: a reminder of the unwieldy and neurotic glory of creativity, and of life.

[USA],Anamanaguchi,by: Noah Yoo,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dbaf742ac499900082d1890/1:1/w_160/anamanaguchi_USA.jpg,2019-11-06 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/anamanaguchi-usa/,Polyvinyl,"Six years ago, Brooklyn chiptune band Anamanaguchi—beloved for their blend of guitars and low-bit video game sounds—crowdfunded $277,399 in support of their second album, Endless Fantasy. Newly flush with cash, they set to work sending pizza to space. Footage of the lonely cosmic slice eventually made its way into a music video, but it’s hard not to roll your eyes at the whole scenario: Four men in their mid-20s convince their extremely logged-on fans to give them a quarter of a million and proceed to blow it on a dollar slice in the name of art. Yet, goofy as the space pizza was, the stunt netted Anamanaguchi a level of press coverage they’d never seen before. It landed them a slot on Fallon, a landmark moment for chiptune devotees. The album itself was a riotous genre masterpiece full of cutesy cat sounds, Weezer-esque turbo-punk, and square-wave synth-pop. But no fantasy is endless. In 2014, as the band announced that their next album would be titled [USA], the country’s reality began to visibly splinter. That same year, the reactionary ideology behind Gamergate sent shockwaves through the gaming community and laid out a blueprint for the online culture wars. Amid all of this, Anamanaguchi began to look inward, troubled by the “indulgent” daydreaming of their 75-minute double album. “When people ask why it was so sugar-coated before, it’s because things were more sugar-coated,” guitarist Ary Warnaar recently said. “I wasn’t losing friends that were dying when I was younger. I am now.” Five years in the making, [USA] addresses these “unavoidable realities” for the first time. Neither Warnaar nor co-leader Peter Berkman, who share songwriting duties, sing on the album. Instead, they recruit a handful of female vocalists—former tourmate and virtual Japanese Vocaloid pop star Hatsune Miku among them—to lend their voices on certain tracks. Still, with the exception of Grimes collaborator HANA’s star turn on the blown-out synth-pop anthem “On My Own,” the vocal features are inessential. It falls to Berkman and Warnaar to compose intentional arrangements that demonstrate just how Anamanaguchi’s perspective has shifted. Endless Fantasy was predicated on a slapdash marriage of power-pop and vintage video game palettes, and while the premise remains, [USA] feels more purposeful and less hedonistic. The previous album’s neon-soaked aesthetic is replaced by a more refined synthesis of those same musical influences, capable of capturing anxiety as well as joy. No longer simply mining the nostalgia archives for inspirational SoundFonts, Anamanaguchi are now interrogating what it means to be the most prominent representatives of chiptune, a niche genre predicated on recontextualizing the escapist magic of an entirely separate artistic medium. Like some of the most celebrated games in recent memory, [USA] uses breaks in the fourth wall to subvert expectations. For every anthemic breakdown, there’s a jab of melancholia, a taste of the real world. The jagged synthesizer cliffs of “Tear,” the album’s emotional centerpiece, fall away at the beginning of “We Die,” replaced by a cascade of non sequiturs: flashes of acoustic guitar, synthesized vocal fragments, muted handclaps. “Speak to You [Memory Messengers]” is an innocuous interlude until it abruptly cuts off with the digital equivalent of a guitar cable jiggling in its socket. The video for another highlight, “Air On Line,” opens with a 3-D rendering of the space pizza from 2013, before the camera pans out to reveal an entire field of space debris floating in Earth’s orbit. The message is clear: It doesn’t matter how sheltered you want to be. You can’t hide forever. Nowhere is this more direct than on the opening title track, where dreamy NES peals are interrupted by a murky, vocoded chorus reciting the well-worn patriotic chant now more commonly associated with nationalist rallies: “U-S-A. U-S-A. U-S-A.” As the voices grow louder, the eight-bit plucks glitch and fade, leaving a harsh grind of textures against a barren, warped soundscape. When the chant returns later on “Tear,” this time voiced by a text-to-speech bot, it feels like a pointed reminder: In this life, ugliness and beauty will always exist in equal measure. But the band is quick to clarify that the title [USA] is not actually about the United States of America; it’s more of a shorthand for working through their own identities, “American” included. “It’s about being from somewhere and having like a label attached to you, your personal relationship to it, and your personal relationship with any assumption,” Warnaar has said. “We could’ve called the album [Chiptune], because it’s a genre that’s always attached to us from the beginning.” They also could have also gone with [Gamer]—after all, it was in this decade that “gamer” really coalesced into an identity. It was gamers behind the targeted harassment campaigns of Gamergate, and it’s also gamers who recently gathered to protest the censorship of a professional esports athlete who spoke out in favor of pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong. Games, sports, fashion—none of the trifling leisures of modern life can feign political neutrality anymore. In the attempt to find themselves, Anamanaguchi have made their most emotionally grounded record, one that speaks to the fragmented state of their environment. [USA] may rarely achieve the melodically overstuffed giddiness of Endless Fantasy, but it reveals more humanity than first meets the eye.

Bin Reaper,ShittyBoyz BabyTron,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dbb10bca294dc0009cac07d/1:1/w_160/Babytron_binreaper.jpg,2019-11-06 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shittyboyz-babytron-bin-reaper/,TheHipHopLab,"In the last three months, the Detroit rap trio BabyTron, StanWill, and TrDee (collectively known as The Shittyboyz) have emerged with punchline-heavy, ahead-of-the-beat raps in which they send their girlfriends into department stores with stolen credit cards and ruin the credit of grannies so they can punch themselves a gift from Saks Fifth. The production should be classified as “breakdancing on cardboard type beats”; their producers flip ’80s dance pop reminiscent of the Beverly Hills Cop theme song into typical funky Detroit instrumentals. The most polished of the trio is ShittyBoyz BabyTron, a 19-year-old that rocks a bowl haircut like a Disney Channel star, wears throwback NBA jerseys like a frat boy at a music festival, and raps confidently about the scams that have supported him since the days when he used to keep a credit-card chip reader in his high school gym locker room. In August, the ShittyBoyz stumbled into a small but fervent following. The trio were beneficiaries of the rise of the 18-year-old Teejayx6, who made Detroit the epicenter for raps about IP strength and stolen social security numbers this past summer. BabyTron’s debut solo mixtape, Bin Reaper, arrives at a moment that’ll decide if the ShittyBoyz gimmick has legs or if it’s bound to get lost in the internet cycle. Bin Reaper is simple, and BabyTron doesn’t overthink the situation: 13 songs of pop culture-referencing punchlines and ’80s video game arcade beats. Sometimes he’ll compare his credit card punching to an anime like One Punch Man; he’ll rap over a sample of Undertaker’s WWE theme song. At one point, he compares his criminal record, which probably has him on a government watch list, to NBA players like Zion Williamson, Clint Capela, and Giannis Antetokounmpo. Detroit superproducer Helluva laces BabyTron with grooves that sound direct from a Richard Simmons workout video. “Jesus Shuttlesworth” and “Scampire” are maybe the mixtape’s two best tracks; unsurprisingly, they’re both just BabyTron shit-talk and funky Helluva flips. BabyTron even holds his own when he tackles a more typical Detroit beat. “Now I punch shit like Jean-Claude Van Damme,” he brags on “Pro Surfers,” going toe-toe with Michigan punchline savant Rio Da Yung OG. By the time Bin Reaper reaches its final track, some of the flips are tired, especially when left in less capable hands than Helluva’s (See: “Special Thanks” and “Top Ten”). But the appeal of BabyTron’s music, like so much of Detroit rap, is that it feels like it was made in a bubble. Take any song on Bin Reaper, adjust the pop-culture references, and tell somebody unfamiliar with the ShittyBoyz that it was made in 2000, or 2010, or 2019, they would believe you. BabyTron has a gimmick and he’s aware of it. But it’s a good gimmick, and sometimes in rap, that’s all you need.","The Detroit scam rapper doesn’t overthink his music: This is just 13 funky instrumentals punched up with funny pop-culture references.

His careful attention to the craft of production is accompanied by a tongue permanently in search of cheek. The prolific Moscow producer’s two contributions to Happy New Year! We Wish You Happiness!, a scene-setting 2018 compilation on Nina Kraviz’s Trip label, marked Buttechno (aka Pavel Milyakov) as the jester in the Trip camp, his songs bursting with mutant gabber, silly noises, and arcade-level Autechre experimentation. badtrip, a double EP that marks his first full release for the label, confirms his trickster reputation. While there’s nothing laugh-out-loud funny here, all nine tracks are marked by the kind of puckish mischief you might find in Aphex Twin’s “Milkman” or Captain Beefheart’s legendarily opaque Trout Mask Replica, with an admirable degree of chaos underlying their punishing techno sound. “U.D.U.” is key to understanding the EP’s happy pandemonium. At first, the song sounds like a mess, an anarchic frenzy of industrial-grade bass drums, hi-hats, snares, and toms suggesting two entirely unrelated tracks leaking into your headphones. Listen closely, though, and “U.D.U.” starts to make a wonderful kind of sense as the various beats—forward, backward, pitched up and down—pull at the limits of a 4/4 cadence to create a bizarrely funky breed of chaos that is all the more sublime for being slightly unfathomable. The fabulous “wb movement” is similarly bewildering, with shakers, hi-hats, and snares positioned around the bass-drum pulse in off-kilter patterns that seem designed to unsettle the listener’s rhythmic instincts. “j become,” on the other hand, is sneakily mischievous. On first evidence, the track is a fairly standard replica of the early Trax records that were designed to put the wind up your nightgown via pummeling beats, relentless synth hooks, and menacing vocal lines, only for Milyakov to yank the bass drum backwards half a beat, so that the mix briefly resembles the kind of botched drop that gives amateur DJs waking nightmares. That he punctuates this effect with the sound of a record spinning back—precisely the move a nervous DJ would make to rescue the situation—suggests a producer who cares very little for the DJ-centric nature of techno. The manipulation of vocal hooks, a hallmark of recent Trip releases, is also in evidence here. On “BBBASE” vocal samples tumble about the octaves like socks in a washing machine, spinning a psychedelic web of noise around the nonchalant central riff, while the gruff robotic vocal that runs through “pkds” and “tr-919” becomes so maddeningly repetitive you suspect annoying the listener might actually be the point. These two songs illustrate badtrip’s principal weakness, namely an occasional tendency to ramble that seems at odds with the lunatic energy of “U.D.U” or “wb movement.” “Ferenz-18” worries at its central synth melody like a cat with a dying vole, the track prickling along like a distressed take on Isolée’s classic “Beau Mot Plage”; it could stand to lose a good two minutes, while “pkds” and “tr-919” are seriously overstretched. badtrip doesn’t give any simple answers. DJs will be put off by the EP’s rhythmic roguery, while home listeners may be frustrated by sporadic needless repetition. At its best, though, badtrip’s musical imagination rides gloriously roughshod over the conventions of techno.","On a double EP for Nina Kraviz’s Trip label, the Russian producer delivers punishing techno shot through with happy pandemonium.

Feet of Clay,Earl Sweatshirt,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc0c1fac617e600080c519b/1:1/w_160/Feet%20of%20Clay.jpg,2019-11-05 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/earl-sweatshirt-feet-of-clay/,Tan CressidaWarner,"Last year, around the time he released Some Rap Songs and ended his deal with Columbia Records, Thebe Kgositsile said he was looking forward to “doing riskier shit.” Apparently, that meant turning his already-insular music darker and more inscrutable. The rapper, better known as Earl Sweatshirt, doesn’t offer much direct commentary on Feet of Clay. Instead, he pushes further into the murky territory he began mapping on Some Rap Songs, loosening up his flow, letting down his guard, and wandering ever-further into the recesses of his mind. Kgositsile has described Feet of Clay, his latest seven-track, 15-minute project, as “a collection of observations and feelings recorded during the death throes of a crumbling empire.” The title references the Bible’s Book of Daniel: in it, the prophet interprets a dream of Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar, in which he sees a colossal statue made of four metals: a head of gold, arms and chest of silver, body and thighs of brass, and feet of iron and clay. Daniel tells Nebuchadnezzar the statue represents the kingdoms of the Earth, starting with Babylon, and that a stone cut by non-human hands will fall on the statue’s feet and destroy it, a metaphor for the end times. “We at the feet of clay right now,” Kgositsile told Apple Music. “We posted up live from burning Rome.” His verses don’t give much clarity to that ambitious context so much as they offer fragments: “I beat you to the point/My noose is golden/True and livin,’ lonesome/Pugilistic moments/Riveting, come get to know me at my innermost/My family business anguish, now I need atonement,” he raps on “OD.” The line hints at Kgositsile’s grief over his father, who passed in 2018. This is the project he made in the wake of that loss. The pall of death haunts the edges of his rhymes; birds of prey circle carrion on “74,” and on “OD” he raps, “My memory really leaking blood/It’s congealing, stuck.” If these are confessions, they are delivered in code, and the meaning comes from the sounds of the words themselves. As a teenage prodigy, Kgositsile leaned hard on his technical skill. Now an adult, he still cares deeply about craft, but he seems to be thinking differently about delivery and performance. There are moments on Feet of Clay when he seems to be actively subverting ideas of what being good at rapping sounds like. On “East,” which pairs blunted raps with a harsh accordion-like wail, he mutters “had a story careen against the bars,” and it’s the closest he’s come to defining the style he’s striving for: narrative and emotional, physical and abstract. As with Some Rap Songs, this project is heavily influenced, in aesthetic and tone, by the New York City rap underground; not just recent Earl Sweatshirt collaborators like MIKE, Medhane, and Ade Hakim but also minimalist Ka, dialectician billy woods, and impressionist Akai Solo. Kgositsile has adapted rather quickly to this gloomy, withdrawn world of distorted jazz and R&B loops supporting his talky cadences. This is straight-up anti-pop-rap: unpolished, unevenly mixed, structurally unbalanced, primarily self-produced, and polarizing. The warped, bassy “4N,” which accounts for nearly a third of the project’s running time, partners him with fellow recluse Mach-Hommy, the brusque and enterprising Jersey rapper Kgositsile has long admired. As the beat winds like a skipping record, they keep everyone at arm’s length. There is some more traditional production: the Mavi-assisted “El Toro Combo Meal” dusts off a vintage soul sample, and the Alchemist-produced “Mtomb” bends Mtume’s “Theme For the People” into a sputtering hymn. But even these are merely cushions for wrestling with deep-seated trauma. On the latter: “Piscean just like my father, still got bones to pick out/For now let’s salt the rims and pour a drink out.” There is a punch-drunk quality to Kgositsile’s verses that occasionally makes them seem like stoned spitballing. But they have the looseness of freestyles, a nonlinear flow he may have picked up from Mavi, a pupil turned sparring partner. They don’t sound half-baked so much as purposefully unfinished, a move even further off the grid for one of our most promising shut-ins. Nearly a decade after becoming a prodigal rap savant, Earl Sweatshirt is still burning old selves in effigy, figuring out who he wants to be in real time.","A woozy, raw, magical, and extremely short album from hip-hop’s most tantalizingly inscrutable rapper.

FIBS,Anna Meredith,by: Piotr Orlov,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db30763fd8a1f0009ad5a70/1:1/w_160/AnnaMeredith_FIbs.jpg,2019-11-05 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/anna-meredith-fibs/,Black Prince Fury,"The clarion sounds that opened Anna Meredith’s first pop recording—a Novation synthesizer’s brass and tuba presets and a cello, on “Nautilus,” from the 2012 EP Black Prince Fury—simultaneously created her musical trademark and set her on a fresh path. The phrase is a bold, symphonic fanfare that, once the rock drums hit, announced a genre-free space while helping Meredith ascend from the contemporary classical sandbox. The song became something like the Scottish composer/producer/singer-songwriter’s sonic signature, returning on subsequent releases (her 2016 full-length debut, Varmints, as well as Bo Burnham’s 2018 film Eighth Grade, which also features her gorgeous original score); variants now reappear throughout her new album FIBS. Most importantly, it highlighted how Meredith brings musical tropes familiar to the masses—in this case, marches of cinematic elephants and stormtroopers, or textures of grime and Southern hip-hop, or the pulse of Carnival parades—into rarified arts spaces, challenging assumptions about class, meaning, and volume inherent to both concert halls and clubs, while trying to keep the fun and the seriousness in both. These are also among the social and narrative tensions at the heart of FIBS. With her second proper album, Meredith shelves the notion of a small group making symphonic dramas and instead takes increasing advantage of the dynamic power that a synth- and guitar-driven band can generate, in the way that some downtown New York composers did during punk’s heyday. The shift also informs her music’s sentimental upheaval, giving it an increasing immediacy and wrapping it in a vaguely political air. FIBS never stoops to proclaim itself pro- or anti- any forces currently in diametric opposition (in the UK or around the world). But it is music that embodies this precarious historic juncture, mirroring the chaos and instability of the contemporary moment in its very form. In this, Meredith has written a set of pieces that better speaks to our era than her classically trained peers’ middlebrow drones and respectful sit-down music. FIBS is just too loud and nervy for that—kinda like the newsfeed. Even before “Nautilus,” Meredith seemed predestined for this terrain, with one foot in pop and another in new classical, and choreographing those limbs to brilliant effect. Her catalog—a solo for bassoon amplified like punk guitar; a Steve-Reich-meets-Stomp “Body Percussion” orchestral piece; an IDM mash-up of a brunch classic, etc.—is recommended to anyone bored by much of what passes for contemporary repertoire. After “Nautilus,” Meredith’s pop miniatures also reflected an art-school nature. It’s in her non-traditional instrumentation and songwriting, whose complex structures and crisp lyrical narratives have precedents throughout the UK’s  post-punk, art-prog, synth-pop timeline. Varmints was a wonderful embrace of this space, full of sinewy pop songs and instrumentals that echoed the propulsion of Pixies and New Order, often heavy on the backbeat, always rightfully assured in their own greatness. Yet from its title on down,Varmints also hinted that, while the drums and instrumental runs were intent on activating the serotonin, more diseased thoughts about the state of our institutions were also present. “Taken,” which featured Meredith amid a trio of voices and has the dark, muscular feel of synth pop on steroids, was unsparing in its take on a world that the sun once never set upon: “What seemed a good idea has fast become a fraying waste of time.” FIBS picks up the sentiment three years later, when those words not only don’t sound the slightest bit dated, they’re the foundation for the current rot. “Inhale Exhale” is FIBS’ own propulsive sequencer-and-toms prologue, but Meredith sounds like she’s singing from an island, exasperated: “You say you're dancing in the deep end/But to me, it looks like drowning/All this talk of saving, but I'm out of my depth.” Her wordless vocal ushers in the song’s primary melody, and a title-repeating chorus arrives with the kick drum and a stuttering bass synth; when the song rolls on, with all the layers working as a single mechanism, it explodes as a trebly pop runaway, at once hyper-vivid and hyper-tense. It is an expertly produced rush that foresees an imminent crash, delivered in a voice that has already lived its consequences. That chaotic uncertainty is the reality Meredith repeatedly presents on FIBS, both emotionally and through musical structure. It is the work’s deeper raison d’être, even when the individual pieces seem digestible, pretty, or even safe. The feverish “Sawbones” is a prog-rock hallucination, fluidly Frankensteining one sonic caricature onto another, juxtaposing high-pitched staccato keys with bass-synth splurges, mutating into guitar arpeggios that interact with disco hi-hats, and so on. “Calion” could easily qualify as a beatless techno piece, its muted kick appearing beneath undulating melodic percolations; yet soon enough a dubwise low end appears like an earthquake to destabilize the whole thing, as the swirling mass tumbles all around. “Bump” brings back the signature “Nautilus” textures with an even more egregious “Imperial March” nod, as Jack Ross’ guitar drills into its structure to make this song too fall apart before reconstituting as a mammoth one-note guitar-synth riff. “Paramour” tacks that familiar brass fanfare (tuba now courtesy of Tom Kelly) onto a hyperactive, electronics-driven instrumental, pairing them with a squealing guitar in the closest thing to funk syncopation that Meredith can be accused of. All of it is intense music of supreme control and a designed anarchy, full of loud proclamations that go a long way toward embodying the album’s title. The parts of FIBS that lie on the outskirts of these Technicolor spasms of pandemonium bring meaning and reprieve—on occasion, simultaneously. “Killjoy” musically quotes the Talking Heads’ “Road to Nowhere” while applying Meredith Monk-like vocal repetitions to wonderful verses that showcase a confrontation with modern life (“Thanking you for leaving/Do what’s best to save face…/Thanking you for stealing/What's left of the daytime”); the chorus follows these up as an assertion of personal will. “moonmoons” and “Limpet” are two of the softest and most musically straightforward instrumentals Meredith has set to record—the former a lovely duet between electronics and cello in which clouds gather and dissipate, the latter a guitar-heavy ride with a hook that features Meredith’s take on a Clearmountain pause. Those songs’ simplicity suggests the deep breath required of survival. Yet survival is not at all assured on the closing elegy “Unfurl,” where a suddenly vulnerable Meredith intones, “Something's bound to break/It better not be me.” And who could blame her? There is, throughout FIBS—and Anna Meredith’s career—a necessary act of pretension at play. Not the act of putting on airs or simple mimicry, but of pretending, what Eno once called the “thought experiments [of finding] out what it would be like to be otherwise” for culture’s benefit. What began with Meredith turning the Novation presets up to 11 and seeing how they fit with Bonham-like drums has, rather strangely, ended up a musical expression of dancing through a world full of lies, not wanting to stop, and seeing where else it takes her. Back around “Nautilus,” Meredith said that, to her, “honesty is more interesting than originality.” Her acts of pretension have seen her wind up with a fair bit of both.","On her second album proper, the Scottish producer/composer/singer-songwriter dials up her rock band’s dynamic power, creating a nervy, chaotically controlled embodiment of contemporary uncertainty.

Saints and Sebastian Stories,Konradsen,by: Joshua Copperman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db369bda294dc0009cabcd1/1:1/w_160/konradsen.jpg,2019-11-05 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/konradsen-saints-and-sebastian-stories/,Cascine,"Norweigan duo Konradsen’s debut was written over a period of three years by band members and longtime friends Jenny Marie Sabel and Eirik Vildgren, and the meticulous attention to detail bears this out. Saints and Sebastian Stories moves from one lush set piece to the next, interrupted by the occasional spoken interlude. The instrumentation signifies folk, but the music is less inspired by contemporaries Jesca Hoop or Laura Marling than someone like Blonde-era Frank Ocean, even as the horn arrangements and quirky touches are indebted to Sufjan Stevens. Comparisons abound, though the result is less memorable than the influences. With the creativity of a bedroom recording and the polish of studio production, these 13 songs often feel like sketches. Found sounds and samples create a sense of familiarity, even when the music meanders. “Dice,” the first song Sabel and Vildgren made together, swaps out traditional percussion for the sounds of cutlery and clinking dishes. “Television Land” arrives with a bizarre prelude from a family friend (both the friend and the track are dubbed “Big Bruce”) before interpolating Bette Midler’s classic “The Rose,” referencing the Brad Pitt baseball drama Moneyball, and incorporating a surprisingly jazzy groove into its climax. The left-field references complement the music’s found-art aesthetic without really clarifying anything. Lead songwriter Sabel’s voice is airy and upfront, her singing alternating between conventional runs and babbling ad-libs. Still, a record this quiet needs lyrics that deliver, and that’s where Saints and Sebastian Stories begins to fall short. The imagery can be evocative (“Hold me closer/The rest is an odd mistake”), but they are too opaque by half. For every moment of clarity (“Some say I should never be a mother/It’s a loving thought I left to die,” from closer “Written to the Others”) there are long stretches where they seem to be saying nothing much with great effort. With time the music blends together, until initially beguiling arrangements become less surprising. The drum break in “Give” or the unexpected saxophone solo that closes “Roasted” are gorgeous, but the songs don’t gel. The influences seem to become more overt as well; the self-conscious Justin Vernon mimicry of “Baby Hallelujah” is distracting, and “Warm Wine” recalls José Gonzélez’s electronic experiments without reinterpreting them. Listeners fond of early 2010s folk like the moody, wandering Ben Howard or Americana trio the Staves will feel at home in Konradsen’s record. Both Howard and the Staves took ambitious detours after finding initial success with less interesting music; Konradsen’s approach skips the groundwork to go for experimentation. It’s folk music untethered from tradition, prioritizing well-crafted production over well-crafted songwriting.","Combining folk instrumentation and found sound, the Norwegian duo’s debut fosters a sense of familiarity, even when the music meanders.

Boundary Road Snacks and Drinks EP,Dry Cleaning,by: Colin Lodewick,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db31b06a294dc0009cabc61/1:1/w_160/drycleaning_boundaryroadsnacksanddrinks.jpg,2019-11-05 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dry-cleaning-boundary-road-snacks-and-drinks-ep/,It's OK,"If you use a notes app for more than just passwords and grocery lists, it quickly becomes a chaotic archive of dream interpretations, draft texts, and years-old epiphanies. Florence Shaw, vocalist of post-punk quartet Dry Cleaning, turns those notes into lyrics about finding connection in an apathetic world. On the band’s new EP Boundary Road Snacks and Drinks, Shaw picks up where August’s Sweet Princess EP left off, confronting loneliness and desire through lists and non sequiturs. She comments on duvet covers, an abandoned fridge, hot people, a banana. Spread across six tracks, these observations represent more than just banal references to personal history. They track a practice of looking, one that places the everyday under a microscope to find out what lies within. “Do you believe that hard work is what it takes to be successful?” Shaw asks on opener “Dog Proposal,” and without lingering, opines: “Hard work has very little to do with success.” The line acts as an overture, inverting one contemporary western belief in preparation for a larger attempt to expose the absurdity of the most trivial aspects of modern life. Repeating the lyric, “I’ve joined a gym, I’ve joined a gym close to the office,” Shaw creates a loop of professional small talk that turns meaningless conversation into a critique of itself. Shaw never sounds removed from the behaviors she observes. “Stream, stream, stream my favorite shows/Just tell me who dies and who finds love,” she sings on “Spoils,” as if watching with glassy eyes. She portrays herself as stuck, not unhappily, in a life of monotonous routine, attached but disinterested at the same time. She dissects her own emotional states with equal coolness. In the latter half of “Viking Hair,” she asks a lover: “Stick up for me/Do what you’re told but sometimes tell me what to do as well/I just want to sexually experiment on a nice safe pair of hands/Don’t judge me, just hold still.” The relentless push of electric guitar and drums lends her words both a sense of confidence and the surreality of a film soundtrack. Shaw’s habit of poking fun of the life she leads, yet leading it nonetheless, loses its humor on the aptly titled “Sombre One.” Over ascending and descending notes on electric guitar, she delivers lines detached from narrative in a slow, heavy monotone. She repeats phrases, telling herself that “everything is easy to get out and put back quickly” as if seeking consolation in the pages of an instruction manual. Reciting a to-do list, she whispers, “Don’t get burnt by the sun’s rays.” Against spare guitar and a dull drumbeat, the line feels pregnant with self-reproach, as if Shaw is ashamed to remind herself to do so little. “Sombre One” imbues jagged, stream-of-consciousness lyrics with melancholy, and it almost falters under the weight of its own self-seriousness. But before the song ends, the instruments fade away, and Shaw’s voice is heard from a distance, delivering a mix of lyrics from other songs like spoken-word poems. It’s a self-reflexive moment for the band, one that turns their signature re-purposing of phrases (“Rest in heavenly peace,” “Amazing voice, amazing body”) back on themselves. By treating language as a machine to be taken apart, Dry Cleaning crystallize experience with just a few images and turns of phrase. It’s enough to make you sift through the minutiae of your own life in search of meanings you’ve overlooked.","The London post-punk band’s lists and non sequiturs expose the absurdity of modern life from the inside.

GOTH ANGEL SINNER EP,Lil Peep,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dbc80bbd8e09f00087f6255/1:1/w_160/lilpeep_gothangelsinner.jpg,2019-11-04 06:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lil-peep-goth-angel-sinner-ep/,AUTNMY,"Posthumous releases go through a quick, sad diminishing-returns cycle. The first one is usually the closest to the artist’s vision, and subsequent releases require deeper digs into the vault and more intervention to make whatever’s left back there presentable. That’s especially true of posthumous rap projects, which are subject to ever-more questionable guest features and production choices. With every release the artist’s presence grows fainter, the doubts about whether they would have wanted this louder. Lil Peep’s posthumous output is subject to those same laws of gravity, even if so far the stewards of his legacy have done right by him. Save for a bonus track featuring XXXTentacion that Peep might not have approved of, 2018’s thoughtfully compiled Come Over When You’re Sober, Pt. 2 was, if not quite Peep's vision, at least a respectful imagining of what it might have been. And in some ways its follow-up EP GOTH ANGEL SINNER, short as it is, feels even more like Peep’s creation. Peep revealed the title himself on Twitter in 2017, just weeks before his overdose death at age 21. He performed its opening track “Moving On” on his final tour, and even co-directed the video for its closer “When I Lie.” The video isn’t much—a spur of the moment, one-take shoot filmed in a green room while on tour in Germany—but it’s evidence these three songs aren’t empty leftovers. They are, at minimum, vestiges of a project Peep cared about. Lil Peep emerged at a time when it was no longer unusual for a young rapper to identify more with Kurt Cobain than Tupac. But where many of his SoundCloud peers embraced rock mostly as an ideal, borrowing its imagery and attitude but not necessarily its sounds, Peep made alternative a foundation of his aesthetic, and like much of his final output, GOTH ANGEL SINNER splits the difference between rap and modern rock. “Belgium” cloaks itself in a flanneled, In Utero-shaped riff, while the guitars on “When I Lie” crackle and glower like Linkin Park. None of these tracks do anything fancy. They’re disarmingly direct, barebones enough that they feel like demos despite their crisp finish. It’s Peep’s intuitive phrasing that makes them soar. “I was out in Belgium on tour, that’s the day that I convinced myself that I was truly yours,” he scowls, and as wordy as that prose reads on paper, his groggy delivery imbues every syllable with intention and implied backstory. His writing is never flashy, but it’s flowered with nonchalant internal rhyme: “Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind/I’m not evil by design but I feel dead at times,” he raps on “When I Lie,” in a flow at once drowsy and purposeful. He was so good at this. Lil Peep’s fame hadn’t peaked when he died, and GOTH ANGEL SINNER is further evidence of how high his ceiling was. Especially given how Post Malone rode a related strain of emotive, rock-suggestive rap to fame and fortune, it’s easy enough to imagine the star that Peep could have become. But posthumous releases can only tell us so much we didn't already know. They can only speak to what no longer is, not what would have been. And as welcome as any unreleased Peep material is, the declines are already on display on GOTH ANGEL SINNER: It sounds a lot like Come Over When You’re Sober, Pt. 2, but there’s a lot less of it. It’s possible there’s still some worthwhile material left in Peep’s vault, but it’s increasingly unlikely there are any revelations.","These three tracks come from the last project the beloved emo rapper worked on before he died. They remind us how good he was, but don’t yield new insights.

Monster (25th Anniversary Edition),R.E.M.,by: Brad Nelson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db1dc140c9c6a0008f6b8fd/1:1/w_160/monster.jpg,2019-11-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rem-monster-25th-anniversary-edition/,Craft,"At the time of its release in 1994, Monster was too strange and sinuous to grasp. The once-underground band had recently garnered huge mainstream success with accessible, drowsily sad songs like “Everybody Hurts” and tightly-strung mood dioramas like “Losing My Religion.” But now every time a guitar tone rippled through an R.E.M. song it threatened to consume it entirely. Michael Stipe’s voice, when intelligible, sang in low, burred tones about sex, marketing, possessive crushes, and the constant reinvention of the self to appear more appealing to the subject of one’s possessive crush. Just as often his voice would echo off of itself or dart between radioactive blooms of guitar. For new fans of R.E.M., Monster didn’t sound like anything on the radio, and it certainly didn’t sound like 1992’s Automatic for the People. It sounded like something that had to be put back where it came from. Despite debuting at No. 1 on the Billboard album charts, Monster is primarily known as a used record. The blurred bear illustration on the front cover became a recognizable orange swell in every used record store’s dollar bin. Why did fans and non-fans alike quietly reject Monster? For one, Monster was a fatal attempt to return to the band’s roots—to the taut, sparkling rock they made in the '80s. By the time they recorded Automatic, the band had traveled far afield musically, into pastoral realms where the strum of a mandolin guided processionals about death and suffering. They hadn’t toured in five years and they worried these quieter, more introverted songs would result in them playing slow, gloomy sets sitting atop stools. They needed a dramatic shift. “We smashed [the acoustic guitars] against the wall and told the string players to go home,” Stipe said at the time. Peter Buck had recently switched to playing Les Paul guitars, and the sounds he pulled out of them made his amps buzz like beehives. They were going to write an album full of punk songs that would be fun to play live. It was supposed to rock. Some of Monster indisputably rocks. A lot of it wobbles sideways like an amoeba, including the two songs that blossom from near-identical tremolo riffs, “Crush with Eyeliner” and “I Took Your Name.” One song, “Tongue,” sounds beamed in from a piano lounge on the moon. (During the 1995 show included with the 25th-anniversary reissue of the record, Stipe introduces “Tongue” by saying it has “a little bit of a ‘Luscious Jackson, roller derby’ vibe to it,” which nails it.) Another, “Let Me In,” written after the suicide of Stipe’s friend Kurt Cobain, is more funereal than almost anything on Automatic, a storm of overcompressed electric guitar chords that resembles the sound of the ocean when you close your eyes. Another, “King of Comedy,” is driven by an unusually harsh and rickety rhythm track, sounding like a machine barely held together by screws and breathing large plumes of exhaust. It’s hard to determine how Monster got this way and the demos included with this reissue aren’t edifying. The band declined to throw in any embryonic versions of songs that actually appear on the record; we’ll never know if or how “King of Comedy” was assembled piece-by-glitching-piece. Most of what is included isn’t even as heat-damaged as “Crush with Eyeliner” or “Circus Envy.” Instead, the demos here tend to be lost instrumentals and riffs for which Stipe never ended up writing lyrics. Some of them sound like instrumental sketches for an actual return-to-our-roots R.E.M. record—the comfortable jangle of the demo “Uptempo Ricky,” its bassline like a searchlight playing over introspective minor chords, could have resembled one of phantoms looming out of the mist on their debut album Murmur had it been completed and recorded by early-R.E.M. producers Don Dixon and Mitch Easter. But the 1994 Monster as-released tends to outright reject R.E.M.’s past. It reaches beyond their own history, into darker, more seductive forms of rock’n’roll. They moved away from the punk and classic rock tropes that formed the gnarled sound of their younger grunge contemporaries, foraging for a more flexible style and manner of performance practiced by figures such as Marc Bolan, Lou Reed, and Iggy Pop: glam rock. Glam would allow R.E.M. to be loud and crude but in such a theatrically exaggerated way that the crudeness had double and triple meanings trailing like shadows behind it. It emphasized the primacy of image as well as its inherent artificiality, using empty-headed rock’n’roll as a vehicle for poetry and subversion. If R.E.M. had to be a popular rock band again, if they had to commit their ideas and performances directly to tape with minimal overdubs, they would also find a way to undercut the idea of a “popular rock band” at every turn of Monster, creating a record that has a simultaneously playful and hostile relationship to its own image. Consider the music video for “What’s the Frequency, Kenneth?”, the first single from Monster. Stipe was popular enough at the time to be recognized on the street, but for the entire first verse of “Kenneth,” the band is filmed from the chin-down and anonymized. Even when we finally glimpse Stipe, debuting his newly-shaved head and wearing a green T-shirt with a small red star on it, the camera loses focus and lingers at senseless angles that fail to contain the band’s performance. It feels like we see more of the garage and the varicolored lighting they’re playing in than we ever see them. Just like the record, it’s very ridiculous and kind of pointless and all about its own ridiculousness and pointlessness, something “cool” that also deliberately indicates the quotation marks hovering around “cool.” Buck described Monster in an interview as “the first record where we dare to be really dumb.” Stipe would also end up classifying Monster as obvious and silly, likely because, a few exceptions aside (“Stand,” “Shiny Happy People”), R.E.M. were used to making music that was oblique and shrouded in fog as a forest edge. Monster was far less guarded about what it was. Stipe came out as queer during the promotional roll-out for the record, and there’s a queerness to his presence throughout the record, an impish unreadability that morphs through different perspectives, as if coming out of the closet made him realize there were whole new sequences of closets to tumble through. As he tried to fit words to the increasingly bent and echoey sounds coming out of Buck’s amp, Stipe began to write in character. The characters that populate Monster are like funhouse mirror warpings of the self, appearing at times larger than life—the narrator of “I Took Your Name” is Satan—and at others frail and distended as an insect, as on “Tongue,” where Stipe sings in falsetto to convey the perspective of a woman who knows she’s being used for sex. “King of Comedy” unreels like the mission statement of a particularly un-self-aware advertising executive, exploiting everything imaginable for whatever money can be harvested from it. “Make it charged with controversy,” Stipe sings, underlining the constant flow of sex and capital with something like a smirk, “I’m straight I’m queer I’m bi.” That lyric, incidentally, is almost inaudible in the original mix of the record. For the reissue, producer Scott Litt, always dissatisfied with his initial mix, decided to clear away the woolen guitar overdubs that clotted over Stipe’s voice and raise its volume across the record. Stipe’s voice is uncannily clear at this altitude, shrugging off all of its old echoes like loose clothing. “Star 69” reveals itself as a song about some kind of telephonic extortion revolving around burning down a warehouse for the insurance money, though arguably the original mix better reflects the song’s plot by having Stipe’s voice quadrupled so it resembles a network of conspiratorial echoes. The instrumental shifts in Litt’s remix are, at best, pointlessly diverting, like the little Polynesian auroras of guitar he places underneath the chords of “Crush with Eyeliner,” making it the closest R.E.M. have approached surf rock. But at worst, Litt’s remix can be clueless and distracting—and it’s often both. Removing the shimmer of tremolo from the chorus of “What’s the Frequency, Kenneth?” erases one of the band’s most compelling hooks. “King of Comedy”’s remix reveals that it was only a coherent song by the grace and economy of Litt’s original mix; the new version sounds like it’s been sunk underwater and is short-circuiting. And the overwhelming guitar distortion that papered “Let Me In” like wet leaves, Litt mutes and decompresses, giving a song that once seemed like it was drowning in the rain of its own grief the naked and unfinished quality of a demo. What Litt misunderstands about Monster is that the inescapable excess of Buck’s guitar tone as well as the slipperiness of Stipe’s vocals are what make the record special; when you invert these effects, it starts to be indistinguishable from any other R.E.M. record. Monster is supposed to be brazenly proud of how alien and strange it is, the kind of record that would find it hilarious and Warholian that it was resold so many times to record stores that it became a near-worthless object. It can’t be defined, down to the album’s title, slippery as a shadow lurking in the background of a horror movie, elusive, gone as soon as it’s recognized. It’s like a Cheshire cat as a rock record, always shapeshifting around a fixed and somewhat sinister grin, saying true things with an ironic uncertainty and saying ironic things as if they were absolutely true. It’s just like Stipe sings in “King of Comedy”: “You can lie as long as you mean it.” (Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)","R.E.M.’s long misunderstood 1994 album isn’t clarified by the bonus material on this new reissue, but the original songs remain strangely oblique, full of glam rock poses and sly subterfuge.

Inside Unsolved EP,Project Pablo,by: Megan Buerger,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db71c93fd8a1f0009ad5c7c/1:1/w_160/projectpablo_insideunsolvedEP.jpg,2019-11-04 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/project-pablo-inside-unsolved-ep/,Spectral Sound,"More than engineered emotion or physical release, producer Patrick Holland’s hazy, unhurried house music tends to evoke a sense of place. The reference points, particularly under his Project Pablo project, are often autobiographical: earworm melodies and jazzy grooves that reflect his native Vancouver, where he grew up listening to live bands and breezy, West Coast house; wandering basslines and fuzzy textures that soundtrack urban Montreal, where he’s lived and deejayed since 2014; and the sleepy, pastoral expanse that exists between the two (his mellow 2018 album, Come to Canada You Will Like It, was a tribute to rural chill). Most of these productions, while imaginative and inviting, aren’t engrossing enough to send you rushing across the border. But Inside Unsolved, Holland’s new EP for Spectral Sound, offers a refreshingly edgy and stirring glimpse at Canada’s eccentric underground. This time, he reaches outside of his own narrative and revisits the country’s musical past—specifically the mid 1990s to early 2000s, when experimental, minimalist house and techno thrived in once-bustling steel towns. The resulting EP—part tribute, part reinterpretation—hat-tips a few of the influences that made Montreal the dance-music hotbed it is today. The project unfolds in four distinct tracks, each with its own vibe, like rooms in a labyrinthine warehouse party. You begin in the middle of the action. “The Solution,” a hypnotic, acid-laced techno groove, is about as big a dancefloor moment as we’ve seen from Holland—bouncy, structured, immediate—and drizzles woozy melodies over concrete, shuffling rhythms. Fluttering whistles and billowing synths make it feel alive and oddly pretty, like smokestack clouds floating over an industrial skyline. For an artist who occasionally veers from low-key to soporific, the song feels like an awakening. Elsewhere, the mood is more far out. “Pill” and “Big Room Delusion” rattle with dizzying, mechanical polyrhythms, like wandering around a factory floor. The beats are somewhat secondary, overpowered by the synthesizers’ twinkling arpeggios, scurrying scales, and dissipating echoes. The sensation is busy but emotionless, like the unconscious energy of an ambling machine. Both songs carry on a little too long, until the activity begins to feel slightly claustrophobic. But perhaps that’s a part of being in a place, too. Sometimes, you overstay your welcome and find yourself scanning for the exits. Holland said that he was specifically inspired by two Canadian labels: Steel City Records, a mid-’90s techno outlet from Hamilton, Ontario, that took cues from nearby Detroit, and Vancouver’s Map Music, home to off-kilter, adventurous productions that delighted in chaos. Both of these labels have been defunct for years, but in the scenes and cities that fostered them, their presence can still be felt. By paying homage to the past, Holland also manages to bring the labels’ visions back to life, funnelling their outsider, industrial energy into loopy, danceable new songs to be spread through clubs and warehouses around the world. On the buoyant and glistening “Pressure No Impact,” a daydream of a track, the mood is at once nostalgic and hopeful: Are the pitter-pattering chimes and pipes echoes of a bygone era, or perhaps, a pulse?","The Montreal producer pays tribute to the classic sound of two bygone Canadian techno labels, yielding some of the liveliest music in his catalog yet.

Altogether,Turnover,by: Abby Jones,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db364230c9c6a0008f6ba60/1:1/w_160/Turnover_Altogether.jpg,2019-11-04 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/turnover-altogether/,Run for Cover,"When they started, the Virginia trio Turnover resembled your garden-variety pop-punk outfit. Then, they morphed into dreamy emo, and then again into Pet Sounds-filtered surf rock; it seemed like they couldn’t stop evolving. Singer Austin Getz went from wallowing in dreary East Coast Decembers to whirling around beachside carousels in the final days of a Californian summer. He began to realize where he went wrong in failed romances instead of resentfully labeling his exes “meaningless lovers” in the same breath he fantasized about sleeping with them again. Like fellow latter-day emo torchbearers Joyce Manor and Touché Amoré, Turnover presented ongoing evidence of their adaptability while still remaining true to their core. On their fourth full-length, Altogether, they’ve remained loyal to producer Will Yip and label home Run for Cover; however, this record finds Turnover virtually unrecognizable. “Chill” has always been an accurate descriptor for Turnover, but Altogether could be used in a D.A.R.E.-style campaign warning the risks of taking it too far. They’ve eviscerated any indication of their “emo-ish punk rock” roots, instead opting for a lackadaisical, stoned regurgitation of ‘80s new wave—like Talk Talk doused in CBD oil. Getz explained that in the making of this record, the band considered “people who don't have the time to delve into the niches and find fringe artists.” This album, he seems to say, is meant to go down easy, devoid of deeper implications—but Altogether winds up mostly just half-baked. In Turnover’s attempts to keep things uncomplicated and accessible, they sound anonymous and corny. Take “Still in Motion,” a perfectly adequate album opener if it weren’t introduced with a wildly over-the-top trumpet solo. “Number On the Gate” could be a pretty good B-side to Good Nature; it pops up about midway through the record, as if to offer one last reminder of “oh, yeah, this is a Turnover album,” before the remaining bloodless tracks scrub your memory clean. The band can write hooks; At their gigs, Peripheral Vision highlights like “Cutting My Fingers Off” conjure mosh pits and singalongs even amid their relaxed atmosphere, while Good Nature opener “Super Natural” begs to be hummed while completing house chores. But hardly anything could be deemed catchy here, with refrains too monotonous to stick. Even when Turnover try spicing things up with congas, a violin, and a couple of ill-fitting saxophone features, Altogether tastes incredibly vanilla, like a playlist of department store slow jams. This blandness would be excusable if Getz backed it up with compelling lyricism, but his words are typically underdeveloped at their best—at their worst, they induce eye rolls. He details his reluctance to going out on “Parties,” but once he sees his date’s “body move just the way that it should,” he’s suddenly fine with the shallow social interactions the party entails. On “Ceramic Sky,” he sings of “Waiting to feel the tingling of your lips/Sedative in your touch,” a line too nonsensical to be sexy. “Have you been through the things I have?/Did you lose your trust or feel betrayed?” he argues on “Number on the Gate,” sounding like the dude who complains about his “crazy ex” before ghosting you. Getz’s trifling depictions of women and inconsequential, clunky ideas—”I don’t mean to make you feel lonely/When I’m feeling like I have no reply”—amount to a record that hardly dips below surface level. In their vision for Altogether, Turnover shot themselves in the foot at the get-go. They hoped for an album that was simple, but the banality that manifested instead was a pretty inevitable side effect. “We wanted to keep in mind...music for those of us who are busy with work or our families or whatever problems might be around,” Getz said. “Music is real magic that can change people's days and lives, and the more people listening and loving, the better.” Maybe he wasn’t planning to change lives with this album, but to make art catered to people who are presumably too preoccupied to fully digest it is a pretty careless and patronizing method of operation.

Let’s Get Free,dead prez,by: Rawiya Kameir,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da4cd4d9ba6ff0008720fc3/1:1/w_160/deadprez.jpg,2019-11-03 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dead-prez-lets-get-free/,Loud,"To be woke is not the same as to stay woke. The gap between adjective and verb contains worlds. Before it was co-opted and reframed to signal a certain kind of performative righteousness, wokeness meant honoring an instinct for preservation. Keeping one eye open to the realities of life in a patriarchal, capitalist, white supremacist society, for some, has meant the difference between life and death. The phrase is often attributed to Erykah Badu, whose 2008 song “Master Teacher (I Stay Woke)” holds one of its earliest mainstream uses. But I’ve been hearing it, in different variations, for way longer. Few people embodied the concept more acutely than M-1 and stic.man, a pair of MCs who met as students at a Florida HBCU in the early ’90s, and found some success later as the duo dead prez. Let’s Get Free, their 2000 debut, is one of the most radical rap releases in history. On “Hip Hop,” the mosh pit rumbler that remains the group’s best-known song, having served as the walk-on music for Dave Chappelle’s Chappelle’s Show, stic.man raps, “Still a nigga like me don’t playa hate, I just stay awake.” While the song’s chanted hook and lines from its fiery verses are often misinterpreted as an endorsement of hip-hop purism, it is more than a judgment on the state of commercial rap at the time. Hip-hop was only a few years off from reaching its status as a billion-dollar industry, and labels were taking expensive bets on all kinds of artists. Puff was flexing furs, artists like Nas and Mobb Deep were experimenting with glossier sounds, and a crew of rappers from New Orleans had everyone calling their jewelry “bling.” On the East Coast, in pockets of Brooklyn and Philadelphia, a neo-conscious subgenre was thriving, with artists like the Roots, Mos Def, and Talib Kweli being positioned as ideologically and aesthetically in opposition to their more commercially successful peers. dead prez were often lumped into this loosely political movement, having come out of the tutelage of Brand Nubian’s Lord Jamar. Despite their affiliations, dead prez were singular. Over a warped, wobbly bassline written by stic, “Hip Hop” offers a reading of the capitalist functions of the music industry, its reliance on the exploitation of black people, and the dangers of internalizing the values perpetuated by those structures. A potent warning: “These record labels slang our tapes like dope/You can be next in line and signed and still be writing rhymes and broke.” (Ironically, a remix of the song was produced by dead prez acolyte turned preeminent capitalist Kanye West.) Existing at the turn of the millennium, stic and M-1 sat squarely between the Rodney King riots and the election of Barack Obama, events that would come to define America in radically different ways. Halfway between the carefreeness of the ’90s and the apathy of the aughts, dead prez saw through the false promises of a crooked empire at its height. The music industry is just one of many targets of Let’s Get Free, a statement of political consciousness so specific and carefully articulated that it’s a wonder to think it received major distribution, and charted on the Billboard Hot 100. The album is dense with words. They tackle public education, the prison system, the police state, media complicity, economic inequity, and more, making historical connections between the oppression of the enslaved and the oppression of the black poor. They identified threats that seemed paranoid then, but from the vantage point of 2019, were deeply prescient: surveillance, food injustice, the fear of false-flag operations. Even when staying woke veers into conspiracy theory (“I don’t believe Bob Marley died from cancer,” goes one line in the hook of “Propaganda”), it is clearly the byproduct of a rightful mistrust in authority. Lyrics and audio collages from films and speeches are built around layers of soundscapes. The uptempo, Afrotech-y club on songs like “I’m a African” reflect stic’s Tallahassee upbringing and the time the pair spent developing their sound as college students in Florida. But the album was also shaped by the stretches of time the pair spent in Brooklyn, bridging the warm-weather energy of South Florida with the more conventional drums-and-orchestration of the East Coast. One song, “Animal In Man,” is a retelling of George Orwell’s Animal Farm, an allegory for class struggle narrativized in rhyme. The track closes with an extended, cinematic instrumental outro, all strings, guitar, and drums. It sounds ridiculous in theory, but on record translates as a moment of galvanizing storytelling. Notably, Let’s Get Free wasn’t built around the aesthetics of consciousness—like some of their incense-lighting, kufi-wearing peers in the late-’90s “conscious-rap” boom, one of the most prominent of whom would go on to sell raps advertising Microsoft's artificial intelligence program—but around the politics of liberation. The best rap has often served as a cultural and political diagnosis. But dead prez didn’t simply observe and analyze, they offered a solution: revolution. They wanted to burn it all down, and then rebuild in a more generous, cooperative, self-sufficient mode. “We live in a society that tells us exploitation and getting over on people is the highest form of civilization as opposed to cooperation and sharing,” said stic in a 2000 Billboard interview. As student organizers and members of the pan-African National Democratic Uhuru Movement, they lived what they rapped. Their approaches were informed by the political action groups and fundamental hopefulness of Eastern spiritualism. But they also follow a rich history of black socialism in the U.S. For decades after emancipation, when black people were free in theory but excluded from economic activity in practice, cooperatives sprung up to fill the gaps in needs and services. As a teen experiencing a personal awakening through music, I found in Let’s Get Free a blueprint for thinking about the world. This required an emphasis on personal health; a revolution needs strong bodies. Years before Gwyneth Paltrow made veganism and high-intensity workouts facets of an aspirational lifestyle, stic.man and M-1 were tossing apples into crowds and doing push-ups on stage. “Music was a way to do what I couldn’t do with a leaflet in my neighborhood,” M-1 said in an interview celebrating the album’s 15th-year anniversary. They were onto something; one academic study credited Beyoncé and JAY-Z’s public embrace of a plant-based diet as pushing veganism into the mainstream. stic and M-1 are continuing this philosophy; their work spans nutrition, fitness, and mindfulness. There is a tendency in today’s world to forget that nothing is new. There are no new ideas, no new problems. “I wish our album was obsolete. Unfortunately, it’s still relevant in the present,” stic.man said in a recent interview. As global inequality and anti-corruption activism reach a peak and people in countries like Hong Kong, Lebanon, Chile, and Iraq take to the streets to advocate on behalf of themselves and their communities, the message of Let’s Get Free remains especially potent: Their system is not working for us.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

Assorted Works,The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db30910bc614b0008ba7a09/1:1/w_160/twiabp_assortedworks.jpg,2019-11-02 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-world-is-a-beautiful-place-and-i-am-no-assorted-works/,Triple Crown,"The emo revival was largely a humble, underground phenomenon when The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die got started in 2009, but everything about them—their name, what seemed like a dozen people on stage trying to keep six-minute songs called “Eyjafjallajokull Dance” from collapsing on themselves—was too audacious and absurd to be ignored. It was clear they’d either be a generational voice or they might implode after one album, if they even get to that point. Maybe both. Even before their seismic proper debut Whenever, If Ever, TWIABP owed this reputation to the daunting and diffuse array of splits, singles, EPs and alternates that are collected for Assorted Works—a compilation that functions as a capstone for a bygone version of TWIABP, an entire scene, and an entire decade. Scour r/emo, Midwest Emoposting or any other similarly minded community, and “Best Of” mixes of this material likely already exist, the band’s shadow history distilled into an unofficial TWIABP LP4. So Assorted Works might not actually be meant for the hardcore TWIABP fan—it’s a work of convenience rather than curation, 20 tracks in semi-chronological order over the span of nearly 80 minutes. And really, it’s far more fun to explore these songs in their original contexts, where TWIABP’s evolution can be traced from a confounding curiosity to a band that stuck around long enough to be a formative influence. The first four tracks are taken from Are Here to Help You, a split with New Hampshire’s sorely underappreciated Deer Leap. “Beverly Wyatt,” which shows them beginning to refine and weaponize their burst-and-bloom dynamics, is also a treasured artifact from a crucial period: a few months before the release of Whenever, If Ever. On its original 4-way split, “Beverly Wyatt” served as the binding agent between the dour indie-pop of Tigers Jaw, the misanthropy of Self Defense Family, and metalcore innovators Code Orange, who were about five years away from realizing their full potential as WWE entrance music. Though TWIABP already felt unruly and grandiose, they were still clearly a product of their local emo scene—probably the only reason they weren’t immediately hailed as maximalist indie rock standard-bearers like Arcade Fire or Broken Social Scene. Most of the notable bands of that time had an off-key yelper and an off-key hardcore guy on the mic. TWIABP had both: Tom Diaz and a guy named “Shitty Greg,” who’s credited with inventing the term “twinkle daddy,” which could refer to the two dominant modes of guitar in early TWIABP—the ringing, exploratory harmonies of American Football or the stardust trails of Explosions in the Sky. It took time for TWIABP to make sense of everything, but from Are Here to Help You, it already was clear what they were about. Diaz was the singer for a band that conscientiously lacked a frontperson, writing almost entirely in plural pronouns about building community, reinforcing the meta, world-building quality of the band. The first half of Assorted Works introduced melodic motifs and homespun images (cars parked on the lawn, climbing trees) that would be revisited on their later albums, while “Mega Steve” is the first in a trilogy of TWIABP songs honoring drummer Steven Buttery, the only person to appear on all 20 tracks. Fuss with the sequencing of Assorted Works’ first half and there’s an alternate vision for Whenever, If Ever that similarly juggles propulsive pop-punk (“Be Neon With Me”), scratchy folk (“To the Janitor, to the King”) and their preeminent mode, which conflated emo’s anxious energy with post-rock’s grandeur. As is, they justify the hype that turned Whenever, If Ever into the emo revival’s first phenomenon—anticipation was so fervent that the label had to move it up due to leaks, and it even managed to scratch the outer edges of the Billboard 200. Oddly enough, Whenever, If Ever is the source for the one true rarity on Assorted Works. “Gig Life” is the most plainspoken song Diaz wrote for the band, a vivid account of going from college town to college town, sustained by Sheetz and mewithoutYou albums. The take here, sourced from a lathe-cut single, cuts off before reaching the orchestral crescendo of the Whenever, If Ever version, and its incompleteness is even more poignant as his last vocal feature on Assorted Works—Diaz left the band prior to the release of Whenever, If Ever and died at the age of 32 in 2018. Diaz’s role was absorbed by David Bello, whose vocals were similar enough on Whenever, if Ever that the two were easy to confuse. But Diaz never had a chance to guide something like “Fat Heaven,” the morose, feedback-scarred track that immediately follows “Gig Life,” and leads into the most antagonistic work of TWIABP’s catalog. “A Note From the Author February 1st to the Author January 1st” introduces the borderline-parodic spoken-word readings of Chris Zizzamia, whose presence lent an intriguing, unstable element to the band’s live shows. It’s followed by “We Carry Knives,” six minutes of harsh noise that appeared on tour-only single The Distance. In retrospect, those one-offs are the sound of TWIABP testing their outer limits before their transcendent sophomore album Harmlessness, a work so fantastically realized that it inevitably siphons some magic off of what surrounds it. The Assorted Works cut from this period are almost uniformly strong and occasionally sublime—the murderous double-kick drum outro of “Katamari Duquette” is a highlight, as is “Smoke & Felt,” featuring call-and-response vocals between Bello and Katie Dvorak. Assorted Works cuts off on “Body Without Organs,” a song that didn’t quite mesh with the generous spirituality of Harmlessness and was released as an ACLU benefit in November 2016. There’s nothing here made by the lineup responsible for 2017’s Always Foreign, nor have TWIABP produced any new music in the time since—a significant decline in momentum two years after an album that was primed to be a breakthrough. Always Foreign featured TWIABP’s catchiest songs and also their most relevant, as Bello drew on his experience as a person of color for timely invective against rising anti-immigration rhetoric, proving TWIABP was not a band bound by their utopian idealism. There has been a lot of turmoil in the band’s lineup since then. The only remaining original member is Buttery; “Shitty Greg” left for good in 2015 and is now a booking agent for a lot of bands you’ve probably seen if you liked TWIABP. The remaining members of TWIABP are working on their next album with “probably the strongest core we have yet,” and maybe it will just as strong as everything else they’ve released. But they look downright normal now, promoting a collection that remembers when they could’ve been anything in the world.

Spring,Itasca,by: Linnie Greene,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db7123b0c9c6a0008f6bad2/1:1/w_160/itasca_spring.jpg,2019-11-02 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/itasca-spring/,Paradise of Bachelors,"“Who knows where the time goes?” Fairport Convention’s Sandy Denny sang in the late 1960s, and in the five decades since, folk musicians have continued to pluck their way toward an answer, their music an acoustic yardstick for life’s seasons. In the measurements taken by contemporary troubadours like Meg Baird or Daughter of Swords, change is both incremental and cyclical, and Itasca’s Spring is further evidence that certain sounds quaver through the years like sunlight, impervious to a world that would hurry it along. Steered by Los Angeles’ Kayla Cohen, Itasca traffic in dreamy, vaporous ballads anchored by acoustic strumming and occasional strings or piano, each added layer a complementary gilding. Cohen spent two months recording the album in a century-old New Mexico adobe, and Spring is both a product of and tribute to these origins. Like the desert, the record’s structure feels like a symbiotic balancing act—each component part placed just so, lest the whole system come apart. In the particularly lovely “Cornsilk,” Cohen sings of going to “think across the Rio Grande,” swimming in the canyoned river where you can “put your feet out under the sky” and “there are traces in the air of your time laid bare.” Cohen’s most salient talent is evocation—trapping place, weather, and physical presence like a butterfly pinned beneath glass. Every track is reverent, as hushed as a church penitent. This proves particularly effective when she wrestles with binary oppositions: natural versus artificial; the solitude of the desert versus participation in the manufactured world. “Watched the white flower bloom/The land of harvest here,” she sings on “Comfort’s Faces.” “Thought it was a good luck charm/But a silk flower instead.” With assists from fellow psych and folk practitioners including mix engineer Chris Cohen and drummer Marc Riordan (Sun Araw), the record gives the distinct impression that it was shepherded into existence by a team of people vibing on the same high, natural or otherwise. Though picturesque, the record meanders, and the pace can feel drowsy. Its consistency is one of its few weaknesses, and it teeters occasionally between meditation and sluggishness. Opener “Lily” falls into this liminal ground, as does “Blue Spring,” and while these tracks don’t seem pointed towards anything particularly urgent, their instrumentation (like the rest of Spring) remains rich and resonant, each component part augmenting the others. Surely Itasca won’t be the last outfit to metabolize the natural world through a set of strings and a collection of images, navigating life’s metaphorical seasons in order to be more present in its literal ones. The desert might seem sparse to a cursory traveler, but look longer and harder and it’s a teeming landscape, exemplary of birth, death, and the time passing in between. So too is Spring, which imbues a much-used musical frame—the folk travelogue, an earthy meditation on the state of things—with novel horizons.

Wildcard,Miranda Lambert,by: Allison Hussey,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db362d50c9c6a0008f6ba5e/1:1/w_160/mirandalambert_wildcard.jpg,2019-11-01 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/miranda-lambert-wildcard/,VannerRCA Records Nashville,"Miranda Lambert opens  Wildcard with confidence: “I’m finally on the up and up.” It’s jarring to hear her use the word finally here, as she’s seemed to be on a long ascent for the past few years. Following the public dissolution of her marriage to fellow country star Blake Shelton, her 2016 double album The Weight of These Wings debuted at No. 1 on Billboard’s country charts. Last year’s reunion with the Pistol Annies delivered another bout of biting, clear-eyed songwriting from Lambert and her bandmates. With Wildcard, she cheerfully exposes her sometimes-chaotic inner life, wearing her heart on her sleeve as she reaches for another shot of tequila. Lambert packs Wildcard with her quick-witted, cheeky observations about her world; it’s as if she strode off the set of a Steel Magnolias reboot and headed straight for the studio. Opener “White Trash” contrasts her have-not days with her more glamorous present, while “It All Comes Out in the Wash” offers reassurance that no stain—be it a splotch of Merlot or some messy gossip—is permanent. The songs are warm, funny, and comforting, acknowledging the hassles of existence outside of the upper class while transforming them into sing-along choruses. Maren Morris joins Lambert on “Way Too Pretty for Prison,” which makes for a punchy later-day foil to the Dixie Chicks’ “Goodbye Earl.” Lambert and Morris let their cooler heads prevail upon considering the practical realities of incarceration. “The bars there ain’t got boys to buy us drinks,” for one. The pair flip the traditions of timeless murder ballads: they don’t go through with their crime of passion, but they could get away with it if they really wanted to. Wildcard hits its hellraiser high-water mark with “Locomotive,” a rollicking number where Lambert draws on a familiar country artifact to make a case for her own unbridled power. She belts every verse before careening into a rapid-fire chorus, while a harmonica imitates the long wail of a train horn in the background. The track’s funky instrumental coda sends it out with a stomp. “Tequila Does,” which arrives late in the album, is a steller last-call anthem. Lambert tempers her casual dismay about barroom wannabe-cowboys (who are “all hat, no cattle”) with a chorus that radiates the warm, rosy glow of one-too-many. Not one to sully her beers with tears, Lambert relishes the prospect of going home alone rather than surrendering to potential disappointment. Lambert’s sleight-of-hand with country tropes distinguishes her as a clever songwriter who honors the music’s history without kowtowing to the hagiography of the genre. Lambert balances her high-spirited romps with more contemplative numbers, cooling off long enough to reflect without flagging Wildcard’s momentum. With “Settling Down,” she examines the forked road ahead of her as a 35-year-old woman, wondering if it’s better to follow her restless spirit or settle down; a gnarled bassline in the bridge recalls the restless churn of an anxious stomach before Lambert bursts into a sunnier chorus. And though Lambert’s mentions of alcohol across Wildcard are mostly celebratory, she acknowledges the more heartbroken side of such pleasures with “Dark Bars.” Lambert uses these songs to share some of her reservations about what the next few decades hold for her, but when she takes stock of it all, she lands on a firm conclusion: It’s pretty bitchin’. The heyday of “bitchin’” as a “cool” qualifier came and went with the Reagan administration, but Lambert injects them with new vitality, singing the four-syllable refrain of “Pretty Bitchin’” as equal parts schoolyard taunt and tongue-in-cheek recognition that she does, indeed, have it pretty great. Wildcard shines in part because Lambert comes across as neither the damsel in distress nor a lone-wolf heroine. The album doesn’t feel “relatable” inasmuch as Lambert and her stable of co-writers (which includes Highwoman Natalie Hemby among other Nashville lights) have distilled common anxieties and insecurities into a batch of excellent country tunes. And though Wildcard is fun as hell, Lambert sounds relaxed, playful, happy, and comfortable throughout. Her “up and up” feels earthly and attainable—it’s not just the Restoration Hardware furniture or the Airstream trailer with white-wall tires. Lambert celebrates the multitudes of being a hot mess, prioritizing the joy of personal growth over lamenting the pitfalls and potholes. Life is, in fact, pretty bitchin’.

ISS004,Skee Mask,by: Gabriel Szatan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db30667fd8a1f0009ad5a6d/1:1/w_160/skeemask_iss004.jpg,2019-11-01 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/skee-mask-iss004/,Ilian Tape,"In a fractious dance-music scene, one thing seemingly everyone agrees upon is that Skee Mask is in a class of his own. Munich’s Bryan Müller began tracing the contours of his style on 2016’s Shred, but 2018’s Compro filled in a detailed 3D render for the world to see. Part of why Compro crossed over is how well it functioned as a proper album—a notoriously tricky tightrope to walk in electronic music. It was sequenced to begin softly, accelerate to a roaring full clip, and spin off into the ether at the death. The music, a meld of warp-speed breakbeats and wistful atmospherics, was lethal in the hand of discerning DJs but suited bedroom listening too. It brought memories flooding back to older heads of dancing to Moving Shadow or tripping in lounges to Autechre, while enshrining fresh memories for a new generation of ravers. Müller tipped his hat to electronica’s past while opening a portal to its immediate future. Flush with confidence and taking more gigs than ever, Müller has crafted his 2019 productions with club sound systems in mind. “Trackheadz,” the walloping standout from springtime release 808BB, and “DJ A.Sieff,” a heavyweight loosie on the Infinite Drift compilation Shiny Zero, are markedly less murky and more direct. When Müller’s trademark becalming pads do arrive, they feel like torches shining into the back of a rave, or a laser tracing curlicues through smoke. They afford a momentary breather rather than an extended spell of reflection. ISS004 continues to pull away from Compro’s stargazing. Only “Slow Music,” with acid-green synths stalking the corners and drums that crackle like a line-in cable connecting to a live speaker, feels tied to that era. Instead, three songs on the EP explore Skee Mask’s grimewise side. “Play Ha” and “RZZ” are reminiscent of cuts by Wizzbit, Zinc, and DJ Oddz found on the Bingo Beats series. It was an in-between stage where the moodiness of dark garage and drum’n’ bass lingered, dubstep wasn’t quite dubstep yet, and Wiley, while publicly asking “Wot Do U Call It?,” was trying to sell “eskibeats” as the term for what wound up popularized as grime. Müller captures that moment and updates it with hi-def sound design and eye-popping drum programming. The most exciting of Müller’s eski excursions is opener “Juug.” Each time the drums pull back on the fourth bar, the bass becomes more feral, eventually snarling like a mecha-jaguar. When a breakbeat kicks in at the halfway mark, it feels like listening to a DJ execute a daredevil mix between two genres that bear little relation to one another. In Müller’s hands, it’s as smooth as a tablecloth trick, one of many moments in his catalog that elicits a reaction of, simply, what the fuck. That the 2010s are ending with Skee Mask as one of its anointed stars is interesting. In the first half of the decade, popular club tunes were colourful and simplistic, with buildups and breakdowns signposted clearly to maximize coordinated release on dancefloors. The period of “deconstruction” that followed, where intense and abstract music lurched toward a form, brought material that was arresting but often a challenge for audiences to enjoy. You could call Skee Mask reconstructed club, if you like; he makes dancefloor-vaporizing weapons, but with galaxy-brain complexity scuttling below the surface. That snatches of grime, breakbeat, ballroom, IDM, electro, ambient, and as-yet-nameless styles find a home in just 28 minutes underlines the praise heaped on Skee Mask. ISS004 is the sound of a highly skilled producer who’s in love with the lot, and can’t wait to show you how good it can all be.","Continuing his run of dancefloor-focused records, the German breakbeat specialist tilts his rearview mirror toward grime’s nascent stage.

Kiwanuka,Michael Kiwanuka,by: Alfred Soto,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da611bca8fd3600081edc8a/1:1/w_160/Kiwanuka.jpg,2019-11-01 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/michael-kiwanuka-kiwanuka/,Interscope,"“All I want is to talk to you,” Michael Kiwanuka sings on “Piano Joint (This Kind of Love),” as if the “you” had heard otherwise. Intimacy, for him, is fraught, full of potential traps. Anxiety pervades the London singer-songwriter’s third album, but he emerges a stronger artist, thanks to panoramic production by collaborators Danger Mouse and Inflo. What on first or even third spin unfolds as an easy listen eventually reveals itself as a mournful and often despairing work: an album by an artist willing himself to believe people will offer the hope that institutions can’t but steeling himself for disappointment just in case. Doubt is his muse—and burden. In the three years since Love & Hate, Kiwanuka’s popularity has only grown— the HBO miniseries Big Little Lies picked up that album’s “Cold Little Heart” as its theme song. His take on soul proceeds from the fuzzed-out serrated explorations of the Temptations’ psychedelic era and Terence Trent D’Arby at his most communal. Better still is his voice, which mixes Solomon Burke’s slow-burn urgency with John Hiatt’s gulp. Kiwanuka mirrors Markeidric Walker’s cover art: grand, regal in its confidence, faintly androgynous. Its best songs are as direct as Kiwanuka’s gaze. The synth-anchored “Solid Ground” almost chokes on its anguish until the strings offer solace. “Piano Joint (This Kind of Love)” presents itself as a prayer in an empty room. “Living in Denial,” change tempos and chords after a couple of exploratory minutes; Kiwanuka treats songs like ecosystems that stretch and flower after sunlight and soil tilling. Perhaps to keep things from skewing too “retro,” Danger Mouse and Inflo overdo the modernizing touches: the clinkety-clanks and distorted samples that sandwich “Final Days” distract from a chiming lament whose refrain marks Kiwanuka’s peak as a vocalist. They love these ideas so much that its follow-up “Interlude (Loving the People)” give them to you again, all three instrumental minutes of them. But the album offers compensatory pleasures, like “Hard to Say Goodbye,” in which Kiwanuka pledges fealty through and space time to a vague someone he has dared to love—an example of the album’s faint queer undertones. A studio-created ripple sound effect creates a sense of immensity. Always, though, doubt chews away at him: “And if I had a dream/Love would be sunshine for me.” Offering no blandishments, no expressions of we’ll-get-through-this, Kiwanuka is a nerve-wracked, sustained act of whistling in the dark. Absent, though, is any hint of reveling: a tendency that often leads to soul rot. When Kiwanuka sings, “The young and dumb will always need/One of their own to lead,” he doesn’t volunteer.

Thanks to You,Rocketship,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db36848029c7900082ec31f/1:1/w_160/thankstoyou.jpg,2019-11-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rocketship-thanks-to-you/,nonstop co-op,"Rocketship have long been the type of slightly below-the-radar act that fans connect with in a fiercely personal way. In part this sense of intimacy probably stems from the Sacramento band’s connection with indie pop, which prizes community and handmade sweetness. Like fellow pop kids from Belle and Sebastian to the Pains of Being Pure at Heart, Rocketship were inspired by Felt, the ’80s project of reclusive UK indie auteur Lawrence. But Rocketship’s 1996 debut album, A Certain Smile, A Certain Sadness, was ambitious and well-crafted to a degree that belied their scene’s reputation for insularity and amateurishness. Afterward, Rocketship disbanded, and then all but vanished. The sole constant member, singer and guitarist Dustin Reske, followed with a couple of Rocketship albums—1999’s ambient-leaning Garden of Delights, 2006’s more eclectic Here Comes… Rocketship—so low-key that they were off most radars entirely. Now based in Portland, Reske has convened a new lineup for Rocketship’s first album in 13 years, Thanks to You. Arriving again with little traditional publicity push, it’s also Rocketship’s first album with widespread distribution since last century. And it’s shockingly good. Rocketship’s triumphant return still feels intensely personal, only now it’s a bit like reuniting with an old friend and finding they’ve grown into an erudite and beguiling stranger. Whatever else has changed, Reske has shown, once again, that bold aims and modest scale need not be opposed. The hypnotic organ and crashing guitar on Thanks to You will be familiar to admirers of Rocketship’s early work, but Reske isn’t simply relying on nostalgia. Instead, Rocketship sound more ambitious than ever, the youthful exuberance of the debut giving way to a louche and alluring sophistication. The most obvious difference is the addition of Ellen Osborn, whose past work includes singing in an all-female Bee-Gees cover band, as the lead vocalist on a sizable majority of the album’s 10 songs. She’s both versatile and formidable, her voice crystalline here and feathery there, as the occasion warrants. But most of all, she sounds gamely in control of whatever the compositions throw at her. That’s important, because what’s especially fun about Thanks to You is how packed with ideas these songs are. A Certain Smile had droning interludes that pointed the way toward the atmospheric instrumentals of its follow-up, Garden of Delights, but Thanks to You goes further. Each of these songs feels as ornately appointed as miniature rooms, with trap doors and spiderwebs that show up as you spend some time living within them. The spacey keys, pinprick bass, and layered harmonies of “Nothing Deep Inside” open up to a French-language spoken-word passage and one of the year’s more poetic guitar solos this side of Big Thief’s “Not.” On “What’s the Use of Books,” a lascivious lunar-lounge cruise suddenly lunges into a stomping, screeching frenzy. There’s yearning dream pop (“A Terrible Fix”), an orchestral-tinged synth workout bringing to mind recent Rest-era Charlotte Gainsbourg (“Outer Otherness”), and whatever you call a song with the jangling riffs of Johnny Marr, the shoegaze whorls of Kevin Shields, and the organ-soaked detachment of Laetitia Sadier (“Broken Musicbox”). This expanded scope also applies to the songs’ lyrics. “Drunk, I’m always drunk/When I’m with you,” Osborn sings as the autumnal opening track, “Under Streetlights Shadows,” rushes to a start that feels in medias res. “When I asked for rent, you sold my amp,” she chides on “Nothing Deep Inside.” Amid the shrill drum-machine thump of “Milk-Aisle Smiles,” Reske pleads with a lover by way of a reference to Joanna Newsom’s Milk-Eyed Mender, rhyming “laissez faire” with “touch you there.” On “City, Fair,” which veers from Pentangle-style folk to Fleetwood Mac-worthy sing-along, Osborn leaps just just as adroitly from Ren Faire “o’er” to all-too-contemporary “black ops on the street.” It’s a lot, and delving into it all is a treat. “Thanks to You is for all the fucked up children of the world,” Reske has said. “In my lyrics now I use a broader lexicon, yet the subjects reflect much of the same longing for love and connection through dysfunction and alienation as always.” That constancy is easiest to grasp on the songs where the lexicon, lyrical and musical, is most direct. “I Just Can’t Get Enough of You” lacks the innocence of Rocketship’s classic “I Love You Like the Way That I Used to Do,” but it’s still a giddy rush of noise, melody, and emotion. Or take finale “I Don’t Know Why I Still Love You,” a back-and-forth duet that conjures up the Cure and Saint Etienne meeting at a rave. “Love a lie, you auto-replay ‘One Man Guy’ now,” complains Reske, citing Loudon Wainwright. ”I wave my fuck-it flag, you wear your love like heaven now,” Osborn spits back, quoting Donovan. It’s all as confused and emotionally extreme as a teenager, but as complex and fraught with references as an adult. Thanks to You is a long way from Rocketship’s irresistible debut single, 1994’s “Hey, Hey Girl,” and yet it’s not so far at all. Reske, who has a business bicycling around Portland and doing yard work with only hand tools, still knows how to make something with lofty artistic goals seem as human and sustainable as cultivating a garden. The fucked-up children of the world might turn out surprisingly well.","The indie-pop band’s first album in 13 years summons the same mix of erudition, introspection, and intense emotion that has inspired cult-like devotion since the late 1990s.

Three Chords and the Truth,Van Morrison,by: Jason P. Woodbury,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db36ab0a294dc0009cabcd4/1:1/w_160/morrison.jpeg,2019-10-31 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/van-morrison-three-chords-and-the-truth/,ExileCaroline,"Forty-one albums into his storied career, Van Morrison remains one of rock’s most enduring studies in contrast, never changing and forever restless. Three Chords and The Truth is his sixth record in the last four years, the latest dispatch of a particularly productive period, and the first to feature all-new original songs since 2012’s Born to Sing: No Plan B (minus one co-write with lyricist Don Black). Though he sticks closely to the conservative R&B, blues, and jazz modes that have defined his ’00s discography, the LP’s 14 songs showcase his determination to wring profundity out of even the most common language. Songwriter Harlan Howard coined the phrase “Three chords and the truth” to describe the necessary ingredients for country and western music, but this isn’t a country record. Van’s talking about his desire to take simple rhymes and traditional song structures and imbue them with Caledonia soul heaviness. As it has since his raging beginnings with Them, it’s Morrison’s voice that affords him such latitude. At 74, he sounds incredible, his voice deepened and richer with age, growling, cooing, and occasionally barking about familiar but resonant concerns. As always, he’s grouchy— sick of the powerful getting away with it all (the Brexit commentary “Nobody in Charge”), annoyed by notoriety and the complications of stardom (“Fame Will Eat the Soul,” which features a rousing call and response assist by Righteous Brother Bill Medley), and uncertain if goodness makes any difference in a compromised world (“Does Love Conquer All”). But he’s equally nostalgic, riffing on the joy of sound on the title track and earnestly recalling the freedom and purity of youth (“Early Days,” “In Search of Grace”). There’s a warmth here that recalls his ’90s highwater marks, Hymns to the Silence and The Healing Game, and connects even farther back in time to 1971’s Tupelo Honey, which balanced the charms of domesticity with R&B raves. Credit the superb backing band for the record’s subtle but palpable drive. With Astral Weeks guitarist Jay Berliner in the mix, they support Morrison sympathetically. “It’s called ‘the flow,’” Morrison said in a recent interview, detailing his optimal conditions for making music. “I don’t know the mechanics of how that works. I just know when I’m in it.” “The flow” makes Three Chords and The Truth a deeply pleasurable listen, but it’s the moments where Morrison sounds less settled that carry the most weight. The album’s third song, “Dark Night of the Soul,” never wanders as far out as epics like “Madame George” and “Listen to the Lion,” nor does it match spaced-out gloss of his ’80s albums with trumpeter Mark Isham, but it’s gripped by the same existential fervor. Its mellow heat has a lot in common with 1997’s “Rough God Goes Riding,” a gentle midtempo cut with apocalyptic visions hiding in plain sight. Revisiting the 16th-century Christian mystic St. John of the Cross’ poem about the unknowability of God, one he’s sung about a number of times before, Morrison showcases the way his twilight years haven’t dimmed his yearning for growth, his desire for a deeper understanding. Morrison concludes the song with passionate vocal riffing, treating his voice like a saxophone pushed nearly to its breaking point. That tension, between the sublime and the terrifying, has always fueled Morrison’s best work. He’s always been split between the desire for complete freedom and a love of tight structure; He’s a guy who once shouted out L. Ron Hubbard in the liner notes to Inarticulate Speech of the Heart but also “wouldn’t touch [religion] with a 10-foot pole.” He’s been a prophet of metaphysical openness and also the chronicler, as author Steven Hyden has noted, of “an infinite number of grievances, both real and imagined.” There aren’t a lot of songwriters who can fit the word “skullduggery” into the lyric book, as Morrison does here with “You Don’t Understand.” Even fewer make the word sound so natural—in Morrison’s songs, griping and testifying are never separated by much. Like his peer Bob Dylan, Morrison has found resonance in singing standards of a sort. This time around they’re all of his own design, and his fitful, relentless desire for cosmic fulfillment animates them. Comfortably appointed in his twilight years, he’s still chasing enlightenment, haunted by “the things I might not yet know,” as he puts it on “Dark Night of the Soul.” For Morrison, there are always mysteries left to articulate.

Seeker,Mikal Cronin,by: Linnie Greene,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db1ddc0a294dc0009cabbac/1:1/w_160/seeker.jpg,2019-10-31 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mikal-cronin-seeker/,Merge,"To overcome an uncharacteristic bout of writer’s block, Mikal Cronin took the took the time-honored sequester-yourself-in-a-cabin approach and emerged with the songs on Seeker, his fourth solo album. A longtime collaborator with other Southern California acts, he enlisted members of the Ty Segall Freedom Band, and despite that group’s penchant for raucousness, out came a mild, confounding blend of twangy power pop, like reaching for half and half and guzzling skim. Cronin’s wistful vocals land on lofty themes—death, rebirth, cleansing fire—but the sound itself is a shrug, a noncommittal exploration of big ideas that never quite reaches an exclamation point, let alone a big impact. “I feel it all,” Cronin insists on the track of the same name, and yet, over the plinks of piano keys, one might ask impatiently, “What? What do you feel?!” For an album supposedly full of introspection, Seeker remains frustratingly vague. On the song “Fire,” which (as he tells it) gave the record its direction, he sings “red embers float above the front yard.” It’s an image that ought to carry some apocalyptic menace, but his delivery suggests falling leaves instead. Cronin’s music has always been ingratiating, but that quality works against his material here, which yearns for something deeper or darker. There are clear limits to the affability that makes some of his previous singles so winsome. “Show Me” starts by teasing some serpentine Tom Petty power chords, and Cronin has a cocksure delivery, but the simmer is cooled by a tepid chorus. The song, like many on Seeker, feels like an almost-anthem, a half-decent rock song a few jolts and surprises away from becoming a good one. “Caravan” is another example of this “almost, not quite” feeling. The chugging distorted guitars snarl at us and a saxophone honks, raising faint hopes of some Stooges-style mayhem, but the bar-band chug stays contentedly mid-tempo. Lacking a hook, many of these songs feel unsure of what exactly they’re meant to be—a ballad a la Big Star’s “September Gurls” (particularly “Lost a Year”)? Garage rock? On closer “On the Shelf,” he sits down with just an acoustic guitar and reconnects to some of the warmth and immediacy of his best work. He’s always had a good ear for affecting closers, and the song could be straight from the back half of Big Star’s #1. “We’ll fall in love and fuck the nonsense; it’s not for us,” he sings, charmingly. It’s the only real cri de coeur on the album, the only time he seems to stare us directly in the eyes.

GUV II,Young Guv,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db1c08b0c9c6a0008f6b892/1:1/w_160/YoungGuv_GUVII.jpg,2019-10-31 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/young-guv-guv-ii/,Run for Cover,"There are lots of reasons to release a double album, whether it’s to accommodate a rock opera, showcase discrete aesthetics, or spotlight the contributions of principal members. And then there’s the more prosaic rationale: You’ve simply written too many uncuttable songs. That’s the situation Ben Cook found himself in when he relocated from his Toronto hometown to Brooklyn in 2017 to devote more time to Young Guv—the solo guise he assumes when he’s not fronting hardcore scrappers No Warning or playing guitar for art-punk visionaries Fucked Up. On his own, Cook has indulged his love of pop music in all its forms, evoking both Robert Pollard’s human-jukebox acumen and Ariel Pink’s sense of mischief. These days, Cook is also mirroring their prodigious productivity: Young Guv’s most recent work was originally envisioned as a 20-song album, before Cook’s new label home, Run for Cover, convinced him to spread 17 of them over two separate releases, Use Your Illusion-style. Last August’s GUV I shone a bright light on Cook’s power-pop skills, presenting eight songs that basked in the eternal afterglow of Chris Bell-era Big Star and all the great Teenage Fanclub tunes cast in their image. GUV II, by contrast, treats that pristine sound not as an end goal but as a springboard into a collection that’s far more adventurous. You can sense the shift about three minutes into the opening “She’s A Fantasy,” when the song’s radiant Byrdsian shimmer slowly dissolves into an extended psychedelic fadeout awash in smeared harmonies and clanging percussion, as if to provide an instant snapshot of rock ‘n’ roll’s mid-’60s shift from innocence to transgression. From there, GUV II cycles through dramatically different styles—from sleek ‘80s dance-pop to lo-fi chillwave balladry—like an indecisive H&M shopper who’s rolled the entire sales rack into the change room. But the whiplash is diminished by the fact that Cook essentially traffics in one kind of song—the sort of doe-eyed, lovestruck laments that sound just as urgent and aching when couched in a Matthew Sweet bubble-grunge rave-up (“Try Not to Hang on So Hard”) as in an acoustic-plucked yacht-rock reverie set adrift on waves of Kaputt-ian sax (“Caught Lookin’”). Cook’s mercurial, childlike voice can recall Gene Ween’s more winsome turns, but his flights of fancy are rarely delivered with a wink or smirk. As an artist who came of age amid the stylistic rigidity of hardcore, Cook nails the fine points of genre (see: the silken organ tones of ’70s soul-pop throwback “Can I Luv U in My Own Way,” or the liquid funk guitars of the dreamy, Toro y Moi-worthy jam “Trying to Decide”). But he also understands that genre, and the factionalized identities we build around them, are ultimately secondary to the sanctity of the song. And on GUV II, no song is more blessed than “Can I Just Call U,” a hit of Lemonheads-flavored alt-candy that peaks with a swoon-inducing surge of overlapping choruses (featuring guest vocalist Aurora Shields in the Juliana Hatfield role). Though its title is written in text-speak, “Can I Just Call U” finds Cook longing to hear his paramour’s actual voice over the phone—“The way you make the words sound, the silence in between, and the fading of a scene.” He’s hardly the first artist to bemoan a life spent “looking at a screen,” but that sort of sentiment puts the rest of the record into stark relief: like the Luddite lover pining for old-school communication in a digital world, GUV II is the sound of a pop classicist forging his own singular path in a post-everything era.","On a new double album from his indie-pop project, Fucked Up guitarist Ben Cook cycles through dozens of styles without losing sight of the primacy of the song.

Respires,Ka Baird ,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db311b9bc614b0008ba7a0b/1:1/w_160/kabaird_respires.jpg,2019-10-31 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ka-baird-respires/,Rvng Intl.,"If the voice is the original instrument, as the experimental singer and composer Joan La Barbara once posited, Ka Baird’s Respires retreats into breath itself. Here, in trance-inducing studies for drums and voice, breath and heartbeat are laid bare as the sources of all expression. The New York musician’s often wordless vocalizations are cushioned by audible lungfuls of air; ritualistic incantations come in a lattice of hissing and huffing. What is normally silent becomes as palpable as a heavy sigh on a winter’s day. Even Baird’s instrument of choice, the flute, is itself a kind of breath incarnate, the edges of its tone wispy and diffuse. It’s a reminder that sound is just stirred air, a disturbance of the invisible. If that sounds almost mystical, well, so does she: On Respires, her chanted mantras often sound like she is snatching phantoms out of the very ether. “Pulse,” which opens the album, is exactly as promised: steady loops of hiccupping phonemes laid over a bright drone; it might be a diagram of the electrical current coursing through the central nervous system. Every now and then, an eruption of sibilance rushes forth, like steam from a subway grate, and the music takes on an even more otherworldly character. “Symanimagenic” deploys similar elements to even more dramatic ends: Nervous flute runs dart and dive above hand drums while Baird’s digitally processed voice channels bullfrogs, snakes, and jaguars, a one-woman rainforest chorus. “Azha” is made principally from interwoven flute loops that have been re-pitched and made strange, like bird calls of some undiscovered species. The centerpiece of the album’s first half is “Teaching Lodge of the Arrows.” A gong strikes, setting the meditative scene for multiple instances of shape-shifting: Baird’s flute is a flock of butterflies, her voice a volley of obsidian-tipped projectiles. Stylistically, it is part free jazz and part operatic aria. She uses the tension between repetition and moments of rupture to tap into an ecstatic dimension, as though speaking in tongues. And then, some invisible peak having been reached, the whole thing plateaus into seven minutes of coruscating drone. The album’s second half is more percussive, but just as intense, layering animalistic chattering sounds and the occasional recognizable word (“Walking,” she intones in the eponymous song, as though willing herself into motion) over insistent hand drumming that draws a direct line between contemporary dance music—the beat of “The Orion Arm” sounds almost like early Chicago house—and the kinds of rhythms that humans have used to make contact with the divine since time immemorial. On stage at Krakow’s Unsound festival earlier this month, the ritualistic aspect of Baird’s music was unmistakable. Spitting into the microphone, pouring rapid-fire flute riffs into her sampler, it seemed less like she was performing songs than channeling spirits. Pacing forward and back, crouching down, even at one point getting down on all fours, she seemed like a person possessed, answering to a private muse. That kind of energy isn’t easy to replicate on record, but Respires comes remarkably close. This is heady music with a physical presence: an intensely private communion with some unnameable, unknowable other, translated into a force you can feel in your bones.

Colorado,Neil YoungCrazy Horse,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db2138702f54100093307d9/1:1/w_160/neilyoungcrazyhorse_colorado.jpg,2019-10-30 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/neil-young-crazy-horse-colorado/,Reprise,"Many have tried, but no one plays guitar quite like Neil Young. He solos like something’s buried under the fretboard that he’s trying to dig out. When he transposes to acoustic settings, the inertia of his playing can cause his legs to cycle up and down wildly, a source of energy traveling through his entire body, dissipating in the lonesome exhaust of his fragile singing voice and harmonica playing. Even when he was a young man, this sound expressed a world-weariness that complemented his lyrics. But his music always seemed engineered to age with him—to rust and burn and keep on going. No group better suits this sensibility than Crazy Horse, the pared-down accompanists he first recruited for his sophomore album, 1969’s Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere. The band—which then featured the late guitarist Danny Whitten, bassist Billy Talbot, and drummer Ralph Molina—were built to tear things up. They kept it simple. Young’s guitar solos sometimes consisted of just one note, looped and clipping until the whole band seemed to lock in place with him. And while Young explored a wide variety of genres in the following decades, from pastoral country to arena rock to instrumental guitar, this primal sound will always be the one most closely associated with him. So when Young reassembles Crazy Horse for new music, there are always heightened expectations. Colorado marks their fourth studio album of the 21st century, following a dense concept album (2003’s Greendale), an unremarkable set of royalty-free cover songs (2012’s Americana), and a brilliantly meandering double album (2012’s Psychedelic Pill). Situated around those releases have been a spotty run of albums (even by Young’s standards), building toward his most inscrutable era since the ’80s. Young himself seems to acknowledge his current standards in the accompanying documentary Mountaintop, as he instructs his reunited bandmates to work quickly but meaningfully during its 11-day sessions. “It doesn’t have to be good,” he instructs. “Just feel good.” Despite his empowering mantra, a dark cloud hangs over Colorado. Its songs are furious (“Help Me Lose My Mind”), haunted (“Milky Way”), and remorseful (“Green Is Blue”). In “She Showed Me Love,” the closest thing this album has to a characteristic Crazy Horse epic, Young sings about a new generation carrying the torch for climate change and imagines how they might view him. “You might say I’m an old white guy,” he speak-sings. “I saw old white guys trying to kill mother nature.” It goes without saying that the “she” in the song title refers to our planet, and the past tense refers to the shortening timelines of both the narrator and subject. The long jam eventually slows to a trudge and makes sure you feel every passing minute. The rest of the record is shaded with subdued tones. In addition to Young’s old bandmates Talbot and Molina, he’s accompanied by Nils Lofgren—the E Street Band guitarist who also played with Young on career highlights After the Gold Rush and Tonight’s the Night. While Lofgren is best known for a near-athletic virtuosity, here he mostly colors in the lines. (His tap-dancing percussion in the sweet, Sleeps With Angels-referencing “Eternity” is the clearest showcase for his gifts.) Even for Crazy Horse, the music is simple but heartfelt. On tracks like “Olden Days” and “Rainbow of Colors,” Young’s basic folk melodies are rendered grittier and heavier by the band, if no less tender. “When you see those geese in the sky, think of me,” go the album’s opening lines, and Young often sings from this distance, watching over a world without him. Outside a few words of gratitude in the gorgeous closing track “I Do,” his lyrics rarely seem autobiographical, but they do seem newly focused and reflective. And while the documentary is certainly not the most riveting film Young’s put his name to (highlights include a story about producer John Hanlon getting poison oak), it does occasionally offer a pure snapshot of his creative process. Seeing how ecstatic Young gets over a subtle tambourine part in “Olden Days” may permanently alter how you hear that song. It offers a reminder of his passion, how the studio remains a source of excitement and joy after all these years. And yet, if it were up to him, none of us would be listening to this album in its final form. “I get to hear it the way we made it. Too bad about most of you,” he wrote on his website, bemoaning the current state of sound quality via streaming. The concern speaks to a lifelong battle with the industry, also discussed in his new 240-page book, but it also speaks to the struggle he’s faced as a solo recording artist this decade. Whether food justice or the destruction of the planet, his muses have often seemed muffled or misconstrued when they finally reach the market. Colorado surpasses those recent works by speaking directly to that ephemeral nature of life, our tragedies and joys and disappointments. “There’s so much we didn’t do,” Young and his bandmates sing together, their ages averaging around 73, in a ballad called “Green Is Blue.” And if one thing has remained unwavering about them, it’s that you know they mean every word.

Underground / Loverboy / Odditties Sodomies Vol. 2,Ariel Pink,by: Nathan Taylor Pemberton,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db1e048fd8a1f0009ad5929/1:1/w_160/underground.jpg,2019-10-30 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ariel-pink-underground-loverboy-odditties-sodomies-vol-2/,Mexican Summer,"There is a case to be made that Ariel Pink’s earliest music has always been a bit haunted. The whole wad of funhouse pop—pulled from crackly master tapes and spawned into reissues of reissues of reissues—keeps floating wraith-like towards listeners, two decades later. It’s how Pink himself described it in a Tiny Mix Tapes interview in 2006: “Once something is captured, it carries an objective power that lives outside of time and reality. It can be manipulated [...] like a person without a body that it can call its own. The world of sound has no visible territory or domain that it can claim. It offers its own spirit to the world for the sake of play and wonderment.” Pink’s idea of what would happen to his music mirrors an idea that writers Mark Fisher and Simon Reynolds were calling “hauntology” the same year. Each considered Pink’s music as the zeitgeisty sound of “time collapsing on itself”—the clearest sign that culture had crossed into an era where nothing could die. Or if by some chance it were to die, as they wrote, it would inevitably come back as a reissued collection. This isn’t to say a new and expansive reissue effort by Mexican Summer under the name “Ariel Archives” is a cynical cultural ploy. Rather, it just feels procedural in this phase of Pink’s two-decade career, not to mention one that feels cobbled together by aggrandized marketing language. Consider also that the musician’s entire career has been a retrospective project, vis a vis his managing and administering the vast musical trove he compiled in a blur of recording between 1999 and 2004. But these are “definitive” releases, the Brooklyn-based label notes, paired with expanded tracklistings, new art by Pink, remastered, and featuring thoughtful essays by Hedi El Kholti, the co-editor of publishing imprint Semiotext(e). The whole collection spans the six albums Pink recorded with his imaginary band Haunted Graffiti, plus three volumes of rarities. It’s the closest thing to a final destination for a catalog that has spent the better part of two decades in various states of disarray, sliding across our musical consciousness, across trends, and attitudes like a discarded CD-R on a trashed car floor. Split into four reissue cycles, the Ariel Archives begins with an odd trio: 1999’s Underground, 2002’s Loverboy, and the collection Odditties Sodomies Vol 2. The musical distance covered by just these three albums mirrors the varied locales in Los Angeles where Pink conceived them—an ashram in South Central, a ranch house in Val Verde where Graham Nash and a Grateful Dead percussionist once recorded, and his CalArts dorm room from which Underground first emerged. Pink says he simply took the sounds in his head and directly injected them into cassette machines of dubious quality, and Underground is the most spontaneous sounding of Pink’s early albums. It’s the one Haunted Graffiti album from this time with the least sense of itself, confined to the same handful of open guitar chords, an idea of sunbleached guitar anthems, and an idea of teenage ennui. “I stole a car so we could run away/Slow down I gotta hear you stay,” Pink sings in “Underground,” a lean guitar and mouth-drums combo that wanders over a melody like a stoned night drive. More than just fetish material for Pink completists, the reissues are most notable because Pink’s equally demonized, glorified, and debated lo-fidelity has been officially tampered with. The original master tapes were made available to credible engineers with good intentions. Unlike the flawed Paw Tracks reissues, the squashed mono mixes of both Loverboy and Underground have been cracked open into a wide stereo field. While a thin layer of tape hiss still hangs above each record like freeway smog, the depths unlocked by the remaster clear space for us to participate in Pink’s original fantasy more than ever. The tumbling AM-radio confections “My Molly” and “Doggone (Shegone)” can be imagined, faintly at least, as actual AM-radio hits, lost soft-rock artifacts recovered on a Saturday morning drive pouring out from a busted rear speaker. Loverboy and Underground’s newfound fidelity muddies the bigger picture of Pink’s legacy. Specifically, the idea that his work as Haunted Graffiti was a mere prelude to studio budgets, the dismal sonics of these albums an arbitrary choice, a condition of some broke musician recording in a squat. Instead, the precision remastering bolsters the minority opinion of what Fisher described as “anamorphic sonic objects.” The anamorphic being the idea of sounds working on the periphery of comprehension, combining into something radically different. In this view, Pink’s aesthetic wasn’t a fuzzy approximation of some “Porcelain Heaven” as Pitchfork writer Mike Powell wrote in 2006, but a visionary style unto itself. An intentional musical vernacular existing, in the end, as a gauzy, unified whole. In this context, given the clarity of the reissues, Loverboy is a futurist pop cycle. From the spectral, pulsing organs on “Ghosts” and “Don’t Talk to Strangers” to the shuffling mouth drums on “She’s My Girl,” Pink’s bedroom feels palatial, some hyper-baroque synth chamber hovering between this dimension and the next. It’s all very “time out of joint” as the French philosopher Jacques Derrida described his original concept of “hauntology.” But don’t let the seriousness of that concept jam you up. Both Loverboy and Odditties sound like they exist simply for the sake of play and wonderment, the latter showcasing Pink’s ability to toggle between styles (Britpop, new wave) and impersonation (be it Kate Bush whispers of “The World is Yours” or the eyes-closed Morrissey delivery in Pink’s cover of “This Night Has Opened My Eyes”). Instead of the usual line about Pink defacing the ideal of pop music, he’s actually defacing himself, either through the puffed up embellishment, of “Didn’t it Click” (“Ladies and gentlemen/The master of ceremonies, Ariel Pink!”) or the emasculated self-deprecation in the chorus of “Loverboy” written with John Maus. (“I love you like a dog or snake or a mouse or a bird/That's why they call me loverboy.”) All the talk of Pink’s musical “nostalgia” feels a bit propped up now—maybe it was ours all along? This haunted question was answered straightforwardly as far back as 2001 when Pink covered R. Stevie Moore’s “Hobbies Galore.” It’s the anthem of his complicated fiefdom, a tribute to the idea of himself, signs of a persona seen in the third-person, and an homage to his mentor. “Gee it’s great to be home/Hobbies galore/Don’t you engage in a craft/Don’t you like it alone/Locked behind doors,” Pink sings, sounding a bit like he’s nodding out on the strength of his own stuff. Who would blame him? The dark ages had just counted off a deathly tune—9/11, Bush, black sites, suicidal markets—and Pink was the one who could harmonize over it, as long as he was left alone, locked behind his many doors.

a tangle of stars,Mary HalvorsonJohn Dieterich,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db31e64a294dc0009cabc63/1:1/w_160/MaryHalvorsonAndJohnDieterich_atangleofstars.jpg,2019-10-30 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mary-halvorson-john-dieterich-a-tangle-of-stars/,New Amsterdam,"The guitarists Mary Halvorson and John Dieterich appear to inhabit disconnected worlds. During the last decade, Halvorson has reimagined the rules and roles of jazz guitar by pairing a graceful approach to melody with an iron will to warp, corrupt, and subvert it. In September, her work as a composer, bandleader, and improviser earned her a MacArthur “genius” fellowship. Dieterich, though, comes from what remains of the indie-rock underground. For two decades, he has been one of two guitarists in Deerhoof, a band whose only allegiance is to its absolute irreverence for genre. They make jock jams for nerds, pop songs for noise lovers—a scrappy, self-styled realm where philanthropic foundations rarely tread. But Dieterich’s Deerhoof are one of the most enthusiastically exploratory bands of their generation, as emphatic and magnetic covering the songs of The Shining as they are splitting the difference between Stereolab and Don Caballero. And Halvorson is the kind of musician who is perpetually down for whatever, whether supplying her singular approach to Anthony Braxton and Bill Frisell collaborations or writing intricate songs for others to sing. On their debut as a guitars-plus duo, a tangle of stars, this sense of wonder that Halvorson and Dieterich share takes center stage for a dozen disarming instrumentals. They score a frantic fight scene for “short knives” and summon the shapes of acid tracers on “continuous whatever.” They flirt with budget psychedelic rock with “my mother’s lover” and float through a haunted house on “ghost poem,” shaping a record that’s surprisingly accessible and emotional for this idiom. Guitar duos often suffer from too much or too little bravura: They can feel like masturbatory Guitar Center technical workouts, or limp handshakes upon a cold introduction. But Halvorson and Dieterich bring an easy aplomb to this session, captured at his New Mexico home when the two met to improvise to one another’s loose compositions. Early stunner “drum the rubber hate” is a feat of athleticism fit for metal shredders on a tropical holiday.  Their interwoven guitar lines move in and out of phase, each player taking a solo over the other’s rhythmic picking. But it’s a supremely good song, too, full of narrative tension and resolution and built with a hook that sinks deeply. Dietrich and Halvorson are self-assured enough as instrumentalists to realize their rendezvous is about something more than instrumental prowess. Indeed, the most complicated and compelling aspect of a tangle of stars is the rich and varied emotional landscape it surveys. None of these pieces trace easy moods in obvious ways; conflicted feelings are bound to each other like the rose and its thorn. “lace caps,” for instance, feels at first like an early fall day, the sun sparkling at the onset of the golden hour. It is as gentle and warm as the recent Windham Hill reappraisals of fellow traveler William Tyler. But notes start to wobble from their axes, Halvorson pushing them quickly to one side like a cat batting a ball of string, until the whole thing collapses. You listen again, searching for early trouble. “the handsome” is both ecstatic and panicked, “balloon chord” at once a daydream of drone and a nightmare of echo. Halvorson and Dieterich remain identifiable as composers and players throughout these pieces—you could spot her hard-edged picking inside a hurricane, after all, and his leads often glow like the neon sign of an all-night pizza parlor. But you can sense both players moving toward a shared space—or, at the very least, making room within their own systems for someone else. During “vega’s array,” Halvorson morphs notes in her trademark way, while Dieterich turns a mesmerizing melody into a never-ending spider web. Toward the middle, their styles begin to blur, one’s tricks dissolving inside the other’s. The song starts to shimmer like a mirage—inviting but illusory, thrilling but dangerous, two worlds collapsing into one unstable beauty.","On their duo debut, these guitarists step outside of free jazz and indie rock to offer a dozen surprisingly accessible and warm instrumentals.

Days B4 III,Lucki,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db88597240be10008ccecb8/1:1/w_160/lucki.jpeg,2019-10-30 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lucki-days-b4-iii/,EMPIRE,"If you begin to notice an uptick in melodramatic and emotional social media posts, that usually means new Lucki music is in the air. Earlier this year, the Chicago rapper released Freewave 3, a bleak project that detailed his heartbreak and the drugs that lead to that heartbreak. At times, the album is an uncomfortable listen, as Lucki narrates low points that typically would be reserved for a therapist: On the album’s centerpiece “Peach Dream,” his mother googles the effects of lean and sends him articles about the impact the drug will have on his kidneys. With the 23-year-old’s second project of the year, Days B4 III, Lucki is in a better place. If Freewave 3 was rock bottom, then Days B4 III is the climb back up. He reflects on his last year, getting everything off of his chest before he can finally move on and recapture the optimism that laced his music when he was a teenager. Lucki’s music works so well in large part due to his ear for production, plodding hi-hats that make it feel like your brain is stuck in quicksand, and his eerie, doomsday melodies. On Days B4 III, Lucki works with a team of producers that help him create that downcast sound: From a homegrown Chicago producer like DJ Eway to SoundCloud pillars like 16yrold and Brent Rambo. The twinkly and dreamy “Geeked,” produced by Condo, best defines Lucki’s blurry world. “Codeine never get bored of me,” he says, reflecting on times when he was most dependent on drugs. Even when Lucki tackles brighter production, like the spacy 16yrold-produced “Way 2 Rare,” he still fears spiraling back into that isolation: “Left me all alone, I hope there’s two of me,” he murmurs. Lucki can portray his self-destructiveness with the clarity of Future, like when his son asks why his water is pink on “TBT.” He wears the influence of Chief Keef on his sleeve, both in the Almighty So-inspired cover art and the way he pairs a narcotized delivery with a choir of ad-libs like on the cryptic Working On Dying-produced “Left 4 Dead.” And like a throwback New York storyteller, a city that he has spent a lot of time in, he can piece together coherent and lively tales when he wants to. His best story is the bitter finale “Last Time Mentioning (Good Riddance),” as he bitterly recaps the friends, girlfriends, and opportunities that drugs have driven away in the last year or so.  But, just like the song title hints, he wants to put it behind him. When Days B4 III ends, the dark clouds separate and the sun peeks through. It’s a suggestion that maybe he’s through with the story he’s been telling and adding to since he was 17, and now he’s ready to begin a new one.","The Chicago rapper reflects on a bleak personal year and starts to recapture the optimism of his earlier music.

Jesus Is King,Kanye West,by: Rawiya Kameir,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db73da8fd8a1f0009ad5c80/1:1/w_160/jesusisking_kanye.jpg,2019-10-29 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kanye-west-jesus-is-king/,Def Jam,"In 1964, in the small, rural community of Longdale, Mississippi, a group of black worshippers at the Mount Zion Methodist Church were ambushed by the Ku Klux Klan. The attackers, some of whom were allegedly dressed in police uniform, broke one man’s jaw, viciously beat others, and ultimately burned the building to the ground. In the midst of the chaos, a woman named Beatrice Cole launched into a spoken prayer of despair: “Father, I stretch my hand to Thee, no other help I know. If Thou withdraw Thyself from me, where shall I go?” Improbably, the Klansmen retreated. Such was the power of the gospel. “Father I Stretch My Hands To Thee,” an unsmiling Methodist hymn written by Isaac Watts in the early 1700s and turned into a rousing standard by black gospel singers over the next century, has since transcended the church pew. It is ostensibly a favorite of Kanye West, who sampled Pastor T.L. Barrett’s version on 2016’s The Life of Pablo, in a song that opens with a non sequitur about a bleached butthole. Three years and a religious rebirth later, the motif returns on West’s ninth album, Jesus Is King. “Follow God,” whose title is as literal as gospel can get, is organized around a sample of a burning vocal: “Father I stretch, stretch my hands to you,” goes the singer of an obscure 1974 track, Whole Truth’s “Can You Lose By Following God.” Recorded (and, apparently, re-recorded) in the months after he announced a recommitment to Christianity, the album is West’s first offering in the wake of Sunday Service, the performance series he’s turned into something of a global church brand. As West sells it, figuratively and literally, Jesus Is King is a repudiation of his past sin, an absolution, a blank slate from which to spread the word of a very specific God, one whose blessings rain down on a cul-de-sac in Calabasas and a ranch in Jackson Hole. He’s always presented as religious—“Jesus Walks” imagined the club as a holy temple back in 2004; the Kardashians’ labored, glamorous Easter photos have become something of an annual tradition; Pablo was explicitly an album about faith—and yet the timing is notable. By most accounts, fewer and fewer Americans identify as Christian, and a steadily growing number describe themselves as atheist or agnostic. The religious, meanwhile, identify as more devout. Consider the power of the evangelical right on the political landscape, into which West has inserted himself in recent years, causing some of the turmoil that presumably sent him seeking refuge in Christ this spring. (In a recent piece for Vibe, the writer Kiana Fitzgerald, who shares with West a bipolar diagnosis, put forth a moving theory connecting spiritual fervor with the experience of mania.) Though Jesus Is King followed what is now a characteristically chaotic album rollout for West, the result is much more focused than his 2018 album ye. His mythical rap-camp format, popularized with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy’s Hawaii origin story, unifies the contributions of producers as disparate as Timbaland, Pi’erre Bourne, Boogz, and Evan Mast of Ratatat into 27 minutes of pleasant, if not entirely transgressive, textures. Some of the hallmarks of 20th-century gospel are evident, and warmly applied: the rise and fall of a formidable choir; the velvety growl of a Hammond organ; an undulating piano; rhythms that stretch through history and geography, all the way back to West Africa. It is a markedly more cohesive and enjoyable album than I believed him capable of creating at this juncture. Jesus Is King nods to a handful of moments from the past 15 years of West’s career. The gospel-soul sample deployed on “God Is” harkens to his early days as an in-house producer at Roc-A-Fella. The maximalism of his leather-skirt phase is all over the expansive soundscape of “Use This Gospel,” whose Kenny G sax solo might be the 2019 equivalent of throwing Elton John onto a hook, just because you can. Elsewhere, the stark, confrontational attitude of 2013’s Yeezus is echoed in the battle drums that propel “Selah.” His raspy pleading on “Water” recalls the era of loosies that produced “Only One” and “FourFiveSeconds.” Throughout, Auto-Tuned vocals draw a line from 2008’s 808s & Heartbreak all the way through to the anguish of Pablo. Though Jesus Is King offers some resolution to the darkness hinted at on Pablo, it lacks the deeply human searching that made that album effective and moving. Life is not black and white, and neither is the experience of communing with any god. The most interesting moment, thematically, comes in the inherent tension between a reunited Clipse—Pusha-T and his older brother No Malice—on “Use This Gospel” for the first time in several years and at different stages of self-reflection. They connect the relatable universality of gospel as delivered on Jesus Is King by Fred Hammond, Ty Dolla $ign, and Ant Clemons, whose singing collectively comes closest to expressing the inspiring, sustaining gentleness of a warmly held faith. Think, for example, of the mountain to be traversed on “Climbing Higher Mountains” or the storm to be crossed on “Take My Hand, Precious Lord.” Whereas much traditional and contemporary gospel invokes struggle, salvation, and transformation, Jesus Is King is largely focused on the ways in which religion has served Kanye himself. “How you got so much favor on your side?/‘Accept him as your lord and savior,’ I replied,” he raps on “On God.” If West’s mission is, as he told Zane Lowe in an interview last week, to convert people to Christianity, he’ll likely have to search a little deeper. Beyond superficial gestures at biblical references and the capitalist leanings of American prosperity gospel, there is virtually no indication here as to what it means to follow Jesus. That is, other than to perhaps sit back and wait for Him to give you a Forbes cover and a billion-dollar sneaker brand. It’s hard to take West seriously when the obstacles he distresses over are Instagram likes and steep tax rates (the IRS, he complains, wants “half of the pie”). Rather than the grace, justice, and love that characterizes faith at its most transformative, West internalizes the religious entitlement that props up the wealthy and powerful, validating months of jokes about his ambitions as a megachurch pastor. Revelations in recent weeks—that he admonished his wife for wearing tight clothes, asked collaborators to abstain from premarital sex, and began keeping a Christian scorecard that includes limiting himself to two curse words a day—suggest his interpretation of the gospel has been more dogmatic than faithful. Historically, it has been the vulnerability with which he expresses his own hypocrisies and moral failings that have made West a uniquely compelling artist; unfortunately, there is very little of that complexity on Jesus Is King. (An exception is “Follow God,” where an argument with his father prompts consideration, however shallow, of what it means to be “Christlike.”) There is not enough depth here to distract from his politics, or to complicate them. It’s an album of slogans, dashed-off and too short, and as he continues to test the edge between spontaneous and half-finished, it gets harder to ignore the facts hovering outside the frame. His call for the abolishment of the 13th Amendment, for example, is in direct opposition to his avowed support of a racist, punitive, incarceration-obsessed president. Yes, the bassline on “Water” is one of the best I’ve heard in a long time, but a moment like this feels like a consolation, not a highlight. Kanye albums used to stretch our perspectives and imaginations. Now they illuminate the contours of his increasingly shrunken world.","Christianity is the unwavering focus of Kanye’s gospel album, a richly produced but largely flawed record about one man’s love of the Lord (and himself).

Pyroclasts,Sunn O))),by: Daniel Martin-McCormick,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db21c7c82b2450008977fc9/1:1/w_160/pyroclasts.jpg,2019-10-29 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sunn-o-pyroclasts/,Southern Lord,"Stephen O’Malley once described Sunn O))) as his “guitar band,” which is a striking understatement. Over the band’s nearly two-decade run, they’ve never deviated from a singular mission: crushingly glacial guitars played at devastating volumes. Since 2009’s Monoliths & Dimensions, the duo has gracefully slipped the shackles of heavy metal, remaining rooted in its ferocious aesthetic while pursuing high concept collaborations and drone at its most incantatory. Sunn 0))) is a guitar band like a hurricane is wind. April’s Life Metal had a distinct back-to-basics quality, stepping away from the orchestrations and composer commissions for some of the pure, indefinite-hiatus riffage on which Sunn 0))) built their name. Recorded by Steve Albini, the album showed Greg Anderson and O’Malley summoning a sound of overwhelming scope and elegance, moving with just a little bit of extra authority. Pyroclasts is a companion to that album, recorded in the same sessions but stripped even further back. At the start and end of each day of recording, the group and their collaborators would perform a simple exercise: explore a single modal drone for 12 minutes; Albini would capture it, and they would move on. These four selections can be experienced as a sort of frame for Life Metal’s more definitive statement. Not compositions, nor exactly improvisations, the group describes them as “a daily practice,” calling to mind a regular meditation or yoga routine (except at pain-threshold dB). And like a series of stretches, these sessions were intended to open up the musicians as they worked through the album. None of that would matter if they didn’t open the listeners up, too. But, of course, they do. The experience on even the biggest headphones won’t ever be the same as Sunn 0))) in concert, but a full run through with Pyroclasts cranked all the way will leave few moods unaltered. Though visually steeped in the quasi-medieval occultisms of Scandinavia’s most notorious groups, listening to Sunn 0))) has always been a fundamentally life-affirming experience. Their tunings are too rich, their gestures too focused for nihilism. The titular inversion of Life Metal suggests a manifesto, and Pyroclasts could be Exhibit A in their argument. There’s little use discussing the relative merits of one track over another. Though variations span the length of the album, the feel is so consistently immersive you lose track of yourself in the sound, which seems like the point. “Frost (C)” howls and shudders, its low end seeming to extend to the deepest, cruddiest bowels of the earth. Around the five-minute mark of “Ampliphædies (E),” someone takes what might loosely be called a solo. No surprise that it focuses mostly on one note; rather than articulating melodic flourishes, it feels like it’s clawing its way out of a mudslide of distortion, gasping for air before being subsumed into the mass. Finally “Ascension (A)” lunges with a triumphant drive worthy of its title. “You’re inside of it,” O’Malley recently said of his sound in an interview. “That’s something that’s been part of my own development as a musician… evaporating.” Here one might think of buddhist monks in the Himalayas. The chant “om,” when pronounced correctly, is supposed to come from the throat, through the mouth and then the lips before returning to the silence from whence it came. This completeness is a sacred expression of the radiant, transcendent infinity of the universe. Pyroclasts feels about as close to that completeness as a metal album by a druid-robed group named after their amplifiers can get.

Sleepmoss,Meemo Comma,by: Ruth Saxelby,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db36254fd8a1f0009ad5b63/1:1/w_160/meemo.jpg,2019-10-29 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/meemo-comma-sleepmoss/,Planet Mu,"Have you ever picked a blade of grass, stretched it taut between your two thumbs, and blown this makeshift reed to release its musical potential? You get the same sort of satisfying squeak when you walk across a wet lawn in sneakers. This almost animalistic sound is rife in the latter half of “Night Rain,” from UK producer Lara Rix-Martin’s second album as Meemo Comma, Sleepmoss. Had she not stated in the accompanying notes that the record was inspired by her daily walks on the South Downs—a stretch of hills that runs for a couple hundred miles along the southeast coast of England—it wouldn’t have been too tricky to work out: the dense and scurrying sonics of Sleepmoss quickly establish the gist. Sometimes the musing on a personal relationship with nature is especially explicit, as on the soothing “Murmur,” with its field recordings of morning birdsong, the simulated tap-tap-tap of a woodpecker, and a low hum that evokes a thousand busy minibeasts. Likewise, the crunch and creaking tones of “Tanglewood” suggest a contemplative autumnal woodland stroll. That said, Sleepmoss really soars in those moments where Rix-Martin’s sound design is attuned to a more cinematic purpose. The use of distortion and what sounds like reversed audio on “Windross,” for example, accurately conveys the sensation of wind whipping past the ears, the fragments of signals it carries forever scrambled. “Amethyst Deceiver,” too, is irresistibly uncanny; its tense and scraggly melody conjures a hopping magpie in my mind’s eye, bending its head to one side as if to assess the onlooker’s character. Being in nature, wherever you are in the world, amplifies your own internal nature. It’s not just the isolation that leads to reflection, but the abundance of life and death in a never-ending cycle. What makes Sleepmoss a particularly English countryside album in this regard is that it nails the predictably unpredictable weather. There are parallels to be drawn between the ecosystem of UK undergrowth—damp and rotting, yet at once sprouting and squirming—and the thought cycles of the mind. It’s the presence of rain that grounds Sleepmoss and gives it strength. Where the album occasionally falters is in its attempts to evoke rain’s opposite. While most of the album avoids pastoral cliché to walk a more nuanced path, the bright synth and chimes of “Winter Sun” come off as twee. Similarly, on closing track “Psithur,” a soft synth that sounds like a CGI pan pipe is an odd note to end on. It falls flat because it feels like it’s trying too hard, unlike the rest of Sleepmoss. When I smell wet soil, I know that I am from the earth and one day will return to the earth. This is the truth of the great outdoors and one that Rix-Martin excavates with care.

Four of Arrows,Great Grandpa,by: Leah Mandel ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db1debf24e92e00084a0492/1:1/w_160/fourofarrows.jpg,2019-10-29 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/great-grandpa-four-of-arrows/,Double Double Whammy,"Two years ago, Great Grandpa were a different band. The Seattle quintet’s 2017 debut album, Plastic Cough, nestled right into the wave of anxious, quippy rock bands like Charly Bliss, Diet Cig, Dude York, and many more that still roam the indie landscape. But there was something about lead singer Alex Menne’s voice, their clear and emotional delivery on casual lines like “Always killin’ it” that was particularly striking. But when bassist and vocalist Carrie Goodwin and her husband and primary songwriter Pat Goodwin relocated to Milwaukee from Seattle last year, the move left the band in flux while they wrote their second album, Four of Arrows. With 2,000 miles between them, Great Grandpa’s songs became more spacious, folksy, and adroit, losing almost all of the grunge that characterized Plastic Cough. They taped a paper sign on the studio wall that said, “Go slow, big choices.” On Four of Arrows, the band takes a step back and thrives in more deliberate songwriting. Great Grandpa retain their tweemo sensibilities on songs like the two-chorus single “Mono no Aware,” whose almost-cloying pop-rock sound, lines about pathos, dead birds, and grandma fading from Alzheimer’s like a “lifeless steak in that empty diner” recall the best of Rilo Kiley. They lean into more adventurous arrangements throughout, especially on “English Garden,” a song about dreams and fears on which Pat plays banjo and piano, and Abby Gunderson is on the violin and cello. (Mellotrons, synths, and harmoniums also make welcome appearances on this record.) Menne’s vocals—all their many croons and yelps—are truly front and center this time. Songs like the bursting opener “Dark Green Water,” hold the kind of emotional urgency of the best Hop Along songs; Menne’s springy voice carries a similar power and effect as Frances Quinlan's. “Digger,” the record’s tarot-inspired centerpiece, pierces the veil of mannered indie rock when Menne wails, “That’s why I hate you” four times in a row. Plastic Cough’s mid-point was a particularly cacophonous track called “Expert Eraser.” But the interlude on Four of Arrows is the piano instrumental “Endling,” composed and played by Pat Goodwin and recorded on the piano from Death Cab For Cutie’s 2003 album, Transatlanticism. The album doesn’t really benefit from this soundscape, except to tie them to their emotional indie-rock forbears, and to make their shift in sound unmistakable. There’s a lot more piano and there’s a lot more death on this record—“Rosalie” and “Split Up The Kids,” both songs penned by Carrie Goodwin, deal with the “relentless regress” of growing old and how she only ever saw her grandparents together at her grandfather’s funeral, respectively. Four of Arrows’ best songs are ones Menne co-wrote, ones that keep the energy up and the ideas simple. On “Treat Jar,” which wouldn’t sound out of place on ‘90s alt radio, Menne sings daggers to the heart: “I can’t help you if I can’t help myself,” and, “Everything is hard this time of year.” And “Bloom,” an ecstatic track about letting your spirit bloom and being “young enough to change” is one of their strongest yet. “I get anxious on the weekends, when I feel I’m wasting time,” Menne croons, “But then I think about Tom Petty and how he wrote his best songs when he was 39.” Time is on their side.

Cheap Queen,King Princess,by: Olivia Horn ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da4d06c240253000865dfe5/1:1/w_160/kingprincess.jpg,2019-10-28 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/king-princess-cheap-queen/,ZeligColumbia,"By now, Mikaela Straus’ artistic predicament has become uncannily familiar: A young unknown with a fresh, infectious sound releases a song that catches fire. Streams rack up, fame arrives overnight; the pressure’s on to articulate an artistic identity, cook up a debut album, and make good on the promise of that first hit, fast—all while contending with the gaze of several million curious onlookers. If Straus, who’s better known as King Princess, wanted to compare notes on the ups and downs of a viral breakout, she could do so with a fairly spectacular peer group that includes Maggie Rogers, Billie Eilish, and Clairo. Straus’ story has an added layer of complexity. Last year, the 20-year-old singer-songwriter rose up on the shoulders of her song “1950,” a sticky, Harry Styles-cosigned debut that took inspiration from classic queer literature and opened with a nod to her sexual orientation: “I hate it when dudes try to chase me.” On its heels came “Talia,” a bit of liquor-wet, post-breakup revelry directed to a conspicuously female subject, and the self-explanatory single “Pussy Is God.” Within months, King Princess was not just a burgeoning pop phenom, but a burgeoning queer idol. In the historically sanitized landscape of pop music, queer expression is undeniably radical, particularly how Straus does it—by naming and gendering her desire in a way that, not long ago, few dared to. And if Straus is fazed by the burden of representation, she doesn’t show it. Her debut album—that first true test of her artistry—is titled Cheap Queen, borrowing a term from drag culture, and on its cover, she appears with her face done up in drag queen glam, down to the painted-on beauty mark. The title track, she says, is a tribute to her squad, all cheap queens in their own right. (Straus, whose father runs Brooklyn’s Mission Sound studio, inherited a leg up in the industry, so it’s a bit cheeky of her to make a personal brand of scrappiness—but then, cheekiness is part of her brand, too.) Like any good pop song, “Cheap Queen” strikes a balance between specificity and relatability. It shouts out its community without wading into identity politics, instead cultivating, through its inclusive warmth and effortless swagger, a stoner-pop appeal likely to resonate with anyone who’s ever stayed up drinking and smoking with pals. Thematically, though, “Cheap Queen”—originally one of the album’s sharp, economical interludes, until Straus’ team persuaded her to expand it—stands apart. On the whole, the album is more concerned with lovers than with friends. Sequenced as a chronological narrative, Cheap Queen loosely follows a fraught renegotiation of space between exes; the particulars aren’t quite so interesting as the emotions they draw out. Straus has noted her eagerness to “write about getting my heart smashed,” and she repeatedly delivers on the drama of that declaration. “Homegirl,” a schmaltzy, vibraphone-embellished ballad, tracks the triangulation of glances between Straus and the boys who are eyeing the same woman at a party—the kind of gathering where close quarters reveal vast emotional distance. The gulf between Straus and her love interest widens as she considers forgotten possessions unlikely to be reclaimed (“Isabel’s Moment”) and nervously awaits a text unlikely to arrive (“Watching My Phone”). The latter song’s clincher is an admission of inadequacy: “I can’t be the million girls you’re going to meet.” The meekness is gutting; its narrator is barely recognizable as the same person who earlier claimed to be “getting too cocky, since everyone wants me,” who wrote off her ex with a sweetly condescending, “You’re probably just a fan now, babe.” But embracing opposing energies is the King Princess way. She is confident and vulnerable, cool and earnest. As her chosen moniker suggests, she’s masculine and feminine, swaggering and soft, posing for Playboy as both cheerleader and jock. She’s posing for Playboy, a bastion of the male gaze that her widely broadcasted sexuality belies. In particular, Cheap Queen plays on a tension between old and new. Straus and her Gen-Z peers grew up listening to Drake, Beyoncé, and Taylor Swift, but Straus’ industry-adjacent upbringing also exposed her to ’70s rock bands including Led Zeppelin and T. Rex. Like Styles, who helped precipitate her fame, she seems eager to cut her modern pop sensibility with doses of historicism. On Cheap Queen, the drum pads and Auto-Tune harmonics that defined her first singles are still part of the mix, but the computer isn’t her primary tool. There’s a hint of Janis Joplin when Straus layers in blues guitar and organ or teases the occasional snarl out of her otherwise silky voice. Latter-day rock prophet Father John Misty drops by to handle drums on “Ain’t Together,” a crisp, handsome tune with Beatles-esque eccentricity in its (digitally approximated) Mellotron fills and densely layered backing vocals. Still, Straus is a distinctly contemporary creator, versed in samples and pitch-shifts and interludes—songs as short as post-digital attention spans—that house some of her most intriguing musical ideas. To the extent that viral success is explicable, it seems sensible that hers continues to hold. As Cheap Queen makes plain, she’s not an ingénue with one great idea—she has a few dozen of them, informed by sources spanning decades and genres. There are moments when she slips up—“Watching My Phone,” with its lugubrious strings and wistful choral embellishments, feels particularly overworked—and she isn’t breaking ground in pop by disregarding its supposed borders. But where post-genre stream-baiters pull their numbers by anesthetizing distinctive sounds, King Princess pulls hers by playing up their contrasts.

12H,Donato Dozzy,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db1bf0ca294dc0009cabb71/1:1/w_160/12h_donatodozzy.jpg,2019-10-28 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/donato-dozzy-12h/,Presto!?,"For over 15 years, Italian producer Donato Dozzy has masterfully ranged from tech house to trance to straight techno. But at his core, he is a minimalist, gleefully finding the strangest, most archaic element to zoom in on, turning any mole hill into Monte Bianco. His beatific ambient techno collaboration with fellow producer Neel, 2012’s Voices From the Lake, took as its starting point a single incident, a live set to be performed at Japan’s infamous Labyrinth festival. And in the past few years, Dozzy’s zoomed in even further, relentlessly exploring every imaginable facet of the mouth harp, the 303, and Anna Caragnano’s singing voice across full-length albums. So it makes a certain kind of sense that a single object lies at the heart of his latest epic, 12H: the Armando Trovajoli - Music Bridge in Rome. While plans for the structure date back to 1929, the bridge was only completed in 2008. It’s the lone steel bridge that runs over the River Tiber into the historic center of Rome. This release on Lorenzo Senni’s Presto!? label is culled from material that Dozzy recorded and assembled for a sound installation designed for 24 speakers that ran the length of the colonnade of the bridge. 12H clocks in at almost 100 minutes, at times evoking the immersive, exquisitely detailed ambience of Voices from the Lake, but without the same breathtaking vistas and sumptuous peaks. The set opens with Dozzy in resplendent, shimmering ambient mode, all body-dissolving washes, tingling small bells, electronics that mimic the sound of frogs at night, and slow-moving arpeggios. Other elements pop up, like running water and clattering wind chimes, before “12H.3” introduces a gentle pulse and quivering synth line, only to have it splash back into gurgly water sounds and electronics. A magnificent highlight comes on “12H.5,” which could be a leftover from Sintetizzatrice, his collaboration with Caragnano. The track painstakingly layers her gossamer breaths, building a sigh into a skyscraper.  As that piece dissipates, the first smattering of percussion finally enters, nearly 45 minutes into the album, the hand drums pinging about the stereo field like a gentle tribute to E2-E4. Usually when drums enter Dozzy’s mixes, they elevate the proceedings to an unimaginable new high. Here, they don’t really add much in the way of emotion or release. The throbs of “12H.8” soon get submerged by field recordings of insects rustling in the distance. The metallic thrums and acid stabs that punctuate “12H.9” are texturally intriguing, though they too soon fall to the wayside. We’re left to wonder what it might have sounded like had Dozzy pushed a few elements further or higher (as when Dozzy dropped a masterful techno rework of “12H.5” as a single earlier this year), rather than let the strictures of minimalism tamp everything down. The sounds of bridge traffic dovetail nicely with 12H’s kosmische-esque closing track, but like most urban congestion problems, it just takes far too long to get there.","Clocking in at almost 100 minutes, the Italian producer’s latest is a muted effort that was originally designed as a sound installation for a bridge in Rome.

Cry,Cigarettes After Sex,by: Sophie Kemp ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da4ece07b52f700084b549c/1:1/w_160/cry.jpg,2019-10-28 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cigarettes-after-sex-cry/,Partisan,"It feels almost like a novelty these days for a dude to write an album entirely about being extremely horny. Men don’t make music about sex the way they used to. We are far past the epoch of Serge Gainsbourg writing pop songs that involved Jane Birkin or Brigitte Bardot mimicking the sounds of orgasm. People have more or less collectively agreed that rendering women as pure sex objects in music doesn’t need to happen so much anymore. Greg Gonzalez, the frontman of the noir dream-pop band Cigarettes After Sex, must not have gotten the memo. He operates within a space of midcentury sexual anachronism. His second record, Cry, is a 41-minute dream about Penthouse pets and women in silken underthings, filtered through chiaroscuro and top-shelf whiskey. There is a universe where this raciness could conceivably offer a reprieve from indie rock’s occasional prudishness. Unfortunately, Gonzalez’s candor about his desire comes off as lifeless and borderline asinine. This is clear from the first play of the record. The bleak textures, like those of the band’s debut, have been airlifted from the darkest corners of dream-pop music. There are notes of Violet Indiana and the Verve circa A Storm in Heaven, as well as more obvious tips of the hat to Angelo Badalamenti and David Lynch. “Kiss It Off Me,” the album’s second song, uses subterranean synth parts that are uncannily similar to the ones on the Twin Peaks soundtrack. The intrigue and Lynchian darkness pretty much stop once we meet the apple of Gonzalez’s eye, a protagonist as two-dimensional as a piece of paper peeling off a picnic table in a light breeze. “I could see you were walking slow/Drinking a Slurpee/In a peach baseball cap/Falling in my lap/You were so thirsty,” Gonzalez sings, with unearned wistfulness. He yearns to make her forget about “all of those rich fuckboys” she tends to date, and by the end of the song, she’s biting her lip and begging for it before she heads off to the gym in the morning. If there is anything romantic about this encounter, it is washed away by the song’s utter inability to deviate from overused ’90s pastiche—or, more importantly, to represent the woman in question as anything other than some chick who loves to work out and have sex. Then there’s “Hentai,” a song that’s literally about anime porn. Specifically, about a hentai video he described to his paramour the first time they “made love,” about “a girl who as soon as she made you come/Could show you the future and tell you your fortune.” The scene setting could almost be funny, but there’s scant irony in Gonzalez’s delivery. The sound of the song is as delicate as an antique plate gathering dust on a shelf: High notes on electric guitars are languidly plucked, and the bassline is a slow IV drip that gives you goosebumps. Then there’s the question of Gonzalez’s voice, a truly lovely and androgynous tenor that’s wasted on lines like these. You could lose yourself in the sound, if losing yourself is akin to collapsing on an overly plush bed. “Pure” is an equally banal and pornographic sketch of a song. Here, Gonzalez’s woman wears a white bodysuit and has wet hair.  Long story short, she goes down on him, and then they go stare out the window but all he can think about is how he got to see her naked. It’s the album’s closer, but it’s likely to leave you feeling nothing, other than perhaps blunted anger. Cry doesn’t evoke much in the name of passion. Unless, of course, passion is the same thing as wafting through depression, and sex is the means to fill that void. There is nothing wry about the way Gonzalez writes about sex. The album has almost zero sense of humor and is deadly serious in its execution. It’s important to write about sex on one’s own terms, and there are plenty of compelling ways to explore sexuality in song. The problem here is that the narrative of this record is essentially one giant, dull, and gross fantasy plucked from adolescent male puberty. It presents a vision of sex that comes from surfing Pornhub after school before your parents get home from work, and from looking at pictures of minimally clad Instagram influencers while waiting in line to get a flu shot. Gonzalez’s attempt to be honest about his experiences is far removed from the reality of what it is like to be sexually vulnerable in front of another person. Cry is a soulless and Styrofoam record as hollow as a booty-call text at 3 a.m. “Hey sexy, you up?” the record seems to beckon. It’s hardly an inviting proposition.

"Hello, I’m Doing My Best",Ali Barter,by: Shaad D’Souza,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5daf762cfd8a1f0009ad5617/1:1/w_160/alibarter.jpg,2019-10-28 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ali-barter-hello-im-doing-my-best/,Inertia,"Though happily married and sober, Melbourne songwriter and guitarist Ali Barter wouldn’t dare write about anything so peaceful. Barter’s muse is the thrilling turbulence of young adulthood, and the lasting resonance of the bad decisions one makes in their early 20s. On her new record Hello, I’m Doing My Best, these themes coalesce with the confidence and immediacy of 2000s pop-rock. The result is an emotionally nuanced album that never takes itself too seriously. Barter’s debut, 2017’s A Suitable Girl, was a lovably slapdash collection of, in the words of one beloved teen film, “angry girl music of the indie-rock persuasion”—feminist pop-rock that angled for everywoman relatability. That formula worked well for Barter, with the singles “Girlie Bits” and “Cigarette” achieving modest success in her home country. Many of the songs on A Suitable Girl, though, suffered from a certain anonymity. Her bid for universality resulted in lines like “What’s a woman made of?/Something glorious”—well-intentioned but nevertheless a little hackneyed. Hello, I’m Doing My Best makes no such attempts, instead leaning full-tilt into Barter’s loose-cannon instincts. She draws herself as an indie rock Fleabag, a self-deprecating and hard-drinking flirt who texts her crushes at 3 a.m. and listens to “Malibu” to get through the hangover the next morning. From its earliest moments—the Hole reference comes in the very first line—Hello, I’m Doing My Best is appealingly frank. “Ur a Piece of Shit,” the second track, is a bombastic love letter to a friend in crisis: “You got your daddy issues,” Barter sings. “It made you real suspicious/That’s why you hacked in his account.” She wastes no time with poetics, and while it’s a risky move—she ends up rhyming “drugs” with “drugs”—it displays a kind of gonzo commitment to the album’s messy, diaristic heart. With loud and unadorned production, Hello, I’m Doing My Best taps into a current of emotive, candid pop-rock typified by the Josie and the Pussycats soundtrack and currently practiced by the likes of Charly Bliss and Bully. There’s not an ounce of crunch or grit here, just clean, sanded-down edges and lacquered finishes. The production—handled by Barter’s husband, Oscar Dawson of the band Holy Holy—adds an early-2000s patina, giving the record the pleasing accessibility of teen classics like Avril Lavigne’s Let Go. Hello, I’m Doing My Best often reads as a guidebook for young adults learning to navigate the world, and in that light, Barter’s no-bullshit lyricism is punkish and endearing. On “Ur a Piece of Shit,” for example, she gleefully calls on listeners to “put your hands up” for various messed-up teenage experiences, like “eating disorders,” “if a doctor touched you,” and “if it felt good to cut yourself.” In moments like these, Barter resembles a young Liz Phair, writing with a shamelessness that few songwriters since have really relished. Lines like, “I heard you like Tool, yeah/And you got really cool hair/And I think that you should be my boyfriend” feel directly indebted to Phair, and the chorus of “History of Boys” (“I used to get drunk and blackout/I used to get drunk and tell you I need you”), while hewing closer to pop than anything Phair wrote in her early days, owes its gutsiness to her. It helps that Barter never lets a linear personal narrative define these songs. The only time she writes about her now-husband, on “Backseat,” she revisits a time before they met, hinting at the future by declaring that “we’d be perrrrrfect” alongside a grandiose Guitar Hero-style solo. “January,” a dejected highlight on an otherwise frenetic album, stops in at one of life’s Sisyphean checkpoints: the hope of magically becoming a better person come New Year’s Day. “I made it through the year again with Diet Coke and cigarettes,” she sings. It could be any year; life, Barter seems to say, runs on a loop, and despite all we think we’ve learned, no amount of personal growth is certain to prevent mistakes. Even hindsight rarely makes everything clear. At least Hello, I’m Doing My Best makes it sound like a blast.

(GI),Germs,by: Madison Bloom,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5daf416b5ce1ca0008c55fde/1:1/w_160/germs.jpg,2019-10-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/germs-gi/,Slash,"Trying to get the straight story of Los Angeles punk band Germs is like trying to piece together the timeline of a debaucherous night out: The specifics are blurry, the headache is blinding, and everybody has a different take on what happened. One lucid fact pierces through the hangover: Germs were a mess of contradictions. Doomed frontman Darby Crash was a well-read savant and a mumbling cretin, crowds adored and abhorred them, and the music they made in four belligerent years reached decades beyond their downfall. By the time their sole studio album (GI) arrived in 1979, Germs had swaggered their way to local infamy, and Crash had crowned himself the genius king of Hollywood’s juvenile delinquents. He died by suicide a little more than a year later at 22. The first LP ever released by Slash Records, (GI) captured Germs in top form. It documents four hardworking iconoclasts who somehow translated their chaotic live sets into a classic record. Before punk-rock brevity came into vogue, Germs opted for glam flamboyance: After forming in 1977, their working name was Sophistifuck and the Revlon Spam Queens. Crash (then known as Bobby Pyn) started the group with friend and classmate Pat Smear. Crash and Smear both attended IPS—an alternative education program within L.A.’s University High School that imparted principles of EST and Scientology. It was there that Crash first dabbled in amateur mind control. “[Darby] had this natural power,” Crash’s friend and schoolmate Paul Roessler recalled in the Germs oral history Lexicon Devil. “It was either that he was so much smarter than anybody else… or he had techniques that he learned from the books he read or from IPS. Or he just had magic.” It was this “magic” that somehow had Germs on everyone’s lips before their first gig at the Orpheum in ’77. Their live debut, opening for the Weirdos, included very little music. “Germs were absolutely fucking terrible!” recalled Weirdos drummer Nickey Beat. “They came on stage, tuned up for 10 or 15 minutes, and then got through maybe one-third of their first song and stopped and started over again… [Darby] took the mic and stuck it in a jar of peanut butter… The Germs weren’t to be taken seriously after that night… for a while.” What Germs lacked in serious prospects they made up for in absurdity. They taunted interviewers like bratty siblings, destroyed property, and got their first single, “Forming,” on the radio by calling KROQ DJ Rodney Bingenheimer multiple times a day until he relented. The band’s fuck-it-all approach seemed both carefree and calculated: long before merch bundles and lengthy album rollouts, Germs had T-shirts, a logo, and a loyal mob of fans, known as Circle One, before they ever laid down a record. Circle One members, typically women, identified themselves by wearing the band’s blue circle insignia, or with grisly “Germs Burns,” which were administered by searing the inner wrist with a lit cigarette from tip to filter. Once healed, a tidy, circular scar formed. “I completely control a number of people’s lives,” Crash once said. “Look around for the little girls wearing CRASH-TRASH T-shirts.” By late ’77, Germs were headlining Brendan Mullen’s notorious nightclub the Masque; punks queued out the door to watch Crash smash beer bottles and bleed on stage. Despite early lineup shuffles—their original drummer was future Go-Go Belinda Carlisle, who came down with mono and enlisted a friend to replace her before the band’s first gig—Germs’ circle wasn’t complete until percussionist Don Bolles joined Crash, guitarist Smear, and bassist Lorna Doom. Similarly, the boy born Jan Paul Beahm did not seal his fate until he rechristened himself Darby Crash. “Whereas Bobby Pyn seemed to me a much more innocent, goofy, carefree character,” Brendan Mullen wrote, “Darby Crash became much more demonic, complex, intense, intoxicated, as he gradually began to exude a much darker persona.” Prior to (GI) (short for “Germs Incognito”), the group had released only a couple of singles. Pronounced the “world’s most volatile band” by writer Kickboy Face, and the “worst band ever” by themselves, it seemed unlikely that any label would sign them. But Slash Records founder Bob Biggs was up to the task. He presented a contract, enlisted Joan Jett to produce, and fronted the cash for Quad Tech studios. Biggs later described his role in (GI) as more “glorified babysitter” than label maven. Something about their impending debut rearranged Germs’ molecular structure. Despite their prior shenanigans, Crash, Smear, Doom, and Bolles got their asses in gear. “My fondest memories of the Germs are right after the beginning and up to recording (GI)... which was a thrilling experience for me,” Doom said. The band rehearsed more than ever, putting in four hours a day, multiple times a week. Their work ethic in the studio was undisputed, although the same cannot be said for Jett, who was frequently passed out, according to many accounts (Crash even makes a crack about it in closing track “Shut Down”). Jett wasn’t the group’s first choice of producer—Crash had his heart set on Mark Lindsay of Paul Revere and the Raiders, but he was too expensive. Jett, who insists she only slept on the job one time, was chosen for her talent, proximity, and friendship with the band. Asleep or not, she managed to channel their focus. “Darby took it pretty seriously,” she said. “We didn’t have to do a lot of takes. He was certainly not out of control in the studio. He respected me. Did what I asked him to do… It was controlled nuttiness at that point.” (GI) was yet another page in Germs’ tome of contradictions. Suddenly, the peanut butter-smeared, tantrum-prone little freaks had (nearly) sobered up and delivered one of the most influential records in punk history. Darby Crash’s progression from blathering imbecile to secret rock’n’roll poet shocked everyone. X’s John Doe was particularly surprised by Crash’s vernacular: “You didn’t know the words because it was all like ‘Warrrrrrrrwarrrwarr,’ when Darby’d sing them live,” he said. “So everyone was just astounded when they got that first Slash record and actually read the lyrics. They were great!” (GI) is often considered the first-ever hardcore album. Bolles’ drumming style was fast and savage, doubling the BPMs of anything the Sex Pistols or Television had released. Meanwhile, Crash’s vocals were far removed from X’s harmonies and Joey Ramone’s chewed-up bubblegum. Crash didn’t sing: he growled. On (GI) centerpiece “Manimal,” he assumes the pelt of a rabid feline: “I came into this world like a puzzled panther/Waiting to be caged… I was never quite tamed,” he snarls. “Manimal” contains some of Crash’s most succinct and effective writing. It has none of the stilted, two-dollar words that sometimes appeared in Germs’ catalog (even Smear admitted that Crash’s lyrics could be “a bit pretentious”), and the song marries thematic and sonic elements better than most of their tracks. It is also one of many cuts on (GI) to hint at Crash’s impending death. “Evolution is a process/Too slow to save my soul,” he sneers, before letting out a pained roar like a wildcat being dragged off by poachers. Like many bands, Germs’ ingenuity grew from limitations. When they formed, no one could really play an instrument, save for Smear, who dabbled in guitar throughout high school. As they performed and rehearsed, they realized they could play better and faster. Bolles perfected his machine-gun drumming, Doom fine-tuned her trademark “wall-of-whump” basslines, and Smear developed a guitar style that was shrill, gritty, and metallic—it often sounded like he was scraping his strings with a cheese grater. Their playing on (GI) is a balancing act of personality and restraint, leaving space for Crash to run the show. Crash was a born prophet, a “premeditated would-be apocalyptic cult leader,” as friend and producer Geza X put it in another oral history, We Got the Neutron Bomb. Darby’s followers were already chauffeuring him around L.A. and footing his endless bar tab long before (GI) arrived. “When you have people for friends and they’re not the kind of people you want, what do you do?” he once asked an interviewer. “You make some better ones.” On (GI), Crash’s frightening magnetism was spelled out in song, and “We Must Bleed” is the most stirring distillation of his power. Crash repeats the titular line with such conviction, he sounds like a deranged preacher distributing the poisoned applesauce to his disciples. Crash was intrigued by the charisma of cult leaders and dictators, from Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard to Charles Manson, Hitler, and Mussolini. “Richie Dagger’s Crime” portrayed a more benevolent side of Darby’s coercive nature. The song’s narrator is a holdover from Crash’s glam roots—a swaggering “boy that nobody owns.” Dagger was a dead ringer for Crash, who grew from “a child despised” into a teenage messiah. When he sings, “I can take on your heroes” it’s both a threat and a premonition—and the closest Germs ever came to pop music. “Lexicon Devil,” perhaps (GI)’s most iconic entry, repurposes Crash’s favorite manipulation device, suffered by everyone he knew: “Gimme, gimme this, gimme, gimme thaaaaaaat.” The song was an admission of Crash’s thirst for supremacy, confirming that nothing he did was by accident. If any of (GI)’s songs were out of step with Germs’ repertoire, it was “Shut Down,” a nine-minute, narcotized jam session. Smear, Doom, and Bolles made minor detours from one circular riff, while Crash improvised lyrics that volleyed between playful and disturbing. One minute, he mocked Belinda Carlisle for being a cheerleader. Measures later, he nodded to the needle: “When I put that in my arm, I know that it done no harm.” (GI) came out at a time when Led Zeppelin, Supertramp, and the Eagles were topping the Billboard 200. It didn’t get anywhere near the charts, but local critics took note. In his Los Angeles Times column, Richard Meltzer crowned (GI) album of the year, calling it “the most remarkable L.A. studio achievement at least since L.A. Woman.” At last, there was documentation that Germs were a legitimate band who could write and cut a record, and a great record at that. It was their best work—the gold standard they never got the chance to improve upon. In the following year, Darby Crash rapidly eroded due to substance abuse. Filmmaker Penelope Spheeris’ punk documentary The Decline of Western Civilization captured his incoherence, making previous claims of his “genius” seem ridiculous. As Crash’s drug use escalated in his final months, so did his sense of alienation. Germs broke up, Crash made a failed attempt at going solo, and he became increasingly distraught over his closeted sexuality—many of Crash’s friends didn’t learn he was gay until after he died. On December 3, Germs played a reunion show. Everyone agreed it was the band’s best performance ever. Don Bolles was so happy playing the concert, he was convinced Germs would regroup for good. But Crash had other plans. “The only reason I’m doing this is to get money to get enough heroin to kill myself with,” he told Smear before the gig. Crash had threatened suicide so many times that few people took him seriously. Four nights later, Crash and friend Casey Cola procured $400 worth of heroin, drove to Cola’s mother’s house, and shot up. Somehow, Cola survived. When she came to the next day, Crash was lying dead next to her. In a cruel twist of fate, Darby Crash died a day before John Lennon, and the news of his passing was largely overshadowed by the Beatle’s murder. It took years for Crash to be widely recognized as a gifted writer, but his work took on a new life after his ended. Germs had an immediate impact on their L.A. peers, but their contributions were particularly felt in the following decades, when artists like Hole, L7, Melvins, Henry Rollins, Meat Puppets, and Red Hot Chili Peppers cited the band as a major influence. After a string of odd jobs and musical exploits, Smear joined Nirvana as a second guitarist in 1993. As a touring member for their In Utero trek, Smear played on the band’s famed MTV Unplugged session in 1994. Following Kurt Cobain’s death, Smear became a founding member of Foo Fighters. He still plays with them today. Bolles continues to perform with a handful of bands, and works as a radio DJ. Doom, who passed away earlier this year, retreated from the music scene after Crash died, remerging briefly in the early 2000s to play a few reunion gigs with Smear, Bolles, and actor Shane West filling in on vocals. West starred as Crash in the 2007 Germs biopic What We Do Is Secret, a heap of schmaltz that is hard to watch, but confirms the ill-fated frontman’s eternal allure. Darby Crash knew that Germs’ music was the first step in establishing his legacy. “Records are only a medium to get something else done,” he once said. “I want to die when I’m done.” (GI) serves as the final testament from one of punk’s most divisive figures—a man who was sadistic and kind, brilliant and obtuse, and destined to eclipse his inner circle.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

Tremble Under Boom Lights,Jonathan Fire*Eater,by: Paul Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da7882761708900098e3e96/1:1/w_160/jonathanfireeater.jpg,2019-10-26 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jonathan-fireeater-tremble-under-boom-lights/,Third Man,"Jonathan Fire*Eater’s Walter Martin once interrupted a meeting with Dreamworks label brass to see about capping sales of Wolf Songs for Lambs, their major label debut, at an even half-million, lest the band grew too big, too quickly. Ambitious, but perhaps a bit premature; Wolf Songs wound up selling about 10,000 copies in the early going, a few zeros shy of the Appetite for Destruction numbers Martin was gunning for. Chutzpah isn’t everything, but it’s certainly not nothing, and what DC-to-NYC before-their-timers Jonathan Fire*Eater lacked in bankable success, they more than made up with unshakable faith in their own abilities. Through their brief, tumultuous tenure, the elegantly wasted JFE looked, acted, and frequently even sounded like heirs apparent to the big crown. They never really came close. Yet, while traditional markers of fame and fortune may’ve eluded them, Jonathan Fire*Eater’s influence on a generation of stall-hogging, scene-making New York rockers—some of whom did go on to the kind world-conquering fame JFE only grasped at—is incalculable. Flip through the first few chapters of Lizzy Goodman’s NYC scene tell-all Meet Me in the Bathroom, and you’ll see one bold-face name after another singing JFE’s praises, if not openly copping to stealing their moves. Jonathan*Fire Eater were it; and then, just as suddenly, they weren’t. For years now, Jonathan Fire*Eater have been a band more talked about than actually listened to. That’s largely been a problem of access: For nearly 20 years, just about the only record available through the usual channels was the spiny Wolf Songs for Lambs, which served as many curious Karen O fans’ first and only taste of JFE. And Wolf Songs is a stellar record, all subterranean scrum atop squealing organs and clattering drums. Now, Third Man has brought Tremble Under Boom Lights—the band’s 1996 mini-LP, released a year before Wolf Songs—back to shelves, alongside five bonus cuts and a chapbook of Stewart Lupton’s poetry. It’s not quite Marvin Berry holding the receiver up to Marty McFly, but two decades on, Tremble Under Boom Lights does manage to sound like a hiccup in the timeline: The brash young JFE didn’t just arrive in NYC fully formed, they showed up to the party five years early. The short version of Jonathan Fire*Eater’s turgid tale goes something like this: DC boys, prep schoolers all, forge a proto-JFE called the Ignobles. The Ignobles eventually relocate to NYC, recruit bassist Tom Frank, put Stewart Lupton behind the mic, and acquire the asterisk. From there, they hustled: Meet Me in the Bathroom finds Lupton glad-handing at every gallery opening and 4 a.m. bar he could find, shamelessly trying to get the word out. Even early on, JFE had something: They were preppy with an unlikely goth edge, “talky” without digressing into polemic, wide-ranging in their musical interests but still very much rooted in oily, scuzzy rock’n’roll. Once they’d worked through the collective throat-clearing of their self-titled debut, their sound was fully in place: big blasts of Walter Martin’s dusty organ, Matt Barrick’s galvanic drumwork, Frank’s subcutaneous bass, Paul Maroon’s alternately stately and spooky guitar, and the scrawled-past-the-margins picaresques of the late Stewart Lupton. Lupton was possessed with the kind of preternatural confidence granted to only the heavily deluded and the genuinely dazzling, and after three seconds with Tremble Under Boom Lights, it’s pretty clear he wasn’t kidding himself. He’s a man of 1,000 voices, able to jut nimbly through a dry Iggy Pop drawl, a squawking Timmy Taylor falsetto, and the Jarvis-worthy swoon that closes out “Winston Plum: Undertaker.” Mostly, though, he’s a scene-stealer, a scenery chewer: whether prattling on about yet another estranged relative or passing out in the hotel hallway after too much free record company hooch, Lupton’s never less than compelling, stuffing scene after roundabout scene with past regrets and unsteady futures. Rollicking highlight “Give Me Daughters” imagines Lupton, years down the road, ringing up his theoretical offspring from some dingy motel. The song is more or less a tacit admission that Lupton’s not about to settle down anytime soon, and like many of his songs, it finds him sliding further and further into a kind of perpetual transience: always on the go, always looking for a new rush, always wondering what his life might’ve been had he hewed a little closer to the straight and narrow. Lupton’s prone to abstraction and red herrings, stocking the pond with characters whose purpose remains somewhat unclear. This Dylanesque combination of cracked imagery cut with bohemian drift is the jewel in Lupton’s crown, the dividing line between JFE and so many other citified mopesters, past and present. “It’s important that you know how I want all the shadows on my street to converge every time it snows and have the conversation that they really need,” he sings on the gnashing “Make It Precious,” the kind of line—and there are plenty like it here—you could spend a lifetime turning over in your head. The tension between the wild-eyed, increasingly unpredictable Lupton and his more temperate bandmates was JFE’s ultimate undoing, but Tremble finds the two sides sparking each other to new heights. Tom Frank—along with Lupton, JFE’s only non-Walkman—brings an almost visceral heft to the low end with his near-toneless bass. Matt Barrick’s drumwork is, as with the Walkmen, the electricity in the socket: without him, the whole thing never gets off the ground. On the organ, Walter Martin favors a piercing, otherworldly sound that’s more “96 Tears” than the grandiose Rothko techtonics he favored later. They wield this rangy, malleable sound—an ever-shifting mishmash of moddish classic rock and post-punk, speckled with Motown and new romance—with all the foolish audacity of youth. These guys just went for it, and 20 years past its sell-by date, their cocktail of inexperience and gall hasn’t lost a drop of potency. The five songs from the initial Tremble release are joined here by five additional tunes: three from 1995’s Public Hanging of a Movie Star EP, a pants-free cover of Lee Hazlewood’s “The City Never Sleeps,” and the previously unheard “In the Head.” The spry, mercurial Tremble songs, available for the first time this century, are the real draw here, but the Public Hanging songs—JFE’s first release after their forgettable debut—are where the band sorted out the sonics, pushed the vocals to the front, and came into their own. “In the Head” is thought to be their final recording, finished not long before their 1998 split; it’s tempting to hear the first murmurs of the Walkmen in its “In the New Year” ripple, but the tune belongs, as they all do, to Lupton: Adopting a decidedly Dylanesque wheeze, he inches the ambling track heavenward. By the end, organs are churning, Lupton’s howling, and the whole thing seems to collapse in on itself. Lupton seems right at home. Influence is a strange currency: It seems valuable enough, but the exchange rate’s lousy. Jonathan Fire*Eater were, for a moment, the hottest band in New York, which was just enough to earn them a massively lopsided deal with Dreamworks and the occasional Paul Banks namecheck. Their stormy, searching sound still looms large over the glammy inversions of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, the brackish urgency of Interpol, and so many others, but for too long, that’s how most people encountered their music: indirectly. Once JFE split, Lupton disappeared for a couple years, reemerging as the Childballads and, later, the Beatin’s; Martin, Barrick, and Maroon’s Walkmen called it quits in late 2013, and Frank took a gig with Vanity Fair. Lupton passed away in 2018, a tragically early end. There’ll always be a lot of “what if?” hanging over JFE, particularly now, with no chance of a full reunion. But for all their accidents of fate, Jonathan*Fire Eater accomplished something most bands can only dream of: not many may remember, but those who do won’t soon forget.

Surviving,Jimmy Eat World,by: Thora Siemsen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db0bf30515e4800080955f7/1:1/w_160/jimmyeatworld.jpg,2019-10-26 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jimmy-eat-world-surviving/,RCA,"Surviving is apt. Formed in 1993, and featuring the same core members since ’95, Jimmy Eat World has enjoyed a course marked by steady output, frequent touring and quiet durability. As luck would have it, they’ve hung on long enough to find themselves releasing their 10th studio album just as emo nostalgia reaches its zenith. Surviving is both occasion for a survey of the beloved Arizona band’s two-decade-plus career and a further push into arena rock; a driving, if not always transportative, selection that should tour favorably. Their latest reunites them with Justin Meldal-Johnsen, the producer for M83 and decades-long live bassist for Beck who worked on their triumphant last album, 2016’s Integrity Blues. On Surviving, the producer guides the band’s instincts towards a heavier sound, letting noise from their guitars and Zach Lind’s drums decay. Meldal-Johnsen addresses lacunae in frontman Jim Adkins’ operative knowledge of synth sounds, as on the U2-evocative “555,” an album outlier which features some Fitz and the Tantrums-like hand-clapping. James King, co-founding member of Fitz, shows up for a saxophone solo on “All The Way (Stay),” just like he did on the Meldal-Johnsen-produced M83 sparkler “Midnight City.” Longtime collaborator and former touring member Rachel Haden, of that dog., contributes backing vocals. The track, which considers staying away from the party rather than at it (“Who really says they hope they’ll meet ‘the one’ for the first time at a bar drinking early?”) is one of the more personal allusions to recovery from addiction that Adkins, sober for six years, ventures here. Lyrically, Surviving is as sincere as their past efforts but less specific. “You’re not alone in pain/Never alone in pain,” Adkins sings on the album’s title track. The band’s shortest LP to date, Surviving moves at a quick clip, losing some of the polish from their last outing with Meldal-Johnsen. They’re conscious when they sound too slick for their own good: The opening acoustic guitar riff on “One Mil” was recorded on Adkins’ iPhone mic in his garage. AFI frontman Davey Havok, who appears on the album finale “Congratulations,” also appears via iPhone. “There’s no clarity in front of me,” Adkins sings on that song, which serves as a sort of curtain call. At six minutes, it somehow still feels a little short. It’s hard to imagine this iteration of J.E.W. recording another “Goodbye Sky Harbor,” that loitering Clarity closer that would take up nearly half of their latest album’s length. By Surviving’s terminus, listeners might find themselves wanting more risks. But the album on the whole is a solid, self-aware addition to Jimmy Eat World’s catalog, and if the band’s modest strivers’ outlook has proved anything, it’s that there will be another. A band whose biggest song is against writing oneself off always has work to do.

Trinity,Eartheater,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5db4884a0586fb00080dae44/1:1/w_160/Eartheater-Trinity-3000.JPG,2019-10-26 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/eartheater-trinity/,Chemical X,"Alexandra Drewchin titled the fourth full-length release under her Eartheater alias as a nod to the three states matter can commonly take: solid, liquid, and gas. It’s a fitting conceit to drape over her work, which tends to melt from concrete pop forms into ominous miasma and back again. Trinity, a mixtape made in collaboration with half a dozen New York producers including AceMo and Tony Seltzer, crystallizes Drewchin’s experimental slant into a full set of dance music built around her signature oblique vocals. Without sacrificing Eartheater’s compelling strangeness, Drewchin has assembled the project’s most accessible and triumphant offering to date. Dance beats skittered here and there on past Eartheater records, but more often than not they worked as texturing tools against the rest of Drewchin’s nebulous compositions. On “Curtains,” from 2018’s IRISIRI, a rave beat pulsed against sheets of placid harp, as though leaking into an orchestral musician’s practice session from an upstairs apartment. Trinity hews closer to the traditional dynamics of dance music: Its songs take beats for their backbones, even if those beats often lurch uneasily through dizzying arrangements. For every element on Trinity that’s easy to grasp, another repels and confuses the ear. On “High Tide” and “Supersoaker,” glassy synthesizer riffs echo late-’90s radio trance, while the blunt bass drums on “Pearl Diver” recall avant-garde strains of contemporary hip-hop. Throughout the record, Drewchin’s voice closes off the easy access points of dance pop, which in its most mainstream incarnations tends to flood listeners with dopamine at every chorus. Layered and thinned with reverb, her singing remains slippery, her lyrics often tricky to pin down. Ostensibly these are love songs, and yet their streaks of affection drip out in confusing, contradictory ways, in double negatives and barely intelligible whispers. “I don’t wanna regret/Something I didn’t do/With you,” Drewchin sings on “Runoff”—a statement that starts out with what sounds like hesitation, which turns into abandon by the end of the sentence. Because her presence is often elusive, it tends to beckon the ear to sink deeper into each song, to grasp at a salient phrase or an especially tuneful melody. Drewchin makes it easy to get lost in her ambiguous sound worlds, which don’t seem to have clear boundaries but always appear to be deepening in volume. Trinity’s tensions build toward its final song and thesis statement, “Solid Liquid Gas.” Rather than end the record on an uncertain, sour note, Drewchin and producer Hara Kiri give it the sendoff it deserves—an unleashed, cathartic dance track where Drewchin’s voice clears away the mist that had clung to it. “Don’t make me wait!” she demands, her voice dense and sharp over a frothing synthesizer arpeggio. If latent desire percolates throughout Trinity, voiced in hushed tones, then “Solid Liquid Gas” gives Drewchin the chance to finally let her wanting rush out of her. It’s a blissful release that bursts past the cerebral parameters of her prior work and into new territory—the kind of song that jolts through the whole body, thrilling as it goes.","A mixtape made with half a dozen New York producers tilts the experimental producer’s left-field tendencies toward full-on dance music, but her signature oblique vocals remain a slippery presence.

Pony,Rex Orange County,by: Anna Gaca,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5daf7411515e4800080955b2/1:1/w_160/pony.jpg,2019-10-25 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rex-orange-county-pony/,Sony,"Alex O’Connor self-released bcos u will never b free, his first modest bedroom project as Rex Orange County, in 2015. It’s not hard to hear the appeal of that first tape: The songs were imperfect and angsty, with an amateur production style that fit Rex’s creaky nasal voice. “Pizza box/Wedding ring left amongst the crust,” he drawled, sketching a banal, absurd image of a crumbling relationship. “Don’t miss me when I’m dead,” he pleaded, and then followed up with an earnest rap verse about rejecting peer pressure. His sound also appealed to Tyler, the Creator, who recruited the English singer and songwriter for his 2017 album Flower Boy. It became Rex’s breakout moment. After meeting Tyler, he rushed out another album, Apricot Princess, so that people who learned about him from Flower Boy would have something to listen to. This week, he released Pony, his first album for Sony and the third entry in Rex’s slim, sentimental catalog. Rex’s distinctive voice has earned him the epithet “old soul,” but his newest music is relentlessly juvenile. When he landed a Spotify deal that offered the opportunity to work with an established artist on a cover song, he picked Randy Newman and “You’ve Got a Friend in Me.” On Pony, a collection of 10 new songs irritating enough to activate the mildest allergy to sincerity, he sings about being young and in love; about getting a little older but not yet old enough; about feeling like a comic-book superhero and getting “Stressed Out.” “When we have to speak I usually shoe gaze,” he admits on “Laser Lights,” with a delivery style equally indebted to Chance the Rapper’s singing and Ed Sheeran’s rapping. Pony employs a more childlike musical palette than Rex’s earlier projects—bubbly synths, electric piano, programmed beats, bells, strings, and bird chirps—and though there’s still a waxy haze surrounding them, the intensity is dialed up. There’s always something jumping out of the mix to compete for attention—sometimes a pop of cartoonish horns, but more often Rex’s quavery voice, a limiting factor Pony tries every possible way to work around: chipmunk squeaks (“Stressed Out”), Vocoder (“Never Had the Balls”), digital barbershop quartet (“Face to Face”), distant-sounding piped-in vocals set to strings (“Pluto Projector”) or a disco beat (“It Gets Better”). The lyrics to “Never Had the Balls” feel extra crude because the setting is so immature; the treacly piano love song “Every Way” would be more believable from Mr. Rogers. None of this straining supports an interesting idea. “Four years later/Look where we really are/Look how far we’ve come,” Rex sings on “It Gets Better,” over tinny, melodramatic electric strings. He’s not talking about graduating, or growing up in general—he’s talking about a girl who’s transformed his world in ways apparently not worth itemizing. You won’t find a wedding ring in a pizza box here. The album’s most salient detail is when Rex recalls a particular house where he once vomited. Pony’s best line comes at the opening of “Pluto Projector,” a slow, Frank Ocean-esque ballad. “The great protector/Is that what I’m supposed to be?” Rex asks. “What if all this counts for nothin’/Everything I thought I’d be?/What if by the time I realize/It’s too far behind to see?” Toward the end, the song takes a weird turn: a pitched-down vocal coda that makes Rex sound like he’s drop-shipping counterfeit “Nikes.” But Rex Orange County isn’t Frank Ocean; he stacks vast emotional weight on predictable, inoffensive songs until they buckle like wire shelving. Pony is simplistic, clueless, subtlety-free. “Didn’t understand until the age of 18/Even then I was blind,” he sings on “It Gets Better.” Over and over again, Rex sounds like he hasn’t begun to realize how much he doesn’t know.","The 21-year-old songwriter’s latest album is irritating enough to activate the mildest allergy to sincerity.

The Decalogue,Sufjan StevensTimo Andres,by: Noah Yoo,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dae28335ce1ca0008c55f9f/1:1/w_160/decalogue.jpg,2019-10-25 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sufjan-stevens-timo-andres-the-decalogue/,Asthmatic Kitty,"It’s hard to believe, but over the last 10 years, Sufjan Stevens has soundtracked twice as many ballets as he’s recorded solo albums. He and choreographer Justin Peck began working together in 2012, when the rising dance star asked Stevens to rework selections from his experimental electronic album Enjoy Your Rabbit for the New York City Ballet. Stevens balked at first, but after George Balanchine’s Stravinsky-scored classics (namely Agon) opened his ears to the expressive possibilities of the form, the singer-songwriter relented, which led to the blossoming of a meaningful creative relationship with Peck. Stevens’ initial hesitation around entering the world of ballet stemmed not only from his qualms with Enjoy Your Rabbit—he downplayed it as “a ramshackle little personal hobby project”—but also his perceptions of ballet itself. “Ballet seemed so anachronistic, so formal and classical and archaic and irrelevant to pop culture,” he said in 2014. Everywhere We Go, the first collaboration with Peck to feature all new, original music, was defined by its intricate arrangements and emphasis on melody, a pointed repudiation of that perceived stuffiness. By contrast, The Decalogue—a borderline academic suite for solo piano, inspired by the Ten Commandments—suggests a self-conscious attempt to compose according to a notion of what contemporary ballet music should sound like. The result is a knotty but welcome entry to Stevens’ discography, albeit one that feels like the result of the artist immersing himself in Peck’s influences rather than the other way round. This new studio recording of The Decalogue, which arrives two years after the debut of Peck’s ballet, does not actually feature Stevens in a performing role. The composer instead opts to have the pianist and contemporary classical composer Timo Andres interpret the score. In Andres’ skilled hands, the pieces move and breathe dynamically, and it’s easy to imagine a cadre of dancers performing pirouettes to the constantly modulating chords. Still, as a standalone piece of music, Decalogue may come across as unusually atonal for any Sufjan fans expecting familiar motifs from their favorite baroque pop polymath, who culled from approximately 50 “impromptu improvisations” to assemble the score. With some exceptions, Decalogue’s piano passages wash over the listener and disappear almost as soon as they materialize. That isn’t to say there are no affecting scenes: The ascendant arpeggios at the beginning of “V” provide an immediately arresting structure for the rest of the piece to flow into. Andres’ execution of the skittering downward runs at the end of “VIII” prove a breathtaking display of musicianship, and the thunderous grand finale in “X” is stirring, if a bit rote. But the album never reveals any whole greater than the sum of its parts, and those parts suffer from a lack of focus. Stevens has said he wanted The Decalogue to be “more pensive and more cerebral, and less explicitly harmonic and melodic” than Everywhere We Go, and he certainly achieves his goal. He’s since moved on from such exercises, describing his most recent work with Peck, Principia, as a middle ground between those prior scores. That new ballet just so happens to feature orchestrations by Andres, a link that implies the pianist isn’t merely a gifted hired gun. Their collaborations may bear more fruit in the years to come, but ultimately The Decalogue is a Stevens curio like Enjoy Your Rabbit and The BQE before it: riveting to diehards, an agreeable footnote for anyone else. -- (Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)","This score for Justin Peck’s 2017 ballet, performed by the pianist Timo Andres, is a knotty but welcome addition to the singer-songwriter’s growing set of compositions for dance.

Nicole Kidman / Anne Hathaway,Hana Vu,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d6591d4ff91290008241548/1:1/w_160/hanavu_nicolekidman.jpg,2019-10-25 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hana-vu-nicole-kidman-anne-hathaway/,Luminelle,"Hana Vu wrote the songs for her dual EP, Nicole Kidman/Anne Hathaway by watching episodes of The Hollywood Reporter’s “The Actress Roundtable” and then conjuring backstories for the women on screen. For Vu, the project’s premise is an entry point for her to do what she does best: crystalize a wisp of an emotion, until the sentiment feels so tactile it could break. Vu’s first EP, the perfectly titled Crying on the Subway, was rooted in bedroom pop, but these EPs explore other genres. She layers and reverbs her vocals on  “Worm” until they sound like a hymn, while “Order” descends into full-on, guitar-thrashing rock. Each track feels like a contained performance, and the lyrics consider the nuanced ways in which acting is tucked into our everyday lives. These aren’t necessarily love songs, and it’s hard to map a narrative onto any track in particular. She wishes someone would cry about her. She croons about “disguises.” “Outside,” which could be a Paramore or Lorde track, comes the closest to feeling personal: “If I look at my phone all day, does it really help my chances?” she asks, waiting for a text that never comes. Vu produced the record herself, and the muted, minimalist fizz matches the distant monotone of her voice. Each track builds around a wrenching line that dissolves into the soundscape. “I’ll never be good enough,” ends the first song, “At the Party,” as a synth sputters and fades. “I wanna be a hero/I want to save you, I wanna save me,” she sings on “Fighter,” with all traces of actual desire drained from her voice. No track on the compact, 10-song project feels unnecessary, but most blend into each other without sounding distinct. (The glaring exception is her cover of “Reflection,” from the Disney movie Mulan, which is thematically relevant but still seems out of place.) That’s not the worst quality in an album that is equally sparse and lush, simple and shimmering, but it shows a space Vu can grow into.","The 19-year-old singer-songwriter’s dual EP branches out from bedroom pop in a set of songs that consider the nuanced ways acting is tucked into our everyday lives.

Hometown: Detroit Sessions 1990​-​2014,Tribe,by: Piotr Orlov,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da0a9d9240253000865df2f/1:1/w_160/hometown.jpg,2019-10-25 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tribe-hometown-detroit-sessions-1990-2014/,Strut,"Almost from its birth, Tribe was much more than simply a jazz group. It was a living example of the ways that community and cultural capital could evolve together during the American century’s final third, in a city that helped define the era’s musical and civic spirit: Detroit, Michigan. Tribe began as a collective around four musicians—reed player Wendell Harrison, trombonist Phil Ranellin, trumpeter Marcus Belgrave, and pianist Harold McKinney—who embodied the late 1960s’ spirit of black self-determination. It ended up a local institution, tutoring program, and one of the unmistakable through lines in the city’s musical history. The contributions of Tribe members stretch directly from Ray Charles and Motown to Geri Allen and Detroit techno. If Hometown: Detroit Sessions 1990-2014, a wonderful compilation of mostly unreleased recordings from the latter chapters of Tribe’s history, doesn’t quite scale early-career musical heights, it makes clear that judging lifelong endeavors through a narrow lens of a single period of time—even one that contemporary perspective deems “classic”—is a fool’s errand. There is no denying the value of Tribe’s revolutionary early sounds. Recorded mostly under the names of individual players and only occasionally as a group, their fluid mixture of soulful post-bop swing, free avant-garde playing, hard in-the-pocket jazz-funk, and almighty music of the spirit continues to spill gracefully off comps like Soul Jazz’s Message From the Tribe: An Anthology of Tribe Records 1972-76 or P-Vine’s Vibes From the Tribe Vol. I and Vol. II; it’s likely to appeal to any admirer of improvisational rapture or a fat-ass groove. But the myriad activities around these recordings, the ones that helped build and sustain both Detroit’s mythical creative streak and its literal artistic community, expose Tribe’s deeper virtues. This is where neighborhood capital, and Tribe’s contribution to it, come into play. The self-sustaining ethos of Tribe Records, Harrison’s Wenha Records, and Harrison and McKiney’s Rebirth Records helped carry on Motown’s ideal of homegrown, artist-run labels, one that continues in the city’s dance music to this day. Tribe magazine—published from 1972 until 1977 and edited by journalist Herb Boyd, author of Hometown’s liner notes and the great 2017 book Black Detroit: A People's History of Self-Determination—was deeply involved in local politics, galvanizing votes for  the city’s first black mayor, Coleman Young. (According to Mark Stryker’s fine new book Jazz From Detroit, the publication was also successful enough to fund Tribe Records.) And both Marcus Belgrave’s Jazz Development Workshop and Harrison and McKinney’s educational and event-production organization Rebirth Inc. were responsible for fine-tuning an endless list of Detroit’s musical talent. That’s one reason Hometown is stocked with performers you may recognize from classic John Coltrane albums (bassist Reggie Workman) or Theo Parrish 12""s (trumpeter John Douglas), along with lesser-known giants (trumpeter Jimmy Owens, trombonist Kiani Zawadi). Despite consisting of three separate sessions recorded over 24 years, and featuring two dozen players, the collection feels like a unified work. Eschewing the outer territories Tribe members once wandered, Hometown conveys a more comforting musical tradition (though with plenty of details that trail outward like breadcrumbs, for those paying attention). Its sound is, to quote the title of the McKinney piece that opens the set, “Wide and Blue.” Recorded live in 1995, at the SereNgeti Ballroom, a great turn-of-the-century Detroit jazz space, the song cuts a relaxed and confident stride: McKinney and Workman’s extended conversation and Harrison’s compact tenor solo are bookended by a theme stated on four horns—Harrison, Belgrave, Owens, and Zawadi. It’s a harmonic statement that wouldn’t seem out of place in the classic Blue Note songbook—that is, until the diminuendo, when horns unlock into a frenzied blowing burst that’s part Frenchmen Street, part Saturn. Hometown collects many such knowing touches as it showcases the depth of an oft-ignored creative community and its cultural staying power. The experience and mastry is there for all to hear, whether in the lesser-known compositions (each of the 10 songs is an original that features its author) or in exceptional playing, which is beguilingly concise. The songs are alone worth the price. Ranelin’s “Freddie’s Groove” is a dance number honoring Freddie Hubbard, precisely capturing the legendary trumpeter’s funky Red Clay/Straight Life period (cue: Ralphe Armstrong’s uncut bassline, Harrison quoting cartoon themes like Sonny Rollins, and guitarist John Arnold in rocked-up George Benson mode). The Pamela Wise composition that gives the compilation its name beautifully mixes the propulsion of a squad of percussionists with the intertwined melancholy of Douglas’ trumpet and Harrison’s tenor, supported by Wise’s modal keys. Zawadi’s “Libra Ahora,” the set’s single moment of stretching out, brings the clave and the drummers (including a star turn by percussionist Frencesco Mora), plus an extended interplay between the four horns. And then there’s McKinney’s “Juba,” which opens with the pianist’s wife and twin daughters in a rendition of an antebellum handclap-and-voice holler, followed by a horn party that McKinney amends by banging out wonderfully dissonant clusters. Such social history has always been central to Tribe’s musical expression, and Hometown features a trio of direct lyrical engagements with the past that also speak to the present. Wise’s “Ode to Black Mothers” and “Marcus Garvey,” featuring words by poet/pastor Mbiyu Chui, are familiar ceremonial acclamations in which a lone teacher rises on a bed of drums to bear a valuable lesson. But McKinney’s closing “Slave Ship Enterprise” is something else entirely: a two-decades-old, solo piano-and-voice reading whose prescience would be remarkable if you didn’t know that black America has been preaching its message for a century. It is an inversion of the chords of “America the Beautiful,” rewritten as an operatically delivered tone poem, with McKinney unfurling a broad “comment on the American phenomenon”—at times ambient, at others direct. “Seems so near and dear, yet so far/Near as our ideals, yet far from the way we are,” reads his indictment of the “land of the free,” a ship “of state… where captain and captive must share a common fate.” The fact that “Slave Ship Enterprise” ends on an almost undeserved image of hope—“U.S. spells ‘us’”—says a lot about where the faith of both Tribe and McKinney, who passed away in 2001, lay. (Belgrave died in 2015.) Like much of the collective’s work, musical and otherwise, it was rooted in the strength of the community and its culture. There was (and remains) an inherent understanding that the vitality of any hometown is expressed not only in how brightly its light shines, but in how long the people keep it on.","A document of the Detroit jazz collective’s later years captures a cast of dozens balancing local community with cultural staying power.

Woptober II,Gucci Mane,by: Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dae1e775b0efb00083e23a2/1:1/w_160/woptober2.jpeg,2019-10-24 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gucci-mane-woptober-ii/,Atlantic,"Since re-emerging transformed from prison as a chiseled, healthy-living Adonis, Gucci Mane’s major projects have included an extra layer of gloss and a few unlikely commercial compromises. In the last year he’s teamed up with Bruno Mars and Justin Bieber on songs that boxed Gucci into a pillow-soft style that predictably didn’t showcase his strengths. It’s easy to envision the conference call with label executives that led to these cuts: “You present like a star now, Gucci. It’s time to get out in front with those radio singles.” But these cuddly aberrations aside, Gucci has largely stayed loyal to his established sound. Woptober II is no more a natural sequel to the original 2016 mixtape than any other Gucci project; the title probably just means it happened to drop this month. Like most of his recent records, it’s another collection of mostly very good Gucci Mane songs, marred by occasional awkward bits. Though still relentlessly paced (this is his second album of the year, following Delusions of Grandeur), Gucci’s output has come a long way from the low-quality data dumps he delivered while he was away, presumably just to keep new music flowing. His trademark swollen southern drawl has been remodeled as something more precise. On “Time to Move,” he moves effortlessly from a menacing whisper to a spiky flow as he recalls tales of waking up in new Bugatti and lies told on the witness stand. Woptober II’s best moments are when Gucci has company. On “Bucking the System,” his voice is slow and hypnotic before Kevin Gates blows through the track, the yin-and-yang flows accentuating the duo’s chemistry. And on “Richer Than Errybody,” Gucci teams up with rising players YoungBoy Never Broke Again and DaBaby, sounding just as fit and uncompromising as his youthful collaborators. There are silly moments. “Big Booty,” featuring Megan Thee Stallion, summons the spirit of 2 Live Crew. It’s a track that would have fallen flat even five years ago, when Nicki Minaj and Jennifer Lopez were causing a mini-revival in these kind of Miami bass-inspired ass anthems. And sleazy raps aside, it’s fair to say that Gucci regularly underperforms lyrically on Woptober II. The low point comes on “Tootsies,” when he tosses off a poorly considered jab at Kanye West’s mental health issues. As for the beats, Gucci’s go-to team of star producers (London on da Track, Zaytoven, Southside, Da Honorable C.N.O.T.E, and more) mostly serve up archetypal Trap God instrumentals without ever distinguishing themselves. J. White Did It (of “Bodak Yellow” fame) encapsulates the malaise on “Move Me,” which leans on the old Dragnet theme tune like an out-of-shape distance runner sagging against a wall. It’s a reminder that one of Gucci’s stronger recent projects, Droptopwop, benefitted from being overseen by producer Metro Boomin, who tied everything together while keeping the rapper’s worst proclivities in check.","The Atlanta legend’s latest continues his consistent streak of mostly-good, sometimes-awkward new material.

Mechanical Fantasy Box,Patrick Cowley,by: Rich Juzwiak,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dae2650bc614b0008ba775f/1:1/w_160/mechanicalfantasybox.jpg,2019-10-24 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/patrick-cowley-mechanical-fantasy-box/,Dark Entries,"Before his death in 1982, the producer and musician Patrick Cowley was best known for electronic disco productions that defined San Francisco’s gay hi-NRG scene. He was one of the first entertainers with national impact (if not the first) to die of AIDS (his “Menergy” and “Megatron Man” hit the top of Billboard’s club chart in 1981). The party line is that his “career began to rise as his health failed him” (words cribbed from his Bay Area Reporter obit), and the music he made in his final year had a starry slickness to it suggesting even better things to come. The last song he cut with Sylvester, “Do You Wanna Funk?,” would go on to become his most widely known, somewhat ironically, after its inclusion in 1983’s Trading Places. That movie was a vehicle for Eddie Murphy, who told virulently homophobic jokes in his standup at the time; his landmark special Delirious, from the same year, opens with an extended bit about “faggots.” In the ’80s, Murphy was a mainstream icon; Cowley was an all-but-forgotten cult figure. The disparity in the cultural volume of their voices is a small illustration of how gay history worked for decades. Josh Cheon, former member of the queer DJ collective Honey Soundsystem and mastermind behind the reissue label Dark Entries, has worked to flesh out Cowley’s legacy with an archival series of posthumous releases. By now, he has shepherded more releases into the world than were available when Cowley was alive. Cheon’s excavation work has exposed less frenetic, ambient-leaning and weirder sides of Cowley’s music. The three previous solo Cowley releases on Dark Entries largely contained material he composed for gay porn flicks—sleazy synth work whose sheer oddness could easily have been lost on consumers who had, ahem, other things to focus on. The latest compilation, Mechanical Fantasy Box, was released on what would have been Cowley’s 69th birthday. It spans the years 1973 to 1980 and has less of a conceptual framework than earlier collections, offering 12 previously unreleased odds and ends mostly sourced from 10-inch reels of Cowley’s synth work juvenilia. It’s unclear if Cowley ever intended this material for release, and as such, will likely appeal most to fans hungry for more excavation of Cowley’s legacy. While not without its charm, Mechanical Fantasy Box is the last place those unfamiliar with Cowley’s work should go exploring. “His early process was often shooting in the dark and seeing what happened,” wrote early Cowley collaborator Maurice Tani, and there is a sense of playfulness to Mechanical Fantasy Box. An arpeggiated squiggle flirts with the right ear in opener “Out of Body (Intro)” before hard-panning to the left as other synths whistle and clunk like a swimmer hitting his head on a boat underwater. Many of the songs contain one, if not several, high-pitched and twitchy sounds that repeat anxiously, but there’s an overall sense of motion here—these aren’t looped compositions, they’re sound designs that mutate over time as parts fade in and out. The best example of this is “Moving Bodies 1,” which starts out dissonant to the point of seeming hostility before, out of nowhere, it all coheres into an unlikely groove. “Right Here, Right Now” is the Mechanical Fantasy Box cut with the most bodily immediacy, pummeling through its arpeggiated bass line, drums that pop and sizzle, and synths that mimic cosmic phasers. It’s the closest thing to hi-NRG here, though a little too fast and woozy to be a proper dance track. The amusingly titled “Lumberjacks in Heat” has the insistence of a John Carpenter score with the terror-prog energy of Goblin’s Suspiria main theme. It doesn’t sound like sex music to me, but Cowley had a voracious appetite and a vivid imagination; if anyone could make this work in a sexual situation, it was probably him. I get this sense, mind you, after reading the sex journal Cowley kept (at times sporadically) from 1975 to 1980, which Dark Entries is publishing and releasing in tandem with this new compilation. It’s also called Mechanical Fantasy Box, after Cowley’s somewhat oblique term for San Francisco’s public sex scene during the first wave of mass gay liberation in the United States. In brief, sometimes poetic snapshots of his encounters, Cowley evinces a poignant shamelessness about loving sex with men. To hear him tell it, Cowley was enthralled by the sex he was having—so many great asses, so many great cocks, and such prowess. “I could never take the fuck I give,” he brags. In addition to the graphic sex, his writings contain sprinklings of romance and momentary ambivalence regarding his fast lifestyle (“The churning, crowded heat of men in a sexual banquet crowds in on me and the forced-by-circumstances emotion-lacking atmosphere drives me away”). There’s also a real sense of the brotherhood that the ritualistic scene could foster for a lapsed Catholic like Cowley: “I’m on my knees worshipping Phallus. All around me are the other similarly engaged. I feel the one-ness of our activity. Silent yet all things understood.” Some passages are breathtakingly moving coming from someone who had no idea that his life would be taken from him in a few short years. “This is a sweet sex and the feeling flows with the juices. Let the feelings flow. The longer you love, the longer you live,” he wrote in 1976. In ’77, he recalled telling a partner, “I know I’m going to be 50 yrs old and be able to look back and say, ‘I spent what I had to spend and used what was mine to use as it was intended.’” Cowley, who didn’t live to see 33, then wrote, “I loved it up.” The book is also the rare opportunity to hear directly from Cowley; because interviews with him are not easily accessible online, much of what there is to learn about his life comes only through secondhand accounts of the people who knew and loved him (and many of them, of course, have also since died). To his fans, he’s existed as a myth. The one-two punch of the Mechanical Fantasy Box release and the journals represents a balanced portrait of the way Cowley lived, to hear some tell it. “He really didn’t have much of a social life. It was just music and the baths, music and the baths,” said Cowley collaborator Frank Loverde, quoted in Joshua Gamson’s 2005 biography The Fabulous Sylvester. Though this sounds like quite a social life to me, this quote suggests that Cowley did not compartmentalize his sexuality. It was imbued in his essence. There’s a legendary story, recounted both in Gamson’s book and a 2016 New York Times piece on the Cowley revival, in which an AIDS-ravaged, wheelchair-bound Cowley looks down from a balcony at the Galleria at a dancefloor filled with revelers at a tribute party thrown in his honor, and says, “Those stupid queens, don’t they know?” And indeed, even a few years ago, Cowley’s accounts of the storm might have read as prelapsarian, even tragic. But in an age when proper access to antiretroviral therapies can keep people from contracting HIV and keep people with HIV healthy, Patrick Cowley’s sex journal is a voraciously readable historical document, a seminal text in every possible manner of the phrase. Over 40 years ago, Cowley was a forbearer of the kind of unapologetic sexual liberation that’s currently throbbing through many queer urban centers. His transmissions have made it all the way to the future to culture that is defined in no small part by the potentially lessening grip of HIV, a culture whose history is now becoming a mandatory component of some states’ public-school curricula. “It seems that life is there for the taking and I took my share,” he wrote in his journal. Even today, Cowley is as insatiable as ever.

Anicca,Teebs,by: Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da6153ded43b80008303f07/1:1/w_160/teebs.jpg,2019-10-24 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/teebs-anicca/,Brainfeeder,"Creative collectives come together through a combination of will and serendipity to make superstars out of those who might otherwise be cult figures, and cult figures out of those who might otherwise never have made music at all. In Los Angeles, starting in 2006, the Low End Theory night at the Airliner was that kind of scene. Many of the names that emerged from there are well known. Then there were artists like Mtendere Mandowa, better known as Teebs. To those who followed what was happening at Low End, he was up there with Flying Lotus and Nosaj Thing, partly thanks to the strength of his 2010 Brainfeeder album Ardour. The record sounded like what would happen if you could plant hip-hop beats in the soil and plug headphones into the flora that emerged. Teebs was a visual artist first; the Low End movement helped him to understand himself as a musician, too. But by 2014, some of the scene’s bigger names had moved onto bigger things. That year, Teebs released an album called  E S T A R A. It was perfectly pleasant. But it felt as if it had been too long since someone pushed him toward anything new. Now, he’s back with Anicca, his first album in five years and his strongest musical offering since Ardour. In lieu of the collaborators with whom he first attracted notice, Mandowa has gathered a new assemblage—some are familiar names, and some of them relative newcomers. Anicca sparkles when it features them, and also when it doesn’t. Teebs benefits once again from a vibrant musical scene, this time one that he’s gathered himself. Teebs’ music begins as beat music and grows from there. The opener, “Atoms Song,” is a good example: It starts with a simple keyboard loop, going around and around. But then synths drift in like wind, elements disappear and reappear, a string section paints the song with light. Before you know it, seven and a half minutes have gone by and a lovely sonic sunshower has come down. One of the things that differentiates Anicca from E S T A R A is its sense of propulsion. There’s constant movement here, and while everything is lovely, nothing lingers too long or lends itself to stasis. Mandowa’s collaborators help keep things moving. Sudan Archives, one of the most exciting Stones Throw prospects in a minute, leans forward over a thumping beat on “Black Dove,” maintaining momentum even when she slows the tempo. “Studie” is replete with all the warmth of early Panda Bear, who arrived at a sound similar to Teebs’ through an entirely different route and who appears on the track to sing, once again, about the perils of social status: “Tripping on the social climb get in line.” (It’s been nice to see Panda Bear start to be understood as a beat-music pioneer in his own right.)  Another standout collaboration comes later in the album as Pink Siifu leads “Daughter Callin’” over a shuffling beat that sounds like great, late-period Dilla. Teebs doesn’t need other artists to sound inspired.  The softly vibrating “prayers ii” seems at first like a standard beat until you realize how the percussion is tempered by strings and synths, the space between each beat breathing and expanding. It’s a track where the time signature isn’t as obvious as you might initially think. “Slumber” opens with a canvas made of strings, shifts its focus to keyboard, and then redoubles the strings; as the keyboard acquires more and more urgency, the strings grow louder and you can just barely hear what sounds like a human voice low in the mix. That might be Mandowa’s daughter, who was born the year after E S T A R A came out and whose voice appears on Anicca, along with sounds created by her mother. Where Ardour was influenced by loss—Teebs’s father died during the making of the record—the new album sounds like the work of a man obsessed with family, and willing to bring his collaborators into his own. Perhaps realizing that scenes dissolve, that friends and colleagues move on, helped Teebs to understand just how important it is to make the best of connections while they’re still available. The word “anicca” refers to the concept of impermanence, and this gorgeous album does move along. It’s over before you know it. While you listen to it, though, time disappears entirely.

Bigger Than Life,Black Marble,by: Fred Thomas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da63d54f1323700083db750/1:1/w_160/blackmarble.jpg,2019-10-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/black-marble-bigger-than-life/,Sacred Bones,"The synth-pop grammar that dictates Black Marble’s music is strict and specific. The project formed as a duo in 2012 but eventually pared down to lone member Chris Stewart; throughout, its output has been uniformly composed of the same carefully curated elements. The instruments are hulking hardware synths and drum machines that hum when they power up. Fluid, melodic bass lines immediately recall New Order, but only the dour churn of Movement, and nothing as bouncy as Power, Corruption and Lies or later albums. Hints of the Cure are limited to the floating whispers of Seventeen Seconds. The crumbling production values are inspired by obscure ’80s minimal-wave artists like Iron Curtain; a detached romanticism can be traced from choice moments in the early OMD catalog. Applying this rigid aesthetic to Stewart’s pop-minded songwriting makes Black Marble one of the more disarmingly catchy bands to bear the coldwave tag. Each subsequent release has gradually stripped away a layer of lo-fi filth, and Bigger Than Life, Black Marble’s third album, is easily the cleanest, uncovering a previously buried accessibility. The understated percussion, plucked guitar leads, and bright chorus of “Grey Eyeliner” are given room to interact dynamically, while the anxiously buzzing arrangement of “One Eye Open” makes space for layers of twitchy hooks. Most strikingly, Stewart’s deadpan vocals rise out of their normally garbled catacombs, making for discernibly pretty harmonies and intelligible lyrics. Where earlier albums waded in ugly murk and occasionally broke out in tantrums of noise, Bigger Than Life sounds composed, almost polite in contrast. Ascending from dungeon-grade fidelity doesn’t always work. The reverb coating 2016’s excellent It’s Immaterial submerged detail but also flattened potentially clashing countermelodies and curbed tangential ideas. Without tape hiss to hide behind, the competing synths of “Never Tell” feel cluttered, and meandering intros drag on. And while Stewart has a gift for crafting obtuse melodies, he also has a tendency to recycle bits of his best tracks. “Private Show” calls on variants of the insistent bass progression and elementary drum fills that drove It’s Immaterial high point “Iron Lung,” and familiar rudiments reappear throughout. The sound is less broken and several shades lighter, but the demo-like quality of earlier albums smoothed over crowded arrangements and forgave repetition. The newly audible vocals also offer a better view of Stewart’s ambiguous, impressionistic lyrics. Inspired during the writing process by a car-less existence in his high-traffic home of Los Angeles, Stewart positions many of his characters as passengers observing the city from the window of a crosstown bus, freaky classmates keeping bones under their bed, or lonely introverts looking for salvation in consumerism. The album’s strongest song, “Feels,” marks its most human moment. Hesitantly optimistic synth tones support a wash of memories from an imagined past: volunteering at a blood drive, waiting for summer to bring happier days,  a late-night slot at a college radio station. Though vague, “Feels” succinctly communicates the soft isolation that the rest of the album reaches for but only delivers in fragments. Its friendly melancholy zeroes in on an unremarkable everyday loneliness, the kind felt by introverted DJs in stuffy basements and glimpsed on the silent faces of strangers on the bus. Dialing down the gloom and upping production values is a logical step forward, and when these changes gel, Stewart’s studied goth-pop evolves. Bigger Than Life takes Black Marble aboveground, where some songs bloom, while others struggle to adjust to the daylight after so long in the shadows.

The Order of Nature,Jim JamesTeddy Abrams,by: Steven Arroyo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da8d715fd8a1f0009ad528e/1:1/w_160/orderofnature.jpg,2019-10-23 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jim-james-teddy-abrams-the-order-of-nature/,Decca Gold,"The friendship between My Morning Jacket frontman Jim James and Louisville Orchestra conductor and music director Teddy Abrams dates back to 2014, the year Abrams moved to Louisville to become the youngest director in the ensemble’s 82-year history. Upon taking over, Abrams immediately started focusing on attracting young locals to the symphony, arguing in a PBS miniseries that funk, jazz, bluegrass, and folk were all not just viable, but fertile sources of inspiration for orchestral pieces. Abrams is also a composer, and thus a collaboration with Louisville native James seemed not as much an “if” as a “when.” It would happen two years later, when James contributed guitar to an Abrams-penned song for Muhammed Ali that was released on the day of the boxing legend’s funeral. Now, the two of them have gone in together on a full-fledged project. The Order of Nature: A Song Cycle is a nine-song program featuring James as vocalist, recorded live at Louisville’s Festival of American Music last April. Each song is either an original composed by James and Abrams, a classic cover, or an Abrams reworking of a James solo cut—none are from the My Morning Jacket catalog. James sent Abrams demos of these songs in acoustic form, which Abrams then filled out with new orchestral arrangements. The arrangements frame James’ sonorous voice so that it sits at the serene eye of a symphonic and choral hurricane. James lovingly interprets Nina Simone on the Charles Reuben-penned “The Human Touch” and later puts his own spin on Simone’s version of “Who Am I?” the Louisville Orchestra keeping him surrounded and supported, not suffocated. When James bellows to the heavens on the latter, “Will I ever live again?/As a mountain lion, or a rooster, or a hennn?” it’s equal parts spiritual and goofy. That’s a familiar mode for James, but not so much for Abrams, who simply follows his lead and crafts an avalanching grand-piano podium for James to project from. Some of James’ solo songs struggle to emerge from under the shadow of their former selves. “Here in Spirit” and “Same Old Lie” were highlights on James’ psychedelic Eternally Even, but Abrams’ cinematic grandiosity swamps them. Compared to the fine-grained studio versions, they just sound flat-footed. Conversely, Abrams’ rollicking arrangement on “Over and Over”—the third official version of the song that James has released in two years, after it appeared last year on Uniform Distortion and its rearranged companion album Uniform Clarity—fluffs it with Bacharach-ian details, its trumpet micro-gusts and lush strings ushering it towards a brightness that the two prior versions couldn’t unlock. That blissful feel creates a new, suddenly essential contrast with James’ lyrics about the tragedy of repeated mistakes; after all, the idea that “we drop the same bombs” and “we shed the same blood” is about as irrational as layering happy brass and a fiddle solo over such grim sentiments. The song’s impact practically doubles. This sounds like the version it was meant to be, the best one. The loose thread binding the album is Mother Earth’s ability to unite—or as James has put it, “the fact that nature doesn’t know how to hate.” But for every ounce of energy that The Order of Nature spends preaching peace, harmony, and the wonders of the great outdoors, it burns more working overtime to convince newcomers of the power and magic of the Louisville Orchestra. “Back to the End of the World,” the album’s majestic center, nibbles a melody from the Fred Neil-penned, Harry Nilsson-popularized “Everybody’s Talkin’” and Bruce Channel’s “Hey! Baby.” It’s lovely and rich, but like much of the album, it also strains a bit in reaching across the classical-pop divide. In Abrams’ own words, when it comes to writing music, “it’s really important that the atmosphere matches the experience.” But the merging of Abrams’ and James’ worlds owes more to geography than to atmosphere. That makes The Order of Nature something of an inherent gamble. The two composers end up breaking even.

Dusty,Homeboy Sandman,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da8da074ee18500086a37d4/1:1/w_160/dusty.jpeg,2019-10-23 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/homeboy-sandman-dusty/,Mello Music Group,"To hear Homeboy Sandman tell it, he’s in a great place now, contented and spinning raps for the pure joy of it. The Queens-bred rapper’s ninth album, Dusty, is his first on Mello Music Group since parting with Stones Throw, and he’s said that it is his most uninhibited release, one in which he allows parts of himself he’s kept in check to “flourish and surface.” But what mostly comes through on Dusty is what he’s already communicated, over and over again—he’s a technically accomplished rapper, and...well, that’s about it. If you’re looking for someone who will cram words like “hypotenuse” into verses, this is the album for you. It must be mentioned as a baseline: Homeboy Sandman is good at rapping. But it’s the kind of good that treats words as a means to an end; that end being proving he’s good at rapping. It’s an empty loop, exacerbated by the fact that he isn’t rapping about much of anything else in particular, save for the weaklings who aren’t measuring up the standards he’s setting. “I don’t wanna be associated with these dudes/Take a peek inside the dossier of a recluse/Who ain’t gonna pretend a serving size is a teaspoon,” he raps on “Far Out,” without going any further out. He’s far from done clearing his throat: “The difference between you and me/Could fill the sun and earth, moon and sea,” he spits on “Live and Breathe.” His only other discernible interest is sex, and on “Pussy” he turns his pursuit of it into a Seussian rhyme: “I love it more than rapping or eating/I love it more than napping or reading.” “Wondering Why,” which is just a string of rapped hypothetical questions, was executed more effectively by Jadakiss in 2004. One question Sandman never asks himself, but should’ve: What, exactly, is the point of all this? On any of Sandman’s songs, there are moments that can make you marvel at the wit of his wordplay or the detailed arrangement of his raps themselves, their sequence and structure. Every now and then, he’ll articulate an idea perfectly: “I deal in the absolutes/Exact as a science/One synapse at a time’s how I spend my whole life/It’s a spirit thing/It’s in here/It keeps me from hearing things” (“Always”). Or he’ll strike a nice balance between his left and right brain: “Greatest look since dinosaurs and the protozoa/Greatest hooks since southpaw Rocky Balboa,” he raps on “Yes Iyah.” Over a diverse selection of traditionalist beats by longtime collaborator Mono En Stereo (formerly El RTNC), Sandman is always engaged, but he’s rarely engaging. Sandman clearly thinks of himself as a peerless writer and rapper. But as pure-bars showcases go, it is less personal than Young M.A’s Herstory in the Making, less colorful than super-producer team-ups from Danny Brown and Freddie Gibbs. He’s not as thoughtful as MIKE or MAVI. His more immediate peers, guys like Quelle Chris (who appears on this album) and billy woods (who he’s taking on tour), use their lyrical acumen to put finer points on big ideas, and don’t sacrifice any of their outsider cachet doing so. Rap albums don’t need overarching concepts, but they do need ideas, and it’s unclear if Sandman has any of his own worth sharing on Dusty.","The Queens rapper’s ninth album is full of the dizzyingly technical wordplay he’s made his trademark.

Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost Part 2,Foals,by: Joshua Copperman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da7538d769ac40008a6624f/1:1/w_160/foals.jpg,2019-10-23 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/foals-everything-not-saved-will-be-lost-part-2/,Warner,"At this point, Foals have settled into their role as alternative-radio festival stalwarts. Ever since the grimy riffs and macho vocals of Holy Fire lead single “Inhaler,” they’ve shown increasing comfort with their U2-sized sound. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing—the build of oft-synched signature song “Spanish Sahara” remains so stirring that its replicants, like “Late Night” and “Sunday,” soar by association. Even if March’s Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost Part 1 was too cluttered to recapture the intimacy of “Sahara,” unexpected detours like the sparse “Cafe D’Athens” and chaotic rave-up “In Degrees” broke through the murky production. Part 2, the band promised, would be heavier still—but mostly it continues the now-standard Foals album formula, dividing its tracklist into Aggressive, Funky, and Somber. It’s not a complement to its predecessor so much as just another collection of Foals songs. Besides, it hardly makes sense to differentiate between a rock and a pop album when every instrument is reduced to overcompressed mush. The band’s brash self-production blows up their sound until all definition is lost. The most disappointing casualty is Jack Bevan’s drumming—once the backbone of Foals’ music, he now sounds buried beneath atmospheric synths and guitars. Not that he has a lot to do: First single “Black Bull” is rhythmically identical to “What Went Down,” second single “The Runner” mimics “Inhaler,” and so on. “Like Lightning” plays like the kind of utilitarian blues-rock that music directors reach for when the Black Keys aren’t in the licensing budget. Foals are most interesting when exploring new territory. While Part 1 shined in its homages to In Rainbows-era Radiohead, Part 2 harks back further to the progressive rock of the ’70s and ’80s. “10,000 Feet” is a half-time Rush homage, down to a repeating “Tom Sawyer” synth. The album’s back half recalls the post-Peter Gabriel, pre-Abacab Genesis, a band that balanced technical prowess with surprisingly poppy melodies. Genesis also evolved from eccentric outsiders to pop stars, and while Foals are too self-serious to embrace the style’s campier elements (leave that to their smarter, more irreverent tourmates Everything Everything), they seem to have tapped an unexpected wellspring. For all their posturing about making a record that “really resonated with the current time,” they’re more at home in old-fashioned prog. The lyrical content, meanwhile, remains virtually unchanged between the two records. This band is famous for its energy, not its insight, and you’d be hard-pressed to hear the political subtext Foals say they’d like to impart. The band describes “Black Bull” as “a conflicted diary of masculine confusion and negative tendencies”; the actual chorus goes, “We not playing around/The black bull’s in town.” Even an intriguing turn of phrase like “turn me into a wedding ring” turns out to be a thuddingly literal reference to a more interesting story: Mexican architect Luis Barragán, whose ashes were turned into a diamond more than 25 years after his death. “Dreaming Of” is made up of references to other, better songs (“you’re dancing on your own,” “you’re always crashing that same car,” “there’s always something in the way”), but at least the magnet-poetry approach feels like a deliberate character study of someone obsessed with looking back instead of facing reality. Rather than forming the second half of a complete statement, Part 2 struggles to differentiate itself. Even with the occasional continuity—like when the earlier “Surf Pt. 1” pays off on Part 2’s penultimate “Into the Surf”—this album could have arrived first with few alterations. “Neptune” and “Dreaming Of” will slot nicely into live performances, but they’re surrounded by songs too effortful to be filler and too unmemorable to be worthwhile. “The defining record of our career, I think we’ve still got it in us,” frontman Yannis Philippakis recently admitted to Dork, but Foals’ career-defining statement is less likely to be a new record than a playlist of all their singles. It’s hard not to lose patience as they trudge towards that album, promising they’re getting closer while moving in place.

Coconut Grove,Relaxer,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da8dc8da8fd3600081ede99/1:1/w_160/relaxer.jpg,2019-10-23 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/relaxer-coconut-grove/,Avenue 66,"Daniel Martin-McCormick’s past always seems to dominate the conversation about his present. No matter how many new groups he’s formed or new aliases he’s tried on for size, his music continues to be evaluated through the lens of his earliest projects. Since 2002, Martin-McCormick has logged lengthy stints in groups like Black Eyes and Mi Ami and recorded solo as Sex Worker and Ital. (Full disclosure: he’s also an occasional contributor to Pitchfork.) Launched in 2016 with a series of five self-released EPs, Relaxer is the New York producer’s latest undertaking, and his new album, Coconut Grove, potentially represents a final, complete break from his noisy post-hardcore roots. More than 15 years have passed since Black Eyes called it quits, but the band’s yelpy, chaotic urgency has colored the perception of Martin-McCormick’s entire career. While some of Black Eyes’ crazed energy did carry over into Martin-McCormick’s subsequent projects (e.g. the tortured glam-pop of Sex Worker and the highly rhythmic post-punk skronk of Mi Ami), he’s spent most of this decade focused on house, techno, and other forms of purely electronic music. As Ital, his initial releases were notably lo-fi, full of jittery intensity and not necessarily primed for the dancefloor, yet the project underwent a major evolution as he moved beyond his playful initial efforts. By the time that Hellhole, the final Ital EP, dropped in 2017, his music was emotionally deeper, more richly detailed and, most importantly, much better produced. Nevertheless, it often felt like listeners’ expectations of sonic anarchy and disarray were still looming in the background; for many, Ital would always be a former punk misfit making weirdo lo-fi house and techno. With Relaxer, Martin-McCormick has effectively hit the reset button. Although he initially launched the alias as an anonymous side project, in 2017 he publicly made the switch and officially retired the Ital name. It was a time of transition, and not just in the musical realm. In 2018, he began work on Coconut Grove, creating the album during periods of what he calls “deliberate solitude” throughout a challenging year. Though he hasn’t been any more specific than that, he has described the LP as “an exorcism, or maybe a rebirth.” Yet Coconut Grove isn’t a morose record. It’s not even particularly dark, especially in comparison to some of the later Ital releases. Martin-McCormick has said that some of the first electronic music that caught his attention, during the mid 2000s, was minimal dub techno, and although he was attracted to the music’s elegance and stripped-down aesthetic, it also lacked the visceral energy and raw emotional release he craved as a musician who was then in his early 20s. More than a decade later, it seems that Martin-McCormick has returned to that particular pool of inspiration, at least in part. Coconut Grove isn’t a dub techno album—the percussion is far too lively for that—but there is a certain patience to the music that feels new for him. Coconut Grove shows a new level of refinement in Martin-McCormick’s music. Songs like “Steeplechase” and “Fluorescence” are brightly colored washes of ambient tranquility, floating along with all the urgency of a cumulus cloud. There’s a slight layer of Martin-McCormick’s usual distortion in the mix, but its presence provides a sense of texture as opposed to abruptly crashing the proceedings and spoiling the mood. The similarly serene “Agony” may sport an ominous title, but the track’s gliding synth washes feel more introspective than melancholy. As good as these ambient excursions are, Coconut Grove spends more of its time on the dancefloor, mostly in a space that could be described as dreamy, melodic techno. There’s a genuine warmth to the record, and although Martin-McCormick still favors battered drum sounds, decaying basslines, and crackling bits of static, the music’s low-end heft sits comfortably alongside its hazy, space-age melodies. “Breaking the Waves” is one of the best examples of this equilibrium, its Balearic synth waves drifting above the song’s breakbeat-ish rhythm and the snarling crunch of its bassline. Album opener “Serpent in the Garden” dials up the melodic acrobatics even further, its bold synths sounding downright buoyant—and veering rather close to trance territory—atop the track’s sturdy techno foundation. The LP does have its more upfront moments. The booming kicks and complex drum patterns of “Um” bring to mind labels like Livity Sound, while the cracking “Born From Beyond” also lets the percussion lead the way, with the help of a sticky vocal refrain and the sort of hovering bass tones that usually populate the background of a drum’n’bass track. Still, these songs don’t feel like outliers, as they retain the album’s warmth and dreamlike atmosphere. Stylistically and musically, Coconut Grove might be one of the safest releases of Martin-McCormick’s career; it’s also one of his best. It may be “just” a techno album, but it’s also a confident statement from a veteran producer who seems to have settled into a groove after years of intentionally butting up against genre barriers and his own production limits. There’s value in that sort of work, but there’s also nothing wrong with an artist leaving it behind once they’ve carved out their own space. Perhaps it’s a function of maturity or simply getting better at his craft, but at some point, Martin-McCormick stopped being an ex-punk dabbling in electronic music and became a proper techno producer who happens to come from a D.C. post-hardcore background. His music has become subtler along the way, but it has also gotten a lot more rewarding.","After years of kicking against dance music’s strictures, Daniel Martin-McCormick delivers something close to a pure techno album. A product of turmoil, it’s a satisfyingly confident statement.

All Encores,Nils Frahm,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da73c0781b37500080c1ee9/1:1/w_160/nilsfrahm_allencores.jpg,2019-10-22 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nils-frahm-all-encores/,Erased Tapes,"The German pianist Nils Frahm likes to think big. He is the founder of Piano Day, an annual holiday dedicated to the instrument, and for a time he was the owner of the world’s largest upright, a Klavins M450i, standing a mammoth 14 feet, nine inches tall. (Since the release earlier this year of the M470i, eight inches taller, his model has, alas, been relegated to proverbial second fiddle.) Stages sag under the weight of his live rig, which can consist of Yamaha grand piano, Fender Rhodes, vintage Mellotron, three Roland Juno-60 synths, at least three drum machines, five Roland RE-501 Chorus Echoes, and racks upon racks of sundry effects, mixers, amps, and still more keyboards; darting from station to station, Frahm concocts a throbbing sort of chamber techno, a many-layered mixture of electronic pulses and acoustic timbres. Still, on record, his music often tends toward the opposite extreme: a kind of contemplative, cloistered intimacy. Where last year’s All Melody, Frahm’s most ambitious album statement to date, attempted to bring together those two opposing poles—fashioning choir, strings, horns, gongs, pipe organ, and his usual welter of acoustic and electronic elements into a whole at once vast and hushed—All Encores takes a step backward, toward a simpler, sparer sound. In essence, it represents a set of rough drafts, avenues abandoned as All Melody assumed its final form. All 12 tracks here were originally released on a trilogy of EPs, remnants of a proposed triple album that never came to completion, exploring distinct corners of Frahm’s musical practice. The first four tracks focus on Frahm’s solo piano, with the addition of a brief trumpet soliloquy that opens the second song, “Ringing,” on a particularly mournful note. This is terrain Frahm has explored, in slightly different form, on 2012’s Screws and 2015’s Solo; the pleasure here is in the virtually unplugged proprieties of the recordings—no bells or whistles, just Frahm’s sentimental melodies swimming in the natural ambiance of the Berlin Funkhaus studios, where he recorded. Like All Melody’s unadorned highlights “My Friend the Forest” and “Forever Changeless,” All Encores’ opener, “The Roughest Trade,” is recorded in a way that emphasizes the piano’s mechanics—the clack of the keys as they rise and fall; the soft shuffle of the striking hammers. It amounts to a kind of X-ray of melody in motion, the piano’s wood-and-metal skeleton illuminated beneath Frahm’s pale balladry. None of the other three piano songs have quite the same emotional pull—their melodies are simpler, or simply more forgettable—though the gently swaying “The Dane,” a staple of his live shows, comes close. After “Harmonium in the Well,” an 11-minute study for reed organ and natural reverb (presumably, given the title, the one he fashioned out of a stone well in Mallorca), All Encores returns to the hybrid textures of All Melody, albeit in scaled-back form. “Sweet Little Lie” sets a drowsy piano lullaby against whispering static; “A Walking Embrace,” for piano and swelling synth pads, verges on the maudlin, as delicate—and as dated—as a collection of glass animals. Only “Spells” attempts the climatic scale of All Melody’s most elaborate pieces—a welcome shot of adrenaline just when the album is in danger of expiring from sheer politeness. It’s a shame that “Artificially Intelligent” is less than two minutes long, because its hiccuping spray of pipe organ and wordless voice is by far the album’s most original moment, translating Frahm’s acoustic palette into a form somewhere between Morse code, abstract expressionism, and the markings on seismograph scrolls. But the final two songs are worth waiting for: The hypnotic “All Armed” is a sidewinding cross between Shackleton and Jon Hassell, while “Amirador” layers rich, deep, organ-like synthesizer tones into a shifting ambient etude of filmic proportions. It suggests a new direction for Frahm’s music, albeit one that it doesn’t seem like he’s quite figured out yet. Nearly four minutes of the 14-minute piece are virtually silent—as though, finding himself at a crossroads, Frahm were holding his breath, waiting for fresh inspiration to strike.

Coin Coin Chapter Four: Memphis,Matana Roberts,by: Mina Tavakoli,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da8deb2a8fd3600081ede9b/1:1/w_160/coincoin.jpg,2019-10-22 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/matana-roberts-coin-coin-chapter-four-memphis/,Constellation,"Time has no steady rhythm, despite what a clock insists. Matana Roberts, who might agree, saw how the tempo of history seemed to move irregularly through both her own memory and the national one: how choice points seemed to speed up, wane, cut, coda, and hold; how nostalgia coddled, unsettled, blurred, and muzzled moments. “The past: It sits there,” she said in a 2016 interview, pausing to savor a delicious silence, “but it moves.” Roberts is one of those artists permanently disturbed by the wing of a single, broad muse—here the muse being America, boiled in its own blood, disquiet, mettle, and hate. Her self-appointed task across a projected 12-part album suite of what can unsatisfyingly be bucketed as free-jazz (but in reality is more like historical fiction accompanied by a loud bouquet of horns, ouds, and vibraphones) is akin to what essayist Elizabeth Hardwick selects as her lodestar on the first page of her best, wooziest, and final work, Sleepless Nights. “This is what I have decided to do with my life,” she writes. “I will do this work of transformed and even distorted memory and lead this life.” Like Hardwick, Roberts has a firm sense of purpose and a fabulist’s impulse, beginning with a vision of the past—on this album, memories of a young woman whose parents were killed by the Klan, a story loaned to her by her Memphis-born grandmother—and using it as kindling to cannon a hailstorm of paean and shrapnel. History, as it often does, crashes in with savagery. Coin Coin Chapter Four: Memphis is like the other three extant Coin Coins inasmuch as it’s marked by a tumbling of psychic and cosmic ephemera, allowing free improv, folk spirituals, and guttural yawps from throat and sax to mimic the beatitude of a woman’s disguises, passions, and dignity against the thrashings of circumstance. This effort, however, feels firmer, and more fulgid. In this sharper focus, Roberts’ subtractions have an additive effect: Whereas Coin Coin Chapters One, Two, and Three approach women as platforms by which to explode outward into sound, Coin Coin Chapter Four: Memphis focuses more tightly on myth-making by channeling the protagonist in a broadly narrative form. We learn of her father, of her grandmother, of her prayers for safety, and watch Roberts narrate as a vessel for her spiritspeak. Both the pieces that utilize her voice—which is most satisfying in a tranced-out, babble-as-hymnal mode—and those that are voiceless somehow summon the sensation that she and her band have swallowed their instruments so as to transcend them. Roberts’ saxophone in the prologue, “Jewels of the Sky: Inscription”—which capitalizes on the horn’s capacity to blare like what one imagines the sun might sound like if it were played (low, eruptive, juicy)—is divine noodling, astral magma. The epilogue, “How Bright They Shine,” ends on deep, reedy emissions like dispatches from a satellite stuck in time and orbit. Space feels grounded in Roberts’ work, though. Mirages of Chicago’s free-jazz heroes—of which Roberts is now resolutely one—mist through inescapably, but so does the city of Memphis. To call upon Memphis as a signifier of place and time is a choice that irresistibly forces images of its past to projectile into the present: the stuff of Sun and Stax, the Southern rag, Three 6 Mafia, Johnny Cash, the blues. This isn’t to say that she sounds directly reminiscent of them, but instead assumes herself as part of a cultural lineage devoted to confronting the darkness, the grimness, the apocrypha of the South. She summons the same dramatic tensions that surface when staring at a Confederate statue still erect in 2019. At the substrate, Roberts’ work is that of a woman in thrall to the legacies of family and history, but so sensitive to the sharp pains and violent rearrangements of a national consciousness that she needs to experience them instrumentally, which is to say, through her body. In a recent interview with The Quietus, Roberts devotes a large part of her conversation to a fascination with the idea of moving through water as experienced by indigineous and African-American bodies during the transatlantic slave trade. “The way in which free divers use their lungs is something I’m very curious about as a saxophonist,” she says of deep-sea diving without an oxygen tank, a new hobby. “I do a lot of the breathwork that I learned in my saxophone practice now.” That phrase—breathwork—sums the brio and intensity of Roberts’ vision. It should come as no surprise that respiration and inspiration come from the same Latin root, spir: ‘‘to breathe.” The force of Roberts’ breath—first through the saxophone, all endurance and fits and starts; then through time, inflated and vivified—makes bold how much the retelling of history is a necessary game of survival—an ongoing, fluid act of resuscitating the dead. Toward the end of Sleepless Nights, Hardwick closes in on her own memory-remaking with a lapidary line that may as well have come from a chorus in the middle of Memphis: “The weak have the purest sense of history.” It takes no effort to imagine Roberts chanting it in one of her fugue states, reaching crescendo as she stacks the words like a highway pile-up: The weak have the purest sense of history; the weak havethepurestsense of history, theweakhavethepurestsenseofhistory… Roberts’ history-making is impure in a literal, fundamental way—that is, part patchwork, part arch composure, part sacrament—but it’s all extremely real. What she does here, and what she will continue to do, is allow her body’s blood to beat loudly enough so that it matches the irregular rhythms of the past. She inhales and exhales life into memory so as to make it new—or, maybe more accurately, she affords history the brief freedom to breathe.

You Deserve Love,White Reaper,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da8db4f9ebe6a00083af249/1:1/w_160/youdeservelove.jpg,2019-10-22 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/white-reaper-you-deserve-love/,Elektra,"White Reaper weren’t lying on The World’s Best American Band, but they were joking. The shitkicking Kentucky quintet seemed to have enough self-awareness to recognize that their craft —we’re comin’ to your town, we’ll help you party down—was no longer understood as a form of populism, but something as archaic and artisanal as, say, scrimshaw. They might as well be the only American band. So they must’ve been as surprised as anyone when Elektra called their sorta-bluff and made them one of the first new signings in the venerated label’s ambitious relaunch, otherwise focused on reliably massive pop-punk, metal, and country acts. But White Reaper hardly sound intimidated by the fact that You Deserve Love now bears the same logo as their treasured Cars, Metallica, Queen, and AC/DC records. They just went ahead and made the next White Reaper album. “If you hate the new record, then you hate us. The major label didn’t do anything. You should at least know that all the blame is on our shoulders,” keyboardist/hypeman Ryan Hater said earlier this year, perhaps assuming heated discussions about selling out to accompany his band’s throwback aesthetic. Rest assured, there are no quasi-trap beats or forced duets or empowerment anthems like those that typify the radio-friendly unit shifters and mono-genre pop acts now flanking White Reaper on the Elektra website. Singles “Real Long Time” and “Might Be Right” are prime reasons the band considered Music For People Who Like Us as an album title. But there’s also none of the indulgences one could reasonably expect from a band that prophesied their own pill-popping, hotel-demolishing rock stardom two years ago—no string sections, no acoustic ballads. It’s actually their shortest album. White Reaper justify their anachronistic existence the same way they did on The World’s Best American Band: By proving that “rockism vs. poptimism” is a modern creation. Their harmonized guitars, spring-loaded rhythms, and snotty hooks are all referential of Van Halen and Cheap Trick, some of the most popular musicians going in the ’70s and ’80s. White Reaper’s desire to really get on that echelon rather than merely evoke its essence results in the one noticeable Elektra-funded upgrade: You Deserve Love is produced by Jay Joyce, a guy who’s worked with Eric Church, Thomas Rhett, and Little Big Town, but also Cage the Elephant and FIDLAR—straightforward guitar acts whose enduring popularity and total lack of critical favor confound assumptions about rock bands in the streaming era. While You Deserve Love is certainly slicker and more reliant on synths, it’s to the same degree that The World’s Best American Band was slicker and more synth-y than White Reaper Does It Again. More importantly, Tony Esposito continues to successfully walk the tightrope between dirtbag and douchebag, a guy who could easily be cast as a Linklater good ol’ boy with his own band soundtracking the latest well-meaning debauch. “I’ve brought too many drinks with me and a 10-ton bucket of gasoline,” he jokes on the bubbly dub verse of “Saturday.” He’s drunk on nearly every song, either out of spite or feelings of inadequacy or just a desire to escape. But the guys Esposito sings about would be better served by some audible evidence that they’re going against the grain. Whether sanding off the grit of The World’s Best American Band was Joyce or White Reaper or Elektra’s idea, it nonetheless makes You Deserve Love less worthy of Camaro-revving fantasies, even if these total non-gearheads lean into them on “1F.” Watch the videos for “Real Long Time” or “1F” and White Reaper are no longer a throwback to Thin Lizzy or Cheap Trick, but to another fertile era for pop-leaning guitar music: The one that bridged the gap between the New Rock Revolution and The O.C., when dudes in denim jackets with snappy songs about booze and girls were getting snapped up by majors by the dozens. Think of Elevator-era Hot Hot Heat, the Thrills, Tokyo Police Club, or Phantom Planet, bands who pumped out enjoyable singles to sizable fanbases without ever worrying what their success indicated about the future of rock. Pointing out the thematic similarity of “1F” to Rooney’s “I’m Shakin’” is only an issue if you deny that “I’m Shakin’” still slaps. This is how You Deserve Love can be a well-earned success while not feeling like a triumph, the way a filler-free major label debut should be for the rare band that outwardly aspires to it. While the title track of The World’s Best American Band was its only overtly conceptual song, the title itself created an unexpected emotional undercurrent for a band that prefers to be taken at face value. A modestly successful indie band from Louisville declares themselves as The Greatest before they knew they were: It’s wish fulfillment as transportative as any of the prog fantasies White Reaper’s idols put to tape. On You Deserve Love, the risk and rewards are lower: White Reaper aspire to be a very good American band.

AXIS,Bonnie Baxter,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da77d3a61708900098e3e93/1:1/w_160/axis.jpg,2019-10-22 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bonnie-baxter-axis/,Hausu Mountain,"For the last couple of years, Bonnie Baxter has been calling herself a mutant. That’s the term that she and her bandmates in the noise trio Kill Alters have come to prefer for their small community of weirdos in the New York underground. The scene—per one of its most fervent supporters—is “historically psycho,” vibrating with heavy, hyperactive music from artists like Deli Girls, Dreamcrusher, Machine Girl, and Channel 63, among a host of other like-minded freaks. Most of the artists exist on the borders between punk, noise, techno, and rap, but few, if any, belong squarely to any one tradition. Baxter’s music, both under her name and with Kill Alters, is close to the spiritual center of this scene. Over the last half decade, she’s masterminded a handful of hard-to-categorize tapes and dozens of Bandcamp releases, and her prolific output runs the gamut of contemporary DIY experimental sounds. Generally, the Kill Alters material is oozy and psychedelic, while her solo tracks largely hew closer to the dancefloor, offering bruising beats that might sound like techno if she wasn’t consistently destroying them with static and noise. Even in that context, AXIS, Baxter’s second solo album for Hausu Mountain, is wonderfully bizarre. More than half of its 12 tracks are less than two minutes long, but it’s packed with more experiments and in-jokes than most records twice its length. Even in the shortest songs, like the minute-long “GLOWNG TROLLS,” she layers tons of overlapping synth lines and rhythmic interchanges. For a second, it sort of sounds like Hausu Mountain co-founder Mukqs’ underwater electro experiments before collapsing into horror-score ambience and unsettling vocals that suggest a possessed Speak & Spell—and that’s all in just over a minute. Most of the tracks are constructed in this fast-paced, collagist way. It can feel a bit like some of the more surreal electronic music from the late 1990s, like Kid606’s unsettling glitch work or Aphex Twin and µ-Ziq’s Mike & Rich record, but Baxter doesn’t ever let things get too frantic or overwhelming. “SPIRIT ENEMA”—the record’s longest track, at nearly six minutes—transitions from Rephlex-ian acid to stuttery sample torture before settling into a breakdown in which Baxter sings, barely holding in a laugh, “I need some fucking help with my asshole/So please take me to the fucking doctor, thank you very very very much.” Another track, “NO DICC” consists almost entirely of ping-ponging drums and the lyric “I don’t want your dick!” That’s how things largely go: She builds otherworldly, unpredictable tracks, then undercuts off the wildest passages with prankish experiments and goofy jokes. AXIS is a demanding record. Not only do listeners have to have a taste for Baxter’s delirious instrumentals, they also have to swallow her confrontational sense of humor, the combined effect of which can feel, at moments, like Wolf Eyes playing behind a Tim and Eric sketch. But even the most seemingly off-putting moments—like when she starts believably retching at the end of “NO DICC”—feel weirdly infectious. She has a giddy enthusiasm for always making the strangest possible decision for where a song can go next. Each mutation is more exciting than the last.","The self-described “mutant” reps the New York underground at its freakiest on a fast-past, collage-heavy album of club rhythms, noise blasts, and unsettling humor.

Whether he’s tracking down a rare piece of vinyl for his voluminous record collection, wiring up an arcane modular synthesizer, or putting together the latest iteration of his audiovisual live show, there’s an attention to detail at work that’s practically unrivaled in electronic music. (Shepherd also managed to complete a PhD in neuroscience a few years back, so he’s clearly no slouch in his other endeavors, either.) The London producer exudes a nerdy yet winning enthusiasm, and each step in his decade-long career has felt carefully considered. Even his impeccable 2015 debut album, Elaenia, which surprised many people by skirting the dancefloor almost entirely, turned out to be a natural evolution of his sound and craft. Knowing this, it’s genuinely surprising that he created the latest Floating Points full-length, Crush, in only five weeks. The album was born in the aftermath of a 2017 tour opening for the xx. After touring Elaenia for a couple of years with a full live ensemble, Shepherd suddenly found himself alone onstage—in 20,000-capacity venues, no less—improvising with just a Roland drum machine and a Buchla synth. While he initially planned to keep things mellow, he quickly threw that plan out the window, choosing instead to embrace a more “chaotic” vibe and warm the crowd up with what he describes as “some of the most obtuse, strange, difficult music of my life.”  It was a risky choice, but the shows left Shepherd feeling invigorated, and he was determined to continue these focused machine experiments once he returned to the studio. Knowing that, you might expect Crush to be an intense, frenzied effort, but in Shepherd’s case, economy doesn’t preclude elegance. While certain elements—a distorted rhythm here, a shuddering synth there—can be traced back to those rough-and-tumble live shows with the xx, the LP as a whole is strikingly melodic and often beautiful, even in its most frantic moments. Take “Bias,” one of the LP’s strongest offerings: The track opens with subdued, almost pensive synth tendrils and brooding baritone, which intermingle and creep slowly skyward before a vibrant breakbeat sneaks in and eventually erupts, yanking the entire production onto the dancefloor. Crush is not hurting for club-ready material. “Last Bloom” is another dancefloor cut with a cinematic streak, with a swinging, slightly off-kilter drum pattern nodding to UK garage as the song’s jaunty melodies bubble along. You could be forgiven for mistaking it for the work of Four Tet or Caribou, two of Shepherd’s closest friends. There’s also no missing “LesAlpx,” the album’s soaring, proggy first single. The track has a lot in common with 2014’s “Nuits Sonores,” arguably Floating Points’ most forceful tune to date, although “LesAlpx” actually goes much harder, veering into proper techno territory as Shepherd layers an array of crunchy modular melodies and technicolor synth blooms atop its sturdily galloping rhythm. Shepherd has spoken often about his early clubbing experiences and their profound impact on his musical outlook, and Crush shows just how much his work carries on the legacy of London’s fertile club scene during the latter half of the 2000s. Those years saw early dubstep dancing alongside underground house, techno, garage, and a variety of leftfield rhythms, most notably in venues like Plastic People, which played host to all-night sessions from artists like Four Tet and Theo Parrish, along with groundbreaking dubstep nights like FWD>>. Experimentation and cross-pollination were paramount, and although this genre-melding moment was ultimately fleeting, it revitalized the UK scene and introduced a new generation of young producers, including Shepherd, whose initial flurry of releases began in 2009. While Crush isn’t an explicit homage to Plastic People (which sadly closed in early 2015), the album does embody the club’s open-minded, music-first spirit. Although the scene that birthed him has long since devolved, Shepherd—a jazz-loving, vinyl-hunting, ensemble-building, classically trained outsider who only occasionally makes what could be described as proper dance music—has nevertheless become a prominent torchbearer for the ideals of that crucial era in UK electronic music. Crush is something of a return to Floating Points’ more dancefloor-oriented material from the first half of this decade, particularly in comparison to Elaenia and 2017’s jammy, rock-influenced Reflections - Mojave Desert, but the LP is also a sonically diverse effort with extended forays into modular synthesis, baroque new age, hyperactive IDM, and more. The quieter passages are some of the album’s best. The stunning  “Falaise” opens the record with a simmering cauldron of trembling synths and strings, the sense of drama building as the music gradually swells into an orchestral crescendo. More delicate is “Sea-Watch,” a gentle sketch that sounds like a melancholy lullaby constructed with a lightly buzzing modular set-up. “Requiem for CS70 and Strings” is another symphonic gem, its combination of classical sensibilities and Buchla-generated new-age wanderlust recalling the magic of Suzanne Ciani’s first solo albums. Crush has its more experimental flourishes too, and it’s in these moments that you can best imagine Floating Points holed up in his studio, tinkering with his machines. The closing couplet of “Apoptose Pt. 1” and “Apoptose Pt. 2” is built atop a foundation of burbling Buchla rhythms, although Shepherd infuses both tracks with a twitchy energy that channels the percussive ping-pong of 1990s IDM. He takes things even further on “Anasickmodular,” where ethereal melodies and a sturdy garage beat are suddenly swept aside as the track disintegrates into a flurry of whirring synths and gnarled drum sounds. The element of chaos is something new for Floating Points, and while disorder may seem antithetical to his generally thoughtful approach, Crush offers proof that Shepherd has quickly learned to harness its noise and power. In a live setting, this material might have the potential to blossom into something unruly, but on the LP it comes across as more mischievous than deranged. Perhaps a little bit of mischief is exactly what Shepherd needed. An album like Elaenia may have impressively distilled Shepherd’s influences into a single, long-form statement, but it also took him five years to finish and largely sidelined his dancefloor impulses. Crush, on the other hand, provides a more complete picture of his artistic outlook, bringing his club sensibilities back into the mix while also feeling like the most relaxed and confident Floating Points effort to date. Shepherd will likely always be someone who dotes on the details, but this time around, he was smart enough to realize that the five weeks he’d spent on Crush were enough. He’d done all he needed to do, and more importantly, he was happy with the result. Sometimes, the most important decision is knowing when to stop.

Juice B Crypts,Battles,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d4acf42a10bea00085b7fef/1:1/w_160/Battles.jpg,2019-10-21 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/battles-juice-b-crypts/,Warp,"With their bracing debut single, Battles offered a new vision of indie rock. The quartet turned prog grandiosity, funk propulsion, and anarchic No Wave spirit into songs Rube Goldberg may have admired. With the vocals of early member Tyondai Braxton or the slew of subsequent guests, they suggested a sort of cyborg pop, as brawny as it was brainy. For a while there, Battles sounded like little else. But Battles have been perpetually beset by instability. Braxton quit after their colossal first LP, 2007’s Mirrored, leaving drummer John Stanier, multi-instrumentalist Ian Williams, and guitarist Dave Konopka to recruit multiple vocalists for 2011’s wild-eyed follow up Gloss Drop. They tried life as a frenetic instrumental trio on 2015’s La Di Da Di. Following Konopka’s departure in 2018, Stainer and Williams return to the Gloss Drop template for their fourth album, Juice B Crypts, gathering a diverse roster of singers to slip into the narrow spaces inside their meticulous instrumentals. Jon Anderson (yes, from Yes) splits the singing on “Sugar Foot” with fascinating Taiwanese band Prairie WWWW. Tune-Yards’ Merrill Garbus, meanwhile, sings on the final two-song suite, “Last Supper on Shasta.” Captivating tidbits rattle inside each of these 11 tracks, thrilling details that, when found, hit like syringes of adrenaline—the synths that seem to scream “Woo” when Shabazz Palaces’ Ishmael Butler finishes his verse on “IZM”; the pitch-shifted electronics that chase Xenia Rubinos like laser-guided missiles at the start of “They Played It Twice”; the West African guitar line that warps into a fractal midway through “Ambulance.” Amid the rubber-band snap of “Titanium Step,” the Pentecostal yelp of Liquid Liquid’s Sal Principato is a pure delight, flashing back to the Talking Heads and Battles’ own early work. But the more you listen, the more these intricacies suffocate inside arrangements too busy for their own good. The instrumental title track seems to ride a dozen merry-go-rounds at once. And the sounds around Garbus simply won’t let her do the work, breathlessly modulating in every direction and stranding her inside the chaos. Many of these songs feel like knots of ideas superficially strung together. “They Played It Twice” pivots between Rubinos’ electrifying lead and mutated breakbeats, but Battles never bother to make the ideas cohere. “IZM” hops from boom-bap thrust to astral krautrock projection, leaving Butler to repeat uncharacteristically pedestrian phrases, clutching them like guylines. Only “Fort Greene Park” shows restraint. Battles slowly build a single theme, sharing it between slicing guitars and spiraling electronics. Just before it spills into bedlam, they lasso it back, leaving something to the imagination. Juice B Crypts is anti-gestalt music, where incredible parts are subsumed by wholes that try to do too much. You’re left to wonder if Stanier and Williams feel they have to prove themselves again. Or perhaps they’re aware that the polyglot power that made their early work so powerful is almost passé now, as the lines between genres corrode. Either way, Juice B Crypts is an act of overcompensation from a duo trying to make too much happen with less.

There Existed an Addiction to Blood,clipping.,by: Stephen Kearse,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da0b5d3240253000865df37/1:1/w_160/thereexisted.jpg,2019-10-21 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/clipping-there-existed-an-addiction-to-blood/,Sub Pop,"Rap trio clipping. take pride in their commitment to ego death. When they formed they adopted two foundational rules—strict avoidance of first-person perspectives and the word nigga—just to make explicit that their music is not about them. Using found sounds, foley tricks, and imagined characters, rapper Daveed Diggs and producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes fabricated entire worlds. Following the space opera of 2016’s Splendor & Misery, which was actually nominated for a Hugo Award following a fan campaign, and the abstract improvisation of 2018’s Face EP, they channel horrorcore. Their third album is named after a lyric from the soundtrack of ’70s horror film Ganja & Hess, a surreal love story in which a vampiric black couple wrestles with their appetite for blood. The movie is lurid, mysterious, and tender, a combination that completely eludes clipping. Somehow, despite the gory source material, There Existed an Addiction to Blood is their most bloodless project to date. Their vision of horror is high-octane, high-concept, and fussy. Technically, there is a lot happening in their meticulous, densely referential songs. Across There Existed an Addiction to Blood there are shootouts, a ScHoolboy Q interpolation (Diggs uses Q’s flow from “What They Want” on “Nothing is Safe”)and a resurrected Bobby Hutton on “Blood of the Fang”—but every detail feels exhaustingly mechanical. As a vocalist, Diggs has the charisma of a metronome and the expressive range of a sock puppet. Performing in a stiff monotone, he exclusively raps fast or faster, enunciating words with crisp diction but never relishing them or giving them life. “And there may even be some meaning gleaming in the streets that they built/On top of dead bodies in the olden days when the pen was a quill,” he raps on “Intro.” “The best menage is a death menage, agree?/ Chest massage with electric rods for three,” he says on “The Show.” You can appreciate the internal rhymes and inversions, but his flow is so robotic it rarely feels like he appreciates them Snipes and Hutson are just as perfunctory. Their production style is informed by film scores and a range of genres, but their beats are dry and lifeless. “He Dead” is a dirge that dissolves into bland ambience. “Club Down,” presumably an ode to shut-the-party-down Memphis crunk, is built around an arid, prickly drone that wanes in and out of focus. Drumless and peppered with EFX, the beat is as vast and empty as an airlocked bunker. The sole outlier is “Blood of the Fang,” which works elements from Ganja & Hess into a throbbing romp that Diggs navigates nimbly. It's one of the rare moments where his flows feel loose and natural. In theory, the pulp and theater of horrorcore should fit clipping.'s skill set. Snipes has done extensive work as a composer for TV and film; Hutson has a background in experimental music, and Diggs is an actor and slam poet. Attention to atmosphere and cadence is essential to all their disciplines, and horrorcore has often drawn from the TV and movie horror canon. What sinks the record is its enduring sense of cosplay. Horrorcore is about terror as a mood and as a state of mind. When RZA mocks suicide, Tyler defiles corpses, or Lord Infamous summons demons, there’s a sense of alienation behind the provocation. The point of horrorcore is to both piss off church moms and find a language and vehicle for rage and misery. But there is no aching, tortured self at the center of clipping., just three fanboys’ overworked hearts palpitating into the abyss. While you can’t deny the imagination, you also can’t fathom the point.

Deborah,Sorry Girls,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da619e6f1323700083db74c/1:1/w_160/deborah.jpg,2019-10-21 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sorry-girls-deborah/,Arbutus,"On their 2016 self-released debut EP, Awesome Secrets, Montreal duo Sorry Girls sounded like they were putting together an audition tape for the Bang Bang Bar. Heather Foster Kirkpatrick’s glowing voice conjured the ghosts of bygone ’60s girl-group singers, while partner Dylan Konrad Obront doused her torch-song serenades in ripples of country-noir guitar and a Badalamentian synth mist as thick as mountain fog. Their first full-length for Arbutus, Deborah, is likewise a fusion of luminous, eerily familiar melodies and obfuscating ambience. But here, Sorry Girls are less interested in capturing a specific nocturnal mood than in exploring the Rorschach-test ambiguity inherent to much synth-based pop music: that is, what some might consider ethereal, post-goth dream pop, others hear as lush, adult-contemporary soft rock. Just as the passage of time has obliterated the rigid aesthetic divisions that once governed pop music and replaced them with genre-agnostic, era-specific radio formats, Deborah imagines an alternate ’80s where 4AD went MOR, and Cocteau Twins shared Top 40 chart space with the Thompson Twins. The album’s directorial analog is more John Hughes than David Lynch, displacing Awesome Secrets’ earthier elements and uncanny atmosphere with soft-focus pleasures and heart-on-sleeve poignancy. Pretty much every song begins in ambient haze before fortifying into the sort of passionate, heartstring-tugging address that could soundtrack a pivotal scene in a seriocomic teen flick. And in true cineaste fashion, Sorry Girls construct their musical mise-en-scènes with an auteur’s eye for detail: Anyone can program a synth to sound like a hit single from 35 years ago, but a true connoisseur of the era recognizes that glassy acoustic guitars (“Something’s Gotta Give”) and breezy harmonica solos (“Under Cover”) were equally crucial components of the ’80s pop palette. And yet, for all of Sorry Girls’ unapologetic invocations of the past, Deborah rarely feels like an exercise in nostalgia—because all its shimmering surfaces can’t gloss over the distress stewing underneath. Kirkpatrick’s voice is both highly expressive and enigmatic: It veers in and out definition like a camera that just won’t auto-focus, echoing the feelings of indecision at the core of these shapeshifting songs. For all its sunrise-summoning optimism, “Waking Up” is really a plea for escape from an unfulfilling relationship (“Maybe I’m waking up to see the ways that I’ve been blinded/By the love that’s in my eyes/I want to send it all crashing down”), while the tropical chillwave of “Easier” sails into the sunset of a tryst as the parties involved lie to each other that “it never meant anything” to soothe their pain. But Deborah counters these portraits of disaffection with vigorous statements of self-determination, like the vogueing piano-house bop “H.O.N.E.S.T.Y.” And with “Give You Love,” Sorry Girls deliver a synth-sparkled affirmation that plays like a spiritual sequel to Robyn’s “Show Me Love,” with Kirkpatrick declaring her intentions in no uncertain terms. “I’m ready to be the one you need, I’m ready to be someone,” she sings to her potential partner—though the bold pop leaps taken on Deborah suggests she’s courting a potentially larger audience, too.

Beauty and the Beat,The Go-Go’s,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dac7032383ae400085345d8/1:1/w_160/Go-Gos.jpg,2019-10-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-go-gos-beauty-and-the-beat/,IRS,"In 1982, the debut album from the Go-Go’s, Beauty and the Beat, went to No. 1, making the California band the first all-woman group to top the charts with songs they’d written and performed themselves. It was such a big hit that the Go-Go’s were constantly misnomered as the first successful female band, ever. While this conveniently ignored the achievements of their pioneering predecessors and contemporaries, there was some truth to the idea. Unlike the girl groups of the ’60s, the Go-Go’s operated without any men pulling the strings, without a Svengali figure as their shepherd. Their singles “We Got the Beat” and “Our Lips Are Sealed” were international successes, and the band’s faces were all over MTV and on the covers of People and Rolling Stone. It was a long way from where they’d started. As the Los Angeles punk scene emerged in the late 1970s, it was inclusive, diverse, and pioneered by marginalized voices. Bands like the Zeros and the Bags spearheaded a community that encouraged the freedom of self-expression and self-celebration. The scene centered largely around The Canterbury, a derelict, roach-infested apartment building where members of the future Go-Go’s lived. As one version of the story goes, outside a house party in Venice, bassist Margot Olavarria invited two girls to join a band she was starting with drummer Elisa Bello: guitarist Jane Wiedlin, a helium-voiced former glitter rocker known as Jane Drano who was studying fashion design, and vocalist Belinda Carlisle, a former high school cheerleader and Monkees fan-club member who was supposed to play drums in the Germs under the name Dottie Danger until she was sidelined by mono. (Subsequent tellings of the band’s mythology often ignore Olavarria’s contributions, but as Carlisle wrote in her memoir, “she lit the match that started the fire.”) The four novice musicians dubbed themselves the Misfits; they quickly renamed themselves the Go-Go’s. “Everyone we hung out with were all in a band and they weren’t any good,” Wiedlin later told Sounds. “So we figured if they could do it, why couldn’t we?” Inspired by the Buzzcocks’ pop-punk, they wore dresses made of garbage bags and wrote noisy, shambolic songs that celebrated BDSM, taunted music critics, satirized pretentious poseurs, and extolled the grimy hedonism of their digs. “I wanted to throw up on stage, rip my clothes off, and dye my hair,” Wiedlin told Flipside in 1979. Olavarria just wanted to “spit at Valley girls.” Down the street from The Canterbury was The Masque, a ramshackle, heavily graffitied DIY venue in the basement of a porn theater on Hollywood Boulevard where, in May 1978, the Go-Go’s played their first show. Missing at that debut gig was Charlotte Caffey, who they had invited to join as lead guitarist. Caffey, who had previously played bass in the L.A. punk group the Eyes, had never played lead before. Yet her presence in the band was transformative, and not just because, as the band often joked, she was the only one who knew how to plug a guitar into an amplifier. Caffey brought in a pop sensibility, and she and Wiedlin quickly became a writing team; as the Go-Go’s became more technically proficient, their music evolved from punk to pop. “One must admit that the wildly amateurish musical approach of their early days has been replaced by a very competent barrage of near melodic tunes and singing,” one Slash magazine critic noted in May 1979. In the summer of 1979, Bello was replaced by Gina Schock, a recent transplant from Baltimore. Of the five, Schock had the most experience on her instrument and, sensing the band’s potential, she imposed a tighter rehearsal schedule and work ethic. And so the Go-Go’s began their slow transition away from “a serious joke” to simply serious. In 1980, while overseas on tour, the band released a demo for the UK punk label Stiff, led by a rough and tumble version of “We Got the Beat.” Composed quickly by Caffey on New Year’s Day 1980 while “listening to Motown songs, watching a Twilight Zone marathon, and getting high on a cocktail of stuff,” the band’s first hit is a two-minute ode to lighthearted bliss driven by a supercharged, Duracell Bunny rhythm section. Though the song failed to take off in Britain, it was big enough back home in California that their audience began to expand beyond the L.A. punk crowd. In December, facing a competing vision for the band and a nasty case of Hepatitis A, founding bassist Olavarria was replaced by Kathy Valentine, who had been playing guitar professionally since she was a teenager in Texas. With a series of sold-out shows at famed Sunset Strip rock club the Whiskey a Go Go looming, Valentine buckled down and learned the bass in four days. As the L.A. punk scene gravitated toward the hardcore sounds of Black Flag, the Go-Go’s were moving in the opposite direction. Still, the group struggled to find a label. “The one thing I was greeted with without exception from every [record] company was ‘Oh, it’s an all-girl band,’” the band’s manager Ginger Canzoneri later explained. “‘Fanny didn’t make it, the Runaways didn’t make it, therefore girl bands don’t make it.’” Neither of these bands were failures by any definition: Fanny wrote their own songs and were the first all-female band to release a rock album on a major label; teenage rockers the Runaways also wrote and performed their own songs while challenging the confines of girl-group sexuality. Though both bands carved out space for the Go-Go’s to thrive, their successes were defined by a system outside of their creation, a system never intended to empower them. On April 1, 1981, after countless rejections, the Go-Go’s finally signed with I.R.S., a small label that was home to the Cramps and the Buzzcocks. I.R.S. wasn’t their top choice, but its willingness to take a risk on the band was meaningful in the face of pervasive sexist prejudice they’d faced elsewhere. “The other record companies could only see that we were girls; they could never get past that point,” explained Wiedlin in a 1981 issue of Trouser Press. “It was either that we were girls so they didn’t want to take a chance, or we were girls and they wanted to capitalize on that.” Soon after, the Go-Go’s headed to New York City to record their debut, Beauty and the Beat, with producer Richard Gottehrer, a former Brill Building songwriter who co-wrote and produced the Angels’ hit “My Boyfriend’s Back” and later produced Blondie’s 1976 self-titled debut and Richard Hell & the Voidoids’ Blank Generation. The record’s two singles, a polished version of “We Got the Beat” and “Our Lips Are Sealed,” fit neatly into Gottehrer’s résumé of pop perfection. The latter, based on a love letter Wiedlin received from the Specials’ Terry Hall, with whom she was having an affair, encourages optimism amid rumblings of hurtful rumors. “Can you hear them/They talk about us/Telling lies/Well, that’s no surprise,” Carlisle sings, brushing off gossip with the relentless pep of a trained cheerleader. The easygoing pleasure of these two singles is embodied in Beauty and the Beat’s cover. With a washed-out Jacuzzi color palette, it shows the five bandmates posed in towels, terrycloth turbans, and face masks, while on the back cover, individual members lounged in a bathtub pouring champagne, eating chocolates, and reading pulp novels. It was a far cry from the band’s grimy roots; many critics interpreted the girly photos as proof that the Go-Go’s had lost all punk credibility. (In reality, the shoot wasn’t so posh: The group had to return the towels to Macy’s in order to afford food and the Mr. Bubble gave them infections.) Though it was a far cry from The Canterbury, Beauty and the Beat is about what’s underneath the surface of pop music. Rather than relishing the California sunshine, the Go-Go’s evoke their Los Angeles, a glittery, gritty place where punks rule the streets after dark. “Tonite” captures the exhilaration of cruising down Hollywood Boulevard, where the band “get dressed up/And messed up/Blow our cares away.” “This Town” digs deeper into the city’s scuzzy glamour. “We’re all dreamers, we’re all whores/Discarded stars, like worn-out cars,” Carlisle snarls before Valentine rips a gigantic guitar solo. “Bet you’d live here if you could/And be one of us,” she taunts, offering a thrilling taste of their freedom. While their attitude might be cooler-than-thou, the Go-Go’s offer an unabashedly sincere window into their hearts. On “Lust to Love,” Carlisle plunges into her vulnerabilities to chronicle the transformation from casual flirt to lovesick prisoner. Later, on “Fading Fast,” love’s spell breaks after one too many lies. As her bandmates cushion her devastation with mournful harmonies, Carlisle holds the pieces of her heart in her hands and looks forward with herculean resolve. Beauty and the Beat concludes with a chipper mantra: “Can’t stop the world/Don’t let it stop you.” Originally written by Valentine for her band the Textones, the song is not so much about blithe optimism as it is understanding your own potential, a reminder of the determination that fueled the band’s creation. The Go-Go’s later claimed that the first time they heard Beauty and the Beat, huddled together in a car, they wept. “In the studio, we had thought we were making a great punk album,” wrote Carlisle in her memoir. “On hearing the final version, it sounded more pop than we had anticipated.” Here, they worried, was the final proof the Go-Go’s had entirely traded their punk roots for mainstream popularity. But once Beauty and the Beat was released in July 1981, many critics felt differently, calling it a record that “those of you who were embarrassed by pop music can use to say that pop’s okay.” The band quickly changed their tune. One month after Beauty and the Beat was released, MTV began broadcasting. The new channel helped catapult the Go-Go’s toward superstardom. In the video for “Our Lips Are Sealed,” the band drives through Beverly Hills in a convertible, their trademark garbage bags replaced by colorful summer dresses. Dubbed “America’s Sweethearts,” the Go-Go’s were considered “safe, wholesome, and proudly commercial.” Beauty and the Beat hit No. 1, they were nominated for a Grammy, and they opened for the Police on a massive stadium tour. But the trappings of mainstream success did not shield the Go-Go’s from the sexism of the male-centric music industry. “It sounds like a joyous, bubbling celebration by five cute girls, with no thought inside their darling little heads save for tonight’s beach party,” griped NME’s review of Beauty and the Beat. “If this was an album by five guys from the USA it’d be hacked to bits by the critics,” said Sounds. Interviews and reviews focused on the band’s love lives, outfits, and novelty; when Annie Liebowitz photographed them in their underwear for their first Rolling Stone cover, the photo ran beneath the headline “Go-Go’s Put Out.” The band was well aware of their sugar-coated image (Wieldlin once compared the band to Twinkies) but privately rebelled against it. They partied relentlessly, while Carlisle and Caffey struggled with cocaine and heroin addictions, respectively; rumors spread of pranks that involved harassing their tour manager with explicit Polaroids and an alleged sex tape. This dark underbelly of an outwardly bubbly band feels indicative of the contradictions that lurked around the band. While the Go-Go’s achieved unprecedented chart success, there was a cost to this insurrection, one that brings up complicated issues of identity, integrity, and the blurring of genre lines—topics still fully relevant today. Would the Go-Go’s have become so popular if they retained the punk spirit of their early days? Probably not. But was there a way for them to retain this essence and still be successful? Yes, and to an extent, they did. The Go-Go’s wrote and performed their own songs, songs about independence and desire and control. They shifted a paradigm and inspired a new generation of women—from the Bangles to Hole to Bikini Kill to Sleater-Kinney—to make noise on their own terms. The Go-Go’s never hid from where they came from, and they never apologized for where it took them.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

Vagabon,Vagabon,by: Ann-Derrick Gaillot,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da0f563163e3300096f69aa/1:1/w_160/vagabon.jpg,2019-10-19 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/vagabon-vagabon/,Nonesuch,"In crafting her self-titled sophomore album, Laetitia Tamko (aka Vagabon) was hyper-cognizant of how the context around her had changed. The unexpected success of her 2017 debut Infinite Worlds meant more resources at her fingertips, but also heightened scrutiny from a public that so often defaults to consuming black women as prophets of oppression and pain. “I was growing really weary of black sadness and seeing how it’s consumed,” the Cameroon-born artist said earlier this year. “I don’t want to romanticize being tortured.” she told Pitchfork. Inevitably, Tamko was folded into the ongoing conversation about the scarcity of visible black women in indie rock—the only world she has known as a practicing musician, having emerged in New York City alongside artists like Frankie Cosmos. She could have dug her heels deeper into the sound that first won her acclaim, but Vagabon is instead a bracing departure, wielding digital sounds and strings alongside her familiar, delicate guitar in search of wider worlds. Tamko produced the album herself and played most of it, and you notice immediately that her voice is subtly foregrounded. The beckoning whisper of Infinite Worlds has become rounder and more confident. This new boldness is matched by her production, which toggles between small-room intimacy and cathedral-sized grandeur. Tamko plays with all kinds of new palettes here, showing impressive mastery over them. On “Flood” and “Water Me Down,” she subsumes the bombast of ’80s and ’90s new wave into her quietly insightful writing. The heartbreaking “In A Bind” combines her tiptoeing acoustic guitar with a gospel choir and new age, “Orinoco Flow”-esque synth tones. Throughout most of Vagabon, Tamko is not shouting to a crowd, but addressing one specific “you,” reassuring them of her love, pleading for them to stay, questioning their permanence, all in service of her own self-determinism. “I belong to no one/You tried hard to be mine/I won’t ask permission from you/We reserve the right to be full when we’re on our own,” she sings on “Every Woman.” Tamko’s adventurousness is admirable, both lyrically and sonically, but occasionally the intimacy of her writing is overwhelmed by her surroundings. The layered arrangement of “Please Don’t Leave the Table” feels muddled, which obscures the simple, evocative chorus: “Please don’t leave the table I’m still eating.” It’s a rare misstep on an album that otherwise uses restraint to its advantage. With its opening and closing tracks, Vagabon forms a sort of self-comforting loop. “Full Moon in Gemini (Monako Reprise)” takes the album’s opening track and tones it an octave down, turning the song from bright and hopeful to easy and accepting. The closed circle feels like a protective gesture, an act of will, a way to book-end her growth and frame it on her terms.  With that transformation, Vagabon concludes as a work of not only personal self-discovery, but evolution in real time.

Use Hearing Protection: Factory Records 1978-79,Various Artists,by: Robert Ham,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9f99dc240253000865de40/1:1/w_160/usehearingprotection.jpg,2019-10-19 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-use-hearing-protection-factory-records-1978-79/,Factory,"“I don’t want to rock the boat, I wanna fucking sink it.” This unofficial motto of Factory Records appeared in an early catalog for the label, typewritten just below their address on Palatine Road in Manchester and just to the right of designer Peter Saville’s now-iconic logo: an image of a man plugging his ears with his index fingers, rendered in blurry triplicate to give the impression that he’s vibrating. It was a prescient statement for Factory, considering the poor business decisions that its owners made throughout the label’s 14-year run, moves that ended up torpedoing the whole business in 1992. But in 1979, when the maxim was printed atop a list of the first 10 “releases” (not all of them recordings) that the imprint’s founders Tony Wilson, Alan Erasmus, Rob Gretton, and Martin Hannett had given a catalog number to, it was the perfect youthful rallying cry: the kind of slogan you’d find carved into the runout groove of a 45 packaged in a hand-folded, hand-stapled sleeve, released by one of the dozens of tiny DIY labels that cropped up in the wake of UK punk. The four men who started Factory were inspired by the explosion of young, hungry artists in their home country, particularly the Sex Pistols, whose snarling 1976 performance at Manchester’s Lesser Free Trade Hall famously lit a fire in the bellies of a number of future legends in attendance. But while the music Factory presented to the world early on was often raw and unformed, the label gave it all a far more professional sheen through Saville’s stunning, minimalist design work. Even if the art offered little indication of what the music might sound like, whether at the concerts they booked in 1978-79 at the Russell Club or on the first batch of records they released, the stark show posters and cover art still have an undeniable allure. (Just ask anyone who has repurposed the sleeve art of Joy Division’s Unknown Pleasures for a t-shirt design in recent years.) The new box set Use Hearing Protection: Factory Records 1978-79 has a similarly unconventional appeal. Its hulking size and spare, bright yellow design, featuring the same ear-plugging logo from their catalog, give no indication of what’s inside, but practically beg shoppers to handle it. What does lie within are recreations of the first 10 numbered items in the Factory catalog, including their first four vinyl releases, a DVD of a Joy Division-soundtracked film titled No City Fun (aka The Factory Flick), and various ephemera: concert posters, stationery, and, of all things, artist Linder Sterling’s rough sketches for a wooden abacus to track a woman’s menstrual cycle. Along with a book featuring photos from the era and an oral history of each item within, this beautifully designed package neatly reflects the way Factory combined the slapdash, try-anything approach of the times with careful curation and thoughtfully designed aesthetic. The Factory nights that Wilson et al booked at the Russell Club were proof of this. Saville’s poster announcing the first batch of shows was instantly eye catching; its precise industrial design looking more like a warning poster found near a building site. The concerts being promoted were the opposite, promising odd pairings like the itchy dub-inspired sounds of the Durutti Column with the winking pub rock of Jilted John (aka comedian Graham Fellows) or Pete Shelley’s loose experimental project the Tiller Boys with the tightly wound attack of Joy Division. This approach extended to A Factory Sample, the double 7"" that was the first Factory Records release. Three sides of the records were taken up by artists who were Russell Club regulars. Joy Division offered up two tracks (“Digital” and “Glass”) that proved to be the transition between the agitation of their Warsaw days and the more ruminative sound of their debut full-length. Though signed to Rough Trade, early industrial trio Cabaret Voltaire lent a pair of tunes to Factory (the atmospheric “Baader Meinhof” and the Joe Meek-meets-Scientist blurt “Sex in Secret”) that codified their unsettling methodology. The Durutti Column’s tracks, meanwhile, are the only studio document of the project’s early lineup, which generated a blur of sprechgesang vocals, wobbly rhythms, and processed guitar. Rounding it out was a true outlier: comedian John Dowie. His goofball pub rock odes to “Acne” and “Hitler’s Liver” feel entirely out of place next to such artful music and inside Saville’s austere silver sleeves. As author Mick Middles put it in his book Factory: The Story of the Record Label, it turned the record from “a base from which a new label would evolve” into “a simple hotch-potch.” Not that it felt so at the time of A Factory Sample’s release in January 1979. The initial run of 1,000 copies sold out quickly, necessitating a quick repressing of 4,000, and apparently four months’ worth of assembling each copy by hand. Those were all snapped up as well. The folks at the label didn’t allow themselves any time to bask in the glow of this early success, as they were already pushing two other singles into the world—the debut 7""s from A Certain Ratio and Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark (OMD)—and facilitating the sessions that would yield Unknown Pleasures (from which the makers of No City Fun would pluck three songs to soundtrack their Super 8 footage of Manchester street life). All would be on the shelves by mid-1979. The level of activity that Factory Records kept up in its earliest years set a template for the label up until its demise in the early 1990s. Wilson and his cohort barreled forward blindly, making snap decisions that would wind up biting them in the end. The label was forced to file for bankruptcy after their failed attempts to sell off their most lucrative assets—the catalogs of Joy Division and New Order—to another label. The problem was that, per a rough contract they signed early on, the bands owned the rights to their music. What Factory had going for it, especially in those early days, was a sharp ear for talent. A Certain Ratio, a band managed by Wilson, were months away from finding the funk/soul sound that turned them into a vital influence for LCD Soundsystem and the Rapture, but their first recorded material was an intoxicating blast of massive bass attack and granulating guitar rhythms. OMD, on the other hand, stood well outside the moody, postmodern sounds of everything else Factory had put a number to that point. In fact, according to the notes accompanying this set, Wilson hated the music and only agreed to release it at the urging of his wife, Lindsay Reade, to help push them to a major label. OMD’s sole Factory single does find sonic connection to the rest of the label’s output via Martin Hannett’s production, which bathed the Kraftwerk tribute “Electricity” and the tart, Human League-like flipside “Almost” in gooey layers of reverb and delay. And, of course, there was Joy Division, the label’s then-crown jewel signing. With Hannett at the helm, they set a new template for post-punk with Unknown Pleasures. The producer recorded their taut, rhythm-heavy compositions over the course of two weekends and then spent another weekend mixing the tracks and turning them into atmospheric harbingers of mental and emotional decay. Where Joy Division’s live performances had been sweaty, blunt-edged affairs, Hannett made the music feel like getting slowly squeezed between two rubber mats. Like that album, nearly all the musical material found within Use Hearing Protection has been reissued in some form or other in the 40 years since its initial release. Their repressing may seem unnecessary to some, but the work that curator James Nice and designer Howard Wakefield put into the details of this set render it exceptionally appealing. The sleeves of Unknown Pleasures and OMD’s single are in their original textured form, and the Factory posters are big and suitable for framing. Some rarities are also included, including a double-CD set featuring an interview with Joy Division, Wilson, and Gretton, and a 12"" white-label single of a proposed release by the Tiller Boys. Neither are necessarily essential listening (the interview is upended by the clatter of crockery and the sounds of the men eating), but they’re nice to have in physical form. Factory Records and its various keepers sprinted ahead for the next 12 years, landing a few huge hits (“Blue Monday,” Pills ’n’ Thrills ’n’ Bellyaches) and many more middling releases as they went. (For a more complete picture, check out the other commemorative boxed set being released next month, Factory Records: Communications 1978-1992.) But for the brief window captured for posterity in Use Hearing Protection, the energy and promise of what Wilson and his friends felt in those vibrant days of the late ’70s radiates from every inch of this set.","A new box set of the legendary post-punk label’s first two years gathers chestnuts from Joy Division and the Durutti Column alongside rarities, oddities, dead ends, and some stunning graphic design.

Lasakaneku / Tomo,Slikback,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da9f6bb383ae40008534433/1:1/w_160/slikback_LasakanekuTomo.jpg,2019-10-19 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/slikback-lasakaneku-tomo/,Hakuna Kulala,"The first thing I heard about Slikback, a year ago, was his prolificacy. A friend, an events promoter, returned from Uganda’s Nyege Nyege festival raving about the young talent who had wowed audiences at multiple performances during the four-day festival, shaking jungle foliage along the banks of the Nile with his unique blend of global bass music and regional African rhythms. Not long after, he performed a similar trick at Poland’s Unsound festival. In the scant 18 months that Slikback, aka Fredrick Mwauru Njau, had been making music, he had reportedly completed hundreds of tracks, the majority of them never heard outside of his live sets or his studio. The first five arrived in June 2018 on Hakuna Kulala, a sub-label of Nyege Nyege Tapes; the next six followed in February. Now, both of those digital-only EPs have been fleshed out with three new tracks and repackaged as a 2x12"" vinyl (or digital) release, making for an opportune moment to catch up with one of East Africa’s most exciting electronic musicians. Where many of the acts on the Nyege Nyege Tapes label work in accordance with specific regional styles—like Otim Alpha’s electro acholi, or the Tanzanian singeli of Bamba Pana, Jay Mitta, Duke, and Sisso—Slikback occupies his own switchbacking lane. The tempos are all over the place, from the slow-motion dembow snap of “Just I” to the 175-BPM assault of “Venom”; a few tracks, like “Bantu Zen” and “Shell,” ride syncopated pulses not too far from late-’00s dubstep. But the tempos of Slikback’s tracks are often a question of perception: “Acid,” which opens the album, starts off torpid, with sludgy 808s punctuated by staccato vocal chops, but a double-time groove soon takes over, flipping a sloth-like creep into a full-on headbang. The same thing happens on “Gemini,” as drawn-out digital death gurgles spin into a rolling footwork rhythm. In place of melody, Njau tends to concentrate on texture and tone color, and those harsh, brittle timbres might be the most distinctive thing about Silkback’s music. Aside from the occasional nod to the TR-808 drum machine, most of his sounds are resolutely synthetic and wrenched apart from any obvious source. A see-sawing riff in “Venom” might be bowed strings or a weeping alien; the main feature of “Rage” is wave after wave of thundering digital feedback, amplified to a speaker-destroying volume. Plenty of contemporary club music—particularly of the “deconstructed” variety—favors this kind of crashing, concussive palette, but little of it displays the rhythmic dexterity that Slickback does. Njau had little guidance when he began producing his music, but a stint working at Nyege Nyege’s Kampala studios changed that: There, Nyege Nyege founders Derek Debru and Arlen Dilsizian introduced him to producers like Jlin and Errorsmith, along with labels like PAN and Planet Mu. After that, Njau told The Quietus, “I began to learn how to let go of what I thought music should sound like.” What he’s come up with so far bears trace elements of those influences, along with bits of grime, trap, drum’n’bass, and singeli; in places, his music has affinities with South African gqom and the spirit, if not the specific sonic tropes, of Afro-Portuguese batida. But mainly it sounds placeless and otherworldly—music from everywhere and nowhere at once. The new tracks here—“Shell,” “Kite,” and “Senshi”—are self-evident standouts that refuse to slot into a predictable pattern. “Kite” is apocalyptic trap; “Shell” could be mistaken for a Livity Sound or Timedance single; and “Senshi,” the heaviest of the bunch, might be a footwork remix of Ben Frost. Shortly before Lasakaneku / Tomo dropped, Hakuna Kulala and Shanghai’s SVBKVLT label jointly released a pair of new Slikback EPs, Slip A and Slip B, far more extreme than anything he’d done previously. Some of that might come down to newfound collaborators like Yen Tech and 33EMYBW, both figures from China’s avant-club underground; mostly, though, chalk it up to Njau’s rapidly expanding vision and chops. Just a little over a year ago, Slikback seemed to appear out of nowhere; now, with his staggeringly original productions—by turns forbidding, malevolent, and scarily disciplined—he’s leading all of us into the unknown.","The Kenyan producer occupies his own switchbacking lane, blending global bass music and regional African rhythms with bits of grime, trap, and drum’n’bass.

Pang,Caroline Polachek,by: Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dab2245515e4800080952a6/1:1/w_160/PANG_Full%20(1).png,2019-10-18 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/caroline-polachek-pang/,Perpetual Novice,"Caroline Polachek named her album Pang after the bursts of adrenaline that jolted her out of sleep. She describes this as an internal thing, the sudden shock of emotion that “pricks you emotionally from the inside.” But it’s corporeal, too; you can’t say the word “pang”—or sing it, as Polachek does on the title track—without a quick release of breath, somewhere between a gasp and a sigh. Pang is Polachek’s first album under her own name (she released 2014’s Arcadia as Ramona Lisa, and 2017’s Drawing the Target Around the Arrow as her initials, CEP) and perhaps not coincidentally, this album centers on her vocals. The music doesn’t depart too far from her work in Chairlift: a little Tango in the Night sophistipop, a little ambient, and a little from the charts. Her usual lyrical themes recur: living unexpected dreams, getting away with something sneaky-fun, tears in public and in oceans. There’s also that familiar tension between the anonymity of the city and the pastoral, even suburban; on “Parachute,” Polachek sings about love as a force pulling her “back to strip malls, highways, and treetops.” The scope of Pang, however, is wider. She produced much of the album with PC Music’s Danny L Harle, and massively tones down his fripperies. At times, there’s a new age or modern classical tinge to the arrangements. Sometimes Pang sounds so sweeping it’s almost symphonic; the first few notes of “The Gate” almost sound like a synthetic orchestra tuning up. It’s a PR cliché to tout artists’ “classical training,” which can mean anything from actual classical training to a semester of voice lessons in college, but in her work, you genuinely can hear it. She’s mentioned writing melodies as wordless stretches of singing—she calls it “applesaucing.” For most of the decade, she’s taken classical voice lessons, specifically in baroque singing. This comes out not just in the soaring, near-operatic vocalizations throughout Pang, but in the crisp way she attacks words and syllables, the controlled vocal leaps, and precise staccato. Even more specifically, Polachek took up opera lessons after hearing the version of Handel’s “Lascia ch’io pianga” in Lars von Trier’s Antichrist. The non-traditional recording perhaps inspired her to use her training to non-traditional ends. Melodies that are heavily vocoded or Auto-Tuned often sound a little like a machine-made baroque run. As Polachek put it, “the voice just becomes the ultimate analog synth,” and it’s an effect she goes for a lot: the ornamentation throughout “Insomnia” and “Hey Big Eyes,” the digitally augmented glissando on the “Ocean of Tears” chorus, or the tumble of a vocal run, almost like a guitar solo, from the bridge of “So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings.” The influence also filters into the instrumental at times, most clearly the harpsichord-esque notes that underpin “Hey Big Eyes.” Pang is such a coherent musical statement that when something doesn’t fit, it stands out. Polachek restructured the album somewhat late, swapping out five songs; what’s left is a sweeping, delicately latticed album with a few odd pop songs. They’re not bad pop songs. “New Normal” matches quick-cut lyrical scenes with a chameleonic arrangement: Polachek’s melody is yanked between two keys, and the instrumental goes from a conspicuously yeehaw opening of slide guitar to an almost dancehall beat to sputtering percussion and vocal clips from hip-hop. Somehow, it all works, but it belongs to an entirely different record. The Andrew Wyatt co-write “Hit Me Where It Hurts” feels like it was intended for Charli XCX—the low, throaty, near-spoken verses are drastically unlike Polachek’s vocal arrangements throughout Pang, but very much something Charli might handle. What those five new songs—“The Gate,” “Pang,” “Ocean of Tears,” “Caroline Shut Up,” and “So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings”—do have in common is that they’re all love songs about the moment of surrender, the pain preceding it, and the euphoria after. These are something Polachek’s said she’s hesitant to write. Whether this is true—after all, this is the singer of “I Belong In Your Arms” and “Crying in Public,” two of the decade’s most unabashed love songs—one still detects a certain wryness on Pang. “Caroline Shut Up” is the record’s most swooning track, a waltz-tempo love ballad. The title is what she shouts at herself, an exasperated reminder to stop overthinking lest she ruin the moment. She gets punchy and self-mocking in “So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings.” The arrangement is ’80s, somewhere between “Every Breath You Take” and “Everywhere,” but the scene is ’10s: crying in public over the Snaps you’re getting from your long-distance partner, culminating in the goofy-horny “show me the banana.” The chorus is punctuated, louder each time, with a gasp: the sound of a crush so sudden you feel like running out of the room, or bursting into a grin and never stopping. After all, laughter is a pang too.","The former Chairlift singer-songwriter centers her sweeping solo debut on her powerful voice, crafting love songs about the moment of surrender, the pain preceding it, and the euphoria after.

Heavy Lifter,Hovvdy,by: Peyton Thomas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da4920bec15310008ce7a5b/1:1/w_160/hovvdy_heavylifter.jpg,2019-10-18 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hovvdy-heavy-lifter/,Double Double Whammy,"Heavy Lifter, the third album by Austin “pillow core” project Hovvdy, is a frothy Y.A. bildungsroman of a record, suspended in the moment between first discovery of love and first brush with heartbreak. Will Taylor and Charlie Martin dig through the detritus of youth with frank empathy for the people they used to be. They sing of leaving a small town and “moving to the coast” as though it’s the solution to their problems, and not another problem waiting to happen. They sing to a “friend” they’d clearly like to be more than a friend. They sound, in short, as though they don’t know what they’re in for. The best songs on Heavy Lifter are like dispatches from a cracking cocoon. “Cathedral,” the record’s lead single and best song, finds emancipating joy in the realization that it is “brighter than before, outside” of a repressive church. The song begins in a pew, bent into a posture of prayer; it ends with the cathedral’s doors flung open. Vowing on the chorus to “never come back here” and instead “stay with our friends,” Taylor and Martin repeat the words in a kind of ecstatic chant. “Feel Tall” makes literal the personal growth that first love can inspire: “Any little thing you want, any little thing at all/Want to make you feel tall.” On “Watergun,” expressions of devotion tilt from the naive proclamations of a little kid toward a newfound, grown-up understanding of love as an act of service. A promise to “gladly dry the dishes” lands with exceptional poignancy. What distinguishes this record from any number of other nostalgic indie-pop ruminations on suburban teenhood is the sparkling optimism Hovvdy carry with them. They don’t long to escape, but to accept the good with the bad. Hopeful energy thrums through cuts like “Keep It Up” and “Mr. Lee,” which mine mundanity for joy. The album is not without grey moments of post-adolescent malaise—particularly the devastating “Pixie”—but Hovvdy veer away from self-destruction, instead homing in on connection and intimacy. These songs are grand, inviting backdrops against which the listener can set any number of paper dolls. This is the record’s greatest strength, and also where it stumbles. Hovvdy remind me of many artists I’ve loved, especially the underappreciated folk-pop savants Page France. But with the exception of a few skittering, programmed drums, they don’t innovate on the sound of last decade’s indie pop as much as imitate it. The lack of specificity in their songwriting means that they never quite eclipse their influences. The world they depict is always a bit blurry, like someone’s smeared Vaseline on the lens; any two people in small-town North America could occupy the vague starring roles. This shyness makes a certain amount of sense, given the youth and inexperience at the heart of the album’s story. But the real gut punch arrives at the record’s end, in the final verse of “Sudbury.” As the singer dreams of graduating from “front yard catch” to the Texas Rangers, he recites the street address of a childhood home. That house, and the patch of yellow-green grass that made sports stardom feel possible, couldn’t belong to anyone else. Taylor and Martin are at their finest here, trading the ubiquitous for the unique, declaring who they were and who they wished to be.

No Holiday,The Muffs,by: Dayna Evans,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da636affd8a1f0009ad502e/1:1/w_160/noholiday.jpg,2019-10-18 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-muffs-no-holiday/,Omnivore,"Kim Shattuck started the Muffs in the early ’90s as a reaction to the self-serious West Coast alternative music scene blowing up around her. “I was getting really bummed,” she remembered years later. “Stuff like the Red Hot Chili Peppers were happening and I was like, ‘I fucking hate them so much, I have to write the anti-Red Hot Chili Peppers songs.’” So she did, burying shards of Beatles and Kinks melodies in sneering three-chord punk ditties. Once she started, she never stopped. The Muffs signed to Warner Bros. for their first three records, but despite Shattuck’s sticky melodies and instantly recognizable sing-scream, success on the level of California contemporaries Green Day and the Offspring eluded them. Their biggest mainstream moment remains their disaffected cover of Kim Wilde’s “Kids in America”—it plays during the opening credits of Clueless. (Shattuck hated that, too. “The lyrics are not good. Like, they talk about East California. What is that?” she told TIME in 2015.) Shattuck seemed to know her band wasn’t cut out for the big time, and was unfazed: “[Our label has] this job to break our band,” she told Rolling Stone in 1995. “And I totally feel sorry for them because it’s not going to happen.” Instead, the Muffs attained a cult status that grew steadily over the years. By the time Shattuck briefly joined the reunited Pixies—and was subsequently kicked out, possibly for being too extroverted—there was hardly a punk songwriter alive who hadn’t been touched by her throat-shredding screams, lively melodies, and bratty, tender songwriting. So when, two weeks before the release of their seventh album No Holiday, Shattuck’s husband of 16 years shared that Shattuck had died of ALS, the world briefly stopped. Shattuck had never publicly talked about her diagnosis, so her passing came as a devastating shock. An outpouring of grief came from her contemporaries and those she’d inspired. The forthcoming record suddenly took on new meaning: This would be the final time we’d ever get to hear Shattuck’s wail. The songs on No Holiday were written throughout Shattuck’s career, from 1991 to 2017, so it feels like a best-of record, or a retrospective. “We wanted to create something lasting and special,” drummer Roy McDonald said of No Holiday. If a young person hadn’t heard of the Muffs, it would be a safe bet to hand them this record and say “start here.” Shattuck’s voice feels raspier and more raw on some of the album’s 18 tracks, a little less energetic, but the musical chemistry between her, McDonald, and bassist Ronnie Barnett remains untouched by time. At the end of “Lucky Charm,” her voice twinges upward with distinctive snideness: “You should be in the mooo-vieesss, yeeeeah.” It’s good to have her back. On a few songs, it feels as if the full band has been retrofitted onto Shattuck’s acoustic demos. That mix-and-match sound is an interesting but confusing choice: Some of those songs, like “Happier Just Being With You” and “Too Awake,” would have sounded just fine with just Shattuck’s voice and acoustic guitar. The full band makes it harder to hear her, which is—now more than ever—what listeners want most. The most unexpected moment on No Holiday comes in its final track, “Sky.” In contrast to nearly 30 years of sneering, eye-rolling, screeching, and fighting back, on “Sky” Shattuck offers earnest lullaby over just an acoustic guitar and a church organ. “I am laying on the nice cool grass and now I’m thinking/Wondering if the birds can fly straight up and there’s no ceiling,” she sings, tenderly. “I know I can’t touch the sky/I know I’ll wonder why.” “Sky” is a tragically perfect way to close out what is now the Muffs’ final record. Shattuck will be remembered for many things: her outsized-but-undersung contribution to the punk lexicon, her lyrics that were mean and sarcastic and sensitive and sweet, all at once. But “Sky” is a poignant reminder that she was an unforgettable songwriter and a buoyant spirit.

Screamer,Third Eye Blind,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da4b416f7f3080008943b50/1:1/w_160/screamer.jpg,2019-10-18 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/third-eye-blind-screamer/,Mega Collider,"If he had less ambition and a lower tolerance for failure, Third Eye Blind frontman Stephan Jenkins could be sipping Mai Tais with Mark McGrath on the deck of a ’90s rock cruise right now, enjoying a life of royalty checks and low expectations. Instead, he’s carried on as if any year might be the one where his group finally reclaims its former glory. Everything he does is a long-shot bid for relevance: He covers Bon Iver, records bold political statements, and generally does the last thing we ask from the second-tier figures of alt-rock’s yesteryear: He tries. Third Eye Blind’s closest corollary is probably Weezer, another band with an extremely online frontman who never lost his thirst for the charts. They haven’t experienced anything like Weezer’s continued success, but they share a refusal to accept middle age as a commercial expiration date. In pop-punk and emo circles, Third Eye Blind’s 1997 self-titled debut is treated with an affection reserved for Weezer’s Blue Album and the Violent Femmes’ debut—nervy, warts-and-all depictions of adolescent alienation. Jenkins is in his mid-50s now, but he hasn’t outgrown that angst, and he still sings in a raw, post-pubescent yelp. His perennial youthfulness remains his most endearing quality, and on the band’s sixth album Screamer, Jenkins Peter Pans his way through a record so improbably infectious that you almost begin to wonder if he might score that late-career radio hit after all. He brings along some younger recruits to boost his chances. Sleigh Bells’ Alexis Krauss injects homecoming-rally pep into the record’s shouty title track, while Poliça’s Ryan Olson punches up the piano-flushed “Got So High” and the lighter-waving “Who Am I.” Billy Corgan is also credited as the album’s “musical consigliere,” though it’s unclear what precisely he contributed to the record beyond some pre-release buzz. The album’s open-door policy helps keep things fresh, and the band sounds more comfortable in their skin than they have since the ’90s. “Turn Me On” and “Tropic Scorpio” are buoyant and bombastic, tinged with EDM-adjacent production that plays off of contemporary Top 40 without pandering to it. Although he’s laying it on less thick than usual, Jenkins’ swaggering vocals remain an acquired taste. He can still be an unrepentantly clumsy lyricist, especially when he breaks out his old sing-rap on “Walk Like Kings.” But overall, Screamer is better than a sixth Third Eye Blind album ever needed to be. It’s unlikely to be the full comeback Jenkins is gunning for, but if Third Eye Blind never score another hit, it won’t be for lack of scratching and clawing.

He sees a flirty text from an unfamiliar number and sneaks to the kitchen for a carving knife to enact his revenge. If this were the extent of “Heart Emoji,” a highlight on Richard Dawson’s new album 2020, it would still be a strange, modern horror story. But there’s more. Additional details include the phone’s passcode (daughter’s date of birth), the contents of the text message (“I miss you ❤️”), the unwelcome creatures infesting their home (spider, slug), the music playing in the narrator’s earbuds (classical), and a story of how the couple met that leaves you questioning their power dynamic and long-held resentment toward each other. It’s a lot to process—and this is one of the shortest, simplest tracks on the album. The songs on 2020 all involve first-person narratives that tend to swerve toward grander, anti-capitalist themes, set in Dawson’s native UK. “Obviously a lot of talk has been about Brexit,” he recently told Q Magazine, “but there’s so many other things without the fanfare.” To accompany these complex stories, he makes music that’s equally overstuffed. In “Heart Emoji,” there’s a creeping guitar part—the sound of stalking through the house at three in the morning—and a wobbly synth solo that mimics a blurry unnatural light in a dim room. Dawson himself, a singer whose thick Geordie accent and primal howl seem to emerge from somewhere deep in his stomach, is restless in his delivery, slurring and braying and dipping into a squeaky, heartbroken falsetto to deliver the words “heart emoji,” as if the thought alone might bring him to tears. Those two words—“heart” and “emoji”—offer a good survey of the album’s themes. On his previous record, 2017’s Peasant, Dawson explored the medieval age, using archaic diction and characters whose dark, grotesque humor left you wondering how distant the past really is. But in the present, amid vape shops and YouTube channels, watching soccer and eating brunch, he finds just as much barbarism. “I don’t want to go into work this morning,” he sings in the opening song, “I just want to lie here and play the new Call of Duty.” And if you think there’s a metaphor somewhere to be uncovered, he makes his point even plainer a few lines later: “I refuse to do this filthy work anymore,” he sings, bellowing the word “refuse” several more times until it sounds like he’s having an actual breakdown. It’s Dawson’s least beautiful music, but it’s also his most expressive. By comparison, Peasant was lush, conventional even, with its sing-song melodies and pastoral texture. On 2020, the arrangements are proudly inorganic as they lurch and blast, sputter and break. The long-form structure of the record feels more like a short story collection, and taking it in front-to-back can have an overwhelming, exhausting effect. But unlike the sometimes hopeless characters in his songs, Dawson can wield this glut of information in his favor. The extraordinary first single, “Jogging,” embodies this challenge: Dawson sings about seeking therapy in exercise as he tries to cram his thoughts into its vaguely motivational rock melody. It seems like a tight, uncomfortable fit, and that’s precisely the point. For “Jogging” and several other songs, Dawson took inspiration from conversations he had with fans at shows, and his intimate tone makes you consider words and phrases you’ve never heard in a folk-rock song before: dehumidifier, voluntary redundancy, Nando’s. There’s a level of difficulty to this combination of banality and mythology (minotaurs and sirens also lurk these songs), and Dawson’s mastery as a writer guides you along without hiding the awkwardness of addressing the world at its ugliest. Compared with other sprawling, self-referential works from this year—say, Lana Del Rey’s Norman Fucking Rockwell! or Bill Callahan’s Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest—Dawson succeeds by finding surreality and horror in his everyday musings. The title seems pointed, referring both to our near future and the power of hindsight. While the album is placed in hypermodern scenarios, in a world burdened with violence, xenophobia, and generational exhaustion, its most stunning moments lead you to unexpected places. There’s “Black Triangle,” a tale of a UFO sighting that patiently evolves into a less fantastical tale of being dumped for a pilates teacher. Even more ambitious is “Fulfillment Centre,” a 10-minute parable that takes place inside of an Amazon shipping warehouse, transporting you with shuffling sound effects and a robotic call-and-response. “There has to be more to life than killing yourself to survive,” Dawson sings in the closest thing this album has to a thesis statement. Of course, there’s no easy answer, so to follow it, he gives us this thought: “One day I’m going to run my own cafe.” For a minute, the music turns bittersweet and his words feel so tender and close that you could hold them in your hand. And one day, you think, maybe he will.

Dawn Chorus,Jacques Greene,by: Noah Yoo,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da0b271ec15310008ce7797/1:1/w_160/dawnchorus.jpg,2019-10-17 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jacques-greene-dawn-chorus/,LuckyMe,"For some time, Jacques Greene’s curious career was defined by the French-Canadian producer’s knack for fusing different modes of dance music with contemporary pop and R&B influences. Philippe Aubin-Dionne’s curatorial ears (and eyes; he previously worked as an art director) helped him navigate electronic music’s shifting trends. But where his debut LP, Feel Infinite, took an insular approach, Aubin-Dionne’s sophomore album, Dawn Chorus, treats the Jacques Greene project more like a band. Inspired by groups like Massive Attack and Slowdive, he brought on producer and Oneohtrix Point Never collaborator Joel Ford as well as contributions from Brian Reitzell, Oliver Coates, and Julianna Barwick. The result feels at once intimate yet immense—a collection of ruminative dance tracks with a shoegaze heart. The muscular loops of last year’s Fever Focus EP, crafted for peak-hour DJ sets, made for an incremental step forward, but Dawn Chorus largely abandons the pretense of the club altogether. From the instant that the smeared rave sirens of “Serenity” go soaring across snippets of indistinct radio chatter, it’s clear that Aubin-Dionne is just as concerned with kindling introspection as he is with moving bodies. It’s a trick he pulls off differently on almost every track: Rainy field recordings envelop mid-album highlight “Sel,” and spirals of hazy, resampled textures on “Let Go” set the stage for a moody guest turn from Toronto-based singer Rochelle Jordan. Until now, Jacques Greene’s signature move has been to lift melodies from beloved singers like Mario and Brandy, slicing them into wistful refrains. He was hardly the first to repurpose R&B vocals—what up, Burial—but Aubin-Dionne understands that the provenance of his samples is less important than the vocalists’ charismatic timbres, rendered mystical by washes of synth. Instead of falling back on familiar sources, he opts to alchemize his guests’ voices into hooks, occasionally ceding the spotlight altogether, as on “Let Go” and the acid-tinged “Night Service,” with Cadence Weapon. Unfortunately, Cadence falls a bit flat as he rhapsodizes about a night out during the bloghouse days of yore, when DJs used to play the Rapture. It’s charming but awkward. Dawn Chorus is most compelling when the production does the bulk of the talking. Nearly a decade into his career, Jacques Greene continues to hone his sound design and arrangements. Much of Dawn Chorus was recorded at Hudson Mohawke’s Los Angeles studio, where Aubin-Dionne set out to wrangle new sounds from specific pieces of hardware used by his musical heroes. You get the sense that exploring unfamiliar equipment in new spaces has helped him find new possibilities in his own work—that by plunging himself into guitar pedals and classic French-house compression modules, he’s ushered in a new era for Jacques Greene without losing sight of his unique sentimentality. “For Love,” possibly the only track geared for the floor, turns a hit by Canadian disco outfit THP Orchestra into a pumping funky house number with a dream-pop middle eight. The expansive “Drop Location,” co-produced by Aubin-Dionne’s old friend Clams Casino, shows that the cloud rap pioneer’s chilly tendencies pair well with Jacques Greene’s newfound love of distorted drones. The shoegaze influence is most apparent near the end of the album. Hesitant arpeggios waft through a barren Shlohmo-esque atmosphere on “Understand,” while the seven-minute closer “Stars” is a slow-burning meditation on nature and childhood, undergirded by the steady pulse of warehouse drums. Aubin-Dionne’s gleaming synthesizers ebb and flow; the woozy swells and quietly crackling drones flank the spectral spoken-word passages of another Toronto artist, Sandrine Somé. Eventually, Somé trails off, and so do the resonant pads, leaving a lone breakbeat to loop into the ether. The brooding, ambient nature of  Dawn Chorus suggests that one day, Jacques Greene just might abandon dance music altogether—but for now, it’s a form that he continues to reshape in his own way with each new release.

Singles Too,Screaming Females,by: Brady Gerber,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da48e1a240253000865dfdc/1:1/w_160/screamingfemales_singlestoo.jpg,2019-10-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/screaming-females-singles-too/,Don Giovanni,"With a discography ranging from good (All at Once) to great (the Steve Albini-produced Ugly) to secretly influential (“Jonah,” from 2006’s Baby Teeth, predated Courtney Barnett by six years), Screaming Females are among the more consistent guitar bands of Bandcamp-era indie rock. That’s the story told by Singles Too, a 17-track compilation that charts the New Brunswick, New Jersey trio’s 15-plus year career not through its hits—did this band ever have any actual hits?—but through its non-album singles, B-sides, and covers. Some of these songs appeared on 2010’s Singles, but it’s nice to have everything in one place. Luckily, there are enough moments to justify its existence. The first two tracks, 2006’s “Arm Over Arm” and “Zoo of Death,” capture the essence of most Screaming Females songs: fuzzy riffs, singalong chorus, one verse or chorus too many. By 2008’s “No Being Disgusting,” the songs get tighter, and you can hear the band learning to play with dynamics. It’s also the first time we hear singer and guitarist Marissa Paternoster’s signature howl, which often acts as a fourth band member; it sounds like a Greek god yelling into a paper towel tube. Around 2013’s “Ancient Civilization,” Screaming Females start to sound better, though better studios don’t always mean better songs. But because of the comp’s low stakes, it’s not such a big deal that the riffs on “Let Me In” don’t quite add up to a song, or that “Skeleton” would sound better in a pit than on a playlist, or that the melody of “Take It Back” doesn’t stick. The peak of the compilation’s original music, “Pretty Okay” (which also appears on 2014’s Live at The Hideout) and “I Do,” are the songs  that sound most likely to appear on an album. Other highlights include an acoustic demo for Rose Mountain’s “Hopeless” and a remix of All At Once’s “End of My Bloodline” by Sammus and Moor Mother. The bonus CD of cover songs is the real revelation. Screaming Females’ takes on Neil Young, Sheryl Crow, Patti Smith, Guided By Voices, Taylor Swift, and Eurythmics are loose, jammy, and, most importantly, fun—perfect for people who like the idea of karaoke but don’t want to watch their co-workers botch “If It Makes You Happy,” which the band absolutely crushes. There and on “Shake It Off,” bassist “King” Mike Abbate and drummer Jarrett Dougherty prove to be the perfect anchors to Paternoster’s furious guitar playing. Annie Lennox’s otherworldly performance on “No More ‘I Love You’s’” becomes an unexpected showcase for Paternoster’s gentler upper register. It makes you wish there were another Screaming Females song like it. Singles Too doesn’t challenge or complicate Screaming Females’ strengths and shortcomings, and it doesn’t try to. Instead, it focuses on the band’s evolution. This is less “greatest hits” and more “here’s what you might have missed.” It’s as good an introduction as any to a trio that still sounds more similar to its 2005 self than different. More often than not, this is a compliment.

As If It Were Forever,Anna Wise,by: Marcus J. Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d6697fd8bd4b800082d4960/1:1/w_160/asifitwereforever_annawise.jpg,2019-10-17 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/anna-wise-as-if-it-were-forever/,Alpha Pup,"When you hear the name Anna Wise, you might think first of Kendrick Lamar—but before she sang on his music, Wise was the eccentric half (or one-third, depending on who was in the group) of Sonnymoon, a New York-based alt-soul and bedroom pop outfit. You never knew what you’d get from her: On a song like “The Fear,” she sounded playful, almost cartoonish; on “Things to Come,” she faded to the background, her piercing falsetto reduced to background noise amid clattering bass drums. Sonnymoon made waves in underground music circles, and around 2016, Wise’s light began to shine brighter, magnified by star turns on songs like “Real” and the Grammy Award-winning “These Walls.” Yet Wise kept churning out the same esoteric soul she always had: She released a solo project, 2016’s The Feminine: Act I, a pop-focused set with electro-soul and hip-hop on the fringes, followed less than a year later by The Feminine: Act II. Then, in 2018, Wise and Jon Bap—a noted vocalist/producer and Wise’s significant other—quietly released a collaborative LP called geovariance, an abstract collage of fuzzy vocal loops and tape glitches that foreshadowed Wise’s proper solo debut album. As If It Were Forever isn’t so wonky, though. Mixing quiet storm R&B, ambient, and acoustic soul, Forever is Wise’s most accessible and fully-formed record, the clearest entry point to her catalog. The peculiar tweaks are still there: “Worm’s Playground” opens with a jumble of loop-pedal vocals, and “Coming Home” is just ambient hums coiled into a quick meditative interlude. The guest features come and go, breezing in and out as Wise’s protagonist holds court. Appearances by rapper Little Simz on the self-loving ode “Abracadabra” and rapper/singer Pink Siifu on the sugary, folk-centric “One of These Changes Is You” give the impression of a collaborative effort between musicians who share a love of cryptic artistry and aren’t defined by arbitrary definitions of hip-hop and soul. Forever is like an open mic in that way: The tracks fade into each other, maintaining a sense of continuity that makes the record feel like a 38-minute suite. It’s a head-in-the-clouds LP where the singer dips between reality and surrealism, exploring the fleeting moments—laughing with friends, relaxing with a lover at home—that she wishes could last an eternity. Forever is about breathing in the good times before they dissolve, and understanding that the only constant in life is change. Lyrically, the songs on Forever read like jotted-down missives in an old diary, ink bleeding through its yellow pages. “Abracadabra” runs through the should I or shouldn’t I of new love, basking in the glow of romance and the tension of maintaining desire. But like everything else, the adoration fades. On “Vivre d’Amour et d’Eau Fraîche,” a sultry duet with Bap near album’s end, the two lean into each other, their voices melded into one. Where “Abracadabra” ends on a somber note, “Vivre d’Amour” is an after-hours slow burner, applying sex and tenderness in equal measure. “Your skin on my skin,” Bap sings over warped guitar chords and barely-there drums. “Your path met my path, several doors are open and all of them divine.” Forever isn’t entirely sentimental; “Nerve” is a chest-thumping proclamation of independence. “I’m not gonna play the safe side,” she declares over scant marching drums and background studio chatter. “I don’t wanna live a simple life when I’m not a simple woman.” On a record wrestling with self-doubt and faded memories of the past, Wise is taking life as it comes and on her own terms.","The idiosyncratic singer mixes R&B, ambient, and acoustic soul on her most accessible and fully-formed record, one that still feels like an open mic.

Neighborhoods,Ernest Hood,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9bac972faa0c0009edd1b7/1:1/w_160/ernesthood.png,2019-10-16 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ernest-hood-neighborhoods/,Freedom to Spend,"In 1975, the Portland, Oregon, musician Ernest Hood pressed his lone solo album, Neighborhoods, in an edition of a few hundred. He passed out copies primarily to friends, and the album, a curious blend of found sounds and proto-ambient, disappeared into the Pacific Northwest mist. Newly reissued by Freedom to Spend (in a much improved pressing, spread across two discs), it’s not the first such rarity to be pulled from the ether in the 21st century, as YouTube’s algorithm accumulates millions of plays for once obscure jazz and new-age records. But it might be the most uncanny, an album that kindles a sensation not unlike watching home videos of your own childhood. If you’ve sat in the yard at dusk right before the mosquitoes come out, ridden a bike through the suburbs in the summertime, or even just driven around your own neighborhood with the windows rolled down, you’ll hear in Neighborhoods an aleatoric sound set in amber. Who was the fellow that plucked out such moments of everyday life, pared them down, and wove it all together? Born in 1923, Hood grew up in a time when kids ran unsupervised all day long and the most enthralling sound was big-band jazz. Hood picked up the guitar and started playing ballrooms with a jazz band (his brother Bill would go on to have a moderately successful career in the industry), but in the early 1950s, while still in his twenties, he fell victim to a devastating polio outbreak. He spent a year in an iron lung and for the rest of his life used leg braces, crutches, and a wheelchair to get around. He could no longer hold a guitar in his lap, so he took up the zither. At one point in the early 1970s, Hood’s zither could be heard on Flora Purim’s early albums, mixing in alongside fusion stars like George Duke and Stanley Clarke. His own career in jazz might have ended abruptly, but Hood remained a presence in Portland, where he cofounded the KBOO community radio station. (Before his death in 1995, post-polio syndrome took away even more mobility as well as his ability to speak and he became the public face of the Death With Dignity Act.) And while his guitar playing was halted, he continued to study recording and production. Starting in the mid-’50s, Hood began using a wire recorder to collect the sounds around him, eventually upgrading to a reel-to-reel and microphone, assembling his field recordings into “audio postcards” for his radio show. As the liner notes recount, Hood would surreptitiously park around Portland, “blacking out the windows of his car with a dark cloth to act as a windbreaker,” which attracted a fair bit of notice from concerned neighbors. It wouldn’t be until 1974 that Hood started assembling all these field recordings and snatches of dialogue into Neighborhoods, weaving in the voices of his own son and family friends. He was in his early fifties at that point and envisioned the album as a nostalgic glance back at his own childhood, a period rapidly fading from memory in the post-war era. There’s talk of a sunken riverboat and steam-powered trains, and the scrape of a game of kick the can, not all that far removed from what Ray Davies would sing on Kinks albums. But you never get the impression that Hood is pining for these lost times so much as documenting the peculiar similarities between his own bygone youth and what he could hear all around him in that moment. The album opens with birds, barking dogs, a kid tooting on a whistle, a passing car—the kind of stuff that rushes in whenever you pull up your garage door. When Hood’s own zither and synth musings bloom to life, they move with a logic like the wind in the trees, picking up speed and then dying back down, meandering along at their own pace. He gets one of his early synthesizers to chirp along with bird sound in one moment, and then to mimic a tune the kids down the street are yelping the next. Hood’s musical musings never take over, but rather move in and out of earshot. Sometimes he strums a whimsical air like something lifted from Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood, and at other times he echoes a radio tuned to an old jazz song. The synth melody that gurgles up throughout “Gloaming” brings to mind another album that wove together pioneering synth work and field recordings, Stevie Wonder’s Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants. Neither moving toward a song nor getting lost in the other sounds, Hood lets it all come to him. While the recordings are documentarian in their way, the music is as vague and open-ended as daily life. There are moments when you might be hard-pressed to notice Hood’s signature at all. “It hardly matters in which neighborhood you sprouted,” Hood wrote in the original liner notes. “The games we played… and the feelings we experienced… are tantalizingly familiar.” Songs with names like “At the Store” and “After School” could be set just about anywhere. Hood susses out a symphony in the daily noise of American life, like Charles Ives with a portable tape recorder or Norman Rockwell with an early synthesizer prototype. In some passages, Neighborhoods doesn’t feel like a half-century-old curio, but as of-the-moment as a walk to the train. Put it on, hear children shouting out songs, crickets chirping, and the noise diesel engines rumbling past and feel the illusion of time dissolve: You’re in Ernest Hood’s neighborhood.

Broken,Xanman,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9cc7c62096e700086ffa52/1:1/w_160/xanman.jpg,2019-10-16 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/xanman-broken/,self-released,"There might be more than one other rapper taking their name from one of America’s most popular anti-anxiety medications, but Prince George’s County, Maryland’s Xanman raps better than any of them. The only thing faster than the 19-year-old rapper’s flow is the prolific pace at which he releases music—Xan has released almost 30 projects on mixtape-hosting service Spinrilla in the past three years, though only a handful of those have made it over to Spotify. He’s been making music for much longer than he’s been releasing it: Xan started rapping at age 5 and had his own studio by the time he was a preteen. A six-month stint behind bars on undisclosed charges briefly interrupted his output, but he’s been grinding harder than ever since his release in May. He’s released multiple projects this year, but Broken is the first that approaches retail-album length. Given his age, Xanman’s extensive discography is made even more impressive by being mostly self-produced. Like the state he hails from, Xan’s beats—which he refers to as “Xanstyles”—split the difference between North and South. There’s heavy Zaytoven influence to the glittering keys, MIDI strings, and organ swells on songs like “Broken, Pt. 1,” but an undeniable East Coast love that comes through in his affection for hip-hop instrumentals that he’s barely old enough to remember, like 50 Cent’s “Many Men,” Mary J. Blige’s “Family Affair,” and Lauryn Hill’s “Doo Wop (That Thing).” Whether his words arrive over straight-up trap or something more soulful, Xanman has a fondness for hashtag rap, using punchlines to detail his plans to cause physical harm: “Flava Flav/You get clocked in the head,” “I put that bitch underground/Harriet Tubman.” At its best, Xan’s love of non-sequiturs gives his lyrics a light surrealism, but it encourages some cringier instincts: casual homophobia, jokes about Paul Walker’s death, and some especially regrettable bars about R. Kelly and Bill Cosby. Even then, he lets out his soulful side enough to keep the whole project mostly serious. For as many colorful metaphors Xanman comes up with to describe his guns, there’s an underlying sense of heartbreak, as the album title and cover indicate. His hooks are more often repeated expressions of emotional uncertainty—“Why you gotta be like that?”; “Have you ever been in love?”; “How would you feel?”—than declarative statements. In classic DMV fashion, Xanman doesn’t let the beat dictate the direction his flow takes, almost as if he’s in competition with it. He crams words into tight spaces and lets them spray in rapid bursts, sounding most at home over menacing, mosh-ready beats like “Brick Paper” and “Back Up.” Reigning rap queen Rico Nasty shows up for a co-signing spot on the remix to “Gucci Down,” the closest thing Xan has had to a hit thus far. Xan’s vocal delivery is the kind we’re used to hearing digitally manipulated, but he’s comfortable enough pushing himself into different registers, from a gruff low end to a twinkling falsetto, that he doesn’t need a computer to do it for him. Xanman has a mixtape series called “Luther Xandross,” which seems to suggest how he’d like to think of himself: as a soulful vocalist, not just a rapper. It’s hard to catch every single word he says, but the skill is clear enough.","The prolific Maryland rapper is alternately serious, silly, and soulful.

Metal Galaxy,Babymetal,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9e568a240253000865dcc6/1:1/w_160/Screen%20Shot%202019-10-09%20at%205.49.36%20PM.png,2019-10-16 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/babymetal-metal-galaxy/,Cooking VinylearMUSIC,"On their unruly 2014 debut, the Japanese pop-metal outfit Babymetal pinballed from blastbeat belligerence to chiptune clap-alongs, adding a trap interlude for extra cultural currency. Two years later, they fortified the follow-up, Metal Resistance, with power ballads and alt-rock anthems. Their indiscriminate approach to approachability worked: Babymetal count Robs Zombie and Halford as fans, and their brutally cute ode to chocolate ranks as one of this decade’s essential viral oddities. On the day they released their third record, Metal Galaxy, they headlined The Forum. Metal Galaxy is a loose concept album about being dispatched to a distant part of the universe. “We are on an odyssey to the Metal Galaxy/Please fasten your neck brace,” they greet us over a Sleigh Bells-sized, guitar-and-sequencer stomp. But then, that thread mostly disappears, and the real conceit emerges: After touring the world, Babymetal recruit a half-dozen international collaborators to widen their musical net even further. There is a guest verse from Thai rapper F.Hero on “Pa Pa Ya!!” and faceless growling from Canadian grunter Alissa White-Gluz on “Distortion,” which sounds like a Hot Topic-commissioned cover of Taylor Swift. Without the help of guests, Babymetal nod to Bollywood and the Miami Sound Machine. It is an exultant, near-absolute mess. Now a duo after the mysterious departure of Yuimetal last year, Babymetal are still at their best when they hover around their initial idea—harnessing the energy of metal and J-Pop into high-flying hybrids. Metal Galaxy’s closing stretch of songs do just that; the arcing “Kagerou” boasts one of their most undeniable choruses, and you can visualize the epic sweep of stage lights and lighter-wielding throngs on “Shine.” Babymetal have rarely sounded as natural or convincing as they do in these moments. Otherwise, Metal Galaxy teems with embarrassing gimmickry. At the start of “Night Night Burn!,” keyboards mimic mariachi trumpets and the vocalists duet with cumbia drums, shouting “Hola! Ma, Mamma Mia!” like they’ve just emerged from a Gloria Estefan nightmare. During “Shanti Shanti Shanti,” they intone in Sanskrit over tamboura drones and sitar samples, offering a cringey Bollywood approximation. At least those songs are listenable. “Oh! MAJINAI,” an abomination with Joakim Brodén, the lead singer from power metal cosplayers Sabaton, suggests the Dropkick Murphys playing mean at Halloween. “Let’s make a wish!” they yell together in pirate patois. OK, then: Here’s hoping this never happens again.

My Diary,W00DY,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5da604a1f433c80008b965ec/1:1/w_160/w00dy.jpg,2019-10-16 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/w00dy-my-diary/,self-released,"After spending the early part of this decade making prismatic pop songs and wheezy techno experiments, Pittsburgh-based producer W00dy has recently settled into a kind of mutant club music that’s built around hyperactive vocal samples and, as the title of a 2018 tape put it, Relentless Kickdrum. In her rhythmic contortions, you can hear the echoes of all kinds of speed-demon dance music: hardcore techno, drum’n’bass, and footwork, among other molar-grinding microgenres. It’s music for ragers, first and foremost. But the real joy of her tracks is: They’re silly. That’s the stated goal of her work, per her Bandcamp page, to “bring absurdity 2 the dance floor.” Without sacrificing the gurning pace of her tracks, she arranges the components in these overlapping, off-balance loops, which blend and blur together in a wonderfully psychedelic way. Listening to her music feels like you’re watching the dancefloor from the center of a lazy Susan, trying to rediscover your center of gravity. W00dy’s latest full-length, My Diary, only pushes her sound further in that dizzying direction. The album begins with a flurry of slurred syllables, fluttering around one another erratically. As “Can’t Resist It” unfolds into more rave-ready shapes, that vocal continues to dart around, like a fruit bat mischievously unleashed on an unsuspecting nightclub. It’s a kind of chaos you can’t help but smile at. There are only four tracks on My Diary, but they’re each so jittery and unpredictable that they feel like they contain a whole album’s worth of ideas. “Came 2 Party,” for example, starts with a slivered vocal and hopscotching kick drum rhythm that sounds like a Teklife record sent through a paper shredder, before morphing into hardcore, acid, and filtered breaks, all within just a minute or two of one another. Each of the tracks—none of which are less than five minutes long—is so stuffed with details and micro-samples that it almost feels like too much for your brain to process at points. It's similar to the approach of rave revisionists like Lorenzo Senni or the many genre-destroying producers that fill surrealist labels like Orange Milk and Hausu Mountain. There’s a sincere joy for the styles that she’s playing with, but a beautiful perversity in how willing she is to mangle them and the speed at which she does so. W00dy has described My Diary as a collection of her “most personal thoughts & feelings.” It’s hard to know what she means by that in a literal sense—there are no lyrics here to speak of—but you can extrapolate a little about her from these four tracks. It’s a portrait of a mind in constant motion, looping back on itself, swinging wildly from unrestrained joy to disarray and confusion, never stopping too long in any particular sound or feeling. That’s probably a familiar sentiment if you too are a sensitive person in the Internet age, watching every day as global tragedies and personal triumphs scroll past you every minute.

Let the Sun Talk,Mavi,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9f94e8240253000865de0a/1:1/w_160/letthesuntalk.jpg,2019-10-15 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mavi-let-the-sun-talk/,self-released,"MAVI is a kid studying neuroscience at Howard University, who is asking existential questions in his raps during his spare time. There is something profoundly mystic—even shamanistic—about how his raps attempt to bridge gaps between the mind, body, and soul, best encapsulated by a lyric from his song “moonfire”: “Cap trapped in my schooling, rap asking for time to spit/Unwinding brain, mind, and consciousness.” Some scientists believe that the same region of the brain that processes language processes spirituality as well, and MAVI seems to be tapping into both at once. “I try to use hip-hop as a conduit to do something, rather than being a composer of hip-hop songs,” he said in April. “My songs are statements, and poems, and equations of their own.” It’s effective to think of his music in each of these ways: as affirmations of deep-rooted personal ideology, enigmatic and beautifully lyrical poetry, and equations to be balanced and then figured out. Released for download on his website and uploaded to SoundCloud as a single, 32-minute-long track, Let the Sun Talk is a young sage discovering the full extent of his powers. These are revelations from the shadows, concealed and mysterious, in search of fresh air and sunlight. “We be hanging in the dark/We surprise ’em with the prowess/If it ain’t to give a spark we’d be still hidden,” he raps on “daylight savings.” The most recent stage of his music, he has said, is about teaching and learning black aestheticism, and the album’s terms and conditions are a mantra on what it means to be “pro-black.” He has classified it as three movements of four songs broken up by interludes, but it can be taken as a lesson in form: As one long song, the album feels limitless, like you’re wading into his inner monologue. MAVI started piecing things together in October 2017 with the mixtape No Roses, full of fleeting but dense songs in pursuit of a clear head. His heavy raps and unsteady flows were supported by a beyond-his-years insightfulness. The names frequently associated with his music are Earl Sweatshirt and MIKE, and for good reason: they too had this same knack for silver-tongued philosophy as teens. Not only have both co-signed MAVI’s ponderous songs and produced a couple of them (on this album), but his music shares traits with theirs. Let the Sun Talk exists in the same loopy, lo-fi realm that governed Some Rap Songs and Tears of Joy. What distinguishes MAVI’s music is its heady, nonlinear flow, as if he’s performing incantations. In the years since No Roses, he’s grown far more comfortable when lost in thought. Some writerly rappers are so obsessive about cramming words together that their rhymes lose their shape. (A self-possessed technician like Logic is so concerned with the formatting of his bars that they’re nearly soulless.) MAVI’s raps have an understanding of capacity and intervals and margin that eludes many seasoned rap veterans. “‘What kinda songs you make?’/I make the kind you gotta read, baby/I leave the silence you can see baby/I weave the darkness you can hear baby/I leave my carcass in the field, baby/I parse my garden on the real daily/And you can sense it,” he explains on “sense.” It’s a spatial awareness that shows great feel and balance. He doesn’t sacrifice meaning for empty tongue-twisting displays. Instead, their equilibrium is dependent on how layered and carefully organized the writing is. (Fittingly, all of his lyrics are available fully transcribed on his website.) Choruses are few and far between, and none of them could be considered “hooks,” which only feeds the stream-of-consciousness flux of his bars. Sometimes he raps like he’s foraging for some sort of spiritual nourishment; sometimes he raps like he’s leaving something behind for someone else to find and decipher. The crypticness can make these songs feel like riddles, but attempting to unpack all they have to offer is crucial to the experience. They start to crack open eventually, and out come MAVI’s fundamental code of ethics. “I’ll take the nigga hitting cars up over cops any day/Who more often called upon for guarding all the chocolate babies?” he asks on the stark “ghost in the shell.” On “selflove”: “Offer free smoke to all the niggas behind a me too/To my niggas: we ain’t free until she free too/To my sisters: we ain’t free until they free too.” Each bar on Let the Sun Talk is building toward something greater. In the album’s waning moments, MAVI raps, “Can’t wait until my raps is more than stashes for my secrets.” It’s interesting to imagine what his songs might sound like if they were more open and direct or they took more of a narrative arc, but what they lack in clarity they make up for in mysticism. Let the Sun Talk rewards (and often demands) close listening and there are instances where parsing the album can be like trying to unscramble a coded message in another language. There are seemingly many answers buried within it, but only you will know when you’ve found yours.","The latest tape from the 20-year-old rapper is dense and mystic.

True Love,Devon Welsh,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9fa3ff163e3300096f6892/1:1/w_160/truelove.jpg,2019-10-15 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/devon-welsh-true-love/,You Are Accepted,"There was a strange high-wire thrill to Majical Cloudz, Devon Welsh’s project with Matthew Otto. Welsh proclaimed the simplest and most naked sentiments in a clear but untrained baritone over synthesizers so warped and wispy they felt like they existed only in your head. Their best songs arranged these few elements in space like a score to a David Lynch film, where loud sounds crashed in without warning and confounded your sense of space and time. Nothing that happened felt strictly real. It either worked spectacularly for you or it didn’t; they weren’t a middle-ground act. Since parting from his Majical Cloudz partner, Welsh has continued as a solo artist. His voice radiates the same emotional intensity, and he sings with equal commitment. But he also reinforces what a fragile balance the Majical Cloudz project was. On his second solo record, True Love, he occasionally sounds a little denuded, his voice leaving that uncanny space and becoming the voice of just a guy sitting at the end of the bar. The arrangements scan as simple instead of sparse, and with one of these small elements slightly out of place, everything he does starts to feel a bit flat-footed; lines like “I wanna be just like my stepdad, I wanna be as cool as him/But then the only thing I can ever really find is me” on “Uniform” scrape pavement instead of taking off. But there are also moments here where that unsteady magic kicks back in—“Dreamers” sounds like 2009-era John Maus, painting a sweet portrait of two lovers (“He liked the Beach Boys, she liked the Doors”) and offering a bashful, fist-pump chorus of chanted “yeahs.” It’s exultant but tiny, like the cells of a future teen-movie anthem gathering in a petri dish. “Songbird” marries the finger-picked guitars of Welsh’s last solo record, 2018’s Dream Songs, with the dreamy atmospherics of Majical Cloudz. He stops to admire the way “songbirds sing in the sun,” and his music operates on a similar level—instinctual, beautiful. In place of a chorus, he croons wordlessly at the top of his range. It is a lonely, haunting sound, and it communicates with your bones. Some songs float in the unsteady middle, dipping into near-banality and then catching a draft upward. “Somebody Loves You” might be the most bathetic song Welsh has ever written, on paper—“Heaven is a place I do hope you find,” he sings, enunciating each word as if talking to a small child—but the near-human cries of the synthesizers defamiliarize his words. “Don’t get carried away/Sometimes there’s nothing to say,” he intones on the title track. He sounds like he might be reading them, puzzled, off a milk carton. “This won’t mean a thing unless we try,” he pleads on “Faces,” allowing the word “try” to occupy six syllables. Welsh made this album almost entirely alone, a process that seems to suit him. His introspection is the sort that usually precludes human interaction, and Welsh’s narrator always seems to be reentering the world, raw and shaky, after some defining devastation. “I will turn away from the shivering world/Though I am a child of that old and rotten place,” he vows on “Grace.” But there is no spirit of turning away here, only an embrace from someone who seems ready to break and rebuild himself, again and again, for you.","With his intense baritone voice, Devon Welsh travels deep into the feelings of isolation and introspection with grace and beauty.

The Ra(w) Material,Czardust,by: Phillip Mlynar,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9fa06b240253000865de43/1:1/w_160/rawmaterial.jpg,2019-10-15 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/czardust-the-raw-material/,self-released,"The Ra(w) Material opens with a hazy, slightly off-kilter double-tracked voice chanting, “Caveman, caveman make me a wheel.” Undulating keys and slurry drums kick in next, sounding for a second like they’re two loops running deliberately out of sync. The vocals brag about copping fire from Prometheus and stacking cash like the alchemist St. Germain, before the track is overtaken by the manic sampled dialogue of a religious zealot—at which point the beat dissolves into a misty soul loop. It’s like some fantastically blunted cacophony whose closest antecedent is the Jungle Brothers’ Crazy Wisdom Masters, a record Warner Bros. deemed too experimental to release back in the ’90s. It turns out, the alien rapping voice belongs to Sadhugold, a Philadelphia producer who wears a stocking mask in photos and is best known for crafting beats for the underground cognoscenti that include Mach-Hommy, Your Old Droog, and the Griselda camp. It also turns out that Sadhugold rhymes very well indeed, much in the same sort of syncopated style as Madlib’s rapping persona Quasimoto. Forming as Czardust alongside Virginia’s Ohbliv—a producer whose work is similarly revered in the same circles—the duo have elevated the usual vanity hip-hop collaboration into a maelstrom of head-spinning loop science intertwined with philosophical commentary. The Czardust world is like a puzzle box. Focus on one of Sadhugold’s raps—which are filled with brags like, “Fuck this rap shit, my nig’, let’s wrangle these chickens/It’s time to cash in with self-help books and religion, ya dig?”—and you might find the vocals fading out mid-line to be replaced by one of many cut-and-paste-style speeches. On “Murder He Wrote,” which starts out dominated by a simmering bass line and Gothic choral refrain, a female voice asks if God will heal the Earth from disease. This prompts a frantic response from a Public Access preacher who rattles off a crazed mix of Biblical references and hip-hop patter: “I’m the Lord, motherfucker, not who you thought I was supposed to be… Like my nigga Mystikal say gon’ be that way long after they release Mandela because you nincom-fuckin’-poops don’t know Jesus.” While this unfurls, a snippet of The Notorious B.I.G.'s “Hypnotize” seeps through in the background, tempting the listener to wander into another new pocket of sound. Backed by pained guitar and monstrous bass, “Phantom of the Options” opens as a moralistic rap that includes the question, “Who can turn a terrorist into a sob story?” As you anticipate the second verse bringing forth answers, the lyrics are totally swamped by news reportage documenting the limits and justifications for violence in the name of self-defense. “What are we supposed to do if we can't protect ourselves?” laments a scared voice as the heady track ends. All these overlapping loops and voices could sound haphazard, but Ohbliv and Sadhugold bring things full circle towards the project’s end. On “Serpent Power,” the same verse that opened the album is layered back into the song, linking the myriad sampled speeches about Christianity, the Ku Klux Klan, and Five Percenter rhetoric to the beginnings of mankind. Then on closing cut “Whattup,” Sadhugold zones out and perfectly encapsulates the cosmic Czardust ethos: “I close my eyes and embrace the blackness of space/’Til the colors and the spirit gods is back in my face like, ‘What up?’” (Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)","Two figures of underground rap—Philly’s Sadhugold and Virginia’s Ohbliv—team up for a politically blunted, cult rap record in the making.

Blood Dust,Arrange,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9f9852fb22c40008d852ae/1:1/w_160/arrange_blooddust.jpg,2019-10-15 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/arrange-blood-dust/,self-released,"Malcom Lacey, a Florida native who now lives near Portland, has been quietly releasing albums as Arrange for ten years. “Quietly” defines both his approach to promotion and the enticing murmur of his music; “washes over you” would be the operative cliché. It’s tempting to call his fluid electro-acoustic pop confessional, but a better word might be confiding. Arrange has always felt like a genuine window into the depths of someone’s private world—someone intense but sweet, someone with whom you feel safe. This is odd, as the music courses with danger: Lacey sings as if he’s voicing scarily vulnerable things with his eyes covered, then peeking out between his fingers to see if the world is still there. Every time it is, he gets a little stronger. Lacey began the project when he was only 17, and it has the air of a long-term therapeutic exercise, or exorcism. Growth isn’t just his process, but his subject, which he pursues with tender, dogged persistence. Lacey’s latest, Blood Dust, stops short of housing an easy epiphany; that would be a very un-Arrange, as he always traffics in more alloyed emotions and muted climaxes. But it does feel like the end of an arc, a survival and a summation—if a characteristically modest one—of a decade. As ever, Lacey’s lyrics are concerned with mental health and family relationships. Throughout the album, blood is wiped from faces, blood is stolen, blood is transmuted from water. Allusive images of generational trauma accrue, abstract but vivid: There is a mercurial lover, a looming father. The album closes, after the glistening folk tune “Never Is,” with answering-machine messages from Lacey’s grandmother. You might feel moved without knowing why—something to do with home and how it moves around. On Blood Dust, 16 songs flow by in barely 45 minutes, but none of them feel incomplete or incidental. Their brevity only accentuates their intimacy, humility, and rich interior detail. Though virtual synths are present, there’s more live instrumentation—keyboards, piano, and especially guitar—than ever before. Arrange emerged from an era of early-’00s laptop loners like Elite Gymnastics, whose quietude was a shadow of sunny chillwave, but it still reminds me most of early Bright Eyes, especially in the low, choked tone of Lacey’s voice. Lacey moves around in time to take the measure of his perspective at various ages, some of them predating Arrange, some plucked blindfolded from the distant future. The album begins with the knocking, drifting dream-pop of “The Lone Ranger,” where Lacey, now almost 27, remembers feeling “the same hate” at 21 that he did at 15. Much later, on “All the Trouble,” he wonders, “When I’m rotten at 83, do you think I’ll be the same boy? When I’m cold at 92, will you tell just who I am?” Much of this language, not to mention the sound, is consistent with what he was doing back on Plantation. But it feels different, more mature and self-defined. Lacey’s music has modeled growth not in the incandescent spurts of much pop, but in the way it actually happens: by degrees so fine as to be almost invisible, with plenty of backsliding and false starts. Instead of someone heroically becoming someone else, it represents someone, even more heroically, learning to be who he is.","Malcom Lacey’s long-running electro-acoustic project feels like a window into someone’s private world.

No Home Record,Kim Gordon,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9d0274fb7d2d000832ff5c/1:1/w_160/kimgordon_nohomerecord.jpg,2019-10-14 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kim-gordon-no-home-record/,Matador,"The last chapter of Kim Gordon’s 2015 memoir, Girl in a Band, is a kind of epilogue—a bridge to the next volume in the long life of the indie-rock icon. Sonic Youth is over, and so is Gordon’s marriage to bandmate Thurston Moore. Their daughter, Coco, is off at art school. Gordon has left the family’s brick homestead in Northampton, Massachusetts, but instead of returning to New York, where she was a paragon of Downtown cool since 1981, she heads out to Los Angeles, where she grew up. By the book’s final pages, she is wintering at a hilltop Airbnb in Echo Park—a temporary landing pad for the permanent business of starting over. She is making visual art again; she’s showing in L.A. and has gallery representation in New York. Then, as she sits in someone’s car outside her rental, making out, she turns to the reader to confess, “I know, it sounds like I’m someone else entirely now, and I guess I am.” No Home Record—which, incredibly, is Gordon’s first solo album in 38 years of making music—offers evidence of her reinvention: Even longtime fans may find themselves thunderstruck by some of the turns she takes here. But the record also confirms the essence of her creative identity; it’s shot through with sounds and concepts that have defined her work over the years, just presented in a way we’ve never heard them before. This isn’t the first music Gordon has made since Sonic Youth called it quits, in 2011. She and guitarist Bill Nace have three records under their belt as Body/Head, all recorded in the years since the band dissolved. But where the squall of Body/Head’s dual-guitar improv occupies a space not far from SY’s stomping grounds, No Home Record offers something radically new and, in places, almost shockingly contemporary. It’s safe to assume that not many people expected an overdriven trap banger with an African thumb-piano melody as one of the highlights of Gordon’s solo debut—but here we are, and “Paprika Pony” is enthralling: druggy and hypnotic, the kick drum like a cross between a sheet of thunder and a crumpled paper bag. Over an ominous, skulking beat, Gordon half-mutters, half-whispers a free-associative path through the alleys of her mind. As much as Sonic Youth’s whirlwind sound could feel like a self-contained entity, there were occasional glimpses of the world outside, like Gordon’s karaoke-booth Robert Palmer cover on 1989’s Ciccone Youth’s The Whitey Album, or her duet with Public Enemy’s Chuck D on 1990’s “Kool Thing.” No Home Record is clearly interested in getting the hell away from the strictures of noise and indie rock as they’re conventionally understood. The opening “Sketch Artist” might have been made by avant-rap groups like clipping. or Death Grips—an overwhelming bass blast that summons all the slow violence of an earth mover churning up everything in its path. From interviews, it sounds like neither Gordon nor her co-producer, Justin Raisen—a Los Angeles producer who has worked with Yves Tumor and Charli XCX—expected the album to turn out quite like this. Gordon was fiddling around with an old drum machine, listening to the Stooges and footwork producer RP Boo; as inspiration, she sent Raisen an old Sonic Youth B-side called “Razor Blade,” a scrappy acoustic trifle. Then, three years ago, they made “Murdered Out,” a malevolent hurricane of a song, and the record’s direction was settled. Some songs are more low-tech—“Air BnB” is a mammoth slab of bluesy, atonal rock, “Earthquake” is a shimmering drone-folk opus—but the most exciting moments are giddy with the sense of worlds colliding. Noise, techno, and post-punk; custom-tuned guitars and battered MPCs; 808s and overheated bass amps—multiple strains of underground music history pushing together like tectonic plates, building up extreme pressure under the surface. The album’s energy, too, suggests a fusion of New York and Los Angeles, equally suited for stomping down a crowded city sidewalk and sitting in traffic. Whether heard on headphones or car stereo, the crushing bass and battering-ram drums feel like a protective exoskeleton—ideal armor for the days you simply cannot abide another living soul getting in your fucking way. Where Girl in a Band’s prose was was full of “a lot of read-between-the-lines stuff, which is how I am anyway,” as Gordon claims, No Home Record is similarly ambiguous, layering snapshots of an American culture in decline with lines it’s hard not to read as autobiographical. “Get Yr Life Back,” a smoldering, no-wave approximation of trip-hop, surveys the wreckage with an almost animal intensity. On the vulnerable “Earthquake,” she sings—really sings, in a way she almost never does—“This song is for you/If I could cry and shake for you,” before unleashing the hidden blade: “You want me to see you/Are you 12?” (It’s one of several jabs aimed at oblivious man-children.) And the brutally unsparing “Murdered Out” flips the image of customized cars with tinted windows into an unambiguous fuck you: “Murdered out of my heart/Covered in black matte spray/Will you see when I’m not there/…You didn’t even know who I became.” Even at her most pointed, it’s the ambiguities that keep things interesting. Is the giddy chorus of “Air Bnb” (“Air BnB!/Gonna set me free!”) a sardonically peppy sendup of late-capitalist shibboleths, or a genuine celebration of second chances? Probably a little of both. Gordon’s most trenchant truths are not in her words, but in her voice. She has frequently demurred that she is not a singer, but “singer” is far too limiting a word for what she does anyway. In Sonic Youth, her voice could be a jagged knife, a lover’s confession, steam rising from a subway grate. On No Home Record, she takes advantage of a newfound sense of space in the music to explore the limits of her expressiveness, whispering in ASMR-grade tones, the mic so close you can hear her licking her lips between syllables. The best exploration of her voice’s capabilities is “Cookie Butter.” Zoom out, and it’s clear that the song’s interwoven “I” and “you” statements are meant to underscore the way miscommunication is threaded through human relationships. Up close, though, her two-word statements take on a hypnotic minimalism, the force of repetition leaching meaning out of the actual words: “I saw/I’ve known/I remember/I liked/I met/I awaken/I wish/I have/I suck/I approach/I fucked…” On and on it goes, Gordon not so much speaking the words as carving out the syllables with her teeth, until the phrases come to seem almost sculptural, like a series of small statuettes lined up in a row. The song is an artful capstone to a thrilling debut album, one that is an ingenious fusion of sound and idea and a fearless celebration of second acts.

True 2 Myself,Lil Tjay,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9f9257240253000865de07/1:1/w_160/lilTjay.jpg,2019-10-14 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lil-tjay-true-2-myself/,Columbia,"Three years ago, a 15-year-old Lil Tjay was sentenced to a year in a juvenile detention center for a robbery. In late 2017, he was released back into the Bronx’s Fordham Heights neighborhood, with a promise to his mother that things would be different. At first, he fell back into his old ways, skipping school to run the Bronx streets. Then, he stepped into a studio for the first time and recorded his breakout single “Resume.” On “Resume,” Lil Tjay sing-raps in a soft voice about his crushes with the charm of a mischievous early 2010s teen R&B star (think Prodigy of Mindless Behavior). At the same time, he reflects on the drug addicts he passes on his block everyday and the friends he’s lost while incarcerated. He perfectly captures the feeling of being a kid in a New York environment that rapidly forces you to mature. That conflict only becomes more profound on the singles that followed “Resume,” which he began uploading to YouTube every month or so. “Long Time” is a bittersweet ode to all of the friends he’s lost; “Goat” reflects on the low points he’s overcome; “Brothers” dredges up the past he’s still trying to distance himself from. By the end of summer 2018, Tjay’s melodic sense was refined and his stories tapped into an emotional honesty that made him a relatable breakout star in New York. Lil Tjay’s music was always suited for singles. There’s nothing wrong with that; so much of rap is consumed through playlists and YouTube videos. But when stretched across a 17-track album, like his debut, True 2 Myself, issues that were irrelevant before begin to surface: uniform vocals, half-cooked production, and writing that pulls from the same stories. True 2 Myself is more like a compilation than an album. On “F.N,” Tjay’s vivid reflections are given life by lush piano. “I was stuck up in the streets, but I had a brain/I ain’t have no money, we was looking for a nigga chain,” he raps, while keeping a steady melody. The album’s intro, “One Take,” is Tjay at his sharpest; every line over the sparkly keys has a purpose, especially when he addresses comparisons to fellow Bronx crooner A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie: “They said I’m the new A Boogie, relax/I ain’t never tried to copy his swag.” Each of these songs is just as good, maybe better, than early tracks like “Goat” and “Brothers”—both land on the album—but lose some of their luster when they’re all run together, and padded out with blander versions of the same piano-heavy street tales (“Dream That I Had,” “Post To Be”). The album format gives Tjay a little room to stretch, something that’s nearly impossible when he’s only releasing one single a month. Some experiments work, like the traditional R&B ballad “Mixed Emotions.” The “BET Uncut” slow jam “Sex Sounds,” meanwhile, is way too much: Hearing him sing “The way you kiss me when I’m stroking deep inside” is like finding porn in your little brother’s internet history. Lil Tjay wants to grow up, and an album feels like part of that process. But Tjay didn’t need an album; he notched a Billboard Top 15 single and became one of the rappers leading New York’s melody-driven scene without one. True 2 Myself is a playlist of soon-to-be singles grouped under the industry-formality heading of an “album.” Inevitably, one of these brooding piano ballads will catch on, followed by another, and Tjay, just like he did less than two years ago, will go on another run.","The breakout NY rapper’s emotionally affecting, piano-heavy street tales start to run together at 17 tracks.

FLY or DIE II: bird dogs of paradise,jaimie branch,by: Marcus J. Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9f711ee0e3e50008fa3dca/1:1/w_160/jaimiebranch_flyordieIIbirddogsofparadise.jpg,2019-10-14 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jaimie-branch-fly-or-die-ii-bird-dogs-of-paradise/,International Anthem,"On November 6, 2018, trumpeter Jaimie Branch was onstage in Paris, France, screeching out the blues with her quartet. The music was more somber than the jam-based jazz that marked the New York native’s impressive debut album, 2017’s Fly or Die. At the same time, voters in the United States shuttled to the polls for midterm elections. The music was a plea for them to do the right thing. “The blues we played was far from where it got to on the album,” Branch writes in the liner notes of her second record, Fly or Die II: bird dogs of paradise. “But the sentiment remained: It’s a prayer for amerikkka…” In its finished form, the 11-minute “prayer for amerikkka pt 1 & 2”—positioned near the beginning of Fly or Die II—is the album’s centerpiece; its plodding rhythm and searing real talk sets a forceful tone. “We got a bunch of wide-eyed racists!” Branch declares in the song’s first segment, “and they think they run this shit.” With thunderous trumpet wails and airy, sometimes deconstructed arrangements, Fly or Die introduced Branch as a powerful bandleader in the New York and Chicago avant-jazz scenes. Released through International Anthem (the same label that’s put out stellar projects from Makaya McCraven, Irreversible Entanglements, Damon Locks’ Black Monument Ensemble, Angel Bat Dawid, and Ben LaMar Gay), Fly or Die arrived seemingly out of nowhere and became one of 2017’s most acclaimed jazz albums. Centered on triumphant, hard-charging backbeats that oscillated between Chicago- and New Orleans-style jazz, it was a far brighter album than this one. While Fly or Die II is darker, denser, and more experimental than its predecessor, it’s no less resonant. Branch sings on this record—on “prayer for amerikkka pt 1 & 2” and “love song”—marking the first time she’s used her actual voice on her solo music. Don’t expect her to start singing old Nancy Wilson covers; her voice—part raspy alto, part full-throated wail—is best suited for punk rock and takes some getting used to. She’s a gifted trumpet player who doesn’t need vocals to convey strong emotions, and to fans of her previous work, a track like “love song,” which concludes Fly or Die II, can feel weird on first pass. In keeping with the album’s theme, its sarcastic ode to “assholes and clowns” appears aimed at apathetic politicians, though Branch keeps the lyrics open-ended enough to apply to pretty much anyone worthy of such distinction. Fly or Die II is expressly influenced by the political climate. In the second half of  “prayer for amerikkka,” after the beat quickens to a stampeding mix of Spanish jazz, Branch tells the story of a teenaged Central American girl who seeks asylum in the United States. Liner notes detail her journey: She’s separated from her family at the border and deported to El Salvador, where she’s beaten and sexually assaulted. Three years later, she seeks asylum in the U.S. once again, only to be held in a cage in Texas. “She was only 19, they crossed over at dawn,” Branch sings. “Now her mother and brothers are safe in Chicago and she’s all alone.” Coupled with a surging instrumental—courtesy of Branch, cellist Lester St. Louis, double bassist Jason Ajemian, and drummer Chad Taylor—the song lumbers toward you, as if the border agents were coming for you next. The theme continues on “twenty-three n me, jupiter redux,” a moody, shape-shifting composition that conjures doom and panic through dark synth chords, crashing cymbals, and sporadic trumpet blasts. A pronounced marching beat breaks down into frenetic free jazz, churning up an urgent blend of drum taps and loud horns—the sound of the sky falling. Yet Fly or Die II grows more optimistic as it plays, and by the time “nuevo roquero estéreo” rolls around, the album veers to a festive style of Chicago jazz, where the beat locks into a two-stepping rhythm as Branch’s horn soars above it.

My Star,The Hecks,by: Steven Arroyo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9e52dee0e3e50008fa3d27/1:1/w_160/mystar_thehecks.jpg,2019-10-14 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-hecks-my-star/,Trouble in Mind,"Since they began in 2012, the Hecks have sounded like Chicago’s least-relaxed band. They approach melody not as a sequence of notes, but jabs. On their 2016 self-titled debut, recorded when the band was still a duo of singer-guitarist Andy Mosiman and drummer Zack Hebert, Mosiman sounded like he was strenuously aiming his guitar, playing either unnervingly on-beat or nowhere near it. His jagged interplay with Hebert recalled the late Women guitarist Chris Reimer, or Talk Talk’s Mark Hollis bashing holes through the solid walls of Lee Harris’s drumming. Mosiman committed to maintaining this angularity in ways beyond his guitar playing, too, whether by singing in a grating monotone or by holding a stoic stage face only slightly less intense than that of the sudden-realization meme guy. Since then, the Hecks added their producer, Dave Vettraino, as a third official member on guitar, followed by a full-time synth player in Jeff Graupner, thereby doubling their personnel. They sound like a completely different band on their sophomore album, My Star, for two main reasons. The first and most obvious is that the grainy recording quality of their debut is out the window; everything on My Star has been recast in sparkling high-definition. The album’s low end is satisfyingly full. Second, and more surprisingly, not a single sound on My Star is out of place; there no “off” notes, no stray threads. Postures are straight, clothes are ironed, and nobody stumbles. As a result, the bizarro world of the Hecks is an entirely different place to spend time; it sounds like it belongs somewhere around the Carter presidency and the start of the jogging craze. “Zipper” sounds like they stayed up for three straight days watching Elvis Costello’s “Pump It Up” music video, then only remembered how to play one repeating measure. “Heat Wave” reimagines the Police’s “Every Breath You Take” as a blank motorik pulse playing in an empty airplane hangar. Mosiman uses his voice primarily for instrumental effect on My Star, more so than on the debut. His lyrics are usually obscured by the band, except for when serving as boilerplate to complete a hook: “It’s tearing me apart” on “Heat Wave,” or “I only wanted to be with you” on the otherwise-fantastic Prince nod “So 4 Real.” The automated quality can be a little suffocating: At one point, he chants the alphabet to the beat, and at another, he counts up to and backwards from eight the same way. Live, the band dances together with stiff, synchronized choreography. That means these songs wind up making a little more sense onstage than they do on record. Nonetheless, there is something poignant in their mathematical rigor; they may treat songs like spreadsheets, but they fill the cells with neon.

For Your Pleasure,Roxy Music,by: Rob Tannenbaum,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d979dfaa540790008f9ddec/1:1/w_160/roxymusic.jpg,2019-10-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/roxy-music-for-your-pleasure/,Island,"Roxy Music singer and mastermind Bryan Ferry grew up in the sooty industrial North. His father tended to pit horses in the local mine in Washington, where the glum employment options for men were the mine or the steel factory. Roxy Music keyboardist and troublemaker Brian Eno grew up in rural eastern England, where his dad worked as a postman and augmented his meager salary by repairing clocks on the side. Both Ferry and Eno felt rat-trapped by an impermeable class system, perpetuating privilege for the wealthy legacy students at Eton and Harrow. Neither could have afforded college if not for England’s post-war education reforms. Yes, the great flowering of British rock in the 1960s began, obscurely, with the 1944 Education Act. England’s schools had withered, due to years of German bombs in World War II, evacuations of children, and general neglect; a study found Dickensian conditions in village schools, more than half of which still used buckets as lavatories. Among the Education Act’s extensive reforms, two had impacts for the working class no one could have anticipated: Students were required to stay in school until they were 15 and school fees were eliminated, making British education free to all. As part of this scheme, the Ministry of Education accredited more regional art schools and greatly loosened entry requirements. By the late 1950s, those schools had become havens for misfits, truants, and strays, financed by local and government grants available to anyone who could hold a paintbrush. Art school was “somewhere they put you if they can’t put you anywhere else,” Keith Richards (who studied graphic design at Sidcup Art College after being expelled from his secondary school) told Rolling Stone in 1971. Chris Dreja of the Yardbirds later classified his fellow art students as “buffoons and social drop-outs.” Art schools were unruly outposts of free thinking, free drinking, and liberation. A few years ago, the artist Roy Ascott, whose students included Brian Eno and Pete Townshend, told me, “It was very releasing for students to come out of their horrific bourgeois backgrounds into an art school where they could fuck and drink and smoke.” And also learn to play guitar, all under a government subsidy. Collectively, these schools had a transformative effect on England’s rock music. From the time the Beatles released their first UK single, “Love Me Do,” in October 1962 to the summer of 1973 when Queen and 10cc released their debut albums, nearly every significant English band had at least one member who’d gone to art school: the Beatles, the Who, the Kinks, the Yardbirds, the Animals, the Jeff Beck Group, Pink Floyd, Soft Machine, Deep Purple, and Roxy Music, plus David Bowie and Eric Clapton. Of these artists, Roxy Music is the one that most directly translated the radical, emancipating ideas of art-school into pop music. And For Your Pleasure, released in 1973, is their most art-school album, as well as their greatest. During an unsuccessful, dispiriting U.S. tour for Roxy’s debut album the previous year, they shared a few bills with Humble Pie, whose up-tempo boogie incited Ferry to write For Your Pleasure’s most raucous songs, “Do the Strand” (the album’s lone single) and “Editions of You,” models for the ferocity of punk rock. Both songs pledge themselves to the moment: “In modern times, the modern way,” Ferry trills in the latter, and in the former, which opens the album, he begins, “There’s a new sensation.” In “Editions of You,” a song about the beauty of pining for someone long gone, Ferry builds a chilly metaphor for love out of mechanical reproduction and Andy Warhol’s silkscreened paintings. Ferry had studied at Newcastle University under England’s preeminent Pop Art painter and theorist, Richard Hamilton, who compelled his students to consider fashion, pop music, industrial design, TV, comic books, and other dismissed aspects of lowbrow culture. Hamilton was working largely in collages, most famously in his 1956 work, “Just what is it that makes today’s homes so different, so appealing?” where he uses images of American consumerism, clipped from magazines. Hamilton regarded a painting, not as a canvas, but a mood board, an array of inspirations and goals that could as easily clash as blend together. Ferry applied this idea to Roxy’s music, which careened across the past and into what still feels like the future. “Editions of You” jump-cuts from Andy Mackay’s 1950s R&B sax invocations to a madcap, pitch-bending synthesizer solo by Eno, who torques the synth’s frequency control to create what he later approvingly termed “quite unpalatable noises.” Hamilton’s influence was so significant that he later, a bit grandly, called Ferry “my greatest creation.” The most tangible residue of his influence is “In Every Dream Home a Heartache,” Ferry’s macabre, hilarious love song to a blowup sex doll, referring back to Hamilton’s “Just what is it...?” collage. The song is a two-part essay about interiors and illusions—there are glimpses of modern sophistication, but behind it, only horror. “But what goes on?/What to do there?/Better pray there,” Ferry sings, gazing in awe at a mansion. Then the façade cracks. After three minutes of transfixing melodrama and funereal organ, the music stops asymmetrically on the one, and Phil Manzanera takes a staggered guitar solo, chalked with distortion, shaking with vibrato, and phase-shifted through Eno’s signature electronic treatments. Perhaps, the song implies, the modern way is not the best way. In a 1960 lecture, Hamilton said, “In its efforts to gain and hold the affections of the mass audience, a product must aim to project an image of desirability as strong as any Hollywood star. It must have gloss and glamor...” Everything is a product, he believed, including fine art. So Roxy Music was one of the first groups who understood that music is a product in need of a package, a mission that began with their carefully constructed album covers, which are like advertisements for the male gaze. For Your Pleasure was released as a gleaming gatefold, in a blue-black hue, showing a statuesque model (Amanda Lear) in tight black leather, walking a panther, silhouetted by a gleaming urban skyline, while a smiling Ferry, dressed like a chauffeur, waits next to a limo. It was an enthralling, modern image of desirability, danger, sexual satisfaction, and luxe living, a tableau as posed and planned as a fashion magazine spread of Helmut Newton photos. Like a lot of rock, the cover offers adolescents a misleading fantasy of what adult life is like. Throughout the album, the band is puffed up with ideas, and desperate to make an impression. Ferry summarizes his passions for artifice and postmodern thought in manifestos: “Part false, part true, like anything/We present ourselves,” he sings in a theatrical baritone that recalls, at various times, Noël Coward and Dracula. For Your Pleasure is happily pretentious and self-involved, the juncture where glam and prog meet with the greatest degree of success. Glam steals from prog’s song lengths and love of soloing, and prog swipes glam’s exclamation marks and sex appeal. Ferry was drawn to the anxious, feminine side of R&B, evident on the album’s most retro moment, “Beauty Queen,” which the band bookends into a salmagundi of a song, complete with tempo changes navigated by stalwart drummer Paul Thompson. Ferry is dumping a woman who has “swimming pool eyes,” but it sounds more like he’s pitching woo. He lavishes her with purple praise, promises she’ll be fine without him, and carefully lathers his words with his heaviest Scott Walker vibrato. Ferry, with his fondness for dualities, uses theatricality and even camp to prove his sincerity, implying that everything make-believe is also real, and vice versa. For Your Pleasure’s two longest songs, “The Bogus Man” and the album-closing title track, leave plenty of time for Eno’s deviations. This first sketches out a musical design for trance, years ahead of it, with a long, minimalist break that confirms Eno’s mantra, “Repetition is a form of change.” Each instrument mutates, minutely transmogrified, on some mysterious cycle. On “For Your Pleasure,” Ferry makes only a brief vocal appearance. Over the last four and a half minutes, producer Chris Thomas and Eno are playing the recording studio as though it’s an instrument, conducting the song at a mixing board, and building a panoramic disorientation. They add more echo on the electric piano, more reverb on the guitar, phasing, tremolo, the drums slip away, and it gently becomes hazy and puzzling: Chopped-up bits of “Chance Meeting” from Roxy’s first album come in—Roxy are sampling themselves—then Judi Dench murmurs, “You don’t ask why,” and almost randomly, la fin. An album that began with Ferry’s request for your attention ends with Eno placing you in the strange new world you were promised. A new sensation has delivered new sensations of arousal and uncertainty. Roxy aimed for a melding of American R&B and avant-garde European traditions (Mackay’s oboe on “For Your Pleasure” sounds like the last thing you’d hear before bees stung you to death). You don’t hear a struggle between Ferry and Eno, just two guys with similar ideas and a band juiced on its early success and acclaim, trying to get farther from earth while still holding on to the Marvelettes and the Shirelles. The playing is so adept and surprising, and Thompson and Manzanera do such strong jobs of grounding the music’s outlandish shifts, that you only slowly realize none of the album’s eight songs has a chorus. A few months after For Your Pleasure was released, Eno left the band, quitting before he could be fired, and starting an unparalleled career as a solo artist and producer. Bryan and Brian were incompatible. Ferry was a neurotic—Woody Allen trapped in the body of Cary Grant—while Eno was a disruptor. In interviews, Ferry withdrew like a turtle; Eno excelled at them, and talked fluidly about Marshall McLuhan, Steve Reich, or his ample pornography collection. Eno most avidly pursued the band’s androgynous style, and dressed like he was Quentin Crisp’s glam nephew (leopard print top, ostrich feather jacket, bondage choker, turquoise eye shadow). Out of the chute, he was a cult hero, and Ferry grew tired of hearing punters yell “EEEEEE-NO!” in the middle of ballads, or seeing Eno credited as his co-equal. The music had no immediate impact in the U.S., where it grazed the album chart at number 193. The band’s two-album deal with Warner Bros. had expired and the label happily left them go. American audiences, Ferry told a British interviewer, “are literally the dumbest in the world, bar none.” But in England, it was the album of the moment, and Roxy returned to TV’s Old Grey Whistle Test, where Whispering Bob Harris, a stodgy presenter who was still stuck in the ’60s, sneered at them, as he had the previous year as well, dismissing them as great packaging with no substance. The notion that style and substance were contradictory was a holdover from the ’60s, and it’s one that has never gone away, revived periodically by fans and critics who long for seeming authenticity. Years later, those Roxy TV appearances would start to feel almost as significant as the Beatles on Ed Sullivan. Harris’ contempt was recommendation enough for lots of kids, of myriad genders and sexualities, who would soon come to Roxy shows dressed in sparkling tunics, glowing frocks, and immaculate dinner jackets, boys and girls both in drag. But glamor and self-invention were only part of the aftereffect: Within the next few years, plenty of future punks and new wavers went on to art school, where they immediately started acting, dressing, and playing like Roxy Music.

Closer to Grey,Chromatics,by: Patric Fallon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9b558d49096a0009749adb/1:1/w_160/Chromatics_ClosertoGrey.jpg,2019-10-12 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/chromatics-closer-to-grey/,Italians Do It Better,"Across nearly 200 releases, L.A.-based producer Johnny Jewel’s Italians Do It Better label has perfected an unmistakable aesthetic. While the music ranges from abstract instrumentals to sugary synth-pop, the design of each record envisions its creators as would-be movie stars and their music as the cult classics we ought to remember them for. Few of the label’s many acts play so directly into the conceit as Chromatics. Since Jewel reinvented his band in the mid-2000s as a dark pop group with a taste for oblique theatrics, Chromatics have imagined their albums as soundtracks, imageless films in the language of music. It’s impossible to discern clear plots or specific characters from a given record, but that’s not the point. Jewel and his band—singer Ruth Radelet, drummer Nat Walker, and guitarist Adam Miller—excel at constructing settings and engulfing them in dramatic atmosphere. For 2007’s Night Drive, it was a meditative, lamplit film noir viewed through a car windshield. Kill for Love, released in 2012, played like a tumultuous, naive romance in the solitude of a Lynchian suburb. That Chromatics can conjure such elaborate moods with little more than a synth, drum machine, and guitar to accompany Radelet’s uncommonly restrained voice is testament to the strength of their vision. It may also explain why these albums take so long to finish. Jewel once said that his writing process involves recording multiple ideas at once, waiting for months, and then revisiting them to bring their meanings into focus. Given this circuitous approach, as well as Jewel’s numerous solo records and film scores, a seven-year gap between Chromatics albums is perhaps to be expected. Closer to Grey was announced only a day in advance, and its arrival wasn’t the only surprise: After teasing the now-mythic 21-track opus Dear Tommy for the past five years, Chromatics had instead put out their most modest record to date. Think of Closer to Grey as an auteur’s niche art project—satisfying to the superfans, though not necessarily winning over new ones. But like clever illusionists, Jewel and his assistants are no less enchanting for their sleight of hand. The subtlest gesture can feel hypnotic or horrific depending on the light. Echoing Kill for Love’s opening cover of Neil Young, Closer to Grey begins with a spooky, stripped-down version of Simon & Garfunkel’s “The Sound of Silence.” The sound of a match strike or a record-needle drop opens the song like the final motion in a séance ritual, before Radelet begins her quiet commune: “Hello darkness, my old friend.” It’s a dead-simple rendition—mostly organ drones, distant synth arpeggios, and a soft drum machine kick—yet it sets the tone for an album set at the witching hour, a sometimes-muddled tale of heartbroken lovers reaching out to the spirit realm. Closer to Grey is most captivating when it indulges these supernatural fascinations. Standout “Light as a Feather,” with its weightless harmonies and shuffling drum groove, feels like a musical ghost story. “I hear a voice, she whispers secrets from the dead,” Radelet sings in her usual demure tone, calling out to herself from beyond: “Nothing lasts forever.” The sense of otherworldly convergence returns on “Whispers in the Hall,” with enough dissonance and tense, Halloween-esque synth loops to qualify as the most ominous song in Chromatics’ catalog. The smoky “Touch Red” lingers beneath wakefulness, slipping into nightmares with the introduction of a distorted guitar. At its most striking moments, Closer to Grey recognizes the importance of pushing at the edges of a tried-and-true sound. When Jewel’s arrangements become too austere and his songwriting falls back on the overly familiar, the album loses some of its charm. The basic synth melodies and deadpan vocal hooks of “Twist the Knife” are more anemic than even this terminally cool band can pull off. The title track is paint-by-numbers Chromatics—understandably so, since it’s at least four years old. Its palm-muted guitar plucks, 4/4 drum beat, and melancholic melodies don’t sound bad, or even past their prime—but they have little to offer an album that shines when experimenting. The glockenspiel and sweeping strings on lovelorn ballad “Move a Mountain” might feel slightly out of place, but at least they’re unexpected. As with much of Jewel’s work, Closer to Grey’s ultimate enemy is time itself. He’s not attempting to outrun it so much as wrestle it, trying to bend bygone eras to his will. The five years between Night Drive and Kill for Love resulted in music that transcended an already exemplary blueprint for chilly disco-pop; the next seven were building slowly towards a monumental statement. Then, out of the blue, Closer to Grey arrived with a note explaining that it represents the seventh Chromatics album, effectively turning Dear Tommy (the would-be sixth) into a “lost” record. The switch-up adds a fascinating page to the band’s ongoing mythology, but it also robs Closer to Grey of its own narrative. By the band’s own telling, the best Chromatics record is the one you’ve never heard.","Chromatics set their surprise “seventh” album at the witching hour, telling a sometimes-muddled tale of heartbroken lovers reaching out to the spirit realm.

Sonic Citadel,Lightning Bolt,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9bb3431ff53200086cbe13/1:1/w_160/soniccitadel.jpg,2019-10-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lightning-bolt-sonic-citadel/,Thrill Jockey,"For 25 years now, Lightning Bolt has made a career out of indulging only the most gnarled riffs, covering every sound in brittle distortion, and playing live shows so loud and destructive that they—literally—blow out the power and leave the performers covered in blood. The duo’s dedication to this “move fast, break everything” mentality is still strong on Sonic Citadel, their seventh full-length album. The first song is called “Blow to the Head,” a three-minute blast of punishing kick drum, acrid bass riffs, and squealed vocals like a pile of styrofoam plates tossed on a bonfire. It’s as wonderfully ugly as anything they’ve ever made. They keep up this energy—standouts include the surreal anthems  “Bouncy House” and the Tilt-a-Whirl hardcore of “Tom Thump”—adding a handful of tracks to the pantheon of Lightning Bolt jams designed to keep your local audiologist in business. But where Sonic Citadel really takes off is in the moments where they deviate hardest from their formula. Underneath all the fuzz, there’s always been pop sensibility at work; Lightning Bolt riffs have been catchy in their own warped way since Ride the Skies. But at points, they allow those instincts to come into startling focus. That’s telegraphed, in part, in some of the song titles, which reference Don Henley, Husker Dü, and Van Halen. None of these jams especially sound like classic rock or hair metal, but they are some of the most memorable moments in the band’s catalog. “Don Henley in the Park” is an especially notable curveball, built around overlapping bass riffs that sound like a Durutti Column song as played by the Tasmanian Devil. Chippendale’s nursery-rhyme vocals would almost be fit for a sing-along, if you could make out what he’s saying. (The lyric sheet isn’t especially helpful on this score; it reads “[improvised lyrics].”) The record’s last vocal track, “All Insane,” is among the more straightforward songs in the Lightning Bolt catalog. Gibson does away with the frills and flourishes that often accompany his bass work as Chippendale settles into a steady mid-tempo beat, singing passionately of living life while the living is good. It’s surprising, but not unprecedented: Somewhere in the flailing limbs and searing volume of Lightning Bolt’s music was a call to squeeze everything you can out a moment, to do whatever it takes to feel something and to do so for as long as you can.

Movimiento Para Cambio,Pelada,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9f55d9147f60000949f069/1:1/w_160/Pelada_MovimientoParaCambio.jpg,2019-10-12 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pelada-movimiento-para-cambio/,Pan,"When Chris Vargas and Tobias Rochman first met as coworkers in a Montreal clothing shop, they clashed—“like oil and water,” Rochman says. But after Rochman’s solo project shared a bill with Vargas’ industrial band Pelvic Floor, something clicked. “We’re both strong-willed individuals,” says Rochman. “It’s better if we’re on the same side.” Together, as the duo Pelada, they fuse Rochman’s lithe house and techno productions with Vargas’ defiant Spanish-language vocals, sung-shouted in a thin yet forceful voice that cuts through the mix like broken glass. On Movimiento Para Cambio, their debut album, the duo’s opposing influences prove surprisingly complementary. Though punk and dance music make strange bedfellows, it’s not an unheard-of combination: The two styles commingled at the Mudd Club in the late 1970s, engendering a funk-punk fusion that, decades later, would bequeath DFA its founding aesthetic. And in the 1990s, Atari Teenage Riot grafted hardcore punk onto breakbeat hardcore, echoing the Prodigy’s snarling aggression. But the two traditions have rarely yielded a merger quite like this one. Rather than seeking overlap, Pelada exploit the disconnect between their respective backgrounds. On record, they still sound like oil and water. Vargas’ monotone shout is reedy and insistent, recalling hardcore punk’s classic declamatory style. Instead of responding with a correspondingly harsh sound, Rochman veers in the opposite direction, opting for velvety deep house descended from the lineage of Larry Heard. It’s an interesting proposition: Seduce listeners with reassuring sounds like the Korg M1 organ bass, a staple of ’90s dance pop, then shout them down like the singer at an all-ages hardcore matinee. The contrast is apparent on the opening song, “A Mí Me Juzgan Por Ser Mujer,” in which Vargas, who uses they/them pronouns, directs their fire at patriarchal instincts and male privilege—the “machitos” demanding more than they deserve. Stuttering chord stabs and breakbeats build to a surging, acid-fueled climax, but the quantized grid keeps the energy in check; Vargas’ chorus, on the other hand, drips with barely contained rage. “They judge me for being a woman/But I was born in this body,” they chant in Spanish, voice rising to a pointed shout; “I didn’t choose it and I don’t know what to do/This is out of my control.” Many of the album’s best songs are animated by this tension. In “Habla Tu Verdad” (“Speak Your Truth”), Vargas might just as well be standing at the front of a protest march, megaphone in hand, each chanted proclamation fit for a hand-lettered sign, while Rochman channels the brightly colored synth of Midwestern techno from the late 1990s. Sometimes, the two egg each other on. In “Desatado,” Vargas lies back, their voice flat and cool, while Rochmann builds the kind of bleepy, quick-stepping beat you might have heard from Aphex Twin’s Rephlex label in the 1990s. Then, as Vargas breaks into a shout, the music crescendos too, and the beat seems on the verge of pulling apart altogether. They have other modes: “Granadilla” is a kind of ambient spoken-word R&B, while “Caderona” fuses ’80s electro with reggaeton. Best of all might be the closing “Aquí,” an environmentalist anthem set to the lush chords of Balearic house. The mood is idyllic yet streaked with turbulence: As the steady beats cruise on, they snag and stumble; Vargas’ speaking voice, uncharacteristically placid, is periodically run through shuddering glitch effects. Throughout the album, questions of control are paramount: Who has it, and whom they wield it against. Here, Vargas declares in a matter-of-fact tone, “Nature controls us/Not vice versa,” and the song’s subtly fraught quality—lovely as a sunset, yet disturbed by a hidden undercurrent—feels like the duo’s way of acknowledging our fundamental vulnerability.","Velvety, ’90s-inspired deep house and industrial-punk sing-shouting make for a surprisingly complementary contrast.

Two Hands,Big Thief,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d656b501ce1350009a5d8e3/1:1/w_160/bigthief_twohands.jpg,2019-10-11 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/big-thief-two-hands/,4AD,"Coming from a band who, just five months ago, materialized somewhere deep in a forest with a mystical set of songs wrapped in a vast, alien cosmos—a band who, in order to summon the perfect squall of noise, claimed to have suspended an electric guitar from the ceiling of a barn and batted it around like a piñata in a circle of amplifiers—Two Hands is jarringly earthbound. For their latest album, the Brooklyn quartet Big Thief invites you to join them live and unadorned in the studio for the span of 10 songs. “Hand me that cable/Plug into anything,” Adrianne Lenker sings, moments after issuing a more basic instruction: “Cry with me/Cry with me.” Nearly every song overflows with tears and blood, bared teeth and broken tongues; living, killing, dying. There are few overdubs, and sometimes you hear the band members instructing each other when to step back or take a solo, like they’re just rehearsing for the actual performance. It makes for a specific kind of rock record: an attempt to capture a band’s imperfect, raw essence, to show what happens when they simply count to four and take off. The approach is best known for accentuating a tough, ragged cohesion, like Neil Young records in the ’70s, but this record goes somewhere different. The more Big Thief zoom in, the more magical they sound. It’s a trick that these musicians have spent their careers perfecting. Since their 2016 debut, Masterpiece, each successive album has felt like a breakthrough geared for larger spaces. But their own interpersonal dynamic has followed an inverse trajectory. “At this point we’re basically touching each other,” guitarist Buck Meek recently observed about their magnetic live shows, a connection made literal on the new album cover. After the spacious odes to the natural world on U.F.O.F, Two Hands is a record defined by these collisions—a reminder that intimacy isn’t just about the comfort we bring to each other but also the proximity to our sickness and pain, blood and guts. The record proceeds along a bell-curve, with the heavier moments at the center reverberating through the quieter points on either end. The focus is on the patient interplay between Lenker’s guitar—rhythmic and physical, like a slot machine with infinite outcomes—and James Krivchenia’s drumming, as patient and instinctive as it’s ever sounded. The accompaniment from Meek and bassist Max Oleartchik, who plays a few solos in “Those Girls,” is more understated but just as crucial. In sparer, creeping moments like “The Toy” and “Cut My Hair,” you can sense the band listening to each other, responding with reassuring hums and nods. And when they do cut loose, you feel the thrashing. Variations on the word “crying” appear in half these songs, and each time Lenker sings it, she tells a different story. Occasionally her lonesome, quivering voice feels like an outsider descendent of country-folk singers like Kath Bloom or Iris DeMent, particularly in “Replaced,” a co-write with Meek. Other times, she sounds like someone clawing at her own skin, trying to escape. In “Forgotten Eyes,” a heartland rocker whose lyrics might be about homelessness, she trembles uneasily toward the final chorus, holding out the “ng” of “tongue” until it makes a phlegmy, growling noise in the back of her throat. Big Thief were built for moments like these, where sound merges with meaning, where the floating voice in your headphones finds its body. As a lyricist, Lenker has become newly adept at telling stories through her absences. She’s written songs in the past that dazzle with poetry (“Mary”) and others that are memoiristic in their precision (“Mythological Beauty”), but these are pared down to just the most crucial bits of dialogue and wisdom. “Everybody needs a home and deserves protection,” she sings in “Forgotten Eyes,” her voice breaking at the word “needs.” “Talk to the boy in me/He’s there,” she begs in the closing “Cut My Hair” as the music cuts out from underneath her. Best of all is “Not,” a fiery exorcism that merges some of her most explosive imagery with a climactic guitar solo; the desperation in her playing feels like a string of cries interrupted by shallow, gasping breaths. “Not” sits at the heart of the record with “Shoulders,” a stunner that’s been in the band’s live repertoire for years. Like a dark analog to Bruce Springsteen’s “The Promised Land” or the Mountain Goats’ “This Year,” it gains power from its folk simplicity: a plaintive melody and a chorus that snowballs with a momentum that seems physical—part promise, part prayer. Lenker, who once noted that she is often both the attacker and prey in her own songwriting, finds its gospel not by rising above her circumstances but through succumbing to her complicity. “The blood of the man who’s killing our mother with his hands is in me,” she sings. “It’s in me/In my veins.” Her voice sounds genuinely desperate, anguished, like she would rid herself of it if she could. The version of “Shoulders” on Two Hands is the definitive take, though you can see its spirit in every live performance. During one particularly great video from Philadelphia’s Johnny Brenda’s in 2017, Lenker’s guitar cuts out during the first chorus. She takes it off and, for the rest of the song, is just a singer: pulling the microphone from the stand, closing her eyes, and doubling over as if in pain to deliver the second verse. Instead of picking up her guitar part, Lenker’s bandmates only highlight her absence, drawing your attention to the new void at the song’s core. By the end, all that’s left is Krivchenia’s steady drumbeat and Lenker front and center, sort of jogging in place, as everyone in the room holds their breath. It’s a random technical issue but it’s also a chance for Big Thief to pose their favorite kinds of challenges. How much can we strip away without losing our essence? What happens when our most basic modes of expression fail us? How will we carry on together? On Two Hands, they are unstoppable.

On a Clear Day I Can See You Forever,Lindstrøm,by: Jesse Dorris,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9b77e9a540790008f9ded9/1:1/w_160/Lindstrom_OnAClearDayICanSeeYouForever.jpg,2019-10-11 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lindstrom-on-a-clear-day-i-can-see-you-forever/,Smalltown Supersound,"Robert Moog’s mid-century, tinker-friendly analog synthesizers were originally “hammered out in the pub” and “assembled out of junk,” write Trevor Pinch and Frank Trocco in Analogue Days: The Invention and Impact of the Moog Synthesizer. The dream was to make sounds like nothing else on Earth, which could be then be made by absolutely anyone on Earth. But by the 1980s, the dream was fading. Moog’s instruments were, in the end, whimsical and unwieldy. Bigger companies made simpler, more powerful machines. The Memorymoog, in 1982, would be the last thing Moog made for decades, and it was a polyphonic powerhouse. But it lacked touch sensitivity, which meant it basically just played loud, and its presets varied wildly; users switching from machine to machine had to pray the strings didn’t sound like brass. In a Hail Mary pass to stay solvent, Moog salesman David Van Koevering, a former evangelical preacher, repackaged a hundred or so unsold models as “Sanctuary Synthesizers,” added a bunch of pious patches, and sold the lot to Christian music makers. Bankruptcy still arrived. Then a cult arose around these wooden boxes of wires. Devotees turned the Moog, like relics of the houses of Korg, ARP, and Roland, into a status symbol. Original Moogs are now incredibly expensive, both in terms of cost and the time it takes to learn to use and maintain them. They look great among the fiddle-leaf fig trees on your frenemy’s feed. They are fetish objects at last, prized more for what they are than what they can do. None of this is Hans-Peter Lindstrøm’s fault. Over the course of his 16-year-career he’s floated to the front of the third-wave analog revival, lifting the wow and flutter of predecessors like Stereolab and Faze Action and sending them into a Scandinavian disco jam-band dimension. Tracks like “Closing Shot,” “Blinded by the LEDs,” and of course the deathless “I Feel Space” demonstrated a command of form and function. Clearly he’s mastered his machinery: On a Clear Day I Can See You Forever arrives in the wake of his performance at Henie Onstad Kunstsenter, commissioned on the occasion of the art space’s 50th anniversary and conscripting untold riches to procure some 30 hard-to-source synthesizers and drum machines. One of them, a Memorymoog, as it happens, forms the foundation of the new album’s title track. He dusted one off and explored what he could do with it in 10 minutes, then played it back in reverse while improvising on the Fender Rhodes; a little perfuming with a Hammond through a wah-wah and some spring-reverbs, and, well, the sum of the parts is the sum of the track. The genius of, for example, those old Boards of Canada interludes was how they dissipated before their mystery ran out. “On a Clear Day I Can See You Forever” instead hopes for meaning through repetition, exploiting the precariousness of its electrical pulses as they stream through metal effects units. A rumble about eight minutes in scared the devil out of my cats, but soon enough they were snoring again in a puddle of sun. The second track, “Really Deep Snow,” is anchored by a covetable Roland SH-101 and administered by various ARPs, Korgs, and Wurlitzers. It’s another almost 10-minute improv, whose main chords pay tribute to a psalm Lindstrøm heard in church as a child. Its vibe is certainly more Halloween (2018), though, a reincarnation of unholy terror as the anxiety of influence. John Carpenter was, without a doubt, the patron saint of arpeggiated epics; “Really Deep Snow” is a pious tribute, if one is needed. Which can’t be said of the third track, titled by a lousy joke that feels, well, profane. How about we not appropriate the sacrament of an African American spiritual promising biblical deliverance from slavery in the service of a hardware pun? How about we not “Swing Low, Sweet LFO,” with its plinky Pianet and sugary Prophet 6 sweeps, less offensive than Moby’s appropriation of spirituals for car commercials but also, unfortunately, very much not as memorable? Still, as in Christianity, redemption comes in the end. “As If No One Is Here” reincarnates a tone poem by Jean Sibelius, itself based on the Finnish national epic Kalevala, which tells the story of a swan being hunted in the realm of the dead. And that’s exactly what it sounds like: a murky suspension of endangered grace. A Roland TR-77 drips like water off stalactites into pools of Yamaha CS-60 chords, deeper than they first appear. Halfway through, acoustic cello and violin cut through like slits of moonlight and everything stills without settling down. Korg MS20 and ARP Solina Strings summon grimmer harmonies. There are echoes of Eno and Badalamenti, though “As If No One Is Here” feels looser than either would allow; perhaps Lindstrøm is better at mixing inspiration than at improvisation new forms. Nonetheless, in moments, On a Clear Day I Can See You Forever is proof that there’s reason to have faith in these elite objects, these inventions of the dead that still somehow call out to us. Ignore the yuppie collectors who think that owning something improves their worth, or that hoarding these rarities will somehow save them from the grave. Lindstrøm may have timed these tracks to fit on a vinyl record, another sign of putting material concerns over creative vision, but there’s a good 15 minutes of so of beauty within those grooves that just might make a believer out of you.

Odds Against Tomorrow,Bill Orcutt,by: Jonathan Williger,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d6592dfc7e6ee0009d820f3/1:1/w_160/odds_orcutt.jpg,2019-10-11 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bill-orcutt-odds-against-tomorrow/,Palilalia,"Malleability is built into the character of American traditional music. Rooted in oral storytelling, foundational songs like the “Battle Hymn of the Republic” and “Oh Shenandoah” have been known by several names and attached to various meanings and ideologies over the decades. The former has had multiple lives since it emerged as a popular tune in the mid 1800s: Pete Seeger anthemized it as “Solidarity Forever,” which guitarist Bill Orcutt recorded on his 2013 album A History of Every One, offering one of the most radical takes on the melody in its nearly two-century lifespan. Orcutt takes the elasticity inherent in folk music and augments it with avant-garde jazz and free improvisation, two other distinctly American forms. A dialogue between these traditions has formed the basis of Orcutt’s solo albums over the past decade, as he has recorded lacerated versions of “Star Spangled Banner,” “Nearer My God to Thee,” “Black Betty,” and other well-worn songs. Odds Against Tomorrow, Orcutt’s latest solo LP, steps away from overt renditions of popular melodies and returns to a subtler investigation of folk and blues. The raw melancholy lurking in the shadows of recordings by pioneers like Son House, Blind Lemon Jefferson, and Charley Patton also hangs heavy over Orcutt’s original compositions. On his early solo releases, most notably A New Way to Pay Old Debts, from 2009, and the follow-up EP Way Down South, his mournful themes were punctuated by spasms of pentatonic runs and extemporaneous howling, giving the music a wild, unrestrained nature. By contrast, Orcutt’s playing on Odds Against Tomorrow is notably restrained and frequently threatens beauty. While earlier LPs felt like spontaneous outpourings, this album feels worked over, informed by lessons learned from the iconic composers he has spent the past half-decade recontextualizing. One of the most notable indicators of this approach is Orcutt’s use of multitracking on three songs, a first in his solo career. On the title track, he traces an understated chord progression in the left channel, allowing the song’s fractured melodic line to dissolve and reconstitute itself in the right, peaking in a wailing, single-note outburst. Rather than boxing the songs into a distinctive harmonic path, the technique allows Orcutt to indulge in more intricately crafted solos, dexterously flying up and down the neck of his four-string electric guitar. If his early work channeled Ornette Coleman in its ability to imply complex changes without their constant, explicit presence, this new technique brings him closer to the conventional electric blues pantheon. Despite these increasingly polyphonic excursions, Odds Against Tomorrow is defined largely by a considered quietude. The one cover on the album, an arrangement of Henry Mancini’s “Moon River,” feels enveloped by negative space, serenely picked with a slight tremolo effect. Album closer “Man Dies” is two minutes of a sentimental, unadorned melody that ends with the buzz of an amplifier decaying into nothingness. Orcutt’s slow transformation from antagonistic abstractionist to wistful minimalist has had many detours, and he continues to explore torrential exuberance in his collaborative work, especially with free-jazz drummer Chris Corsano. But on Odds Against Tomorrow he has found a way to settle down without settling into complacency. The album retains the core elements of his best work, and his restless, postmodern exploration of the American lexicon, while refining what makes those qualities potent. Refusing to repeat himself, he takes tradition as a living thing, blazing new trails to familiar vistas.","Stepping away from the overt historicism of previous recordings, the guitarist opts for a subtler—but just as expressive—investigation of folk and blues.

Terror Management,billy woods,by: Stephen Kearse,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9bb13c2fc1930008a608ab/1:1/w_160/terrormanagement.jpg,2019-10-11 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/billy-woods-terror-management/,Backwoodz Studioz,"Terror Management begins with a clip of Kurt Vonnegut explaining narrative arcs. The most common story structure, he argues, is “man in a hole,” which he breaks down as “somebody gets into trouble, gets out of it again.” Vonnegut’s audience laughs, but in billy woods’ world, holes tend to be bottomless. His last album was March’s hiding places, a record set in crawl spaces and crags where men in holes settle into the sediment instead of plotting escape. Terror Management, written immediately after hiding places, doubles down on that fatalism, sinking into the darkness at the bottom of the well. The album’s cover is a jagged ice plain with a fleck of a sun in the distant horizon, and woods channels that sense of chilled abandonment throughout the record, finding misery everywhere he looks: cancelled Christmases, dead spiders stuck in webs, splintered glaciers. The imagery is crisp but plotless; instead of characters, woods offers landscapes. “The sky empty, trees like widows huddled/The bore muzzle nuzzle, iridescent black truffle/Black snow in the forest,” he raps on “Shepherd’s Tone” He sounds like he’s narrating satellite footage. That sense of dreadful stillness is amplified by the production, which is often tenuously connected to the writing. On “Gas Leak” a blast wave of distortion detonates in the middle of the song, presumably dramatizing the title but also disrupting the momentum. On “Blood Thinner,” hisses and crackles sizzle in the foreground at a steady clip. woods is clearly trying to evoke tension and paranoia, but the result too often feels cluttered and airless. The record catches steam around the midway point, where woods taps into the sentiments behind his obsession with bleakness. His freeform, street-preacher flow works wonders on “Birdsong,” winding into volleys of gut punches. “First time he saw the word nigga in a book/How it danced on the page/Back in the day/It’s what the family didn't say/How you knew it was AIDS,” he raps. “Trivial Pursuit” turns Open Mike Eagle’s album Rappers Will Die of Natural Causes into a funny conspiracy: “Rappers dying in they sleep/I’m watching Mike Eagle on TV/It ain’t just luck, chief.” Moments like these are reminders that the miseries and absurdities of the late capitalist hellscape are sensory and personal. The abyss is an experience, not just a setting. Album highlight “Great Fires” centers on the permanence of a breakup, presumably woods’ divorce. woods is oblique throughout, never citing a decisive scene of rupture, but never disputing that the relationship was doomed. “Sleep a steep fall, wake up like a stray dog/You wonder where she found the strength not to call/You’re proud of her, you know what it cost,” he laments, stuck in the aftermath. Built around a tinny horn loop and dusty drums, the song swells to a despondent utterance of the former lover’s name that’s jaggedly overdubbed with the word “love.” The insertion sucks the wind out of woods and lays bare the kinds of losses he sees in the desolation he’s so intent on cataloging. In 2013 billy woods described himself as the bridge between late Zimbabwean novelist Dambudzo Marechera and Earl Sweatshirt. There was a defiant pride in that claim, a conviction that despite Marechera’s death from AIDS in the ’80s, and woods’ obscurity, the lineage of artful African perspectives on Western terrors would persist. In 2019 Marechera is still dead, the Klan is active in Kurt Vonnegut’s native Indiana, and Earl regularly tweets billy woods lyrics. The world is absolutely the shitshow woods knows it to be, but even the apocalypse has its charms.","On his bleak new album, woods doubles down on the misery that snakes through all his music.

Old LP,that dog.,by: Maura Johnston,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d97a3c6a540790008f9ddf3/1:1/w_160/old_thatdog.jpg,2019-10-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/that-dog-old/,UME,"In their ’90s heyday, that dog. existed in between two major pillars of alt-rock: Grungy, bemusedly annoyed rock and zingy, precisely detailed alt-pop. An L.A. band whose pedigree included music-biz royalty—lead singer and songwriter Anna Waronker is the daughter of label exec Lenny Waronker, while sisters Rachel and Petra Haden, who provided backing vocals and instrumentals, are children of jazz bassist Charlie Haden—they developed a fierce following from the periphery of alt-rock radio, which had already begun to sideline fun (and female voices) in favor of self-pity by the time the group broke up in 1997. that dog. got back together in 2011 as a four-piece, along with drummer Tony Maxwell. Playing their songs—particularly those that they hadn’t played live before—energized Waronker, whose hiatus years included a rock opera co-written with Go-Go Charlotte Caffey, music for TV, and two solo albums, to return to the spiky, elegant mode of her onetime band. What’s remarkable about Old LP, that dog.’s first album since their split and their first as a trio (Petra left after the reunion shows), is how little time seems to have elapsed. The harmonies still have gooey centers; the fuzzed-out guitars and precisely arranged strings still bounce off each other like highly attuned dancers. Compact and thoughtful—the band worked on the album for years—Old LP has the vibe of a beloved record that was, for whatever reason, sitting on a shelf. The album opens with “Your Machine,” a showcase for Waronker’s plaintive vocals that crests into a full-on power-pop starburst, as distortion-heavy riffs rise up to counter her pleas for notice. “I am incomplete/Impatiently/Awaiting your receipt/And graciously/Eating crumbs thrown at my feet,” goes one lyric, a poetic echo of the “thanks for your support!” messages issued by artists in the era of online patronage. When the noise eventually recedes, allowing Waronker and the harmonies behind her to rise up, it’s a moment of pop triumph. From there, that dog. balance beauty and muck, with marshmallow-sweet vocals and careening strings adding tension to the breakneck chorus of “Just the Way” and the weepy violins of “Drip Drops” filling out the lyrics’ minimalistic portrayal of heartbreak. “If You Just Didn’t Do It” sounds excavated from a lost volume of DGC Rarities, with a shimmying beat and defiant, closing string flourish that offer a subtle update of ’90s alt-rock’s satisfying bite. Like much of the best 2019 music from still-at-it ’90s alt-rockers—Juliana Hatfield, Versus, Team Dresch—Old LP works because its growth doesn’t pander to modern notions of “cool.” But the way the band re-balances the grime-vs.-grandiosity equation with each song demonstrates that when it comes to musical math, the proof matters as much as the outcome. The title track, which closes the album, isn’t just a sweet elegy to music’s power to conjure bittersweet memories. “I never wanted you to leave/I hate that there’s no choice/That I can’t hear your voice/Unless it’s on an old LP,” go the lyrics, which were written after a memorial service for Charlie Haden. It’s the first time Waronker and Rachel Haden have sung a duet on record, their voices darting in and out of each other while cymbals crash and strings swoon. Looking back, which Old LP does with gentleness and honesty, doesn’t have to be a nostalgia trap.

Tell All Your Friends,Taking Back Sunday,by: Owen Myers ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9b6f4a90fe870008f50bcf/1:1/w_160/TakingBackSunday_TellAllYourFriends.jpg,2019-10-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/taking-back-sunday-tell-all-your-friends/,Craft,"If there was ever a visual metaphor for emo’s second wave, it’s a gang of women in tank tops kicking the shit out of a skinny white guy. That iconic image, a flip of David Fincher’s Fight Club from the video for Taking Back Sunday’s “Cute Without the E (Cut From the Team),” broadly symbolizes a wave of early ‘00s bands who’d been downhearted and used pop and post-hardcore to expose their freshly picked scabs. But the video’s scene was also on-the-nose to the point of being camp, marking the divergent path that Taking Back Sunday took from their peers. Their music described all the ways of being an emotional punching bag even as it sent up bleeding-heart stereotypes. The balance between wit and sincerity courses through their newly-remastered, still gripping debut, 2002’s Tell All Your Friends. Taking Back Sunday’s members came from the kind of suburban towns that have a way of magnifying anxiety, isolation, and paranoia into high-stakes urgency. In 1999, the five-piece formed in Amityville, New York, leading their then-label Victory Records to proclaim that “a city that has been synonymous with nothing but horror since the 1979 release of The Amityville Horror is about to be redefined.” But given the near-universal concerns of their landmark debut Tell All Your Friends—heartbreak, jealousy, and depression, elevated to an operatic intensity—the five-piece could have come from just about any out-of-the-way place in the U.S. The stretch of grey highway depicted on the cover of their debut album Tell All Your Friends is about as region-specific as a McDonald’s. Their sound, though, had tell-tale antecedents in Long Island’s thriving late-’90s punk scene and post-hardcore across the nation. The hooks of the Get Up Kids, the intensity of Thursday, and the post-rockish flourishes of Cap’n Jazz come together in Taking Back Sunday’s taut, poppy anthems, while also leaving a breadcrumb trail for fans to go deeper into the genre. Guitarist Eddie Reyes had played in bands including the Movielife, and the call-and-response vocals of another former band, Clockwise, inspired Adam Lazzara and John Nolan’s fevered duels. On Tell All Your Friends, every instrument pushes against each other. Frontman Adam Lazzara—a microphone masochist with the swooping hair of a Funko Pop! figurine—delivers the album’s opening lines as if he’s been waiting his whole life to do it. “So sick so sick of being tired, and oh so tired of being sick.” Later, a chorus-slash-manifesto arrives alongside guitars that hit like an electrical current’s surge. “We won’t stand for hazy eyes anymore.” It’s a sublime bit of chest-puffing nonsense, a stake in the ground that’s twisted until it holds fast. The psyche of young, white, cis straight men is dissected with startling candor. “Ghost Man on Third” is a brutally vivid chronicle of addiction and suicidal ideation, on which Lazzara wrenchingly repeats the line, “It’s a shame I don’t think that they’ll notice.” Meanwhile, “Bike Scene,” with gorgeous backing vocals from Nolan’s sister Michelle DaRosa, fits in a hundred hooks while it evokes post-heartbreak depression. “The Blue Channel” takes a sleazy riff and soaks it in screams, before Lazzara’s taunting whisper at the song’s close: “Do you know what your girl’s been up to?” At times like this, author Jessica Hopper’s description of women in emo songs comes to mind. They are, she wrote in a 2003 essay, “denied the dignity of humanization through both the language and narratives [...] only of consequence in romantic settings.” It’s hard to deny this read of Tell All Your Friends’ lyrics. But the band knowingly play into emo’s tropes—by 2002, already well-worn—with a knowing wink. Women are addressed as “sweetie” and “princess,” terms that endow their songs the satirical register of screwball comedy. You can imagine Cary Grant delivering a quip like “Cute Without the E”’s “don’t bother, angel,” through a plume of cigarette smoke. And “You’re So Last Summer”’s unforgettable line—“You could slit my throat/And with my one last gasping breath I’d apologize for bleeding on your shirt”—is both achingly real and downright absurd, a humorous quality hammered home by Flava Flav’s bizarre lip-sync to the lines in the song’s video. In a 2003 Absolute Punk interview, Nolan explained his and Lazzara’s psychodramatic reenactments of a straight couple’s dialogue in their music: “Me and Adam had an idea originally to have some of the lyrics written like a play where one line is the boy and the next line is the girl,” he said. This fluidity, coupled with Lazzara’s slash fic-catalyzing hangouts with other emo frontmen, allows for delightfully queer readings of songs like “You’re So Last Summer,” on which Lazzara belts, “These grass stains on my knees they don’t mean a thing.” (He’s recounting the speech of a woman. But he’s still the one saying it.) Taking Back Sunday’s innate flamboyance, coupled with their songs’ willful slippage of gender binaries, makes them a complicating outlier in a largely straight scene which privileged cis male voices even as their lyrics ultimately upheld its supportive pillars. Even so, the most compelling relationship cataloged in Tell All Your Friends is the flame war between Taking Back Sunday and Brand New’s Jesse Lacey (2017 reports alleged that Lacey is a sexual abuser and pedophile). A former member of the band, Lacey was allegedly kicked out of Taking Back Sunday after romancing Nolan’s girlfriend, and responded with 2001’s cruelly catchy DUI fantasy, “Seventy Times 7.” The Amityville band turned Lacey’s words against him in the math-y anthem “There’s No ‘I’ in Team,” but everyone involved seemed to revel in the drama; the bands came together to perform a mash-up of the two songs a few months after Tell All Your Friends’ release. Real-life context seemed to undermine any real threat of lyrics like “best friends means I pulled the trigger,” stoking the mythos of both groups. Adding credence to the theory that the rivalry was only skin deep, you could buy the Team Brand New or Team Taking Back Sunday shirt. Unbeknownst to the band members who made the album while just grazing legal drinking age, Tell All Your Friends was a pivot point for second-wave emo. The genre exploded in late 2004 and into 2005 as Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance became TRL staples and Taking Back Sunday’s second album, 2004’s Where You Want to Be, sold 163,000 copies in its first week, a staggering number even in the CD era. But Tell All Your Friends still stands for being young, being horny, being a troll. It was a high-water mark at a moment just before everything changed.

Hello Exile,The Menzingers,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9b7250a540790008f9ded6/1:1/w_160/HelloExile_TheMenzingers.jpg,2019-10-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-menzingers-hello-exile/,Epitaph,"The Menzingers write about basically one thing, though contrary to this tweet, it’s not the waitress outside the all-night diner. The seven-year span from their second LP Chamberlain Waits to 2017’s After the Party is a longitudinal study of men in their 20s struggling to process the passage of time, drinking away the tragicomic pain of reliving the good ol’ days that never happened. Imagine “Glory Days” if it was just the third verse, the high-school jocks and heartbreakers replaced by guys in dumpy vans and stalled relationships wishing they committed themselves to something more substantial—or as “House on Fire” put it, “waiting for your life to start, then you die.” After the Party occasionally gave the impression that the Menzingers recognized this form of nostalgia as an artistic dead end, posing “Where we gonna go now that our 20s are over?” as an existential crisis. Instead, Hello Exile reframes it as a question with a single, obvious answer: They’re gonna go right back to making Menzingers songs about getting older. “How do I steer my early 30s/Before I shipwreck, before I’m 40,” Greg Barnett announces at the outset, and despite the parallels to the aforementioned line from After the Party opener “Tellin’ Lies,” the intention is different—there’s an unexpected optimism amidst the pervasive societal turmoil of “America (You’re Freaking Me Out),” a willingness to see a wasted 20s as a dry run for responsible adulthood instead of a sunk cost or an endlessly renewable resource for self-loathing. Like most bands in their position, Menzingers commit to living in the moment by proclaiming “we do politics now.” While the title of “Strawberry Mansion” would usually promise yet another hardscrabble account of drinking Keystone Light in the Keystone State, this time, the Menzingers describe the impending environmental apocalypse in the same language as “Born to Run” (“Set a course for the sun/To bittersweet oblivion”). And while none of Barnett’s insights on “America (You’re Freaking Me Out)” are remotely original—“What kind of monsters did our parents vote for?”; “Cranks for Christians in powerful positions/I’ve always felt like all their pomp and circumstance is just cover for the devil to dance”; “Can’t you recognize truth from clever lies?”— they paint a sympathetic and empathetic portrait. Menzingers’ narrators aren’t radicals, and neither are the Menzingers; their musical progressions are incremental and headed towards predictable outcomes. The slower songs are a little bit more country, the more uptempo ones a bit more rootsy, and all of it is bolstered by typically brawny Will Yip production that cuts through the chatter of any barroom or basement. Since they perfected their craft with On the Impossible Past, the boundary between Menzingers songs and parodic “Menzingers songs” has all but disappeared, undermining their heartfelt honesty with bingo cards of burly, sensitive-rock-guy tropes seen through Pabst-colored lenses. “I was getting fucked up with a high school friend/Wondering where all the good times went”; “I know what you’re thinking but I can’t stop drinking”; those used to be the subtexts of Menzingers songs, but now they’re choruses on songs literally called “High School Friend” and “I Can’t Stop Drinking.”  The plot to “Anna” is quintessential “Menzingers”—a guy starts to realize his girlfriend’s outgrowing him (“It’s like our studio apartment is just a place to keep your stuff”) and can’t summon the confidence to make up the ground between them. Instead, he begs her “please come back to Philadelphia” so they can relive their first days living together, dancing in the kitchen and “drinking cheap red wine.” As it is in many Menzingers songs (scare quotes or otherwise), “cheap” is an important qualifier, one that cuts against Anna’s job promotion and newfound upward mobility. While people might not ever face abject poverty in a Menzingers song, they’re always one squandered paycheck or shitty tour away from couch-surfing for the next year. But throughout Hello Exile, “cheap” ends up exposing a poverty of new ideas: Barnett wants to rekindle a relationship on “Portland” with “cheap Champagne and roses”; he swears this “cheap motel” is temporary on “Strain Your Memory,” even though you’ll find him plastered off “cheap beer” in “I Can’t Stop Drinking,” and when everyone comes together in a “Farewell Youth,” they’re “drinking the cheap stuff.” “Farewell youth, I hardly got to know you,” Barnett sings, but even though they get older, “Menzingers songs” remain the same.

Phantom Rhythm 幽靈節奏 (幽霊リズム),Gong Gong Gong 工工工,by: Linnie Greene,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d978992979349000933d25f/1:1/w_160/gonggonggong.jpg,2019-10-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gong-gong-gong-phantom-rhythm/,Wharf Cat,"A couple of misfits and a brash bouquet of sound: These are the building blocks from which rock’n’roll sprang. Beijing-based Gong Gong Gong slot directly into the canon—the streamlined duo of Tom Ng and Joshua Frank use two of the most familiar instruments in the rock pantheon, a rhythm guitar and a bass, to create Phantom Rhythm 幽靈節奏. The result is a novel pastiche of post-punk, West African blues, Bo Diddley, and distortion. Ng and Frank started playing together in 2015 under their adopted city’s underpasses and in DIY spaces. Even with crisp production, this record (their first, after 2018’s Siren 7"") indicates a pair capable of holding its own in a repurposed warehouse or shipping crate. Their divergent backgrounds—Ng grew up in Hong Kong, and Montreal-born Frank has lived in Beijing off and on since childhood—yields a complementary chemistry. Adding drums or keys would be an intrusion. Gong Gong Gong stack garage instrumentation, Ali Farka Touré melodies, and dissonance without a whiff of the baroque. Opener “The Last Note” casts an ominous, unrelenting spell, building steadily towards Ng’s deadpan Cantonese intonations. It’s a refusal to capitulate on multiple fronts—language, fervor, unnecessary flourishes. By minute four, the fervent, interwoven riffs evoke the sinews of a charging beast. The album reaches its zenith midway through, where standouts “Wei Wei Wei” and “Some Kind of Demon” follow in succession. These songs follow a similar structure as most others—an insistent, galloping rhythm overlaid with guttural cries and a sinuous riff. “Wei Wei Wei”’s opening fuzz leads into a faux-casual plod, charting a steady ascent into rhythmic abandon, order teasing at chaos. It’s music that engages one’s entire body. “It’s a pity/As long as/Can only/But not/Still,” Ng yelps on “Some Kind of Demon,” the choked lyrics in direct opposition to the music’s metronomic swagger. In its spareness and meticulousness, Phantom Rhythm 幽靈節奏 leaves so little room for missteps that every reverberation proves to be an act of curation and collaboration. If there’s a critique to be made here, it’s that some tracks (“Moonshadows,” for instance) pale in comparison to their freakier counterparts, whose jazzy rhythms elevate them beyond their component parts. Even so, Ng’s screech in the second half of “Moonshadows” is a fork stuck into a live outlet. At their best, Gong Gong Gong point towards a future where (porous) borders and a vast palette of influences facilitate interesting collaboration. When they’re plugged in, driving towards a chorus or bridge, they sound like an engine of revelation.

Ghosteen,Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d97999832a22700089555c2/1:1/w_160/ghosteen.jpg,2019-10-09 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nick-cave-and-the-bad-seeds-ghosteen/,Ghosteen Ltd,"On the sublime Ghosteen—the first album Nick Cave has written and recorded entirely since the death of his teenage son, Arthur, in 2015—he sorts through his grief and all the requisite stages, occasionally as though in real time. His mood drifts between domesticity and depravity. He empathizes with the true believers who wept beneath Jesus’ feet at the crucifixion. He latches onto friendship and love in any shape they take. He loses his faith, then fights desperately for any belief that can replace it. Scored by synthesizers, pianos, and electronics, the process is alternately harrowing and comforting for the first hour of the album, Cave’s waking nightmare on full display. But then, in the album’s final verse, at the close of the dangerous “Hollywood,” he steps back from the edge of a nervous collapse to paraphrase a Buddhist parable in his fractured falsetto: “Kisa had a baby, but the baby died,” he sings. And so begins “The Mustard Seed,” a tale in which a mourning mother, Kisa Gotami, tries to save her baby by asking for seeds from houses where no one has died, as prescribed by the Buddha. Alas, someone has already died in every other house, so Kisa is left to bury her child and manage another home where the specter of death has crept across the threshold. “It’s a long way to go to find peace of mind,” Cave repeats at the end, the bassline’s tension and his wounded tone emphasizing the cold irony of the epiphany. Still, the takeaway is clear: He has not been alone in his sadness, and neither will you when the time comes. A little more than a year had passed since Arthur’s death when Cave released Skeleton Tree, a masterful record that, like the best of his catalog, used our mortality as way of considering what matters most. Hearing it as anything other than a response to the recent tragedy seemed nearly impossible. But the accident only informed Skeleton Tree, a new solemnity settling over the songs like morning mist. Ghosteen, however, squares up to the aftermath and to feelings of loss so overwhelming that Cave—“a man mad with grief”—questions the foundations of his sanity. There are moments where he nearly comes apart, holding himself together only by denying that death is final and believing that, maybe on the next train, his child will return. But he slowly wrestles hope from that existential abyss. Cave does not sublimate tragedy into triumph; he simply finds assurance in the knowledge that we’ve all walked through some sort of hell. That realization is the core of what may be the most poignant album of his storied career. Though Cave has long stood at the edge of darkness and tried to document what he felt there, writing about his family’s own tragedy proved vexing. His new songs didn’t ferry adequate emotional weight, he confided in The Guardian, and the singer who had once contextualized a convict’s trip to the electric chair as a sinner’s visit to confession had tired of the disingenuous tidiness of narrative. Soon, though, he found himself “amassing a stockpile of lines and thoughts, images and ideas,” forsaking his traditional sense of song for an atmosphere of intuition and feeling. That’s where we find him on Ghosteen, sorting through sensations of despair and persistence. Cave has cryptically said that the songs on Ghosteen’s first half are the children, while the interwoven triptych that follows are their parents. Those final three pieces are discursive and raw, pulling the broad emotional sweep of grief into a series of overstuffed settings. During “Ghosteen,” Cave counterbalances the wonder of being alive at all—broadcast over a sudden surge of strings and the record’s only cavalcade of drums—with the pedestrian cruelty of washing his dead child’s clothes or realizing almost absentmindedly that his family is now smaller. And “Hollywood” begins with seething rage, Cave looking to lash out at anything within reach, to hold even nature itself responsible for his loss while he waits for his own death. In the end, he relays the fable of Kisa, calming his nerves not with the company of others’ misery but with the wisdom that our sadness is but a point on an ancient timeline. The eight “children” are filtered and discrete, each investigating another side of what it means to bear the unbearable. Cave slips through phases of nostalgia and fantasy, fragments of lullabies and vows of love. He realizes that his art will outlive his body during opener “Spinning Song,” a surrealist rumination on Elvis and Priscilla Presley and their downfall. Cave and his wife, model and fashion designer Susie Bick, navigate their mindsets differently during “Waiting for You.” She wants to confront the truth and stare down reality, while he seeks refuge by longing for an ecclesiastic miracle—if an entire religion can rest on a belief in resurrection and afterlife, cannot fatherhood? Both are reasonable, he concludes, crooning, “Just want to stay in the business of making you happy.” Cave returns to the shores of compromise, finding safety in companionship. Likewise, the gorgeous “Bright Horses” opens inside a realm of imaginary terror, where horses dash through cities with their manes ablaze. He holds someone’s hand, protecting them from the fires. Even when that alternate world crumbles to reveal a swath of sociopolitical failure, he seeks some hypothetical redemption, some future brighter than his present. “Everyone has a heart, and it’s calling for something/And we’re all so sick and tired of seeing things as they are,” he deadpans in a stunning moment of functional escapism, reminding us that it’s OK to dream of the world we want, not the one we inherited. It’s impossible not to pull for him, to believe in his belief. As listeners, we mostly hover alongside Cave, floating in a middle distance shaped by Warren Ellis’ sprawling synthesizers and gilded by elegiac piano and scrambled samples, like signals dispatched from the great beyond. The Bad Seeds have long been a mighty rock band, prowling the darkened corners of the blues and the avant-garde. But they bend completely to Cave’s will here, not receding in the background so much as framing his self-portraits. This is the most musically esoteric record they’ve ever made, suspended somewhere between the urgent but obtuse abstraction of Current 93’s Black Ships Ate the Sky and the charged soundscapes of Harmonia. Their restraint strips away all emotional armaments, placing each of Cave’s vulnerabilities at the record’s humming surface. Cave doesn’t blink. Though secondary to the script, the production is sophisticated and subtle, often augmenting Cave’s words with shades of feeling and meaning he’s omitted from his text. There’s the chiming church bell that keeps the rhythm of “Night Raid,” a half-spoken recollection of Cave’s family gathered in a hotel room, laughing and leaning from the window to take in the streetscape below. The bell’s sound is initially warm and round, a signifier of the bustling city. But by song’s end, it arrives harder and faster, like a beeping alarm clock. It is a warning dispatched from the future, a damning promise that this happiness will end. Or there’s the choir that echoes his aspirational words during “Galleon Ship,” a song about committing to love, although you know it’s bound to bring pain. The voices are phased between the channels, surrounding Cave so that their pronouncements arrive at different times. The effect is vertiginous and disorienting, just as setting yourself up for hurt can be. The sound is so beautiful, though, you reckon it must be worth the risk. Ghosteen marks the 40th anniversary of Nick Cave’s recording career, a span that’s especially daunting considering that he has rarely released a clunker. For the uninitiated, it can seem intimidating to tap into new music by this kind of legacy artist, to dive into a massive body of work by someone with such a mythology. We tend to wait, frankly, until they’re dead, so we can more readily see how it all fits together. But you don’t need to be an expert in Cave’s wider cosmology to be swept inside of Ghosteen, to be devastated by its despair and lifted higher by its humanity. You only need the ability to suffer and the desire to survive.

Over It,Summer Walker,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d97a05532a22700089555c5/1:1/w_160/overit.jpeg,2019-10-09 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/summer-walker-over-it/,Interscope,"Summer Walker’s slow-groove R&B sounds like it was conceived in the parking lot of an Atlanta strip club. Slow and sultry, it shifts from anger to love to frustration in a heartbeat, like she’s both the angel and the devil on your shoulder. The 23-year-old Atlanta singer hardly does interviews, and when she does, it’s like she’s being held against her will, mumbling with an emotionless stare and her hood up. That shyness disappears on records, where her voice is big yet gentle, and the tales pour out. At her best, Summer Walker’s stories play out like a telenovela. On “Me,” a moody track in the middle of her debut album, Over It, she’s heartbroken and unsure how to react, so she runs through her options: not care, or be petty and send him a single-word text. Instead, she checks her purse, then the trunk of her car, and pulls out a gun. “I would never shoot you, baby/Maybe just wave it around,” she sings in a sweet but defeated tone. It’s relatable melodrama for some, maybe a cautionary tale for others. But Walker’s detail is just as rich in the moments that come directly before she reaches her breaking point. “Playing Games” addresses the lame dudes that continue to take her passion for granted, only showing affection in private and refusing to acknowledge their relationship on Instagram. The A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie-assisted “Stretch You Out” shows that frustration beginning to bubble over. “You never wanna clean up/And you talk to me like shit/And you handle me too rough/And, at the end of the day you got the nerve to bring up that bitch,” she sings. Like much of Over It, both tracks feature production from her current love interest and executive producer London on da Track (“Drunk Dialing...LODT” is dedicated to him), who energizes her lovestruck ballads for the social media era with his signature ATL bounce. Occasionally she steers into blander territory, like the well-written but  sleepy “Fun Girl,” but a rotating collection of R&B’s most toxic crooners keeps the energy level high. On “Like It,” Walker is infatuated, while Atlanta’s 6LACK only has sex on his mind. She blames herself for her failed relationships on “Just Might,” her duet with PARTYNEXTDOOR (“I just might be a ho”), while the OVO signee plays the cheating boyfriend with every excuse. The pettiness reaches an apex on “I’ll Kill You,” when she vows “I’ll go to hell or jail about you boy” next to Jhené Aiko, like the final scene of a twisted revenge thriller. Like many of her current R&B peers, Walker is working through her obsession with ’90s R&B. “Body” flips 702’s “Get It Together,” and “Come Thru,” both samples and features Usher. Otherwise, her writing is irresistibly fresh. Whether she has on love goggles or is shaking up her boyfriend by pointing a gun at him—out of love, of course—it’s part of what makes Summer Walker feel like a real person, making the real misguided decisions that happen when you’re over it, or telling yourself that you are.","The 23-year-old Atlanta singer’s slow-groove R&B plays out like a telenovela, feeling irresistibly fresh, messy, and human.

Fuck Yo Feelings,Robert Glasper,by: Phillip Mlynar,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9b769d453b8f000807ddbd/1:1/w_160/RobertGlasper_FuckYoFeelings.jpg,2019-10-09 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/robert-glasper-fuck-yo-feelings/,Loma Vista,"In the mini-documentary that accompanies Robert Glasper’s Fuck Yo Feelings, the Grammy-winning pianist and composer explains, “I want this whole thing to be mixtape vibe, so when we put it together it’s like a beat here, might be a song here, then we fuck around talking here.” To achieve this sort of free-form setup, Glasper welcomed a guest list of MCs, singers, and musicians—including Yasiin Bey, Herbie Hancock, YBN Cordae, Denzel Curry, and Audra Day—to pass through a studio in New York City and jam. The goal was to allow the artists to form organic bonds and strike up creative collaborations on the fly. But despite the accomplished cast, there’s little spark about the fruits of those sessions: Fuck Yo Feelings is a 71-minute melange of tepid sonic backdrops that lacks the vital momentum and progression inherent in any effective mixtape. Fuck Yo Feelings begins with an almighty misstep in the shape of the nearly five-minute “Intro,” hosted by comedian and actor Affion Crockett. The premise has Crockett roasting various band members and riffing on the no-fucks-given album title over a growling bass line. It’s a cringe fest. After encouraging the listener to tell the person nearest to them, “Fuck yo feelings,” Crockett breaks into a rant: “You are welcome to fuck they feelings with my dick, disease-free fucking, yeah, fuck they feelings, nasty porno style with some cream on they god damn back.” The barbs are neither shocking or amusing—and the “Intro” completely jars against the prevailing mellow tone of the next 18 songs that follow. The core sound of Fuck Yo Feelings brings to mind the dusky, keys-laced mid-tempo beats that the Ummah trio of Q-Tip, J Dilla, and Ali Shaheed Muhammad mined during the 1990s. Only here the loops are replaced by drummer Chris Dave’s clipped snares, bassist Derrick Hodge’s warm low-end patterns, and Glasper’s feathery keys. The players’ chops are undisputed, but the relaxed, easygoing nature of the grooves they slip into sap the MCs’ bars of energy. Sometimes this happens quite literally, like when the usually erudite Chicago rapper Mick Jenkins gets pushed out of “Let Me In” early, departing the track and letting the song amble along for another three minutes of spacey keys and tippy-tappy drums. When Glasper ushers singers to the forefront, this style of low-key neo-soul production works. During the album’s midsection, the sultry, hushed vocals of Yebba, Audra Day, Baby Rose, and SiR seem to sink into the tracks they sing on. For a moment, there’s a seamless blend between vocal tone and musical backing. But the spell doesn’t last. Instead, the last third of the album becomes a meandering slog that takes in a four-minute shout-out track featuring Glasper’s slurry, pitched-down vocals, plus a series of free-associative musings courtesy of Yasiin Bey that, clocking in at seven minutes, sound like their own self-contained project. The sprawling structure of Fuck Yo Feelings suffers from the same excess that blighted the hip-hop mixtape market during the 2000s, when shunting 20 or 30 tracks onto a project was erroneously seen as a smart hustle rather than something likely to exhaust a listener. Towards the end of Glasper’s mixtape, he names a track after GZA’s crime-rhyme classic Liquid Swords. This is the same learned MC who also once advocated, “Make it brief, son, half short and twice strong”—advice that would have served Fuck Yo Feelings well.","Throwing open his studio doors, the pianist aims for a loose, mixtape-like vibe, but the stacked guest list yields a scattershot party that only ends up overstaying its own welcome.

Signal,Automatic,by: Margaret Farrell,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d97a23a32a22700089555c7/1:1/w_160/automatic_signal.jpg,2019-10-09 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/automatic-signal/,Stones Throw,"If Los Angeles trio Automatic had been around in 1978, they’d probably play at the same clubs as their hometown heroes the Go-Go’s—they’re named after the band’s ominous 1982 single. On “Automatic,” Belinda Carlisle hovers over every word like Victor Frankenstein awaiting his monster’s first breath. “No thought, automatic,” her voice clicks. The sentiment is still menacing today, with our necks craned over our phones. With every hypnotic bassline and quotidian criticism on their debut album Signal, Izzy Glaudini, Lola Dompé, and Halle Saxon carry the torch of post-punk precision. The band also has a personal connection to this era of foreboding stares and doomy lyricism: Their percussive engine Lola Dompé is the daughter of Bauhaus drummer Kevin Haskins. Automatic prefer brighter colors, but Signal has a fair amount of darkness and even spookiness to it. The band’s first collection of songs since forming in 2017 is an exercise in post-punk and no-wave galvanism, setting chilly motorik rhythms against contemplations of zombie robots and death. Automatic are minimalists crafting songs with mostly throbbing bass, tight-zipped drumbeats, and synths that evoke the buzz of neon lighting. Album standout “Highway,” which recalls New Order’s “Blue Monday,” has only one lyric (“I drive all night”) but the music captures the restless desire to escape. The drumbeat has the crunchy propulsion of tires running over gravel; shallow bleeps emerge and recede like stripes of road paint. Though most of the production is sparse and controlled, Signal is rich with late-’70s genre influence: “Humanoid” references the psychedelic goth-rock of Bauhaus or Suicide’s “Frankie Teardrop,” while the eerie vocals and post-punk morbidity of “Suicide in Texas” are reminiscent of Joy Division. A fog of apathy plagues Signal. It’s in the repetitive nights out on “Strange Conversations,” the stubborn romantic proclamation of “I Love You, Fine,” and one particularly depressing assertion from lead single “Calling It”: “Emotion is always out of reach.” Glaudini’s deadpan lead vocal suggests the trio has given up hope, or that their hearts have been taken over by a tangle of wires and chrome. “Oh look at me/Machinery of modern life,” goes the anxious title track. We’re all another cog in the machine. “It’s not enough to be alive,” Glaudini chirps. She’s looking “through satellites or lonely nights unsatisfied” for a guiding mechanical transmission. By song’s end, she’s drawn “to wash away the man” in her. Does she seek to scrub away the stains of masculinity, or of humanity? Automatic would be at home in the late ’70s, but their nostalgic, mechanical sound paired with ruminations on cyborgism eventually feel tired and directionless. When Glaudini recounts a jarring transformation on “Humanoid,” her hopelessness is just casual, without stakes. “Signal” and “Electrocution,” the latter inspired by a real-life near-death experience, are gloomy romps with a purposeful sense of dread. But by album’s end, the mesmerizing buzz becomes a numbing sedative. Automatic wrestle with preserving humanity, but at times it seems they’re barely fighting for theirs.

Ode to Joy,Wilco,by: Jason P. Woodbury,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d977f2c90fe870008f509ff/1:1/w_160/wilco_odetojoy.jpg,2019-10-08 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/wilco-ode-to-joy/,dBpm,"At the end of his 2018 memoir Let’s Go (So We Can Get Back), Wilco’s Jeff Tweedy noted a shift in his approach to songwriting. Where he once imagined singing only to himself, “pretending no one else is listening,” the personal excavation of the book opened him to the idea of speaking to listeners, imparting exactly what he’d “like to say directly to someone.” That desire for clarity informed his very good recent solo albums, last year’s WARM and this year’s WARMER. Where he once telegraphed emotional truths through murky poetry like a Midwestern John Ashbery, now he was addressing mortality, depression, and malaise head-on. The approach has carried over to Wilco’s 11th studio album, Ode to Joy, a spacious record in both lyrics and sound. Wilco albums have often centered on fears and limitations, but on Ode to Joy, even when Tweedy reflects on the holding patterns that keep us making the same mistakes, there is actual happiness woven into these songs—evidence of the “poetry and magic” Tweedy extols on “Hold Me Anyway.” He’s not sidestepping the fraught tone of the national moment—addressing nationalism, never-ending wars, and the lies we tell ourselves to get by—but he populates the album with surprise flashes of brightness, too. These are love songs about possibilities and the way our vision may be limited by our vantage point. What might a shift in position reveal? Over the course of the last decade, it could be a little hard to tell whether a Wilco record was cruising or coasting. Throughout their catalog, there’s outliers and left-turns, of course: They pushed against roots-rock complacency by embracing violently experimental pop, veered into kosmische musik and distorted meta-commentary. By contrast, Ode to Joy attempts to strip everything down to the bare essentials with a hushed template similar to 2016’s Schmilco. Wilco’s six-piece lineup, in place since 2007’s Sky Blue Sky, has been capable of fireworks, but the focus here is on space. Glenn Kotche—one of rock’s most creative drummers—lays off the cymbals, focusing on bass drum, snare, toms, and rattling percussion. Even when combatively rocking, like on the buzzy “Everyone Hides” and the shuffling “Love Is Everywhere (Beware),” Kotche makes room for skittering keys by Mikael Jorgensen and Pat Sansone and Tweedy’s mellow croon and strained falsetto. Likewise, guitarist Nels Cline lays back in the cut. His jolts of noise have provided reliable spectacle since joining the band following 2004’s A Ghost Is Born (on which Tweedy himself hinted at Cline’s distinctive style), but he’s reserved on Ode to Joy, which makes the few moments he does step out—the apocalyptic solo on “We Were Lucky” and the fuzzed-out glam leads of “Hold Me Anyway”—gleam all the more. The rest of the cast—Sansone, Jorgensen, and bassist John Stirratt, the sole remaining founding Wilco member aside from Tweedy—offers up similarly textured performances. Tweedy matches the band’s volume, resisting the catharsis of giant rock moves in favor of subdued intensity. “I have a quiet amplifier/Silence seems to be more true/Every guitar is denied/I’ve tried in my way to love you,” he sings on “Quiet Amplifier.” In “Before Us,” Tweedy documents hearing a doorbell resonate in the body of his acoustic guitar, leaned up against the wall. That’s the way these songs work—they thrive in negative space. Wilco’s earlier records, Summerteeth, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, and A Ghost Is Born, were artfully packed, stuffed with extra noise and elliptical messages, reflections of their creator’s worry he’d be misunderstood. Like Tweedy’s solo albums, Ode to Joy’s beguiling folk songs are direct and generous, quiet sounds coming from a big room. “Everyone hides,” Tweedy sings, his signature falsetto in place. But not always, only some of the time. A new perspective doesn’t always require blowing everything up—sometimes it just requires a curious tilt of the head.

Deceiver,DIIV,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9b6dff44f5190008c08d1e/1:1/w_160/diiv_deceiver.jpg,2019-10-08 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/diiv-deceiver/,Captured Tracks,"Just a year after DIIV released its sophomore album, Is The Is Are, frontman Zachary Cole Smith conceded it was predicated on a lie. That record purported to be a portrait of addiction and recovery, a tidy narrative culminating in “a light at the end of the tunnel,” but recovery is never as easy as merely willing it, and in truth Smith says he hadn’t committed to sobriety, let alone mastered it. In hindsight, the album’s messaging “really trivializes what people go through,” Smith apologized in a 2017 interview. “Getting sober and staying sober is fucking hard.” He spent much of that year in inpatient treatment, living in rehab facilities and a sober living house, coming to terms with the reality that the light at the end of the tunnel was more distant than he admitted. In a sense, then, DIIV’s third album Deceiver is a do-over, an atonement for a record that, while a triumph on a technical and artistic level, didn’t get the truth right. Like its predecessor, Deceiver is a portrait of addiction and recovery, but this time it’s not quite as tidy, and there’s no suggestion of a victory lap. It plays like the last record’s darker shadow. As with every DIIV album, it sounds timestamped from the year that punk broke, but the mood is heavier, louder, queasier. The guitars jangle less and brood more. The band workshopped many of these songs on the road with Deafheaven, which may account for some of the newfound muscle, but mostly the bluster feels like a natural extension of Smith’s remorseful lyrics. Over knots of Sonic Youth guitars on “Skin Game,” he offers a more unflinching account of self-destruction than anything on Is The Is Are: “Sunken ceiling and a sideways grin/We lived to use and we used to live.” On “Between Tides” he channels Elliott Smith’s falsetto sigh as he sings of living with shame: “Apologize to all I see/For everything I used to be.” Deceiver is trimmer than its predecessor—a relatively compact 10 songs spread over 44 minutes—yet it feels bigger. The luscious shoegaze overtones of the record’s early tracks gradually give way to the creeping unease of Unwound’s autumnal masterpiece Leaves Turn Inside You as Smith's focus turns from the damage he’s done to himself toward the relationships destroyed during “the years I lived in vain, chasing the pain with pain.” In its second half, the record burns hotter and blacker as it stretches toward its seven-minute closer “Acheron,” the dirge that most bears Deafhaven’s influence. That track doesn't quite go full metal, but the lyrics get close: “Hate the god I don’t believe in,” Smith seethes. “Heaven’s just a part of hell.” It should be too much, but isn’t. Smith spends the entire album flirting with self-hatred, dwelling on lies, guilt, and burned bridges. And yet Deceiver never succumbs to miserabilism—even at their dingiest, these songs radiate with a beatific serenity. The lyrics wallow, but the music soars. For a record about regret, Deceiver is an unbridled pleasure.

Look Up Sharp,Carla dal Forno,by: Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9781b5a885210009a26c0f/1:1/w_160/carla_lookup.jpg,2019-10-08 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/carla-dal-forno-look-up-sharp/,Kallista,"Autumn is the most charged of the seasons, and the most melancholy. As English novelist Kate Atkinson wrote in Human Croquet, the air can feel laden with “an aromatic shadow… the fragrance of last year’s apples and the smell of the insides of very old books with a base note of dead, wet rose-petals.” This same haze is conjured in almost everything recorded by London-via-Australia artist Carla dal Forno. A multi-instrumentalist and detail-obsessive, she records albums that, were they images, would be heavy with fog and sepia. She writes, generally, about the longing that precedes and follows relationships, the kind that casts a sillage of tension and want around the surrounding days. Look Up Sharp, dal Forno’s second album and her first on her own Kallista Records, doesn’t depart from her past work so much as coalesce the haze into more of a shape. Dal Forno imprinted on post-punk, and she found a fitting home for her early records amid the doomy, dubby shadows of her former label, London-based Blackest Ever Black. But there’s an equally strong current of folk influence to her music, specifically the stark, lo-fi records of Virginia Astley and former labelmates Gareth Williams and Marie Currie. The midpoint of the genres is a shadowy space occupied by goth-folk singer-songwriters like Emma Ruth Rundle or Laura Sheeran, or the cello-and-violin mood pieces of former 4AD session musicians Martin and Kimberlee McCarrick. This is where dal Forno is at home, and newly assured. The arrangements—starting with the first lead bass notes of “No Trace”—are more muscular. Her vocals move from foreground to background, though there are still moments where you might swear you’d heard the voice of Broadcast’s Trish Keenan: the soprano brushstrokes of “No Trace,” the trip-hop murmurs of “Push On,” or the austere, layered choral opening to “Don’t Follow Me.” Her lyrics are more direct, even pointed. Single “So Much Better” isn’t just direct for dal Forno; lines like “you were a disaster, I’m glad I caused you pain” would be blunt coming from anyone. (“I had to trick myself that it was a bit of a joke that I was writing these lyrics down,” she said of writing the track.) It’s a calm anger, though: The song moves slowly, with deliberately paced bass and measured, almost deadpan vocals, like a grudge held so long and rehearsed so often it’s become an internal rhythm. “I’m Conscious” is less conflicted: “I crave drama,” she sings, and the track she conjures delivers. It’s as if, seeing romantic disaster approaching like thunderheads, she’s decided to go storm chasing. Dal Forno can afford such candor; her arrangements are flush with subtext as is. “Took a Long Time” and “Push On” bloom with “Teardrop”-esque percussion shudders. “Don’t Follow Me,” a lyrical nod to the Cure’s “A Forest,” suspends dal Forno’s vocals above a grotty low end like thick moss. And the instrumentals on Look Up Sharp are characteristically palpable: a string solo on “Heart of Hearts,” the most McCarricks-like track here; the late-night meditations of “Leaving for Japan” and “Creep Out of Bed,” one neon and one smoky; the stark foreground-background arrangement of “Hype Sleep,” where clock ticks, live-wire buzzes, and longing woodwind fade in and out around a heavy, perseverating lead bass line. It is, as they say, an extremely big mood, and dal Forno is by now an expert at setting them.

Diatom Ribbons,Kris Davis,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d518a31611b880008b575ff/1:1/w_160/krisdavid_diatomribbons.jpg,2019-10-08 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kris-davis-diatom-ribbons/,Pyroclastic,"Not long after Cecil Taylor’s death, the Tzadik label crafted a tribute album involving six pianists. To find Kris Davis among their number was likely little surprise to fans of contemporary jazz, given that her live performances at New York venues like Roulette and the Stone have long shown off her melodic and percussive mastery of post-Taylor pianism. But she is not just a star soloist. One recent, notated composition of Davis’ was included on an exciting set of contemporary classical pieces performed by the pianist Rory Cowal. She is also an adventurous collaborator, working in a wide variety of ensembles. That range is one of the principal delights of Diatom Ribbons, Davis’ latest release on her own label. (Yes, she’s an impresario, too.) Wilco’s Nels Cline appears on several tracks, and sometime Tom Waits sideman Marc Ribot also shows up on a couple. Both of those guitarists hold firmly established identities in the contemporary jazz firmament, though it’s not often that you’ll find them on an album that also features two guest spots from Esperanza Spalding (working only as a vocalist here). Davis’ organizational insight holds that all of these artists contain multitudes, and that it shouldn’t be so unusual to hear them grouped together. That the stylistically diverse results flow so well, over the course of an hour and 10 tracks—all but two composed by Davis—is also partly due to a band within the band. The album gains a sense of unity thanks to a trio of players that shows up regularly amid the comings and goings of guest stars: veteran drummer Terri Lyne Carrington,  rising-star DJ Val Jeanty, and Davis herself on piano. The trio’s collective attack sets the pace during the first minute of the arresting title track, which opens the album. First Davis, on a prepared piano, plays riffs full of metallic timbres while Jeanty samples spoken—but highly musical—phrases from Cecil Taylor himself. Carrington settles into a groove not long before Taylor’s line, “For me, music saved my life”—a construction that inspires Davis to introduce new percussive figures. Soon after, Jeanty retreats for a bit, making room for a bassist (Trevor Dunn) and a pair of tenor sax players (JD Allen and Tony Malaby). There’s a lot going on here, including melodically captivating soloing, an intergenerational shout-out, and various experimental textures. But instead of being a jumble, it’s a triumph. Spalding’s voice gets the spotlight on the next track, “The Very Thing” (written by Davis associate Michaël Attias). But Jeanty again provides crucial work during this performance, attaching delicate trails of whispery turntablism to some of Spalding’s highest notes. Carrington, Jeanty, and Davis also construct the head-nod feel at the outset of “Rhizomes” (with the help of onetime Xiu Xiu drummer Ches Smith on vibraphone). But Carrington is soon ably shifting into rock-adjacent territory before Cline enters with an energetic solo of lightly distorted tones. That covers about the first 16 minutes of the album. There are plenty of highlights yet to come, including “Corn Crake,” the core trio’s standalone number, during which Jeanty samples oration from the French modernist composer Olivier Messiaen. But no matter how unusual the compositional structures may seem, there is a consistent, songful style at the heart of most performances. The major exception to this rule is “Golgi Complex,” a short tour through a chaotic complex of motifs. But even here, Davis pursues a variety of approaches: The composition is presented twice on the album, with the original, more forbidding version sequenced second, after another variation that has an air of funk-indebted swing. Even when Diatom Ribbons ventures into unapologetically avant-garde territory, there is a clear desire to make each choice communicate. When expertly realized by such a vibrant cast of collaborators, this suite of strategies brings several of Davis’ skills—as a player, composer, and bandleader—to a new, heightened state of expression.","Aided by Nels Cline, Marc Ribot, and Esperanza Spalding, the New York pianist and her band mix lyrical song form, turntablism, and avant-garde strategies in unusually fluid fashion.

uknowhatimsayin¿,Danny Brown,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d966a7c979349000933d1b9/1:1/w_160/uknow.jpg,2019-10-07 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/danny-brown-uknowhatimsayin/,Warp,"Danny Brown’s breakout album came the year he turned 30. Now that he’s closing in on 40, he doesn’t seem to be settling into an elder-statesman role; judging by his new album uknowhatimsayin¿, he hasn’t settled at all. “Never look back, I will never change up,” he chants repeatedly on the first song—a vow to never let a groove become a rut, to stay the same without repeating yourself. It’s a lonely sort of promise, but it’s one that he’s kept: He remains as defiantly hard to situate now in the rap landscape today as he was in 2011. Back then, he was ostentatiously weird, a gap-toothed Detroit rapper with a hyena voice who forever altered the smell and taste of Cool Ranch Doritos, a weirdo fashion plate back when something as mild as skinny jeans could cost you a label deal. Now that he looks like an original X-Man to SoundCloud rap’s New Mutants, he’s still an outlier: His devotion to punchlines and similes makes him sound almost rigid in the melted, borderless landscape of current rap. But this is the joy and pain of being a three-dimensional human in your records, over and over again; if you do it correctly, you’ll never quite fit in anywhere, ever. When he announced that Q-Tip was going to executive-produce his new album, he reaffirmed that he was a classicist at heart, an old-school formalist in freak’s clothing. They are an odd pairing, The Abstract and The Hybrid; Q-Tip’s music has always felt comfortable and lived-in—wipe your feet on the rug, relax yourself, please settle down. His aesthetic is built on leaving space while figuring out how to make the quietest sound the most interesting one. Danny Brown’s most compelling music, meanwhile, has usually felt ready to leap out of its own skin, full of scraped nerves, nosebleeds, migraines, grinding teeth. Working with Tip, Brown doesn’t tone his style down so much as modulate it, dotting his voice across these tracks like wasabi blobs. He mostly forgoes the downward-spiral theatrics of 2016’s Atrocity Exhibition and 2013’s Old, opting for punchlines and vivid images and creative cadences—trace over the jagged rhyme patterns of a song like “Negro Spiritual” and you might prick your finger. He stagger-steps around the looped guitar so nimbly it might escape your notice that he rhymes “on par,” “rental car,” “centaur,” and “Pat Benatar” within one 20-second gulp of breath. Brown usually lunges out of beats, but here melts into them, making himself just another bright leaping dot on a cartoon assembly line. Individual production credits come from longtime collaborator Paul White, JPEGMAFIA, Flying Lotus, and Q-Tip himself, who coaxes and calms these nervy beats into a free-flowing suite, full of irregular rhythms and snipped edges. The snare snap on JPEG’s “3 Tearz” hits either a half-second later or sooner than you expect, prompting the loosest and most unpredictable verses from Killer Mike and El-P in years. Q-Tip’s own “Dirty Laundry” basically loops a full minute of “Aurora Spinray,” a quivering instrumental from the early-’70s psychedelic group Syrinx, and destabilizes the rhythm so much that listening to it feels walking across a waterbed. These are the kinds of tactile pleasures uknowhatimsayin¿ offers. Brown has never sounded more musical, natural, or locked-in. He reels off quotable lines everywhere; “Henny got me wetter than whale piss/I’mma die for this shit like Elvis” from “Combat” is a particularly rich one, as is, “I ignore a whore like an email from LinkedIn” from “Savage Nomad.” Structurally, at least, he’s a punchline rapper, and from this angle, producing him might not be that different from producing a happy pugilist like Phife Dawg, who similarly wanted to fill whatever small container he was given with the maximum amount of his personality. As he trades bars with Tip over the trilling horn loop on “Combat Zone,” it sounds like Brown has ascended to a sort of hip-hop classicist nirvana, a place where every kick drum lands just-so, every sample clears effortlessly, every loop cuts off exactly where it should. If there’s anything missing from uknowhatimsayin¿, it’s a sense of mortal stakes, a feeling that this music matters to Brown on a gut level. His best music has always been overwhelmingly personal, and when he declared that he would be the “greatest rapper ever” on XXX’s “30,” the implication was that he might die if he failed. It is an unqualified good thing that he is not rapping about suicidal thoughts, depression, isolation, and drug abuse anymore, but whatever else is in his head is missing. There is no moment where Brown grabs your lapels and demands you to feel what he’s feeling, whatever it may be. He has called uknowhatimsayin¿ his “standup comedy album,” and the mastery on display is that of the comic going out there and killing. But the best-loved and most enduring comedians left their own blood out on the stage, too.

The Third Ascension,Glenn Branca,by: Madison Bloom,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9516db90fe870008f507f9/1:1/w_160/thethird_glenn.jpg,2019-10-07 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/glenn-branca-the-third-ascension/,Systems Neutralizers,"“There are very few animals that kill their own kind.” Avant-garde composer Glenn Branca often began interviews with bleak screeds on human existence. “We’re vicious, psychopathological beasts,” he said in 2011, referring to our planet as a “disgusting shithole.” It was easy to take one look at Branca, drink in hand and perpetually smoking, and think you had him figured out. It was even easier to hear his vitriolic compositions and find them oppressive and terrifying, as John Cage famously did in 1982. But there was always an armored optimism in Branca’s work that suggested: If we can get lost in this maddening sound, we might be able to transcend our shared shithole, if only for a moment. With Branca’s final work The Third Ascension, released a year and a half after he died of throat cancer, the composer and his ensemble take the familiar instruments of a rock band and transform them into machines of calculated pandemonium, whose noise is so merciless it’s blissful. The concluding entry in his Ascension series, The Third Ascension premiered at New York’s famed art space the Kitchen in February 2016, where Branca and his ensemble were recorded for this very album. Branca, dressed in his trademark black duster and slacks, flailed around the stage as he conducted for bass, drums, and four guitars (one of which was played by his wife, Reg Bloor). His movements were spasmodic, and he occasionally shimmied his hips like a beleaguered Elvis. He grumbled between songs, brief quips about the best hot dog he’d ever eaten, or a dig at John Zorn. He kept his sheet music in a plastic shopping bag, which, if memory serves, had a yellow smiley face on the front. It was the only concert I’d ever been to where earplugs were forcefully handed out at the entrance, like safety goggles at a gun range. Branca was known to say that if you didn’t like loud music, you shouldn’t bother with his. At live performances, you had no option regarding volume. When it comes to his albums, you unfortunately do. But heed the man’s words: The Third Ascension should be played at full blast, neighbors and landlords be damned. One of the most exhilarating aspects of Branca’s music is the amount of aural hallucination it inspires—a frequent side effect of listening to his work is hearing things that aren’t really there. “The Smoke,” a 16-minute odyssey that kicks off like the opening credits in a western film, eventually bursts into a fit of distortion, and it appears as though a synthesizer simulating gale-force winds has been added to the mix. On closing opus “Cold Thing,” Branca’s guitar quartet sounds like a squad of machine guns firing at point blank range, and yet the continued roar somehow registers as distant screaming, air raid sirens, and a choir of angels all at once. This psychoacoustic mindfuck is all part of the plan. “I want you to be confused,” Branca once said of his audience. “Because if you become a little confused, then you’re not sure what you’re hearing, and that’s the point at which you can start thinking about what you’re hearing, and you can start creating what you’re hearing.” The Third Ascension, much like Branca’s masterpieces The Ascension and Lesson No. 1, is a shrine to ecstatic disorientation. It is both exhausting and elating, so much so that the end of each song coincides with a deserved deep breath. Branca’s work has always been as much of a physical experience as a musical one, and The Third Ascension continues that tradition beautifully. The high-frequency guitar riffs piercing through “Twisting in Space” feel like individual pin pricks, and the dueling rhythms in “Lesson No. 4” might as well be a series of 2x4s bashing you in the face. It’s a glorious, numbing assault. Glenn Branca did not like the word “transcendence,” but he knew that was the ultimate goal. “I want everything in the world, in every minute of every piece,” he once said. “I want to create a small universe on that stage, and take you off of this earth, into a place that isn’t this fucking shithole.” Branca has finally escaped. Consider The Third Ascension his parting gift.","The celebrated avant-garde composer’s final work is a shrine to ecstatic disorientation.

Carnage Hall,Kaputt,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d6598db8bd4b800082d48bb/1:1/w_160/kaputt_carnagehall.jpg,2019-10-07 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kaputt-carnage-hall/,Upset the Rhythm ,"Of all the ways to say something is fucked, “kaputt” might be the cheeriest and most playful. There’s an almost cartoonish quality to the word, conjuring images of blown gaskets and billowing smoke. Yet it’s a silly-sounding word that cuts straight to the heart of capitalism’s great folly: It’s a system whose survival depends on selling you useless, instantly obsolete junk over and over again. So it’s fitting that, on their debut album, the Glaswegian sextet who call themselves Kaputt proffer a style of post-punk that is both highly combustible and patently absurd. Carnage Hall is built atop a wobbly foundation of familiar post-punk totems: the wiry energy of early B-52’s, the bass-string-snapping rhythmic contortions of Minutemen, the melody-resistant rants and cheerleader chants of Brix-era Fall, and the sort of saxy violence that coursed through feisty freaks from X-Ray Spex to Love Is All. But in sharp contrast to your typical Mark E. Smith-modeled sing-spieler, Kaputt lead singer Cal Donnelly isn’t especially cranky—his elastic voice sounds both permanently gobsmacked and full of bravado, like someone who’s gotten clocked in a bar fight and, amazed to be still standing, marvels at the imaginary stars swirling around them. The first words we hear him sing on album opener “Rats” are, “It’s so much/Darker now,” but while a sudden breakdown at the 28-second mark braces you for a hit of chaotic skronk, the track instantly reanimates itself as an upbeat, brass-powered thrust that invites you to dance your worries away. As “Rats” illustrates, Kaputt excel at making complicated songs sound fun. Even Carnage Hall’s most tightly wound rave-ups, like the D. Boon-worthy “Very Satisfied” and the call-and-response sprint “Parsonage Square,” pack surprise structural shifts and outta-nowhere hooks, with percussionist Emma Smith’s restless clatter providing the destabilizing counterpoint to bassist Tobias Carmichael and drummer Rikki Will’s vacuum-sealed rhythms. Donnelly’s wordplay cuts through the clamor with lyrics that are as bleakly satirical as they are brutally efficient. On “Feed My Son,” he takes on patriarchy and gluttony in a single couplet, singing, “I need to feed my son/Need him to grow big, big and strong,” before adding an ominous twist: “I need to eat to my son, he’s grown to twice the size of a normal one!” Donnelly’s innate theatricality is most effective on Carnage Hall’s more manic tracks, where he can pinball off of guitarist Simone Wilson and saxophonist Chrissy Barnacle’s punk-rock pep-rally harmonies. His unwavering bug-eyed intensity feels out of place when the band eases off the accelerator for slow-burn struts like “Hi! I’m the Wasp” or more light-hearted fare like “You Are Buried With My Nose.” But the band successfully ventures beyond the typical dance-punk parameters on Carnage Hall’s two-part centerpiece, “Drinking Problems Continue.” It is, in many senses, the album’s most despairing song, an unflinching portrait of escape from industrial-town misery via alcoholism. (“Metal smell roll off hill, burn my nostrils further,” Connelly sings, before sardonically adding, “I love this place like no other.”) But it’s also the album’s most joyous moment, with a boisterous Afropop groove that gives way to an ecstatic group chorus—a readymade self-help anthem for when all your hopes and dreams go kaputt.","Building atop a wobbly foundation of post-punk totems, the Glaswegian sextet make complicated songs sound fun.

So Removed,WIVES,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d6596e31ce1350009a5d91d/1:1/w_160/wives_soremoved.jpg,2019-10-07 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/wives-so-removed/,City Slang,"Had they emerged 15 years ago, it’s easy to imagine the Queens band WIVES getting scooped up by RCA in the post-Strokes feeding frenzy and lingering on the fringes of the New York Y2K rock renaissance just long enough to collect a few saucy backstage anecdotes about Albert Hammond Jr. to share in Meet Me in the Bathroom. But seeing as the infrastructure to hype up post-punky garage bands has all but disappeared in 2019, this quartet are free to be as weird and wired as they want to be. By channelling the locomotive rumble of the Velvet Underground, the menacing, bass-driven pulse of the Fall, and the surrealistic musings of the Pixies, WIVES eagerly hitch themselves to a long lineage of anti-social record-collector rock. But more than any particular band, their debut evokes a bygone era when underground New York City rock bands couldn’t help but reflect their seedy surroundings (back when there were still seedy surroundings to reflect). At a time when so much of the music we engage with is grappling—whether overtly or implicitly—with political turmoil and mental health, So Removed feels, well, so removed from the current conversation. Instead, WIVES coolly roam a subterranean nocturnal netherworld of their own design. WIVES guitarist Andrew Bailey is also a founding member of dream-pop phenoms DIIV, but any connection between the two outfits ends there. Fitting for a group that formed because one of its members had some leftover time at his practice space, WIVES conceal an improvisational jam-band soul in a punk band’s body—though in their case, the jamming is verbal. On the opening “Waving Past Nirvana,” singer/guitarist James Beach rifles through a series of free-associative internal rhymes and open-ended kickers (“And your uncle, he wears a dress/With a shotgun and some meth/And no teeth where he peeks in his mirror to speak in tongues”) sounding like Black Francis after a CBD-oil massage. Beach’s musings are the focal point of every WIVES song, but his presence isn’t always enough to invigorate the album’s more even-keeled tracks, like the Stonesy rocker “Servants” or “Why Is Life,” which recalls post-reunion Pixies. But Beach can deliver the hooks when he tries: “The 20 Teens” relocates the E Street Band to the corner of Lexington and 125, while the glam racket of “Hideaway” yields the album’s most quotable chorus (“Don’t you sweat it girl/You’ll regret it, girl/You’re doing all the cocaine in the world”). In fact, there’s enough evidence here to suggest here that WIVES’ true calling is to shake off the agitated post-punk posture and embrace their inner Marc Bolan: On the space-bound ballad “The Future Is a Drag,” they bow out with a rusted-out “Metal Guru” to call their own. “We blew it, just for kicks,” Beach sings as the planet around him crumbles, but he doesn’t sound too bummed—because this song is his first-class ticket from the gutter to the stars.

Room for Squares,John Mayer,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d97967490fe870008f50a37/1:1/w_160/johnmayer_roomforsquares.jpg,2019-10-06 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/john-mayer-room-for-squares/,Sony,"John Mayer has always been something of a critical bête noir. His gentle, mawkish songwriting juxtaposed against his caddish, clownish behavior has created a friction that is at best unappealing and at worst artistically dishonest. At the height of his fame in the mid- to late-’00s, as the guitar virtuoso and singer-songwriter was vacuuming up Grammys for harmless pablum like “Daughters” and “Say,” he became known for a notorious string of celebrity exes, from Jennifer Aniston to Jessica Simpson to Taylor Swift. Once a dependable source of amusing copy, he beat a forced retreat from the Hollywood media sphere after his increasingly incendiary interviews culminated in the use of a racial slur, followed by his tearful onstage apology during a February 2010 show in Nashville. Yet since Mayer has stepped out of the spotlight, he has entered an unlikely career renaissance. His three solo albums since his self-induced purgatory have been understated, exploratory; his mind expanding according to the size of his hat. His work when he is not billed under his own name, especially, has been fascinating to behold. Mayer blazes an uncredited guitar solo on one of the best songs on one of the 2010s’ greatest albums, Frank Ocean’s Channel Orange, and since 2015, he has been touring, with Dead & Co., as the de facto leader for what remains of the Grateful Dead. To replace Jerry Garcia and be warmly accepted into the Deadhead community is not something you could have predicted from the guy who once donned a Borat-inspired lime-green “mankini” on a festival cruise ship called the Mayer Carrier. But at the start of the millennium, Mayer was just a nobody with a website, exploiting his wide-eyed lyrical clarity and chopsy musicianship to capture a teen audience readied by the college-quad strums of Dave Matthews Band and David Gray. “Welcome to the real world,” he sings at the start of Room for Squares. The giveaway is that he’s attributing these words not to himself, but to an unspecified authority figure. His major-label debut, released when he was 23 but largely written when he was at least a couple of years younger, is not the real world. Its opening track, “No Such Thing,” denies that one even exists, “just a lie you have to rise above.” Room for Squares offers a willfully innocent fantasy. Life can be as safe, as self-consciously cute, as broadly appealing as a really popular sitcom. The Crayola-bright soundtrack echoes the music of the protagonist’s childhood, particularly early MTV hits by the Police and Elvis Costello. He wins over audiences with sincerity and admitting his faults; the music is smooth because people are not. What Mayer describes on the album as a “quarter-life crisis” is also a privileged space, a temporary sanctuary from becoming an adult. This is a place where it’s OK to make yourself vulnerable as you figure out who you’re going to become. As a kid in suburban Connecticut, Mayer wanted to play the guitar after watching Michael J. Fox in Back to the Future. A neighbor passed him a tape by Stevie Ray Vaughan in 1990, the year Mayer turned 13, and he grew worryingly obsessed. “Everyone else had Nirvana, and I was skipping class, reading the Buddy Guy biography Damn Right, I’ve Got the Blues, cutting out the pictures when I was done,” he has said. A few years later, when he was 17, Mayer told his mother and father—an English teacher and a high school principal, respectively—he wanted to skip college and become a musician. They did not react well. Mayer began to suffer from panic attacks. He dreaded landing in a mental hospital. After graduating from high school in 1995, Mayer worked for two years at a gas station and played in blues clubs at night. When he realized that his “dreams of staying in Connecticut and becoming a star from home,” as he once put it, weren’t going to happen, he briefly enrolled in Boston’s Berklee School of Music. It wasn’t a fit, and, wanting to be “listenable,” he moved to Atlanta, where he and co-songwriter Clay Cook, later of the Zac Brown Band, won an open-mic contest as a short-lived duo, Lo-Fi Masters. Mayer self-released a coffeehouse-tinged solo EP, Inside Wants Out, in 1999. By the fall of 2000, anyone could hear early versions of several Room for Squares songs via his page on MP3.com, which acted like MySpace, SoundCloud, or Bandcamp for unknown artists right before the dotcom bust. In a nod toward the jam band scene, Mayer also encouraged fans to tape his live shows and circulate the recordings. If Mayer initially gravitated toward the blues, he escaped whatever was on his trail through his accessibility and relentless eagerness to please. (You can picture the genre’s fabled hellhound walking away thinking, “What a nice young man.”) Room for Squares shares a producer, in John Alagia, with Dave Matthews Band, who came up a lot as a comparison for Mayer’s percussive acoustic guitar playing and slightly congested vocals. But the album feels more polished than that. “I was trying to make the most mature-sounding immature record in the world,” Mayer once said, adding later, “It’s almost a concept album about being really shamelessly melodic.” His ambitions leaned toward pop. The title, which happens to be flipped from jazz great Hank Mobley’s 1963 album No Room for Squares, is Mayer laying out a welcome mat. It’s as if to say: No prerequisites to your enjoyment here. The most all-around shameless track on Room for Squares is its mid-tempo slow jam, “Your Body Is a Wonderland.” Squint hard enough, and you can almost see the sun peeking between dorm-room window curtains. Like everything on the album, it’s a bit much—“Your skin like porcelain” is an objectively bad lyric, and “bubblegum tongue” is just ridiculous. But if you grew up listening to ’90s R&B, it isn’t that much more ridiculous than Hi-Five smooching and telling on “I Like the Way (The Kissing Game),” or Shai asking to be your “Comforter.” Mayer himself quipped, during a video-streamed 2000 gig, that “Wonderland” should start with a husky spoken-word intro: “...And in the morning, girl, I’m gonna pour you a bowl of Count Chocula, and I’m gonna pull some of the oat pieces out so it tastes like there’s just more marshmallow.” As bubblegum-tongue afternoon delights go, it’s an endearingly silly ode, both tender and curious. If Lady Bird could rescue “Crash Into Me,” maybe there’s hope for “Wonderland” yet. Mayer is at his most affecting here when he’s singing about feeling lost and scared. The soaring chorus of “Why Georgia” nails a particular youthful anxiety that’s quite different from what critics usually mean by “angst,” and maybe a bit more sheltered, too: “I wonder sometimes about the outcome of a still-verdictless life/Am I living it right?” On “Not Myself,” more like an early Coldplay song with its lyrical economy and sweeping, open chords, Mayer trusts a friend to wait him out if “I lose my worried mind”: “Suppose I said, you’re my saving grace,” he booms, as much as Mayer ever booms. When you’re in a crowd of people mouthing these words back alongside you, you might feel a little less lost and scared yourself. He would soon be routinely touted as a “heartthrob,” but these are the songs of a young person who has spent a lot of solitary hours in their bedroom. On “83,” which makes plain the early MTV influence by shouting out the Police’s “Wrapped Around Your Finger,” Mayer longs “to be 6 again,” and the Peter Pan syndrome is intensely vivid: “That’s my plastic in the dirt,” he sings, a Lost Boy wryly alerting future homeowners to lost toys. “Great Indoors” uses blocks of electric guitar and more Mayer wordplay to empathize with a TV-gazing shut-in. “Love Song for No One” is one of those ditties you can’t believe hadn’t been written yet. Here, again, the perspective is curiously childlike: “I could’ve met you in a sandbox,” he claims. “Back to You” has a gentle groove distantly reminiscent of Jeff Buckley’s “Everybody Here Wants You”—it struts, as much as Mayer here ever struts—but his lover is just a silhouette, who wouldn’t even smile in their final photo. When Mayer steps out of the bedroom, he’s still awkward. On the bouncy “My Stupid Mouth,” with its goofy false ending, he’s as winsome about ruining a date as he is about engaging in foreplay on “Wonderland.” On “Neon,” the object of the narrator’s affection is out soaking up Atlanta’s nightlife, and why shouldn’t she be? Mayer was a non-punk straight-edge guy; the song is mainly a fine showcase for his irksomely giant-thumbed guitar flash. Mayer gets in more licks on “City Love,” a blues-drizzled love letter to New York romance where he unforgettably humblebrags, “She keeps her toothbrush at my place/As if I had the extra space.” Listening back, you can sort of sense his ego about to balloon. Critics have long been averse to this record’s charms because, at its best, Room for Squares is an antidote to exclusion. It’s a coming-of-age album that refuses to pose as rebellious, a guilty pleasure that challenges the idea there should be guilt in pleasure. Arriving when assembly-line teen-pop and aggro nu-metal still ruled the airwaves, the album proved that pop could be delivered by the precocious boy with the guitar next door. The confident vulnerability of early Drake and the sharp-eyed clarity of early Taylor Swift, but also the man-child strums of Ed Sheeran, Shawn Mendes, and the Jonas Brothers, all have precursors here. Teenagers screamed. Elton John raved. Room for Squares is also a time capsule. Columbia issued the album a week after the attacks of September 11. Nostalgic reassurance was in high demand, and it’s possible that only children of sanitized ’80s America would recognize the music’s cozy solace. Mayer’s big-tent pop now feels like the last gasp of the old monoculture in the face of digital fragmentation, but it also reminds me of all those movies where the straight, white, middle-class, and (cis) male is presented as the default perspective; the fans were a diverse bunch (including the Roots’ Questlove), but the women in his songs are faceless. And while sincerity was Mayer’s stock-in-trade—he wields it “like a pitchfork,” Time’s Josh Tyrangiel later wrote—he has turned out to be more of a scoundrel, or perhaps an enigma, than some doe-eyed romantic. John Mayer is constantly performing “John Mayer,” whether he wants to or not. I’m not sure the music we loved when we were younger becomes less valuable just because we no longer need what it has to offer. Over the years, I’ve adored plenty of albums that reflect the richly varied ways we are each different, individual, weird. I listened to Room for Squares the most when I wanted to feel normal. Not “normcore”: Just normal. A little less alone; a little more accepted. “You will know what all this time was for,” Mayer promises as “No Such Thing” rings to a conclusion. I just know that expressing what’s true, for yourself or for a group of people, can make a bigger difference than anyone realizes in the moment. Room for Squares, for all of its baggage, remains a little guitar-pop utopia where it’s OK to keep discovering ourselves as we go along.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

Moments,Michael Vincent Waller,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9518c748124d0008132476/1:1/w_160/moments_waller.jpg,2019-10-05 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/michael-vincent-waller-moments/,Unseen Worlds,"Since its founding in Tommy McCutchon’s Austin apartment in 2006, the Unseen Worlds imprint has become a refined voice in late 20th- and early 21st-century explorations, whether exalting a historically neglected female composer like Laurie Spiegel or reissuing albums that plumb the divide between pop and avant-garde. Alongside reissues, Unseen Worlds has also offered up an adventurous exploration of contemporary piano music. Releases run the gamut from stately solo piano pieces by Ethiopian classical composer Girma Yifrashewa to achingly slow takes on Erik Satie by founding Fluxus member Philip Corner to a stunning modern ambient album from jungle/breakcore pioneer Robert Haigh. This year the label adds two new entries to that list, first Hague-based Leo Svirsky’s River Without Banks and now Michael Vincent Waller’s third album, Moments. Waller’s 2015 double-disc debut The South Shore found the New York-based composer presenting a diverse array of works written over a five-year period, with some 20 total players performing pieces for solo cello, string quartet, flute, and a saxophone and electric guitar ensemble. On 2017’s Trajectories, Waller narrowed his focus to the interplay between cello and piano. Moments zooms in even further; five of the 18 compositions presented here are for vibraphone, the remainder for solo piano. R. Andrew Lee, pianist on Trajectories and a noted interpreter for minimal composers like Dennis Johnson and Jürg Frey, is again seated at the bench. Waller enlists William Winant—percussionist to the likes of John Zorn, Frank Zappa, and Roscoe Mitchell—on vibraphone. Both men are renowned for their restraint, and they are a perfect fit for Waller’s sensibilities. Every note and gesture on Moments seems to be deeply felt and philosophically weighed before a hand touches a piano key or lifts a mallet. Waller is uninterested in hiding behind any sort of artifice in his compositions, conveying sentiment as directly through the notation as possible. There’s little reverb to the recording, no electronic processing or layering; the sustaining pedal isn’t depressed for the duration of the album. He’s uninterested in a larger canvas when a postcard will suffice. None of the compositions last longer than six minutes, and many speak their piece well before the three-minute mark. Waller seems as attuned to the notes struck as to the overtones produced and their natural decay, which perhaps comes from his studies with minimalist composers like La Monte Young and Bunita Marcus, the latter perhaps best known for the piece that composer Morton Feldman named for her. Erik Satie’s name comes up in almost every writing about Waller, and it’s hard not recall Satie’s “Gymnopédie No. 1” during a passage on Waller’s own melancholic “Nocturnes - No. 4.” But Feldman is the more telling reference, especially in Waller’s balance and exploration of the instruments’ attack and decay. “Vibrafono Studio” wraps itself in warm, lingering tones, pausing every few lines to let the overtones fade away. The gorgeous “Jennifer”—dedicated to his cousin—moves swiftly from its opening chords to a flurry of high notes before drawing to half-speed, carefully exploring a descending bass melody that offers each note ample space in which to sound. His dedication to the late Pauline Oliveros, “For Pauline,” exemplifies her tenets of “deep listening” not with a durational, large-scale composition akin to her own work, but with three gentle minutes wherein each of Lee’s chords moves like steps across slippery river stones. As understated as Waller’s writing is, and as self-contained and seamless as each piece is, it’s almost startling when the album arrives at the stunning finale of “Bounding.” Lee’s playing starts off measured, but soon gathers velocity, each run quickening the pace until it reaches an evocative peak. The final third of the piece gushes forth in a cascade, the emotional restraint of the album finally giving way to release. As sterling and subtle as Moments can be, the finale feels nothing less than cathartic.

The Unluccy Luccy Kid,Sheff G,by: Brian Josephs,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d9517f632a2270008955326/1:1/w_160/unluccy.jpg,2019-10-05 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sheff-g-the-unluccy-luccy-kid/,Winners CircleEMPIRE,"Sheff G’s The Unluccy Luccy Kid comes two years after his breakout “No Suburban.” The eerie anthem found the Flatbush native convincingly adopting Brooklyn drill’s signifiers—brusque threats, lingo-filled punchlines, and a video of hoodied-up men whose ages were betrayed by their backpacks. Millions of clicks later in 2019, Sheff G is still something of an underdog: Unluccy Luccy Kid comes after Canarsie’s Pop Smoke took over the summer with “Welcome to the Party.” The spotlight’s redirection hasn’t deterred Sheff, though. The production here is cleaner, but his debut project finds him repacking his style instead of making large steps forward. The Unluccy Luccy Kid feels more like an industry necessity than a statement. A few of its tracks can stick out on their own, like the previously released “Flows,” his bluesy collaboration with fellow Brooklynite Sleepy Hallow. But strung together, these tracks are dulled by their own repetitiveness. You’ve heard all these grievances elsewhere: We came from the struggle, don’t like fake love or snitches, and don’t pretend you shot somebody, just be yourself. Sheff G largely avoids the introspection or detail that would give these tropes weight. He broods about being “a product of power and pain” over the funereal pianos of “Respect,” but his verses are pridefully elliptical about what that means: “Never talked what I did/Still I will never talk what I saw.” To be fair, that’s not really anybody’s business; however, Mozzy’s vivid verse on the ghostly “Menace” (“Meet me on Fourth, right by the court/None of these shooting guards play around”) has more resonance. Sheff G largely relies on the compact, off-beat syllabic barrages that he rode on “No Suburban.” His approach works best when he’s not trying to contort that flow into singsong melodies, like the clumsy and generic “Designer.” Sleepy Hallow appears on half of the project’s tracks and does well as the choleric foil to Sheff’s bearish presence, landing many of the album’s darkest jabs (“What can they tell me about the trenches, almost lost my sense/So if my name is ever mentioned just tell the judge send a sentence,” he raps on “All My Life,” darkly humorous but dead serious). The Unluccy Luccy Kid isn’t going to be the groundbreaker that pops the Brooklyn drill scene out of its bubble, but that’s probably how it was designed. Sheff G and Sleepy Hallow sound more engaged when they’re rapping unapologetically about street dealings. A few of drill’s artists have expressed making music mainly for the folks who walked those streets. If Unluccy Luccy Kid connects with them, hasn’t it served its purpose?","The Brooklyn drill artist follows up his two-year-old hit “No Suburban” with a grim and terse debut LP.

Make Yourself at Home,Harmony Woods,by: Abby Jones,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d8e6b0632a2270008954f80/1:1/w_160/HarmonyWoods_MakeYourselfAtHome.jpg,2019-10-05 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/harmony-woods-make-yourself-at-home/,Skeletal Lightning,"Before Sofia Verbilla began making music as Harmony Woods, she was dragging friends to gigs around her native Philadelphia, introducing her peers to the city’s DIY scene and pining for a chance to meet her local rock heroes. Inspired by the same bands she moshed to, Verbilla finished writing her first song when she was 16. By 18, she was playing solo sets at the same house show space that members of Modern Baseball once called home. Some of the band even helped her record Harmony Woods’ debut, 2017’s Nothing Special. But there was surely something special about Verbilla; with crystal-clear vocals and evocative lyrics, she was primed to become a fixture of Philly’s underground. The title of Harmony Woods’ follow-up LP, Make Yourself at Home, is less welcoming than it appears: “So make yourself at home, although you weren’t invited,” Verbilla offers on lead single “Best Laid Plans.” It’s the kind of passive-aggressive comment you might make to someone who’s crashed on your couch a few nights too many, but it’s also an apt summary of a record that examines self-sabotage. Verbilla sings about devoting too much emotional real estate to people who don’t necessarily deserve it, or—in her own meme-formatted words—romanticizing their toxic behaviors. She’s learning to prioritize her own well-being, and Make Yourself at Home unearths the ugly side of that maturation. Verbilla is an affecting lyricist; her words are candid, unglamorous, and often graphic recollections of trauma. “I can’t feel safe around you/Not when you’re like this,” she laments in the jarring “Misled,” as if channeling pain directly from childhood. “When I was young/My mother’s lover acted the same exact way.” The album also describes the agonizing process of unpicking an abusive relationship, alluding to domestic violence and gaslighting. “You slam the car door shut accidentally/Profusely apologize/You say, ‘That’s not like me,’” she sings on “The City’s Our Song,” with enough hindsight to realize it was indeed characteristic of her subject. “Now all I want is the truth/But you’re frightening me instead/You say, ‘I think you’ve been misled,’” she sings in “Misled.” Verbilla regularly employs her villains’ dialogue, and Make Yourself at Home can feel as much about them as it is about her. She’s also a fan of recycling lyrics: “Seasons change, people stay the same,” she muses in both “Best Laid Plans” and closer “Halt.” “One day we will die/And only ghosts will be our friends,” she sings in “The City’s Our Song,” only to reiterate the thought on “Ghosts.” On first pass, it can feel lazy—but repeated listens suggest that these are simply Verbilla’s mantras on humanity and mortality. The more hurt she reveals (“Another trauma I’ll have to unpack,” she wails in “Burden”), the more weight her duplicated words bear. While Verbilla finds strength in this poetry, she’s yet to hit her stride as a musician. “Best Laid Plans” and “The City’s Our Song” boast her boldest, most dynamic choruses, but few moments are equal to them. Compositionally, Make Yourself at Home is rather simple: There are more power chords than intricate riffs, and most of the hooks are a little too banal to stick. It’s easy to wish there was something more complex in the music of Harmony Woods—but after you hear Verbilla’s narratives, it’s also pretty easy to forgive her.","The 20-year-old singer-songwriter’s clear vocals and candid lyrics feel at home in the Philadelphia DIY scene that raised her.

All Mirrors,Angel Olsen,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d6593d326e2b40009eed797/1:1/w_160/angelolsen_allmirrors.jpg,2019-10-04 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/angel-olsen-all-mirrors/,Jagjaguwar,"Angel Olsen is a natural at writing mantras for jaded souls. Burn your fire for no witness. Unfucktheworld. Some days all you need is one good thought strong in your mind. No one’s gonna hear it the same as it’s said. While her music has evolved from lamp-lit folk to boisterous rock’n’roll and ritzy synth-pop, she has always emphasized the importance of self-conviction. This steadfast philosophy, coupled with how wryly she appears to withstand heavy emotional weather, has made Olsen talismanic to fans. But halfway through the tour for her 2016 album My Woman, a messy fallout from a breakup made Olsen realize how disconnected she had become from herself. She decided to make her next album as she had her earliest releases, working almost alone (in remote Anacortes, Washington) to focus on bare-bones songwriting. It also meant trying to elude the accrued weight of her identity: Olsen has said that she and her friends often “joke about how dumb ‘Angel Olsen’ is.” In the songs Olsen wrote in Anacortes, love and, consequently, her identity became an illusion. What ended up on her fifth album, All Mirrors, are bemused questions about why she would suppress her needs, why she had to deny what she was going through, why the past must keep repeating. The lyrics are often softer and less certain than on her first four scalpel-sharp records. If there is one mantra among them, it’s in the stoned ambivalence of “Spring”: “I’m beginning to wonder if anything’s real,” she sings. “Guess we’re just at the mercy of the way that we feel.” We don’t yet know what the music from those Anacortes sessions sounds like: A few months after its completion, Olsen recorded a second version of the album with show-stopping string arrangements from Ben Babbitt and Jherek Bischoff (and production by John Congleton). She intended to release both records simultaneously, then realized the power of the orchestrated version meant it had to come first. The two incarnations, one lavish and one threadbare, embody that lyric about how feelings shape reality and identity, and pose a striking challenge from an artist variously misunderstood in the past as “sad girl at the bottom of a well,” feminist autodidact, and silver wig-wearing “character.” Once both takes on All Mirrors stand side by side, they’ll offer an intriguing case study in interpretation and how form suggests content: Is authenticity regarded as a magisterial group effort or just a lone voice and a guitar? Does devastation hit harder at volume or a whisper? The two albums are also a massive, meta juxtaposition of the feminine archetypes that Olsen has wielded over the past decade—fragility and excess, interiority and high drama, submission and rage—that dares us to distinguish between the person and the performance. For now, though, all we have is the first part, which would be revelatory in any context. The atmosphere suggests a wracked Cassavetes heroine wandering onto a sparkling MGM set and sinking right into its whipped-cream luxe. Eight of its 11 songs feature a 12-piece string section, with modes ranging from gallant high-romance to Gainsbourg hat-tips to twilit softness. Plenty of acts skew symphonic at some point in their career, and it’s hard for any artist to hold their own against such overwhelming staging and the constant threat of pastiche. But everything from the songs’ surprising dramatic arcs to their granular textures feels integral to Olsen’s songwriting. Take the title track, where she sings about being trapped by her past romances and youthful beauty: The backmasked backing vocals intensify that sense of imprisonment; the synth sparkle that follows it takes an unexpected dip from major to minor, like a sudden changing of the light. And that moment in “Spring” where she sings about being at the mercy of her feelings pushes the song from twinkling lullaby to barbiturate reverie, a total surrender to sensation on a record so recklessly physical it should come with its own parachute. Not that All Mirrors is just a strong wind that blows in and leaves you undone. Olsen has described All Mirrors as an “angry” record, and even when she isn’t explicitly cursing “DREAM ON DREAM ON DREAM ON” on the skyrocketing “Lark” at an ex who failed to register her desires, the synth-abetted production seethes and shudders, grandeur and ruin existing side by side. But it’s a playful album, too, one that traces the full scope of heartbreak. “What It Is” canters along as Olsen mocks herself for giving in to love’s charade: “You just wanted to forget/That your heart was full of shit!” she sings in a cadence that suggests a sarcastically wagged finger. With its elongated violin notes, “Tonight” is fit for the last flush of romance in a silver-screen love story. Yet Olsen’s tenderness is directed at herself, having arrived at a clarity where she no longer cares to explain “all the things you think you’ve come to understand about me.” Her composure as she sings these words is as still and inky as the sea against the night sky. The remark could apply just as much to the public as her former lover. Each of Olsen’s artistic developments has been heralded as some sort of permanent shift in her work or her commercial aspirations: Now she’s an indie star. Now she wants to be a pop star. Oh, she’s collaborating with Mark Ronson? She must really want to be a pop star. But the wild range of All Mirrors and Olsen’s vocal performance fly in the face of the idea that identity and artistry are fixed, and consequently turn over how much we can ever know each other, and ourselves. She finds the nuance and enduring pleasure in her game of faces. While “Too Easy” sends up undying devotion, with moony girl-groupisms to spare, Olsen willfully dedicates herself to someone else on “New Love Cassette”—and the lusty mood, lifted directly from Gainsbourg’s 1971 album L’Histoire de Melody Nelson, indicates her pleasure in doing so. We fall in love again and again because a little self-sabotage never stopped anyone. Olsen suggests that nihilism and optimism are closer than you think, that what feels like knowing yourself is almost always revealed as delusion. On All Mirrors, she glories in that tumult, and the sparks that fly illuminate her bravura turn.

"Losing, Linda",Sui Zhen,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d94df0ee6ad950008e1c7ee/1:1/w_160/losinglinda_suizhen.jpg,2019-10-04 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sui-zhen-losing-linda/,Cascine,"The idea of human consciousness existing outside the body has been the focus of dystopian sci-fi from Blade Runner to Westworld, and it’s embedded in the new album from Melbourne art-pop auteur Becky Freeman—a.k.a. Sui Zhen. But unlike those works, Losing, Linda isn’t consumed by apocalyptic visions of robots taking over. Rather, the record suggests there’s something inherently flawed about attempting to live in a perfect world, and that there are certain problems for which there is no app. Freeman's sublime sophomore effort, 2015’s Secretly Susan, explored a life lived through avatars. On Losing, Linda, Freeman sings from the perspective of the titular AI Linda. The lyrics examine the possibility of artificially reconstructing a human life through the digital detritus we leave behind on social media—an idea that became all-consuming when Freeman’s mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer just as recording commenced.  And like the latex-mask replica of her face that she wears on the cover, the results are equally alluring and unnerving—this is a record where pristine facades can never conceal the distressed soul underneath. Losing, Linda hits the same big pleasure points as Secretly Susan—neon-hued ’80s pop, DIY digital dub, bossa-nova balladry—but the mood hovers between ecstasy and unease. Freeman’s voice loses the post-Grimes avant-R&B smear of Secretly Susan, adopting an eerily calm and crystal-clear diction that sounds very much like an AI learning to convincingly imitate us. The drum-machine stutters of “Natural Progression” suggest a robot coming to life and getting used to its mechanical limbs, before asking itself questions like: “I’m growing hair/Do I need it anymore?” On the centerpiece “Being a Woman,” Freeman’s concerns move beyond physical characteristics to the gender expectations accompanying them. The song is both celebratory and cautionary, a proud declaration of womanhood on one’s own terms (“Redefine sexuality, that’s how I’ll find my way!”) whose chorus (“Being a woman/You have to hold yourself ... before you hold someone else”) suggests self-determination is much easier wished for than achieved. Freeman recently admitted that she was only able to be open about her sexuality after her mother passed, so when she sings “When I grew up, I thought I had to be/Somebody’s mother, or somebody’s daughter,” she hints at the unshakable familial forces that can constrain even the most empowered, free-thinking souls. On Losing, Linda, her mother's loss isn’t so much addressed as felt. You can hear it in the ghostly chorus to the space-age bachelor-pad sway of “I Could Be There,” in the eerie Dark Side of the Moon Safari atmosphere of “Another Life,” or in the equally desolate and divine dream-pop of “Mountain Song.” The latter track was inspired a treacherous hike that left Freeman stranded for a night atop a Japanese mountain, though with lines like “Can you let go and just be comfortable with the fear you have for the unknown/What could be out there that’s scarier than your own mind,” she seems to be preparing herself for the even greater challenge that awaits her once she returns to her mother’s bedside. But on “Different Places,” she seems to make peace with the fact that her life will henceforth be haunted by absence: “We’re just in different places,” she sings, before adding, “but I’m with you.” As Losing, Linda reminds us, the cruel irony about technology is that we crave its synthetic pleasures in those moments when life gets too real. But with the immaculate “Perfect Place”—a sensuous swirl of Neal Tennant sing-speak, Kraftwerk keyboards, and rubbery funk bass—Freeman suggests that utopia can be ours not with the push of a button, but with a boost in motivation and change of scene. “Now look toward the river/A new point of view/Past the industry/A little further still/ And it’s the perfect place—get to know it,” she sings, like an enlightened Waze app. ”Things you can’t put off, do it now, do it now.” By adopting a robotic persona to examine real-life strife, she reinforces the notion that a life is more than just an accumulation of data.

LφVE & EVφL,Boris,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d94e086a540790008f9dc52/1:1/w_160/Boris_loveandevol.jpg,2019-10-04 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/boris-love-and-evol/,Third Man,"New Boris albums once offered joyous upheaval and a sense of shock. At their best, and sometimes their worst, they ventured into whatever forms fit their loose-fitting creed of “Heavy Rocks.” Pink, one of the band’s early, essential breakthroughs, moved from the reinvented shoegaze anthem “Farewell” into wild-eyed D-Beat and squalid noise-rock, as if beating a gleeful retreat from perfection. Sure, there have been gimmicks and missteps along the way, but Boris’ restlessness has often been rewarding and contagious. But it is hard to muster much more than a shrug for LØVE & EVØL, Boris’ double-album debut for Jack White’s Third Man Records. LØVE & EVØL finds Boris at a strange career crossroads—or, rather, just beyond it. Three years ago, they recorded what was meant to be their farewell album but instead stumbled into Dear, their most ecstatic and aggressive LP in years. Boris sounded reborn, their vows renewed. LØVE & EVØL, however, suggests that the euphoria of this second honeymoon has faded. These seven anemic songs find Boris becoming something new yet again—self-satisfied. They remind us of a lot of their best tricks: Wata’s solos, like the one that leads the lumbering “LOVE” out of its torpor, still streak across these tracks like a rainbow somehow appearing against a moonless night sky—few guitarists sound so rapturous with a trick so simple. And in its ascendant second half, “EVOL” recreates the band’s most disorienting and beautiful effect—the ability to drop down in tempo, key, and distortion and still shoot for the stars, as if the rules of gravity have been temporarily reversed. Those little moments of wonder stud songs that, by and large, feel like adult-coloring-book versions of Boris triumphs past. “uzume” is a surging wall of noise, with wave after wave of distortion and drums moving ever inward, but it lacks the wild radiance of their earlier drone experiments. Closer “Shadow of Skulls” lingers in the same space for 12 minutes without shifting into anything heavenly or heavy. It plods ever-onward because Boris don’t know what else to do with it—a fitting end for an album that adds little but another entry into an already-enormous catalogue The band once served as a generational gateway to the worlds of international psychedelia and doom-adjacent metal. Accessible and enigmatic, they drew you in, making you sort through alternate editions of their records to find the next weird gem. But accessing the world’s musical extremes is easier than it was even a decade ago, with point-and-click access to infinite wormholes. Boris, meanwhile, simply feel staid, a band that missed its best chance to take a bow.

Abundance Welcoming Ghosts,Red River Dialect,by: Stephen M.

It’s also a captivating moment, one that anchors the song’s loftier subjects to the everyday world and reveals something essential about Morris as a songwriter and bandleader. Red River Dialect are fascinated by tactile sensations, whether it’s the sharpness of hot metal against your hand or the soft tension of a piano key under your finger. When Morris shouts about brain freeze, you hear the band work together to evoke the chilly stab of adrenaline. Such physical sensations are important, as they ground the earnest spiritual inquiries animating the Cornwall band’s inventive folk-rock songs. Morris is the son of an Anglican priest; as a teenager he found Buddhism through the Beat poets and went on to work as an interfaith adviser at the University of Westminster in London. Immediately following the sessions for Abundance Welcoming Ghosts, Red River Dialect’s fifth album, he decamped to Nova Scotia for a nine-month stay at Gampo Abbey. The music and the monastery visit may serve the same purpose, as Morris has regularly seeded Red River Dialect songs with spiritual insights and observations. “May I welcome joy when it comes near,” he sings on the jazzy, Pentangular “My Friend.” “May I also laugh about but never doubt it.” There’s a quiver in his voice, slightly more suppressed here than on previous records, that makes the lines sound less like lessons and more like reminders to himself. Perhaps because the band knew Morris was going to disappear for close to a year, or perhaps because they spent so much time touring behind 2018’s Broken Stay Open Sky, these songs possess a new urgency and intensity. There’s an electric tension to “Blue Sparks,” with piano notes that sound like the hooves of a galloping horse. Even a slower, quieter tune like “Two White Carp” sounds barely contained, as though the players might burst out of the Welsh landscape as Morris paints it. In the tradition of Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span, who mixed traditional English folk songs with contemporary rock sounds, Red River Dialect understand the importance of a solid rhythm section: Drummer Kiran Bhatt and bassist Coral Kindred-Boothby play with a jazzy sense of invention that makes “Snowdon” sound like it’s powered by an invisible engine. Abundance Welcoming Ghosts may be the band’s most ingenious and immersive mix of folk and rock yet, but it’s also Morris’ most compelling set of songs. He invests small sensations with outsize power, finding joy in sensory pleasures as well as in the mystical inquests that music allows. “Oh, a piano,” he sings on “Piano.” “Open the lid, play a single note, and look out through a new window.” Even as the record is steeped in the long history of British folk music, that balance of the tactile and the spiritual anchors these songs in the present moment.

Herstory in the Making,Young M.A,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d8d33355c47170008d47e7b/1:1/w_160/youngma_herstory.jpg,2019-10-03 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/young-ma-herstory-in-the-making/,M.A. Music3D,"In the immediate wake of the viral 2016 hit “OOOUUU,” Young M.A was quickly projected to be a trailblazer for modern New York City rap, pegged as a rejuvenator for quintessential New York City rap, and preordained as the city’s best pure rapper in what had felt like ages. She was the hottest rapper of the moment, maybe the most promising hometown prospect since 50 Cent, and even he was impressed. Usually, all stories of viral rap success play out in the same way—a label swoops in after a bidding war, new music is released posthaste, and most of it sounds dangerously close to the viral hit itself. But something funny happened with M.A: She never signed with a major, she held off on rushing out an album, and she retreated deeper into her notepad, not once trying to recreate her signature song. Without much of an attempt to capitalize on her virality, the hype subsided, and many wrote Young M.A off as a flash in the pan. In a twist, in the years since, she has quietly lived up to everything unfairly foisted upon her. Young M.A isn’t just one of the best rappers in her city, she’s one of the best anywhere. She has spent her free moments, during on-air appearances or hijacking other rapper’s songs, putting beats through the torture rack until she’s cracked them. Though a longtime master of the form, her freestyles have become epics. Her singles have become confessionals. In these structureless spaces, she’s unleashed. Her verses feel undiluted and ceaseless; she seems inexhaustible, like she could rap forever. Herstory in the Making, her long-awaited debut album, was supposed to be a punctuation mark. It was meant to put a cap on this arc, to give shape to her untreated verses and her story. Instead, it is merely another flex, another display of her competence and skill. She runs the gauntlet and comes out largely unscathed. A name like Herstory in the Making implies biography and Young M.A has confirmed as much in interviews. She always seems to be setting the record straight in her raps, but these aren’t her memoirs. In an attempt to offer all of herself, she ends up providing only glimpses, never settling long enough to divulge much. Despite that, she finds enough balance to provide a convincing self-portrait. There is plenty of the tough M.A—the raw M.A—to satiate fans of her bruiser raps, especially on bum-rushing songs like “No Mercy” and “Bleed,” but there is vulnerability elsewhere. The NY Bangers-produced “Sober Thoughts” reveals struggles with depression and substance abuse in the aftermath of her celebrity. When she lets her guard down, she grows as a storyteller. The most glaring illustration of this is “No Love,” on which Young M.A wrestles with her brother’s murder and her own proximity to street life. As the song goes on, she keeps reliving his death in different contexts, feeling its impact in different ways. It is some of her most centered writing. “I seen my brother go from human to Casper/From a bed to a casket/Tryna move on, but it’s like my life goin’ backwards,” she remembers, trapped in a nightmare. There’s no love in the streets so she finds it elsewhere—down a bottle of Hennessey, in her mother, and in God. She always raps with clarity, but when she writes with purpose her songs become even more affecting. Sometimes, the writing is so crisp that it becomes like journaling in its detail and narrative focus. “My paychecks use to be a pair of Jordans/And I know I can’t afford ’em, but I went ahead and bought ’em/Then I quit, started slangin’, spent my money on recordin’/Yeah, the studio was small, but man, that shit made me a fortune,” she raps on “Car Confessions,” as clear a rendering of converting aspiration into inspiration as you’ll ever hear. There is such a natural finesse and composure to M.A’s rapping that it can, at times, seem almost casual. But it’s easy to underestimate what’s happening on Herstory in the Making because she performs a rap clinic for nearly 70 minutes without exerting much energy. While the album may not be the resounding statement of self the title makes it out to be, it is a fine endorsement of everything that those who have ignored her have been missing. If nothing else, Herstory in the Making is an exhibition of Young M.A’s ability to rap proficiently over anything. She bobs her way through the muted, glowing Mike Zombie-produced “BIG” and then lurches through Zaytoven’s trap gospel on “Kold World” like Peak Gucci Mane. She slides off the “My Hitta” synths with singsong flows. With each song on her debut, Young M.A is reasserting her place in rap.","The New York rapper’s highly anticipated debut album is another big, long flex from one of the most skilled rappers to emerge in the last five years.

The Afterlife,The Comet Is Coming,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d935f2c42446e00087f7c4f/1:1/w_160/thecomet_afterlife.jpg,2019-10-03 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-comet-is-coming-the-afterlife/,Impulse!,"Since their debut was shortlisted for the Mercury Prize in 2016, the Comet is Coming’s saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings has become a formidable presence in the international jazz scene in his own right, making fans of Beyoncé and Virgil Abloh along the way. Hutchings landed not just one but three different bands on the Impulse label in the process. From the Afro-Caribbean stomp of his Sons of Kemet to the South African spiritual jazz of Shabaka and the Ancestors, his music is simultaneously rooted in the traditional, broadly international in scope, and thoroughly of the moment. But there’s something in the way the Comet Is Coming skewers the typical jazz trio that stands apart from his other projects. Its surface speaks to the cosmic sounds of Sun Ra, but there’s something raw and earthy at the core. Comet draw from the minimal, restrained palette of the trio format to make something that’s electrifying and apocalyptic all at once, able to tear the roof of jazz—as well as rock, jam band, and EDM—festivals. A companion piece to this year’s Trust in the Lifeforce of the Deep Mystery, The Afterlife continues to hover over that album’s scorched earth, not replicating the rush of “Summon the Fire” but instead exploring in greater detail that set’s most somber moments. It’s concise yet also shows the trio’s depth in just over 30 minutes. Whereas Trust in the Lifeforce’s centerpiece featured the poet Kate Tempest speaking vitriolically of capitalism and “the blood of the past,” here the band welcomes back to the fold Joshua Idehen. Idehen appeared on Sons of Kemet’s Impulse debut and previous Comet albums, most tellingly on “The Final Days of the Apocalypse.” His dystopian demeanor remains unchanged on opener “All That Matters Is the Moments,” spitting lines of “daydreaming of a world I won’t live to see” against a slow roil of drums and widening oscillations. There are glints of clarity, at least, if not hope, as he speaks of holding onto the memories of friendships in trying times. No matter the cosmic jazz or sci-fi backdrop conjured, Hutchings knows when to ride the carefully controlled swells of drummer Max “Betamax” Hallett and synth player Dan “Danalogue” Leavers and when to rove on his own. He lays in the cut on the beautiful “The Softness of the Present,” basking in warm chords laid down by Leavers and the chunky beat of Hallett, adding just enough vibrato to keep the piece from drifting off into downtempo territory. Instead, the songs drifts into the title track, which strikes a deft balance between menacing sine waves and the kind of gurgling ostinatos that Alice Coltrane would throw down on her organ. “The Seven Planetary Heavens” deftly blends the breathy air of spiritual jazz with the pinging of techno to make something that, instead of reaching the point of combustion, maintains a radiant glow. Divorced from the flickering electronics and rolling drums, Hutchings’ burnished horn would sound merely soulful, as it is on the two-part “Lifeforce.” But combined with the arpeggios and simmering cymbals, his tone veers towards the melancholic, as if moving over a planet’s surface in search of life. In the song’s second half, as Hallett’s chunky breaks transition towards something more uplifting, Hutchings’ horn picks up enough velocity that the trio achieves liftoff, no doubt to some other unexplored corner of the cosmos.","The cosmic fusion group skewers the jazz-trio format as it’s typically understood, flipping the minimalist palette into an electrifying, apocalyptic sound.

Love From the Planet Gong: The Virgin Years 1973-75,Gong,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d936133e6ad950008e1c674/1:1/w_160/gong_box.jpg,2019-10-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gong-love-from-the-planet-gong-the-virgin-years-1973-75/,UMC,"If Daevid Allen’s prophecy is correct, we are a mere 13 years away from Planet Gong descending from the heavens to deliver enlightenment to all earthlings. Allen first posited his theory on a series of albums by Gong in the mid-1970s: Each LP was designed, he said, to prepare “the heads of all who hear their music for the arrival in the year 2032 of many Pot Head Pixies who will be coming to help spread of joy in the new age.” Those albums, long known among the Gong cognoscenti as The Radio Gnome Trilogy, are housed alongside a bounty of unreleased live material excavated from deep in the Virgin Records vaults in the hefty Love From the Planet Gong: The Virgin Years 1973-75, a 12-CD/1-DVD box set whose very weight may intimidate anyone who is not already a member of the band’s dedicated cult. Gong tended to attract cultists, in every sense of the word. Freaks of all stripes flocked to Allen, hearing loopy wisdom lying underneath Gong’s cacophonic prog-funk fusion, ever-expanding space-rock, and tall tales of spliff-toking sprites. The most famous of these fans was Sherman Hemsley, who gained notoriety as George Jefferson on the Norman Lear sitcom The Jeffersons. At the height of his fame in the late 1970s, Hemsley flew Allen out to his Los Angeles home, where the Gong guitarist discovered a chamber devoted to his band. Flying Teapot—the first installment of The Radio Gnome Trilogy, released in 1973—played on a loop in a darkened room filled with naked women, and that was just the tip of the actor’s devotion. Hemsley planned to wallpaper Hollywood with billboards trumpeting Flying Teapot, in hopes of spreading the Planet Gong philosophy to the masses. Gong’s music inspires this intense dedication but also its opposite reaction: To those on the outside, the fantastical music-hall jazz sounds utterly bewildering. If Gong seem as if they flew in from another world, there is some truth in that suspicion; they were born in the serene surroundings of the French countryside. As a member of the pioneering psych-jazz outfit Soft Machine, the Australian-born Allen was part of Canterbury’s nascent prog-rock scene in the late 1960s, but once the band’s 1967 European tour wrapped up, the UK denied him reentry due to an overextended visa. Undaunted, Allen claimed Paris as his new home, witnessing the student revolution of 1968 before eventually settling on the edge of a forest with his partner Gilli Smyth. Before long, the pair formed Gong, which from their earliest days defied anything resembling a stable lineup. Musicians would come and go, usually living in the band’s communal house in Voisines. Allen wasn’t so much the leader of the bunch as he was its shepherd, encouraging his flock to follow his path but happy to take whatever detours the pack pursued. A few Gong records came out on the French label BYG in the early 1970s, but the three years the group spent at Virgin is where they took flight. Happily, they inked a deal with the fledgling Virgin Records when Richard Branson was flush with cash and willing to let his acts do whatever they wanted. Along with Mike Oldfield, whose “Tubular Bells” became a massive hit thanks to its prominent placement in The Exorcist, Gong were Virgin’s signature act. Flying Teapot, largely recorded prior to the Virgin deal, didn’t quite take full advantage of this freedom, yet it still shows the band taking shape. It’s a technicolor blimp that lurches and glides, cruising along on dextrous funk fusion before it descends into annoying maniacal chants. Chalk the latter up to the pothead pixies, who were central to Allens’ “Gong philosophy,” which wasn’t so much a cohesive manifesto but a feverish prankster fantasy filled with cheap puns, smutty jokes, and a fervent belief in cosmic unity. All those elements gel on Angel’s Egg, a 1973 LP that Gong recorded at their country home, miking the woods for ambiance. The crackpot idea worked. Gong sound utterly unencumbered by gravity, floating between moments of grace and madness. Again, much of that lunacy comes from Allen’s mythology, which picked up themes and the thinnest of narrative threads from Flying Teapot, then turns it into a jumble that’s indecipherable without bushels of weed. Paradise eventually comes to an end, and so it was with Gong. A bust—equal parts customs and drugs violations—prompted France to kick the group out of the country, so they headed to England and gathered the material for 1974’s You, which was their biggest, boldest album. Nominally the conclusion of The Radio Gnome Trilogy, You found Allen’s Gong philosophy slowly subsumed by the majestic power of the band. In a sense, they achieved an equilibrium, with the band—now featuring the liquid, startling guitar of Steve Hillage—racing along at the same speed of Allen’s mind, while his lunacy prevented the knotty extended improvisations from calcifying into egghead art. The divide between Allen and much of the rest of Gong came to a head in 1975. At a concert, Allen claimed “a force-field stopped me taking the stage on my musical cue,” so he simply left the band he created. Some members quit in his wake, while others were relieved to see him go: Drummer Pierre Moerlen and percussionist Mireille Bauer were eager to ditch the “silly lyrics” and overhauled the group into a slick, serious outfit that could hold its own with Weather Report. That incarnation of Gong can be heard on 1976’s Shamal, the last of the four studio albums included on Love From the Planet Gong. It’s an impressive work, sharing a clear lineage with the nimble jazz-funk of the preceding three albums, but neither Shamal nor the post-Allen live concert from 1975 quite feels like Gong. Without Allen’s babble, the band lacked the means of achieving transcendence. Not that Gong often did that anyway. Most of the time, the band was working at cross purposes, a tension that is maddening and thrilling in equal measure. In the studio, these tendencies were gussied up, often in an appealing fashion, but the live recordings that provide the bulk of the unreleased material on Love From the Planet Gong show the band’s muscle and might at work. Stripped of the stage visuals—their act was replete with mime, sorcerer hats, ultraviolet lights, and paper plates doubling as flying saucers—the group is an unwieldy delight: a British Sun Ra Arkestra that manages to make it home in time for tea. The live recordings are bracing and, oddly enough, they provide a better gateway to understanding Gong than the albums themselves, as the LPs often are dressed in fussy period charms. Returning to the studio trilogy after absorbing the live recordings, Flying Teapot, Angel’s Egg, and You seem like vivid snapshots of songs that are often too wild to sit still. Gong’s restlessness is integral to their appeal, since it’s what pushed them to explore the outer reaches of the universe from the confines of a French country home. The group managed to create an enduringly weird body of work whose strength is perhaps best appreciated in total, not in parts. Taken individually, or without the concert recordings, the LPs seem merely odd, but when they’re combined as they are in this box, the strangeness seems monumental. And that’s fitting a testament to Gong: They’re not a band designed for dabbling, only a full immersion will do.","A mammoth box set of Daevid Allen’s prog-rock project makes a virtue of its excesses, capturing the band’s monumental strangeness.

Terms of Surrender,Hiss Golden Messenger,by: Allison Hussey,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d8d20d22c883100087553e1/1:1/w_160/hiss_terms.jpg,2019-10-03 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hiss-golden-messenger-terms-of-surrender/,Merge,"The phrase “terms of surrender” implies defeat, but surrender can mean also liberation. On his fourth album for Merge Records, Hiss Golden Messenger’s M.C. Taylor splits the difference between the two meanings of the phrase as he tries to make sense of his own increasingly complicated life. Working within his established roots-rock sound, he explores the heaviest questions—how to be an artist, a parent, a citizen—and realizes that there may be fewer and fewer answers as the years go by. To do so, he enlists two big-name indie-rock guests: the National’s Aaron Dessner contributes guitar and piano, and Jenny Lewis sings backing vocals. But a quieter fact of Terms of Surrender is that the album has no involvement from Scott Hirsch. A longtime collaborator going back to pre-Hiss bands the Court & Spark and Ex Ignota, Hirsch has produced, engineered, and/or played on almost every Hiss Golden Messenger album. His unusual bass patterns helped lock the band into its distinct grooves; his production felt spacious without being sparse. Without him, an intangible element of Hiss’ “secret sauce” has disappeared. Instead, Brad Cook—former Megafaun bassist and collaborator with acts like Bon Iver, Whitney, and Kevin Morby—handles both bass and production, and fills the frame with ill-fitting sounds as if over-compensating. The album isn’t a mess, per se, but it is cluttered, and it often feels like Cook should’ve adhered to Coco Chanel’s rule of removing one thing before leaving the house. There are just too many elements competing for space, and none of them seem to agree which is the star. Hiss Golden Messenger have dipped into dub textures before (2009’s “O Nathaniel,” 2012’s “Born on a Crescent Moon”) and they do so again on Surrender’s “Old Enough to Wonder Why (East Side—West Side).” But then tinny banjo plunks appear like gnats, disrupting the wide-open sense of space. Taylor’s voice, meanwhile, feels squished among layers of guitars, keys, and synths. At times, it’s difficult to make out what he’s singing—a shame, as Taylor has a knack for examining existential anxiety with honesty and empathy. On the sweeping opener “I Need a Teacher,” Taylor yearns for “beauty in the broken American moment.” With “Happy Birthday Baby,” a tender song written for his young daughter, he hopes she’ll think better of him than he does of himself. But the arrangements of songs like “Down at the Uptown” and “Katy (You Don’t Have to Be Good Yet)” feel more in service to broad-strokes Dead-and-Dylan worship than to Taylor’s songwriting. A striking line like, “I’m a little bit lost and a whole lot of things you can’t hang with” gets lost in the anodyne folk-rock mix. Sometimes, Taylor’s lyrics seem to arrive from an entirely different record, one that’s better and more focused. His best songs put his ruminations on spirituality, family, loneliness, and humanity at the center, but here he sounds like the only thing he’s surrendered is his spotlight.

KIRK,DaBaby,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d8d1a0f7b18ef000826ddc6/1:1/w_160/dababy_kirk.jpg,2019-10-02 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dababy-kirk/,South Coast Music GroupInterscope,"DaBaby hasn’t turned down a check since the Fourth of July. On that night, Dreamville debuted “Under the Sun,” a record that features the Charlotte, North Carolina rapper sounding like a local drug dealer that found God. Since that moment, nearly every pop-rap hit has gotten the DaBaby touch. This summer alone, the 27-year-old landed on tracks from Chance The Rapper, Lizzo, Lil Nas X, and Post Malone. In return, DaBaby, who a year ago was stuck in regional-rap-star purgatory, has become one of rap’s most visible stars. With that visibility has come slight DaBaby fatigue; constant exposure to his breathless, high-energy flow will do that. Beginning with March’s Baby on Baby, DaBaby has flooded the internet with different iterations of the same song—you know the one. But it’s important that we note: DaBaby is really good at making that one song. In DaBaby’s six months or so as a pop-culture figure, one thing that we know for sure is that he likes to rap. Like, really rap. He’s not spitting traditional lyrical-miracle 16s, but he is joyfully filling up every inch of available space, and on KIRK, R&B hooks and sing-rap harmonies are an afterthought. His rapping is relentless, and he doesn’t ride a beat so much as he steamrolls it. KIRK offers some moments of unexpected depth. On “Intro,” he reveals that he learned “Suge” went No. 1 on Billboard’s mainstream R&B/hip-hop charts the same day he learned of his father’s sudden death. “Same time I got the news, my shit went number one, that’s fucked up,” he says, over a warm instrumental that sounds like it was made in a hip church’s Sunday school. For the first time, he effectively works an emotion besides “I will punch you in the face” into his formula, and it fits him surprisingly well. DaBaby doesn’t stay in the reflective mindstate for long, though. After he pays respects to his father and comes to terms with his own trauma, he’s back making the sort of music that I imagine plays in his head while he punches a showgoer mid-bar and throws hands at the mall. On “Off The Rip,” DaBaby raps about eating at a restaurant with his kids and mother with the same chaotic spirit he brings to verses about robbing local drug dealers. DaBaby is self-aware, which goes a long way in hip-hop. He goes in over bass-heavy beats that are similar, but not the same, most notably from homegrown Carolina producer Jetsonmade. “Straight off the rip, you know I don’t wait for the drop,” he says, commenting on his penchant for rapping at the 0:01 timestamp. KIRK’s momentum is disrupted by the number of guests that can’t hang with DaBaby (See: Nicki Minaj and Migos). DaBaby’s similarly anarchic long-time partner Stunna 4 Vegas and Kevin Gates are the lone guests that sound at home—which makes sense considering that Gates’ deadpan delivery has probably influenced DaBaby. But much of KIRK is DaBaby in his sweet spot: alone and rapping with the untamed aggression of a tasmanian devil, on a beat that could destroy a 2001 Toyota Corolla from the inside out if played too loud. Change is overrated.","The Charlotte, North Carolina rapper's debut finds him in his sweet spot—which is to say, demolition mode.

The Adornment of Time,Tyshawn SoreyMarilyn Crispell,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d8d1da85d366d000838d1f5/1:1/w_160/adornmentoftime.jpg,2019-10-02 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tyshawn-sorey-marilyn-crispell-the-adornment-of-time/,Pi,"The composer and multi-instrumentalist Tyshawn Sorey has been spoiling audiences in a variety of jazz and classical scenes over the last few years. It’s easy to assume that he’s always in a recording studio somewhere: documenting his excellent trio; working as a percussionist in bands led by colleagues like Vijay Iyer and Steve Lehman; producing expansive, multi-hour pieces that engage with drone-music mysticism. But that substantial discography is hardly the whole story. His recent song cycle, “Cycles of My Being,” was written for the tenor Lawrence Brownlee (and has played at Carnegie Hall and Opera Philadelphia). A 2018 appearance at New York’s Jazz Gallery, during which Sorey performed on a modified piano alongside the saxophonist Hafez Modirzadeh, was a reminder that his work as a keyboardist has not been given enough attention. A few months later, a production of Sorey’s dramatic work inspired by Josephine Baker, with a text by Claudia Rankine, proved mesmerizing on the steps of the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s grand staircase. Yet even as his reach has broadened, Sorey has also kept working in more intimate formats. His latest record, a duo set with the veteran pianist Marilyn Crispell, is a freely improvised meeting recorded live at the Kitchen, a longtime New York experimental haven. The album’s first act—particularly its first 20 minutes—is dominated by hushed and haunted timbres from both players. Approximately half an hour in, we get the first hint of tumult, a mood that develops, thrashes around, crests, and subsides over another quarter hour. An extended, closing coda brings to mind the beginning section while also highlighting the distance these performers have traveled. On the surface, this might seem a standard free-improv sequence, and therefore less notable than Sorey’s hyper-conceptual projects. But this composer lives to mess with surface-level thinking. And thanks to his distaste for categorizing music—particularly when it comes to genre definitions—listeners should always be prepared for ambition and thoughtfulness, no matter the format. Not surprisingly, across this unbroken 64-minute improvisation Crispell proves to be an ideal partner for such a non-hierarchical musical mind. Her own rise to prominence came, during the 1980s, as the pianist in saxophonist and composer Anthony Braxton’s “classic” quartet (a group whose recordings Sorey remembers admiring as a teen in the liner notes for this album). During those vintage, marathon performances, preserved on albums like Quartet (Birmingham) 1985, Crispell often played one of Braxton’s notated solo-piano pieces while the band’s other members played parts from other Braxton works. The collage-style results tended to be bracing, but always in a musical fashion—in part due to Crispell’s keen ability for listening intently amid a whirlwind. Crispell’s responsiveness is still in elite, extraordinary shape here. Her percussive, avant-jazz technique gets plenty of room to roam during a section of high-drama pummeling; check out the swinging density she produces 34 minutes into the set. But her feel for momentum is also present during many of the performance's quieter passages, during which the pianist’s ideas clearly inspire choices made by the drummer. (It helps that Sorey’s kit is outfitted with gongs and other forms of pitched percussion, the better to merge with melodies coming from Crispell’s instrument.) In these moments, The Adornment of Time doesn’t merely present two talented musicians in a room, improvising at the same time. Instead, the album makes good on ideals at the heart of the free-improv tradition—including equality and adaptiveness—that are often paid lip service, if not always easily heard.","A live recording from New York’s the Kitchen captures a rare kind of improv synergy between the versatile composer-percussionist and a pianist who rose to fame in Anthony Braxton’s quartet.

In the Morse Code of Brake Lights,The New Pornographers,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d442f7d7ed29000096e4522/1:1/w_160/unnamed%20(64).jpg,2019-10-02 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-new-pornographers-in-the-morse-code-of-brake-lights/,Collected WorksConcord,"Ever since Chuck Berry motorvated over the hill in “Maybellene,” cars have been a shorthand for freedom in rock’n’roll. The New Pornographers flip this axiom on its head on their eighth album, In the Morse Code of Brake Lights, where all sense of liberation is undercut by a suspicion that whoever is behind the wheel may be headed toward danger. A sense of doom lurks at the heart of Brake Lights, providing connective tissue between its 11 barbed songs and darkening the album’s sunniest moments. As the work of a collective determined to keep classic guitar-pop alive by slyly twisting and expanding the form, Brake Lights has no shortage of colorful melodies, yet the hooks rarely feel bright, certainly not when compared to the incandescent rush of 2017’s Whiteout Conditions. Such a shift in tone is deliberate, a reflection of changes within the New Pornographers as well as the culture at large. Always the group’s unofficial leader, A.C. Newman now stands as its lone songwriter and producer. Busy with family obligations, bassist John Collins decided not to share production duties with Newman this time around, while the mercurial Dan Bejar opted to sit out, save a lyric or two. Bejar’s absence has the inevitable side effect of straightening out the group’s sound, but the bigger change on Brake Lights lies in the New Pornographers’ retreat from the bombast of 2014’s Brill Bruisers and the percolating Krautrock rhythms and New Wave sheen of Whiteout Conditions. Stripped of such excesses, the band seems harder and tougher than they have in a while, maybe since the days of Twin Cinema. A lot has changed since 2005, not the least being a global political lurch toward the right. Newman appears to address the turmoil of Trump’s America throughout Brake Lights: The narrator of “Colossus of Rhodes” sorts through the wreckage of a break-in but still believes in salvation; “Higher Beam” laments that “deep in the culture of fear, we all hate living here”; references to dead malls and cold wars are rampant. Despite these charged phrases, it’s difficult to discern any distinct political position in these songs, because Newman resists concrete narratives. Words pile upon each other, slowing down just enough to allow a certain line to linger; it’s as if he’s writing puzzles to counteract the force of his melodies. Perhaps Newman’s lyrics are elusive, but enough images catch hold to create a lasting impression. In the Morse Code of Brake Lights feels emotionally direct in a way that’s foreign to New Pornographers, the result of Newman stripping the group down to its foundation and then building back up with the assistance of the string quartet Strength of Materials. When the guitar amps are cranked, it sometimes can be difficult to distinguish the sawing strings from analog synthesizers, but that only emphasizes how densely saturated the album is. The songs are propelled by a giant backbeat and sustained by soaring melodies, but they’re surrounded by a cavalcade of echoing harmonies, carnivalesque keyboards and, on occasion, a ripe guitar riff. At the center of all the tumult is A.C. Newman and Neko Case, the pair who have wound up as the New Pornographers’ joint frontpeople. By now, their complementary styles are familiar—Case channels her passion with melodramatic flair, Newman is her wry, plaintive tonic—but far from tired. Each vocalist wrings out the confusion, desperation, and fear of the album’s darkest moments, adding shape and meaning to songs designed not to expose their secrets so easily. Case, in particular, has a knack for transforming elliptical tunes into urgent drama—in her hands, “Colossus of Rhodes” plays like an anthem—but Newman lends vulnerability to the delicate strains of “You Won’t Need Those Where You’re Going.” Still, what pulls the album into focus is their vocal interplay. Case and Newman trade lines, finish each other’s thoughts, reveal the unspoken meanings of the songs; they’re old friends who find sustenance in each other’s presence. The essential humanity at the heart of this relationship offsets the dread that flows throughout In the Morse Code of Brake Lights, and gently leads the record toward something resembling hope.

I’M HIM,Kevin Gates,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d92163442446e00087f7c12/1:1/w_160/kevingates_imhim.jpeg,2019-10-02 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kevin-gates-im-him/,Bread Winners’ Association,"Somewhere along the way, Kevin Gates got buff. It wasn't a magical Gucci Mane transformation, but the once dad-bodded Louisiana rapper is now fit enough to be the subject of a Men’s Health video, where he outlined an exhaustive regime that includes rigorous dieting and 2 a.m. weight training. That same dedication he brings to working out—or to practicing oral sex on mangos, as he revealed when that Men’s Health segment inevitably took one of those weird, sexual turns that Gates always seems to invite—permeates just about everything he does, including his music. I'm Him is Gates’ official follow-up to his revelatory 2016 album Islah, although that ignores all the very good EPs and mixtapes he released in the interim. Parsing the distinction between albums and mixtapes is usually a fool’s errand, especially for an artist like Gates who mostly works without guest features, name producers, and other big-budget trappings. But I’m Him differentiates itself from his non-album releases in one key way: The hooks are magnificent, his most boisterous and fine-tuned since Islah. Lots of rappers sing, of course, but few seem to enjoy it as much as Gates. Even the most naturally tuneful SoundCloud rappers from the last few years sing as if out of solemn obligation. Gates bellows with a zeal rarely heard since Fetty Wap’s 2015 singles run; even when he's singing about pain and regret, he offers the go-for-broke gusto most of us save for a hot shower. “By My Lonely” runs a scant two minutes, but its hook is so monumental the track hits like an epic. Gates has carried a full-length project by himself before, but that doesn't make it any less remarkable hearing him do it again.  Seventeen songs with no guest features should be a recipe for exhaustion, yet there's hardly a trace of fat on I’m Him, and most tracks clock in at about the length of a Ramones song. “Push It” belongs in a Rocky montage, while “What I Like” pits Gates’ voice against a blown-out bass rumble. There are fewer sex songs on the album than usual, too, which is nice. Wonderful as it may be, Gates' voice is not the aphrodisiac he thinks it is. He includes two bravely sentimental standouts. “Betta For You” is an apology to the daughter he vows to do right by (“Your mother had you waterbirth and I skipped out, I was scared/I was afraid to be a failure, prayed my faith would prevail,”) while on “Fly Again’ he offers a grandiose love letter to his wife. “We the reciprocal of one another, come from the same star/We got the same moles under our nose and we got the same scars,” he raps, his voice dripping with sincerity. If I’m Him feels just a hair less essential than some of Gates’ previous releases, it’s because there isn’t all that much new to see. Gates folds a bit of DaBaby’s irritable yammer into his flow on “Facts” and on “Pretend” he flirts with a dancehall patois, both of which he more or less pulls off. But innovation has never been integral to a Kevin Gates project. The draw remains, as always, hearing one of rap’s most well-rounded personalities be his unabashed self, whether that means being a hardhead, a hornball, an unguarded romantic, or all of the above.","The follow up to 2016's revelatory Islah offers another showcase for the Baton Rouge rapper's fully formed and gloriously weird personality.

SOUND & FURY,Sturgill Simpson,by: Chris O'Connell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d8d0e675d366d000838d1eb/1:1/w_160/sturgill_soundandfury.jpg,2019-10-01 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sturgill-simpson-sound-and-fury/,Elektra,"In 2017, Sturgill Simpson publicly declared that Nashville—every country musician’s master—does not dictate who he is or what his music sounds like. After his third studio album, A Sailor’s Guide to Earth, Simpson busked outside the 2017 Country Music Awards in protest of a statement CMA sent to journalists demanding they refrain from asking artists about the Las Vegas massacre, gun rights, or politics in general. One of the signs in his open guitar case read, mockingly, “Struggling country singer.” If the country music establishment didn’t feel he was fit for them, he’d show them that they were correct. He expands on this idea on SOUND & FURY, his fourth full-length, an extension of that protest in album—and anime—form. The album is the soundtrack to an accompanying Netflix film, which is essentially a 41-minute music video. Fitting, then, that the album opener is titled “Ronin,” meaning a wandering samurai with no master. The song kicks off with some grade-A foley work—boots crunching rocks on a dirt road, an old gas-guzzler wheezing to life, Alex Jones on the radio—and evolves into a swampy extended guitar solo that lays bare Simpson’s intentions for the rest of the album. Across 10 tracks, Simpson trades subtlety and plaintive guitar work for full-bore skronk and sleaze. It’s a hard but fearless turn away from what Simpson’s calling card of blurring the lines between country and psychedelia. On SOUND & FURY, Simpson throws both genres into the trunk of his car and does 85 down the backroads. Musically, SOUND & FURY has more in common with ZZ Top’s 1983 album Eliminator than Merle Haggard’s Hag—or any country album, really. The tracks are woven together by the car radio first heard on “Ronin,” as if Simpson is changing the station for us, showing that he can glide between synth-rock, glam, dancefloor-fillers; songwriting is king in his world. It doesn’t matter if he’s playing a dreamy campfire song—there are none here, by the way—or a two-minute instrumental stomper. Simpson is the one dictating his sound, take it or leave it. What works for Simpson is when he lets his soulful voice shine through, like on “All Said and Done,” the closest fans will get to a Simpson song of yore on the album, or “Mercury in Retrograde,” a bouncy pop tune with electric strings and a fluttering synth about fake friends who barge on to his tour bus to ask him if his songs are about them. This one is. What doesn’t quite land are tracks like “A Good Look,” co-written with John Prine, if you can believe it. It’s a frenetic disco-funk song, with a police-siren lead guitar and an overworked bassist. Its genuinely interesting and introspective lines about creating art, like, “I write my poems in the dirt with an oily rag/I have to wear a gas mask just so I don’t gag” become frustrating afterthoughts when followed by an incessant cowbell. There are a few more moments like this, where Simpson’s reliance on ’80s disco and funk often feels more like artifice than art, a reactionary and deliberate hard-right away from what has served him so well in the past: lush, beautiful soundscapes and sweeping choruses. The lyrics from “Make Art Not Friends,” anticipate such criticism. The song begins with an extended arpeggiated synth part that wouldn’t sound out of place on Tangerine Dream’s Tangram, before eventually evolving into a cohesive thesis for the album. “This town’s getting crowded, the truth’s been shrouded. I think it’s time to change up the sound,” Simpson croons. “The wheels keep turning, the flames get higher, another cycle rolls around.” Simpson has always looked for an escape. His first album, High Top Mountain, was his traditional country debut, a hail-mary attempt to make it; Metamodern Sounds in Country Music was his refutation of that style, with stoned panache; and he said he wrote A Sailor’s Guide to Earth because “people think I wake up in the morning and pour LSD on my Cheerios.” SOUND & FURY is miles down the road from any of his previous albums. As the album’s closer, “Fastest Horse in Town,” reaches the seven-minute mark and the radio sounds return, we hear that same car from “Ronin” revving up and speeding away. He’s likely already done with this sound, and on to the next one. Hell, he told his wife a few years ago that he’d make a bluegrass record someday composed of ’80s covers of her choosing. Only the real ones will be along for this ride, but, as he sings on “Mercury in Retrograde,” the album’s penultimate track, “the road to hell is paved with cruel intentions.” He’ll travel it solo if need be.

Dreams Are Not Enough,Telefon Tel Aviv,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d8d11417610040009f9209a/1:1/w_160/telefon_dreams.jpg,2019-10-01 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/telefon-tel-aviv-dreams-are-not-enough/,Ghostly International,"There was a time, not long ago, that Joshua Eustis doubted whether he would ever make another Telefon Tel Aviv record. Between 2001 and 2009, Eustis and his duo partner Charlie Cooper recorded three albums, establishing a singular fusion of maze-like circuitry and soulful melancholy that is part Autechre and part Depeche Mode. Then, the same week that their third album Immolate Yourself was released, Cooper disappeared and was found dead in his sleep. Shortly thereafter, Eustis’ father died, and then the film director John Hughes passed, whose son had put out Telefon Tel Aviv’s first album, and who Eustis said “was like a second father to me.” With a sizeable chunk of his world suddenly wiped out, Eustis faced the task of starting over. Gradually, he did just that. In 2014, Eustis released a solo album of elegant synth pop as Sons of Magdalene.. He produced for Tropic of Cancer and Vatican Shadow. He played in Tool frontman Maynard James Keenan’s group Puscifer and the brooding synth-pop trio the Black Queen; he was a touring member of Nine Inch Nails. And with Belong’s Turk Dietrich, he recorded two albums of deeply experimental dance music as Second Woman. Now, a decade after Immolate Yourself, Eustis returns with Dreams Are Not Enough, his first solo album under the alias. Telefon Tel Aviv were always downcast, but Dreams Are Not Enough sharpens and strengthens their most morose tendencies into a kind of probing and exquisite bleakness—what Eustis has described as “the rapture of despair.” The suffering is inseparable from the serotonin rush; it is storm-tossed sea and lifeboat all in one. The album is formally inventive in a way we don’t often expect of music so firmly grounded in gloomy electronic pop. In the course of the record’s trim 50 minutes, it winds between sandblasted ambient and misty-eyed synth pop, industrial techno and chamber choir; there are echoes of Chicago acid and Arvo Pärt alongside apocalyptic sound design reminiscent of Ben Frost. The scale of the thing is enormous, suggesting cliffs cleaving into the sea. Certain tropes recur throughout: Chief among these is a strange kind of zippering rhythm, speeding and slowing in cycles, like a stick being dragged along a metal grill. Second Woman made extensive use of the technique, but if there it could feel clinical, like an experiment in search of a real-world application, here it has a powerful emotional undertow. In the album’s opening track, it works like a bellows, stoking dull coals into full flame, and it’s put into similar service on nearly every song, wringing something wild and unpredictable out of what might otherwise have been merely politely forlorn. It often feels like the very stuff of the music is being torn apart. This recurring arrhythmic energy helps bind the album; so do the ambient interludes that stitch together contrasting tracks. The whole album works as a suite, a deep dive into a dream state. Eustis says he has experienced both lucid dreaming and sleep paralysis, and the album’s song titles are drawn from one of his nighttime visions. When read down the tracklist, they constitute a brief poem: I dream of it often:
a younger version of myself,
standing at the bottom of the ocean;
arms aloft,
mouth agape,
eyes glaring,
not seeing,
not breathing,
still as stone in a watery fane. Fittingly, for such an expression of Romantic yearning, Eustis’ songs dwell mostly upon loss, regret, and the passage of time, though his words are frequently indecipherable, buried beneath layers of distortion. It seems likely that’s on purpose: The lyrics are right there on the sleeve of the record, but they are mostly expressions of the kind of hurt that is as private as it is universal. Eustis dances between revealing and concealing, admission and denial, and that tension animates the record from within: emotional whiplash as the engine of life. In this, the album plays out very  much like the sweep of grief itself.

Prison on a Hill,Somos,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d6699ce8aeb9e0008ccf731/1:1/w_160/somos_prisononahill.jpg,2019-10-01 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/somos-prison-on-a-hill/,Tiny Engines,"“From here on out we are Antifa-core,” Somos announced shortly after the release of Prison on a Hill. Their third album wears its radicalism on its sleeve: The title reappropriates the puritanical vision of their native Boston and Ronald Reagan’s sundowning American dream, while the cover utilizes anti-Nazi iconography. But more importantly, that’s what Phil Haggerty would’ve wanted. Somos’ guitarist passed away August 10 at age 28, and the band paid tribute by emphasizing his activism, posting local news footage of Haggerty ripping down white pride flyers. Their label, Tiny Engines, rush-released the album for a week to help defray funeral costs, donating the overage to the Heather Heyer Foundation. While Haggerty’s death lends an unfortunate urgency to Prison on a Hill, it doesn’t fundamentally change the album so much as emphasize what it already was: a band reaching a new level of confidence making songs about the human cost of late capitalism. Many punk bands rail against the “same 9-to-5, 16-to-65” from a position of moral superiority, whereas Somos’ breakout single “Dead Wrong” saw it as a trap that most don’t have the privilege to avoid. The average desk jockey wasn’t complacent or weak, just struggling to maintain sanity in a system that saps whatever energy could be spent trying to improve the collective lot. “We have insufficient hate for an unforgiving place,” Michael Fiorentino sang on 2016’s First Day Back, which prophetically alluded to a violent decline led by right-wing demagogues or apolitical shitposters (“You can mock anyone/You can find humor in anything”). Turns out it was both, and now Prison on a Hill surveys the suffering that results when these viewpoints gain even the slightest public legitimacy. “What do you think they’ll do to us, once they are really on the move?” Fiorentino asks on “Mediterranean,” a song inspired by the rise of anti-immigrant movements in Europe. While Somos’ political stance isn’t new, Prison on a Hill imagines it as a message worthy of thousands, rather than a few dozen in a basement. “Mediterranean” is a surefire, almost sweatless stadium-rock groove, the kind you hear from bands destined for beer commercials and an eventual gig opening for Foo Fighters. This is not the same band whose hiatus appeared permanent after their second album First Day Back, an album that managed to sound both demo-like and overproduced, alienating fans of their more rugged debut and failing to attract new ones. Throughout 2017, the group focused their energy on activism and other projects, but eventually returned to the recording studio with ideas to match their ambitions. Somos now operate with a newfound sense of adventure, doing everything more than in the past. The timid synth washes of First Day Back are swapped for pianos and strings on “Iron Heel” and “Mediterranean,” achieving a symphonic grandeur that might’ve once seemed overblown. “My Way to You” equally recalls the Tinkertoy beat-making of Tanlines and palm-muted pyrotechnics of early Taking Back Sunday, and delivers the album’s most unintentionally heartbreaking moment. “Thank you for the best years of your precious life” feels like foreshadowing now, even if “My Way to You” is still a quintessential Somos song, one where a faceless, domineering entity offers some kind of trinket—a medal, a retirement watch, a severance package—in exchange for human capital. Both dominant parties in American politics—the right and center-left—caricature Antifa as jackbooted extremists, rather than guys like Haggerty who fought racism on a street level and whose obituary noted how much he enjoyed the beach and the Boston Celtics. Prison on a Hill is also variously enraged, defeated, hopeful, and dreamless—but always empathetic, even for those who find themselves on the wrong side of history because they just didn’t see other options. The “heavily armed guards/Bored out of their minds/Desperately hoping for a chance to shoot to kill” on “Granite Face” and the shellshocked veteran on “Farewell to Exile” (“I was too young to see it all”) are treated in a way that targets the military-industrial complex, rather than the enlisted. Fiorentino has frequently utilized “the killing fields” as a metaphor in his lyrics, purposefully vague about whether he’s referring to a “war of annihilation” abroad or the simple fact that everyone is battling for an ever-dwindling amount of resources. “Iron Heel” takes its imagery from Mad Max, yet when Fiorentino sings “How did it feel to be born after the gold rush?” the post-apocalyptic wasteland might as well be the gig economy. Prison on a Hill is nearly 20 minutes longer than First Day Back, and its back half is subject to an occasional midtempo lull. But at its best, it’s like a Born in the U.S.A. for 2019: synth-gilded, blue-collar rock honoring people drafted into a war they had no part in creating.","The Boston rockers’ third album wears its radicalism with confidence, and the untimely death of the band’s guitarist lends their late-capitalist protest unfortunate urgency.

Legendary Member,Thaiboy Digital,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d8d1c7c7610040009f9209f/1:1/w_160/thaiboy_legend.jpeg,2019-10-01 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/thaiboy-digital-legendary-member/,YEAR0001,"Born in Thailand, raised in Sweden, and influenced by American rappers like Soulja Boy and 50 Cent, Thaiboy Digital (real name Thanapat Thaothawong) testifies to rap’s status as a global commodity. He also illustrates the gap separating the life of the music from its makers; Hip-hop might go where it wants, but human beings often have more trouble, and Thaiboy’s had a number of scuffles with Swedish immigration authorities over the years (he was deported back to Thailand for a spell in 2015). Those troubles don’t necessarily manifest in the lyrics of Legendary Member, Thaiboy’s debut album, but they have impacted how the album was made. His deportation to Thailand turned his creative collaboration with Drain Gang, a Swedish collective that includes producers Yung Sherman and Whitearmor and rappers Bladee and Ecco2K, into an entirely digital relationship, a wireless transmission pinging back and forth between different countries and disparate styles. A restless spirit, Thaiboy drifts between relentless and repetitive flows and Auto-Tuned falsetto crooning. There’s a sense of jubilant menace to straight-up rap cuts like “Drainstar Rock” and “Nervous,” which recount the expected tales of Bentley trucks and double cups. The simplicity of Thaiboy’s hooks — Volvo-sized couplets like “Break it in half/Kit Kat” and “Nowhere else to go/Kiss me through the scope” — betrays the complexity of his vocal delivery and the intricate production that buoys it. Thaiboy’s voice drones like a Gregorian men’s chorus when he’s rapping, but his most confident register is the melodic flow he flexes on glossy love songs like “Kiss Me Through the Scope” and “Lip Service.” The latter track, a duet with Drain Gang associate Ecco2K, is Thaiboy at his dreamiest, a lovestruck ode to an angelic raver girl. The production, handled exclusively by producers Gud, Whitearmor, Woesum, and Ripsquad, is equally dreamy: cascades of vocal samples on “Baby,” wind chimes on “Can’t Tell,” the glittering synth line that lends a melancholic chill to “Legendary Member.” It’s striking to consider how much-maligned American “mumble rap” has opened up space for rappers like Thaiboy and his seasonally affected compatriots in Stockholm, who come to English as a second, third, or fourth language. In an interview with The Fader, Thaiboy Digital describes his thought patterns as a trilingual speaker: “If I get surprised, I think in English. I like to curse in Swedish. And when it’s some real shit, I think in Thai.” Though his lyrics are almost exclusively in English, there are times where it sounds like Thaiboy is rapping in different languages in his mind. His vocal delivery overrides the specific meaning of individual words, making melodies from the sound of language itself. Mumble rap transforms what would have been considered mistakes or imperfections in another era of hip-hop into stylistic attributes; there’s meaning in how a voice sounds, not just in what it says. Precision and enunciation, the privileges of native speakers, aren’t priorities in hip-hop like they used to be, and it’s reshaped the linguistics of rap worldwide. The words that come out of Thaiboy Digital’s mouth are often slurred and unclear, their exact meaning obscured until you look up the lyrics, but the intended emotional effect is impossible to miss.","The Thailand-born and Sweden-raised rapper offers a dreamy, melancholic, and abstracted take on mumble rap.

Blue World,John Coltrane,by: Nate Chinen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d8cc2027b18ef000826dd4f/1:1/w_160/JohnColtrane_BlueWorld.jpg,2019-09-30 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/john-coltrane-blue-world/,Impulse!,"Sometimes a thing can be hidden without really hiding. Blue World, a previously unissued cache of studio recordings by the classic John Coltrane Quartet, comes to us in this vein: For the last 55 years, a clue to its existence could clearly be heard in the soundtrack to a well-regarded French-Canadian film, which interpolated portions of three separate tracks. But only in recent years have jazz scholars connected the dots, leading to what we have here: a 37-minute album (of sorts) by one of the most compelling bands in jazz history, at an unmistakable apex of cohesion. If this sounds vaguely familiar, it may be because of the afterglow of Both Directions at Once: The Lost Album, which Impulse! released, to critical acclaim and commercial triumph just last year. The precedent of that album, and what you could call its market validation, surely had something to do with the way that Coltrane’s estate and former label have rolled out this one. But it would be foolish to shrug off Blue World as yet more product off the archival assembly line. For any admirer of Coltrane, a saxophonist-composer-bandleader who embodied so much in the 1960s—deep mystery, spiritual fervor, hurtling momentum, searching humility—it’s a windfall worth greeting with fresh astonishment, before considering a handful of questions. So, in that spirit: Blue World offers a glimpse of the John Coltrane Quartet in a state of relaxed assurance, during the same span of time that would yield two landmarks, Crescent and A Love Supreme. Recorded at Van Gelder Studios on June 24, 1964, it’s a small assortment of songs from earlier in Coltrane’s career, refashioned by the evolving language of the band. And to a man—Coltrane on tenor saxophone, McCoy Tyner on piano, Jimmy Garrison on bass, Elvin Jones on drums—these musicians seem almost to luxuriate in the dark modal hum and polyrhythmic pull that had already become their trademark. They sound unburdened, as if they have no agenda to advance, and nothing to prove. Which stands in stark contrast to director Gilles Groulx, at whose behest this music was made. Trained as a documentary filmmaker, Groulx was working on his first feature, Le chat dans le sac (The Cat in the Bag)—a metaphorically charged portrait of a young couple’s unraveling, informed both by the French new wave and Québec’s emerging separatist movement—when he had the idea to approach Coltrane for a soundtrack. Coltrane agreed, but because the project fell outside the purview of his record contract, he left the date off the usual session logs. Groulx took the master tapes back to Montréal, where they were eventually stored in a vault of the National Film Board. Le chat dans le sac, an early touchstone for Québec cinema, uses only 10 minutes of Coltrane’s music—but in prominent places, with an obvious touch of pride. Barbara Ulrich, one of the film’s two stars (and Groulx’s romantic partner for a time), recalls in the Blue World liner notes that he had specific song requests for Coltrane. Drawn from albums in his personal collection, they represented objects in the saxophonist’s rearview. Coltrane wasn’t in the habit of revisiting previously recorded songs in the studio, but in this case, he and the band obliged. “Naima,” Coltrane’s tenderest ballad, first appeared on Giant Steps, the 1960 album that signaled his break from Miles Davis, and the beginning of a relationship with Atlantic Records. The song remained in Coltrane’s active repertory—you’ll find it, twice, on The Complete 1961 Village Vanguard Recordings—but its quietly smoldering treatment here is notable. Les chat opens with the full first take. (A second take is no less persuasive but a touch less vulnerable.) “Traneing In” is from an even earlier vintage: the album titled John Coltrane With the Red Garland Trio, recorded in 1957 and released, on Prestige, the following year. The version on Blue World begins with a nearly three-minute bass solo—a master class in low-end theory by Garrison, but not the sort of gesture that would have naturally suited an album track at the time. Coltrane must have embraced the idea that Groulx would pull choice excerpts from the session, taking it as a license to stretch. (The looseness in his own solo recalls a boxer’s warmup routine.) Groulx must have also admired the 1961 Atlantic album Coltrane Jazz, because Blue World includes two reimagined pieces from its tracklist, “Like Sonny” and “Village Blues.” The former, so named because Coltrane based its melody on a phrase he associated with Sonny Rollins, appears here in one brief and noncommittal take; Coltrane’s intonation and attack are shaky, and it would seem that he decided to set this tune aside. Honestly, it’s not a keeper. “Village Blues,” on the other hand, sounds marvelous in all three versions on Blue World. Take 2, which appears in the film, is the right selection. (The first take feels less focused rhythmically; the third maintains a lower simmer.) But these musicians could do no wrong playing the blues in this period, and the loping incantation of “Village Blues” is a near-perfect vehicle for them. Speaking of which, the title track of Blue World appears in two excerpts toward the end of Groulx’s film. This too is a callback: The song is a barely disguised rewrite of Harold Arlen and Johnny Mercer’s “Out of This World,” which had been the opening track of the 1962 album Coltrane. Its new title is almost certainly a ploy to evade copyright and licensing obligations, given that Coltrane employs such a similar arrangement as he did before. Still, the execution reflects a band with heavier traction, a stronger sense of itself. And there are moments in Coltrane’s solo when he cycles a motif through several tonal centers, testing an idea he’d soon push to center stage on A Love Supreme. The comparison that puts Blue World in clearer context, though, is Crescent, the title track of which had been recorded in the same room three weeks earlier. Ben Ratliff, one of Coltrane’s biographers, has observed: “Crescent does not contain the most impressive solos by any member of the John Coltrane Quartet; but in a span of six years with more cornerstone statements than most bands have listenable albums, it occupies the greatest part of that group’s center.” This is correct. And to extend the thought, Blue World falls just off-center—not a major addition to the Coltrane canon, but certainly an addition to a major part of it. There’s no serious argument to be made for its integrity as a proper album; there’s too much redundancy for that, and no way of knowing what Coltrane would have wanted. But the strongest moments on this offhanded, unintended artifact are remarkable even by the standards of this band at this juncture, and the historical record will reflect that. Finally, the cat’s out of the bag.","Long-lost soundtrack recordings by the saxophonist’s powerhouse quartet, made shortly after 1964’s Crescent sessions, capture the band at the peak of its cohesion.

Face to Phase,rRoxymore,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d8bbfa85c47170008d47d88/1:1/w_160/rroxy_face.jpg,2019-09-30 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rroxymore-face-to-phase/,Don't Be Afraid,"The most interesting dance music right now isn’t coming from house and techno; it’s happening in the margins, where producers are unafraid to fuck up a steady groove every now and then. Where mainstream house and techno (and their standard-issue “underground” variants) are concerned with getting everything just right—the right EQ on the drums, the right compression on the bass, the right number of bars leading up to the climax—the really interesting stuff right now takes its pleasure from getting the right things deliciously wrong. The UK label Don’t Be Afraid is helping lead this charge leftward. Even its clubbiest records are wobbly and moth-eaten, and with artists like Karen Gwyer, one of its most unpredictable talents, it has blazed new trails into the unknown. The debut album from the Berlin producer rRoxymore continues that trajectory: The French-born artist has spent the past decade crafting an increasingly idiosyncratic take on classic club styles, wrapping unvarnished drum machines in analog squelch and treating dance music’s most cherished rules with blithe disregard. Her early single “Wheel of Fortune” slows precipitously halfway through, threatening to derail any DJ who might be attempting to mix the record. On Face to Phase, she gives her experimental tendencies free rein. Face to Phase is still plenty forceful, and even danceable in places: “Passages,” which kicks the album into full gear following a dreamy ambient intro, wields its broken rhythm with serious strength, its burly kick drums landing like blows to the sternum; “Forward Flamingo,” which follows, boasts the kind of skulking, mysterious groove you could imagine hearing from a Lena Willikens set. Throughout, the music has all the hallmarks of sci-fi intrigue—shimmering Detroit pads, eerie chromatic progressions, Theremin-like tremolo squeals—with none of the self-consciously retro affect that’s customary in electronic music. The label says that most of the album was produced “in the box”—that is, primarily on the computer. So while it may sometimes sound analog, she’s clearly not much concerned with repeating old glories. Even at its most powerful, the music seems less interested in forward motion than in carving out space for exploration—the freedom to try out a knotty drum groove or an unusually iridescent palette—and then move on without looking back. By track four, “Energy Points,” which drizzles soft marimbas over irradiated background noise, dance music’s touchstones are beginning to dissolve. “Someone Else’s Memory” hints at the shakuhachi intro of Peter Gabriel’s “Sledgehammer” before launching into a stern, industrial march and then dropping the beat out just as abruptly, as though led by an absent-minded drum major. By the closing “What’s the Plan,” the slow-motion beats have succumbed to fatal enervation, stumbling and falling back into the glistening ooze. That might not sound like it’s supposed to be exciting, but it is; not many artists are this willing to short-circuit dancefloor function in the service of more idiosyncratic ends. It all adds up to an unusually expressive album, one that disregards clubland’s status quo in favor of far more imaginative terrain. The opening track, “Home Is Where the Music Is,” sets out to map that territory: a beatless synthesizer fantasia as tender and moving as a piano ballad, it sounds like old certainties being melted for scrap and turned into something new.","The Berlin producer is unafraid to throw a wrench into her steady grooves, and her latest disregards clubland’s status quo for more imaginative terrain.

Weeping Icon,Weeping Icon,by: Madison Bloom,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d8cce825c47170008d47e32/1:1/w_160/weepingicon_weepingicon.jpg,2019-09-30 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/weeping-icon-weeping-icon/,Fire Talk,"In 1990, experimental filmmaker Jon Moritsugu released My Degeneration, a movie about an all-girl punk band called Fetish who get sponsored by Big Beef and spiral into chaos as a result of their success. Their songs become propaganda for juicy steaks and sausages, and their lead singer falls in love with a severed pig’s head named Livingston. It’s a hilarious parody of rock’n’roll excess, inflated egos, and the now-obsolete sin of “selling out.” The characters that populate Brooklyn punk band Weeping Icon’s self-titled debut are grappling with similar issues, only their patrons are lifestyle brands and their preferred platform is Instagram instead of a stage. On their sturdy first album, Weeping Icon offer a suite of detailed and coarse thrashers that pick apart our relationship with social media and #content in a way that is unpretentious and often quite funny. In 2017, Weeping Icon released Eyeball Under, an eight-track project stocked with energetic (if sometimes generic) punk cuts that were effective individually but didn’t stitch together as a whole. In contrast, Weeping Icon feels like a complete vision, aided by a studio team of Uniform’s Ben Greenberg and Eaters’ Jonathan Schenke, as well as the precise, discordant interludes that connect each song like barbed wire. These distorted tendrils mimic Weeping Icon’s live performances. “We don’t stop between songs because we want to sustain the energy and for the sets to be immersive,” the band said in a 2017 interview. “We want people to feel very present.” Considering that most of the lyrics on Weeping Icon skewer the amount of time we spend staring into our phones, you might say the desire to be present is one of the album’s unspoken themes. The instrumental vignettes do command presence. They cast an apocalyptic pall over the record, perpetuating a feeling of unease, but they also allow the full-length tracks to pop. “Be Anti” punches through the sickly, arrhythmic heartbeat of “(you should listen to me),” delivering a snarky sendup of counterculture fit for Portlandia. Singer and guitarist Sara Fantry spews a vague monologue about how fucked up the world is. She’s pissed off, and there is only one way to change things: “I’m gonna spit,” she snarls, before making sure the act was captured on video. “Did you get it?” She asks. “Post it on Instagram… Do you have Snapchat? Oh, Facebook Live, put it on Facebook Live. I’ll do it again.” It’s an abridged version of something we see every day: People staging their lives for an invisible audience. Throughout, Weeping Icon poke fun at the discrepancies between the lives we live and those we post online. On “Like Envy,” Fantry takes on the persona of an Instagram influencer. “I post every day at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.,” she gushes. “My life is my brand.” By the song’s end, Weeping Icon’s instruments have been kicked into overdrive, Fantry’s buzzsaw guitar shooting off sparks while Sarah Lutkenhaus’ synthesizer howls like a wild dog. Fantry’s character, meanwhile, has completely unraveled. She sounds like she’s crouched over a pile of burning rubble, compulsively listing Instagram filters she can no longer use, because the world has ended. It would be too easy for Weeping Icon’s critique of the social-media generation to come off as heavy-handed and out of touch—fortunately, they’re just as guilty as the rest of us. “We’ve all taken selfies,” Fantry said in a recent interview. “We’re on social media all the time.” Their participation in the phenomenon and their sense of humor (one of the songs is literally the bandmates laughing uncontrollably) are what save Weeping Icon from sounding like an album made by Abe Simpson, or worse, your dad.

Reservoir 1: Preservation,Sarah Hennies,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d8a302a21339a0008396a77/1:1/w_160/sarahhennies.jpg,2019-09-30 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sarah-hennies-reservoir-1-preservation/,Black Truffle,"Much the way Paul Klee compared drawing a line to taking a walk, American composer Sarah Hennies’ Reservoir 1: Preservation feels like what happens when a percussion ensemble throws on its hiking boots. The 56-minute work, the first of three Reservoir pieces based on the relationship between the conscious and unconscious mind, is scored for three percussionists, who shake, hit, and tease their instruments into vividly atmospheric shapes over a piano’s sparse, mournful melody. The piano is ever present in Reservoir 1, its jazzy, sometimes jarring lines played with admirable restraint by Phillip Bush. But it is the percussion, performed by Hennies alongside her partners in the improvisational group Meridian, Tim Feeney and Greg Stuart, that stars. We are used to percussion playing a supporting role to the whims of melody, or serving as a tool for dancing. Here, though, it dominates, driving Reservoir 1's heady atmosphere as if indifferent to the demands of the piano's chords. This is percussion as a tool for expression, an end in itself rather than a means toward a wider goal. The dramatic range achieved by such apparently limited means is impressive. Toward the start of the piece, shakers cut through the piano’s artfully dripped melody to inject urgency and life, their rhythms overlapping in a way that suggests the babble of hurried conversation. Later, percussive touches bring tension, echoing the nervous patter of rain on a tin roof as it builds to a storm. From there, Reservoir 1 dives into emotional extremes. At 26 minutes, a globular droning effect conveys drowsy serenity; five minutes later this has curdled into paranoia and violence, as blunt percussive blows strike malignantly, recalling percussionist Alasdair Malloy’s meticulous assault on a slab of meat for Scott Walker’s The Drift. Through all this, the piano drifts onward, discernible but somehow out of reach, the mysterious unconscious to the juddering passion of percussion’s conscious mind. The constancy of the piano helps to hold Reservoir 1 together; its internal logic bonds the album into a coherent, satisfying listen. But Reservoir 1 is adaptable, too. Hennies has said that the idea behind the three Reservoir pieces—the second was premiered in spring 2019 by flautist Claire Chase and vocal performance ensemble Constellation Chor, while the third is intended to be a piece for strings—is that they will work together and individually. It’s also possible to cherry-pick outstanding moments from Reservoir 1’s well-rounded whole. I love the stumbling rhythm between bass drum and woodblocks around the 10-minute mark, which seems to delight in slipping out of frame, and the haunting scrabble at 44 minutes that echoes the ghostly cracking of an abandoned boat at sea. The occasional frustration with Reservoir 1 is that it can feel like it would be better experienced live than on record. Meridian drift so far from typical percussive sounds over the 56-minute piece that human nature demands to know how this music is being made. But what the listener loses in understanding, they gain in mystery. Hennies has spoken of the importance of recordings in removing the visual associations that we have around music, with the sight of a cymbal being played, for example, automatically triggering certain assumptions. On Reservoir 1 the shape-shifting percussive palette is all the more gripping for its enigmatic origins, like a magic trick that must forever remain secret. Hennies’ work is an oasis of inscrutability, where ignorance is bliss and time slips by unhurried.","Assisted by the pianist Phillip Bush and colleagues in the percussion ensemble Meridian, the American composer tests conventional notions of musical narrative.

Gold: Greatest Hits,ABBA,by: Jamieson Cox,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d8e4e2742446e00087f7b6a/1:1/w_160/abba_gold.jpg,2019-09-29 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/abba-gold-greatest-hits/,Polygram,"What, exactly, is the use of a “greatest hits” album in 2019? The full catalogs of almost every artist popular enough to merit such a collection are available through any streaming service, organized by algorithms, and easily sorted by play count, which means labels have little reason to waste time and energy on a task the machines have already mastered. Even when the indie rock band Spoon released a greatest hits record earlier this year, the band acknowledged that its fondness for the form outweighed what was a near-certain losing proposition businesswise. That fondness exists because of the real power greatest hits albums once had: They threw open doors for curious new listeners, solidified artists’ place in the canon, and transformed reputations that had fallen into disrepair. In his 2016 eulogy for greatest hits, anthologies, and other, similar reissues, Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that Bob Marley could have languished in relative obscurity were it not for the release of Legend in 1984. “By focusing on the hits, they crystallize the essence of each star,” wrote Erlewine, touching on compilations of work by Elton John, Billy Joel, and Tom Petty. “Over time, those greatest hits albums—purchased as a package, repeated incessantly on the radio—formalized each act’s conventionally-accepted canon and, in turn, cemented their enduring public personas.” If the ideal greatest hits collection captures the fundamental truth about an artist, stitches them into an enduring place in our cultural fabric, and sells enough copies to fund the purchase of a minor island, then ABBA Gold—a 79-minute buffet of schlocky ballads, elegant pop delicacies, and disco heat rocks—is the definitive example of the format. The 1992 compilation rounded up all of the Swedish pop band’s international smashes into a refined package with surprising emotional range. It capitalized on a simmering, subcultural interest in ABBA’s work and sparked a full-blown revival, one that culminated in Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan belting and grunting their way through “S.O.S.” in the movie version of Mamma Mia! And it became one of the best-selling albums of all time, with copies continuing to trickle out of stores in shocking numbers to this day. Because of Gold, ABBA has become an integral part of the world around us, their music floating through common spaces around the world like a music fan’s lingua franca; without it, the band might have remained a curio, the kind of half-forgotten treasure you have to seek out rather than stumble upon. Little more than a decade separated Gold’s release from the unceremonious end of the band’s recording career. After a delirious rise to global superstardom in the second half of the ’70s, ABBA was finally starting to lose steam. Its two constituent couples—Björn Ulvaeus and Agnetha Faltskog, and Benny Andersson and Frida Lyngstad—were either separated or divorced by the release of their final album, The Visitors, in 1981. And while all four members continued working together with an impressive level of professionalism, the fact remained that Ulvaeus and Andersson were writing music and lyrics, including post-breakup ballads and wounded domestic dramas, for their ex-wives to sing. The band had soured on touring and promoting themselves after enduring some of the most frenzied appearances this side of Beatlemania, and the fatigue was showing up in their music: “I was sick and tired of everything/When I called you last night from Glasgow,” sighed Lyngstad on the title track of 1980’s Super Trouper. “All I do is eat and sleep and sing/Wishing every show was the last show.” And after conquering the pop charts in dozens of countries around the world, everyone was ready for a new challenge: Andersson and Ulvaeus were dreaming of a detour into musical theater, and Faltskog and Lyngstad were curious about reviving their dormant solo careers. Boredom aside, ABBA’s commercial peak was clearly in the rear-view mirror by the early ’80s. The Visitors was their least successful album since the beginning of their career, and the band’s generation-spanning core audience was starting to wander into new spaces. The children who grew up with ABBA omnipresent on the radio were maturing into punk, rap, and new wave; the adults who enjoyed their lighthearted, melodic hits were less interested in minimally arranged character studies. Studio sessions in the spring of 1982 yielded little more than a few singles, and by the end of that year, it was clear ABBA’s time had come. Andersson and Ulvaeus collaborated with Tim Rice on Chess, a musical about a chess tournament (and love triangle) set against the backdrop of the Cold War; Lyngstad made an album with Phil Collins; Faltskog scored a few solo hits and duets before largely retreating from public life. From a distance, it must have seemed unlikely that ABBA would explode back into the popular consciousness and stay there indefinitely. Yet Gold was perfectly positioned to take advantage of shifts in technology, music business, and the culture at large, all of which crested alongside the compilation’s release in 1992. In the decade since ABBA’s collapse, CDs had become the dominant form of physical media and were accelerating toward their turn-of-the-century peak. While the CD market had been steadily growing since the end of the ’80s, reissues covering the ABBA catalogue had become conspicuously absent from record store shelves around the world, a consequence of business decisions made near the beginning of the band’s career—all handled by the group’s famously unscrupulous manager, Stig Anderson—and an ensuing string of contracts, renegotiations, and acquisitions. “Many in the music business raised their eyebrows when Stig signed with different record companies all over the world, instead of letting one major label handle the group globally,” wrote Carl Magnus Palm in his essential ABBA biography Bright Lights, Dark Shadows: The Real Story of ABBA. “That, however, was the whole point. Stig’s theory was that no company could be strong in every territory around the world and ABBA’s interests would be better served by working with the label that had the most impressive sales presence in each market.” Anderson’s decision to establish a network of international distributors meant that by the band’s demise, ABBA’s catalog could be handled differently according to each country’s needs; the compilation slapped onto shelves in Madrid wouldn’t necessarily be the same as the one stocked in Melbourne. When Anderson’s Polar Music Group (and, consequently, ABBA’s songs and masters) were acquired by Polygram (now part of Universal Music Group) in 1989, the label had to wait for Polar’s patchwork of licensing deals to expire before devising a coherent strategy with which to approach ABBA’s library of hits. Plans for a box set were pared back to a single disc, a conservative play intended to gauge the market for the band’s catalog before investing any more resources. The label polled its offices around the world regarding song selection, market tested the album’s cover art—its classy, minimal black-on-gold a far from the kitsch of ABBA’s studio album artwork—with potential British buyers, and made sequencing decisions based on fan feedback rather than chronology. Even though Polygram was dedicating reasonable amounts of time and money to ABBA’s revitalization, they still underestimated the amount of latent interest in the band’s music by the early ’90s, in part because that enthusiasm was rooted in marginalized communities. For gay men around the world, ABBA’s blend of naïve camp—consider the outfits they wore on stage, which ran the gamut from High Elven couture to sets of matching white silk kimonos—indelible melodies, and genuinely wrenching melodrama proved captivating. They wrote anthems for dancing queens and men after midnight, inadvertently adopting language that would become essential to gay life. And as much as the gay community loved ABBA, the band returned the favor: “In the ’80s, especially the first half, [it] was like ABBA was forgotten,” said Ulvaeus in a 2019 interview with Gay Times. “We thought that was it, we go on and do other stuff and ABBA will be forgotten. Then it was the gay community who underpinned the comeback… we felt that we had the full support, and it made a lot of difference.” Goofy cover bands like Australian outfit Björn Again built on this enthusiasm for ABBA’s music and became genuine sensations at clubs around the world, dialing up the kitsch with even more outlandish attire and between-song banter delivered in Swedish accents. And if the commercial potential of ABBA’s music wasn’t already evident, it became impossible to ignore in mid-1992 when Erasure’s cover EP Abba-esque topped the charts across the UK and continental Europe. So came the perfect storm surrounding Gold’s release: assembled at an ascendant moment in the music business by a label that approached the ABBA catalog with an unprecedented level of coordination and thoughtfulness, delivered to a public desperate for a convenient way to hear the band’s hits. It’s a fascinating story, yet it still doesn’t explain why millions of people around the world were ready to embrace ABBA once more with feeling. What is it about this band’s music that spoke, and continues to speak, to listeners across languages, cultures, and borders? Unlike the great majority of contemporary hits, ABBA’s version of pop music is completely divorced from the influence of R&B, hip-hop, soul, funk, and Latin music—in short, from non-white musical traditions. Ulvaeus summed up their approach rather neatly in a 1981 interview: “Our musical roots are European—we like French and Italian songs,” said Ulvaeus. “This is probably why our songs work well in the countries of Latin America… in the United States, pop music is heavily influenced by the blues, soul, and gospel—which isn’t in ABBA’s heritage.” Ulvaeus and Andersson grew up on traditional Swedish folk music and schlager music, a sappy, simple strain of pop with a distinctly continental European flair. And when their tastes began to develop as teenagers, they developed a network of influences that remained almost exclusively white: the Beach Boys’ golden teenage hymns, Phil Spector’s Wall of Sound, Lennon and McCartney circa Rubber Soul, classical music, and musical theater. It’s no surprise that as mature composers and lyricists, they came to favor crystalline melodies, dizzying arrangements and counterpoints, and over-the-top emotional gestures. This mix of influences helped create the band’s reputation as purveyors of unrefined schmaltz. The songs on Gold that have aged most poorly are the cuts that bear the greatest schlager influences, songs like “Chiquitita” and “Fernando” and “I Have a Dream.” Even gorgeous hooks wilt up against inelegant English lyrics, martial Germanic pomp, and faux-Italian balladry. Rare misses aside, hearing Faltskog and Lyngstad’s impeccable voices weave through a battalion’s worth of riffs, bells, and whistles is an indefatigable source of ecstasy. Listening to “S.O.S.” or “Dancing Queen” or “Super Trouper” for the first time can feel like hearing “Good Vibrations” or “Born to Run” in the same fashion: Your pleasure centers are overwhelmed until they blow up like the Grinch’s tiny heart, expanding beyond their old size and becoming something new. Listening to Gold with fresh, focused ears, I was struck by the sheer variety of sounds beneath its blinding polish. The ABBA ground-zero that’s anchored in my head lies somewhere between “Lay All Your Love on Me” and “The Winner Takes It All”: cavernous, sprightly, desperate dance-pop confections built for crying in the club. (Robyn became one of this decade’s great pop heroes by pinning down this same sad-ecstatic balance and welding it to modern, muscular production.) And while this might have become their most distinctive mode, it was far from their only one. “Take a Chance on Me” is best remembered for its a cappella opening buoyant chorus, but its verses are pure Swedish honky-tonk; I hear them and think of Daft Punk’s “Fragments of Time,” a hidden jam on Random Access Memories that’s built on a warm country boogie. (Speaking of Random Access Memories: while that album’s connection to Giorgio Moroder may have been more explicit, its primary sound—expensive, theatrical, continental European pop—is pure ABBA.) “Money, Money, Money” is the most successful of Ulvaeus and Andersson’s early forays into musical theater, a gold-digging fantasy that’s given real edge through Lyngstad’s dramatic interpretation. Late-period hit “One of Us” is heartbroken, lilting reggae, and it boasts one of Faltskog’s most delicate vocal takes for good measure; glammy stomper “Does Your Mother Know” is dumb, clean fun, even if hearing Ulvaeus take the lead makes you wish they’d called in Elton John for the supremely bitchy guest spot the song deserves. The magnificent “Knowing Me, Knowing You” finds the band at its best and its silliest in the span of 60 seconds: An elegant chorus with a male countermelody leads into a second verse spoiled by vaguely, unintentionally pornographic backing whispers. Skeptics pointed to the watch-like precision of every new ABBA hit as evidence of the band’s soullessness. In a 1993 essay in TIME after Gold’s American release, critic Richard Lacayo wrote that the band “was always easy to enjoy, if you could just put aside the unnerving sense that they were hastening the decline of pop music into commercial calculation and mindless buoyancy.” But the level of quality represented on Gold sprung from more than just studio scheming or bald ambition. By the time ABBA won the 1974 Eurovision contest with “Waterloo,” Andersson and Ulvaeus had each enjoyed a decade of domestic success as musicians, and Faltskog and Lyngstad were working solo artists in their own right. They had collectively played thousands of tour dates across Sweden, produced music for dozens of other artists, and spent untold hours working as a songwriting and performing team. Their mastery and enthusiasm for their craft was indisputable. Calling ABBA icy or passionless also conveniently elides the intricate balance between their craftsmanship and mournful writing. Take it from no less an authority than Max Martin: “I’m a sucker for the melancholy,” admitted the legendary pop producer in a 2001 interview with TIME Europe. “I guess that’s one of the things, coming from [Sweden]. If you listen to ABBA… it’s always sort of melancholy.” Ulvaeus and Andersson had figured out the balance as early as “S.O.S.,” ABBA’s first major international hit after “Waterloo.” It sounds like Faltskog is singing the first verse from the bottom of a well; her loneliness and desperation are so thick, you can almost reach out and touch them. When the chorus finally arrives, its warmth is palpable until, all of a sudden, it’s not: “When you’re gone,” Faltskog chirps, “How can I even try to go on?” The contrast is stark, and it’s irresistible. As the division of labor between Andersson and Ulvaeus became clearer later in the band’s discography—the former handled most of the music, the latter wrote the bulk of the lyrics—the divide between subject matter and sound became even more pronounced. The tumult of the band’s personal lives began to subtly leak into their art: “Knowing Me, Knowing You” and “The Winner Takes It All” are crushing glimpses at marriages in disrepair, sung by adults who know they can’t help but carry on with their lives. Relatively silly cuts like future booty-call anthem “Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)” are marked by quiet urgency: “Half-past 12/And I’m watchin’ the late show in my flat all alone/How I hate to spend the evening on my own,” Faltskog moans. Even “Dancing Queen,” the band’s most purely joyous moment, can’t fully give itself over to pleasure. It’s a celebration of impermanence. You may be young and sweet now, but you won’t be 17 forever. Erlewine wrote that greatest hits have a way of “sand[ing] away the artists’ quirks,” and the same is true for Gold. Polygram’s decision to detach the album’s sequencing from the arc of ABBA’s career makes it harder to appreciate the band’s gradual transformation. The silly, glammy Swedes who galloped onto the stage at Eurovision took over the world, stormed the disco, and finished their career making their saddest, strangest music yet. (The new ABBA music reportedly recorded as part of a 2018 reunion has yet to materialize). And yet Gold still conveys the one thing you absolutely need to know about the band: For about a decade, these four Swedes cracked the code on pop music.

Swoon / From Langley Park to Memphis / Jordan: The Comeback / A Life of Surprises,Prefab Sprout,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d8e484542446e00087f7b33/1:1/w_160/Swoon%20-%20Album%20Artwork.jpeg,2019-09-28 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/prefab-sprout-swoon-from-langley-park-to-memphis-jordan-the-comeback-a-life-of-surprises/,Sony Legacy,"At first, Paddy McAloon thought he had to invent his own chords to write songs. As a result, the earliest music by his band Prefab Sprout can sound comical and haywire, like a jazz band entertaining themselves at a cocktail party before the guests arrive. As McAloon continued refining his voice, he earned comparisons to Elvis Costello and Steely Dan, but his heroes were people like Michael Jackson and Prince, Stephen Sondheim and George Gershwin. He dreamed of writing songs that the whole world could sing along to—but he wanted to do it his own way. Four new vinyl reissues offer a thrilling survey of his journey as a pop songwriter. The series comprises the band’s 1984 debut Swoon, 1988’s commercial peak From Langley Park to Memphis, 1990’s double album Jordan: The Comeback, and 1992’s The Best of Prefab Sprout: A Life of Surprises. These reissues—which feature subtly improved artwork and sharp remasters from McAloon and his brother Martin—leave out but orbit around Steve McQueen, their 1985 masterpiece that remains the ideal entry point to their catalog. It was a breakthrough for the band members, marking their first collaboration with producer Thomas Dolby, whose playful, surreal touch helped define their characteristic sound. Dolby even helped curate that album’s tracklist, choosing songs from a stockpile that McAloon had amassed since forming the band with Martin in County Durham, England in the late ’70s. Several of those songs predated Swoon, their scrappy debut, whose post-punk edge would be abandoned for a smoother, more sophisticated sound. While Swoon was unrepresentative of the band that Prefab Sprout would become, it set the template for how they’d navigate the pop world. The brothers were joined by multi-instrumentalist and vocalist Wendy Smith, who accompanied McAloon for wordless refrains and non-sequitur exclamations that took pleasure in twisting expectations. McAloon was beginning to write eloquently about heartbreak and adulthood (“Cruel,” “Elegance”) but he was also having a blast addressing questions that most songwriters might find trivial: What is the life of a celebrity chessmaster? When was the last time you played basketball? After Swoon and the critical acclaim that followed Steve McQueen, the band recorded and shelved a quieter follow-up (Protest Songs, eventually released in 1989) before setting off to make something that capitalized on their newfound momentum. At the time of its release, the cinematic From Langley Park to Memphis was largely overshadowed by its first two tracks: the semi-novelty hit “The King of Rock and Roll” (which arrived with a fittingly absurd music video) and the Springsteen-referencing “Cars and Girls.” As a one-two punch, they rightfully stand among Prefab Sprout’s most recognizable songs, and the rest of the record is just as catchy and complex. McAloon was now penning his own version of standards (“Nightingales”), reverb-coated alt-rock anthems (“The Golden Calf”), and dramatic singalongs that could find a second life on Broadway (“Hey Manhattan”). His writing favored narrators in sad, autumnal stages: “All my lazy teenage boasts are now high precision ghosts/And they’re coming ‘round the tracks to haunt me,” go the opening lyrics to “The King of Rock and Roll,” imagining the life of an older touring musician, every night singing the same meaningless words that he wrote decades ago. And yet the music sounds colorful and hopeful and alive—everything seems to sparkle, right down to the glossy band photo on the album cover. With that photo, lovingly filtered here to look slightly more artful, the band signaled that they were pivoting away from their underground beginnings. Released at a time when American indie bands like R.E.M. and the Replacements were beginning to make bids for larger audiences, McAloon was making a similar leap, even if he still preferred staying out of the spotlight. While his songs were newly poised for radio and MTV, he remained wary of fame, setting on a reclusive path that would span the rest of his career. “This isn’t meant to sound snobbish,” he told Melody Maker at the time, “but I’ve never felt a part of any community… I don’t go out and look for like-minded people and I’ve never found anyone on the planet who fits the bill.” From Langley Park remains the band’s closest brush to stardom, but McAloon kept finding new ways to push himself. On Jordan: The Comeback, the most ambitious Prefab Sprout album and one of their greatest, McAloon created his own mythological world to blend into. The cast of characters are drawn from the Bible (including star turns from Michael the Archangel, Satan, and God himself) as well as rock history. A suite of songs in the middle of the album imagines Elvis Presley, having faked his death and retreated to the desert, dreaming of the perfect comeback song to launch his next act. McAloon, meanwhile, was also searching for the follow-up for his own biggest hits. “Wild Horses” is a romantic fantasy whose sleek arrangement still sounds fresh, while “The Ice Maiden” offers one of the most memorable lyrics in his songbook: “Death is a small price for heaven.” It was a comeback album obsessed with comebacks, from rebound relationships to resurrections. Less commercially successful than Langley but just as rewarding, it’s a work so layered that, decades on, it still seems to hold new secrets. When it came time to compile Prefab Sprout’s career highs into an album-length primer, A Life of Surprises didn’t quite capture the full picture. The picks from Jordan are less meaningful stripped of the album’s purposeful sequencing, while the one selection from Swoon sounds jarringly out of place in the non-chronological tracklist. Not to mention, “Bonny,” a stunner from Steve McQueen, is nowhere to be found. What the set does provide, however, are two essential non-album cuts that lend fitting closure to this era of the band’s career. The glittery, pulsing single “If You Don’t Love Me” would later be reimagined as a piano ballad by Kylie Minogue, bringing McAloon’s unlikely pop dreams to reality. But it’s “The Sound of Crying” that really shows how far he had come, pairing one of his most gorgeous melodies to a strange, brilliant vision of the world in flux. “Sometimes I think that God is working to a plan,” he sings, his voice breathier and softer with age. “And other times I’m sure that he is improvising.” Lamenting a chaotic universe, he casts a higher power in his own image: obsessive and inscrutable, observing us from somewhere that he can’t be reached, and searching for a tune.

NINE,Blink-182,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d88fab51f868e00096102be/1:1/w_160/blink182_nine.jpeg,2019-09-28 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/blink-182-nine/,ColumbiaColumbia,"Pop-punk’s appeal has always been the fusing of the hook-filled sentiments of pop music with the direct current of punk. They are two prongs that any band, particularly those that find something close to mainstream success, are forced to straddle. This dilemma—how to, in the misquoted words of Donnie and Marie Osmond, be a little bit pop while also being a little bit punk—is one that blink-182 has been struggling with for years now. The apex of their fame revealed serious fissures in the group’s long-term stability, leading singer and guitarist Tom DeLonge to leave the group after their 2003 self-titled album, start the new band Angels & Airwaves, and get really into U.F.O. conspiracies. He’d rejoin for 2011’s Neighborhoods, but since 2015, DeLonge’s place in the band has been taken by Alkaline Trio singer Matt Skiba. Blink picked up their first Grammy nod with 2016’s California, and the band now seems singularly focused on making sure the brand endures into the future, which never really seemed like much of a priority during their most erratic years. With NINE, their eighth album, blink is in search of a more sustainable kind of success. They’re aiming at a more youthful audience, maybe the kinds of kids who inadvertently came to pop-punk by way of Lil Peep, but blink-182 have long held appeal to people who didn’t cut their teeth in the punk scene. Take drummer Travis Barker, who is all over the last decade of hip-hop, from Run the Jewels to Lil Wayne to Young Dro. He tends to work with artists who aren’t exactly in vogue, usually aggressive, Generation-X rappers, like LL Cool J, Cypress Hill, and Xzibit, or the younger and critically unacclaimed, like Machine Gun Kelly and Yelawolf. But Barker has benefited tremendously from hip-hop’s du jour reverence for pop-punk, emo, and alternative rock, repositioning himself into something of a Rick Rubin-esque Svengali of a younger generation of SoundCloud rap. Over the past year, he’s shown up on songs by Lil Nas X, XXXTentacion, and Ghostemane and executive produced EPs by $uicideboy$ and 03 Greedo. It’s Barker’s drum programming that shapes the sound of NINE more than anything else. His beats have always sounded a little bit like Pharrell’s, with that booming bass sound you can hear being so clearly played by a human hand on a drum machine. There are shades of Barker’s hip-hop work all over NINE, particularly on a song like “Hungover You,” which opens with an uptempo, danceable drumline and ends with a pattern of bass tones begging to be blasted out of oversized trunk speakers. This is a clear bid for the kind of success currently enjoyed by bands like Fall Out Boy and Panic! at the Disco. Blink-182 worked on NINE alongside pop songwriting teams like Captain Cuts and the Futuristics, as well as Ali Tamposi, the co-writer of Kelly Clarkson’s “Stronger.” It’s impossible to hear a song like “I Really Wish I Hated You” and not sense the Chainsmokers lurking in the corner. “On Some Emo Shit” pulls from the same well of lazy Big Apple tropes (“I thought I saw you at the Bodega,” “Thinking back to times in Manhattan and that SoHo Gallery”) as Taylor Swift’s “Welcome to New York.” It’s a song that sounds written to accompany B-roll of the fictitious Brooklyn of TV Land’s Younger, a show about a middle-aged woman masquerading as a millennial—an experience that’s probably relatable to the members of blink-182. Even if their sound is somewhat refurbished and compressed, blink-182 still avoid guest features and a full pivot from pop-punk to pure pop. Their flirtations with light EDM and hip-hop backbeats aren’t exactly new—“Run Away” sounds a lot like Linkin Park at their peak, with stuttering drums and manipulated vocals scattered across the rest of the album. There’s still plenty of speedy guitar playing and a lot of mournful rage. Mark Hoppus’ lyrics largely stem from his recent personal experiences with depression, but with the new sound, there’s also a new commitment to offering advice and inspiration to younger fans, like on the song “Happy Days,” where the band addresses a kid whose head is filled with “dread and doubt.” It’s surprising how well the new sound works, though the voice of Skiba doesn’t always mesh comfortably with the production. As always, angst and unrequited affections are aplenty, but it all feels far too tame. Skiba and Hoppus wail to high heaven on “No Heart To Speak Of,” nothing approaches the bleeding feelings of “Josie” or the paranoia that permeates 1999’s Enema of the State. Blink-182’s late-career work has largely been overshadowed by Tom DeLonge’s sincere effort to prove that aliens really do exist, in its own way a less surprising late-career pivot than a developmentally arrested band courting of a younger crowd. DeLonge has moved on, but he’s stayed weird in a way the rest of blink hasn’t. The band fits neatly into their shiny new suit, but they look better naked.

Confetti,Jack Harlow,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d8bb75b5c47170008d47d86/1:1/w_160/harlow_confetti.jpeg,2019-09-28 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jack-harlow-confetti/,Generation NowAtlantic,"Jack Harlow is from Louisville, Kentucky, but without the defiant “I’m a Kentucky boy til’ death” shoutout on 2018 breakout “Sundown,” you wouldn’t know it. His fourth full-length project in just as many years, Confetti sounds like it could be made by any 21-year-old that grew up with access to Hot 97: He reflects on driving around his city listening to The Blueprint on CD and raps over samples of Usher’s “U Don’t Have to Call” and Trey Songz’s “I Invented Sex.” His music has no identity. But he has a natural charm and energy that helps you overlook the fact that you’ve heard countless albums like this before, just by different names. Prior to Confetti, Jack Harlow’s big singles were 2017’s “Dark Knight” and the aforementioned “Sundown.” The self-confident bounce of the former earned him his current record deal with DJ Drama and Don Cannon’s Lil Uzi Vert-cursed Generation Now label. The more polished “Sundown” boasts a Neptunes-influenced beat from his frequent collaborator 2forwOyNE that complements his low-key swagger.  Both songs balance a light, teen-movie party atmosphere with warm reflections on his hometown. This is Jack Harlow’s sweet spot, and when he remains there, he cranks out enjoyable DJ-set filler. Album intro “Ghost” is upbeat enough to ignore Harlow’s painful one-liners (“I got all the whipper-snappers and the lil’ rascals”) while serving as a reminder that DJ Drama’s “Gangsta Grillz” tag is timeless. On later tracks like “Heavy Hitter,” Harlow’s natural charisma elevates typical first-record-deal topics like dating women who use him to build their LinkedIn connections. The light-spirited “Walk in the Park” would’ve made sense on the back half of an Aminé or KYLE project. But like so many emerging rappers, Jack Harlow seems to think that for his music to take the next step, he has to sing. On the Da Honorable C.N.O.T.E-produced “Sunday Night,” his fun-loving personality is lost in the minute he opens his mouth: “I know that a ‘you up’ text would be fucked up, but I’d be lying if I told you I ain’t wanna,” he sings weakly. He talks about relationships so impersonally that he might just be reciting the plot of the last television series he binged. His vocals suck the life out of his coming-of-age reflections on “Goin Back Down,” and his Louisville tales only come to life when he connects with his hometown hero Bryson Tiller for the sappy duet “Thru the Night.” Jack Harlow’s music is harmless. If you come across any of Confetti’s standouts on a Spotify playlist, you won’t be moved to complain or click over to his artist page. At his best, he can make above-average slappers like “Heavy Hitter” and “Ghost,” and that’s enough to keep him afloat. Well, that’s until the next Jack Harlow comes around, with a new name, representing another underappreciated city, and then we can have this conversation all over again.","The genial Louisville rapper doesn’t have much of an identity, but he has a natural, low-stakes charm.

"Hey, I’m Just Like You",Tegan and Sara,by: Aimee Cliff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d8a273a7610040009f91e7e/1:1/w_160/teganandsara_justlikeu.jpeg,2019-09-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tegan-and-sara-hey-im-just-like-you/,Sire,"In 1998, Tegan and Sara caused a small stir when they won a Calgary, Alberta talent contest called Garage Warz. The identical twins appeared on a local news segment to talk excitedly about their win, draped in capacious clothing and distinguishable by Sara’s long hair and Tegan’s lip piercing. “The thing that I like the best,” said Sara, “is that, I don’t think that [the judges] think, ‘Wow, they’re perfect, they [need] no improvement’... I think they just see maybe a sparkle of something, that can get to be something bigger.” Even in her wide-eyed hopefulness, Sara probably didn’t imagine that the duo would go on to have a storied 20-year career: first as Canadian grunge-folk darlings, then pop-punk rebels embraced by the White Stripes and Paramore, and later as synth-pop troubadours joining Taylor Swift onstage. On Tegan and Sara’s ninth studio album, Hey, I'm Just Like You—and the simultaneously released High School, a co-written memoir about their time dropping acid and moshing to Green Day in the ’90s—they revisit their roots, re-recording demos they wrote as teenagers. This time, they’re both the open-hearted teenage songwriters and the wiser industry professionals who can spot, and expand on, their spark. It’s a smart move for a band whose fan base has both aged with them, and continually refreshed itself with younger members. At a Tegan and Sara show, you’re as likely to meet women in their 30s or 40s who have been die-hard fans of the trailblazing LGBTQ icons since the opening guitar strums of “You Wouldn’t Like Me” in 2004 as you are to meet younger listeners who caught the wave with their 2016 breakthrough pop hit “Boyfriend.” On Hey, I’m Just Like You, the band seem to acknowledge and speak to each of these audiences at once. Listening to the title track in its plaintive, unvarnished demo form, it’s clear that it was written by the same two girls who, as described in their memoir, once built a shrine to Kurt Cobain. On the album, the song opens with sharp claps, and builds to a synth-spangled chorus that cushions the jagged melancholy of the original in a pop cocoon. As well as reconciling their different sounds, the album is a fierce reminder of the twins’ ability to write an irresistible chorus. Particularly memorable ones here include the stadium-sized exhalation of “I Don’t Owe You Anything,” the bratty moshpit-lite chorus of “Hold My Breath Until I Die,” and the angst-ridden, fist-pumping “I Know I’m Not the Only One.”  On “Don’t Believe the Things They Tell You (They Lie),” a clunky title becomes a surprisingly great refrain when the song breaks open, halfway through, into a widescreen anthemic surge. “Don’t Believe…” is not the album’s only clunky phrasing. Glancing through the track list is like flicking through a teen’s journal, with its powerful “get off my case, Mom” energy. The album’s general embrace of Tegan and Sara’s teenage earnestness is mostly its strength, but there are moments that grate: the “hello, hello, hello” hook on “Hello, I’m Right Here” carries strange hints of the “British whine” that Sara recalls their teenage voices carrying in High School. On the electronic bounce of “You Go Away and I Don’t Mind,” the stripped-back production gives the juvenile, baffling opening lyrics (“I’m complicated, I was raised by icons”) nowhere to hide. On “Don’t Believe…,” however, they strike the right balance between the clumsy originality of the song that Sara says she wrote in 1995, at age 15, and the polished pros they are now. The melodrama of the chorus (“I belong”) is muted, filtering the pain of teenagerhood through refined adult tastes. There’s a radical kind of self-acceptance to honoring your goofy and heartbreaking teenage sentiments with such seriousness. Sara recently told the Guardian that she has a lot of “self-hatred” and “internalized homophobia” stemming from her difficult high school years, but that revisiting the music and memories of the time—rather than embarrassing her as much as she expected—helped her to love herself. “I’m so amazed at what that person accomplished, knowing that inside they were really, really damaged.” The fact that these songs have been interpreted by their writers 20 years later creates a layer of knowing poignancy, such as when Tegan sings, “I wonder if someday, we'll just be a memory?” on “I Know I’m Not...,” or when Sara sings “What if I become all of the horrible things that I said I would never be?” on the delicate “Please Help Me.” The sting of their adolescent fears is softened both by the heightened shimmer of the production, and by the very fact that we know how this story ends. Compare the gentle, winking nature of the line “Right now, I wish I was older” on “Hello, I’m Right Here,” to the brute force of Billie Eilish—still in the thick of all-encompassing young turmoil—singing about wishing she could be someone else. Memories of the very real pain and passion we felt as teenagers become cool enough to touch when we’re older. In Tegan and Sara’s hands, they become mantras, glimmering and hopeful and full of sparkle.

Songs From the Bardo,Laurie AndersonTenzin ChoegyalJesse Paris Smith,by: Ruth Saxelby,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d8a2df75d366d000838cf89/1:1/w_160/songsfromthebardo.jpg,2019-09-27 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/laurie-anderson-tenzin-choegyal-jess-songs-from-the-bardo/,Smithsonian Folkways,"When his brother-in-law died in a refugee camp in India, Tibetan singer and musician Tenzin Choegyal joined his sister in mourning. Tibetan Buddhists believe that when someone dies, their consciousness wanders through an in-between phase called the bardo for seven weeks before transitioning to a new life. This journey can be disorienting and frightening. To help guide his brother-in-law’s consciousness toward rebirth, Buddhist monks read aloud from The Bardo Thodol, also known as The Tibetan Book of the Dead, over the course of 49 days. “The ritual performance and recital of The Bardo Thodol by the monks transformed my sister from a devastated person to someone who gained conviction in her life again,” Choegyal writes in the liner notes for Songs From the Bardo. “The whole process was as therapeutic as anything I have ever observed in my life.” Over the past 15 years, Choegyal has explored the power of The Bardo Thodol in a variety of musical projects. Songs From the Bardo is the latest manifestation and finds Choegyal in collaboration with multidisciplinary artist Laurie Anderson and composer Jesse Paris Smith. Anderson acts as the guide, reading passages from The Bardo Thodol translated into English by Choegyal. The unknowable expanse of the bardo is invoked by Choegyal and Smith through vibrations summoned from a variety of particularly resonant instruments. Resonance is the closest that sound gets to touch. Lyrics can describe a caress, but reverberation can move air and bodies in ways that viscerally recall the breath of a loved one on the nape of the neck. Throughout much of Songs From the Bardo, it is the soothing drone tones of Choegyal’s Tibetan singing bowls and Smith’s crystal bowls that hold the space. The album’s songs flow into one another with little regard for beginnings or endings, just as The Bardo Thodol describes the journey of the consciousness through death to the next life. On “Heart Sutra Song – Gone Beyond,” Choegyal’s plucking of the dranyen, a Tibetan stringed instrument, provides a grounding counterpoint to Anderson’s inquisitive violin and guest musician Rubin Kodhel’s brooding cello. Over the strings, Choegyal sings part of the Heart Sutra in Sanskrit; his natural vibrato makes for one of the most stirring moments on the album. Elsewhere, Anderson’s recital is also deeply resonant. Her words often hang in the air for a split second after they leave her mouth. Over Smith’s gently rousing piano on “Lotus Born, No Need to Fear,” Anderson imbues each description, including “a fish rolling in hot sand,” with such emotion that it floods the mind. “Listen without distraction” is a refrain that Anderson repeats throughout Songs From the Bardo, and one that occasionally made me wonder if the album would have benefitted from using her gift for spoken word more sparingly. The interplay between the three collaborators’ instrumental contributions is so absorbing that maybe it doesn’t always need the narration; the spiritual guidance is apparent in the resonance itself. That said, dissonance plays as an important role as resonance on the album, especially in its second half. On “Dancing With the Crescent Knife,” Choegyal’s low chant rolls underneath creaking strings that, along with Anderson’s theatrical storytelling, bring to life the most disconcerting phase of the bardo. The spoken word on Songs of the Bardo, it is important to note, draws exclusively from the Chonyid Bardo, the part of The Bardo Thodol that describes the various spirits, including “blood-drinking wrathful deities,” that one’s consciousness encounters in the bardo. “Natural Form of Emptiness” illuminates those spirits further. Choegyal plays the lingbu (a Tibetan bamboo flute) like the guiding call of a bird, as if to say, This way, this way. Then the repeated crash of a gong signals a warning, but Anderson encourages the listener to hold their ground. “Awakened one, when projections appear like this, do not be afraid,” she recites. Then, later, “They only arise out of the spontaneous play of your mind.” The spontaneous play of your mind. These words hold particular weight at a time when systemic injustice, existential crises, and self-commodification pull the psyche in a thousand different directions at once. Anxiety, stress, depression, and a general sense of paralysis are common complaints of everyday people, and are without fail capitalized on by the very institutions and corporations that purport to support us. Insomnia, a smaller but related complaint and something I’ve experienced recently, can feel like being trapped in an in-between state. I listened to Songs of the Bardo on repeat when my eyes were burning and my head felt clogged, and it helped. The album’s contemplative pace—designed for listening in solitude, not playing in the background—cracked open just enough mental space to provide relief, and for that I am very grateful. While based on a text to help the recently deceased reach rebirth, Songs of the Bardo is very much an album about life; a salve as much as a guide.

The Talkies,Girl Band,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d51800e8bbc27000a66bf37/1:1/w_160/girlband_thetalkies.jpg,2019-09-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/girl-band-the-talkies/,Rough Trade,"After laying dormant for nearly a half decade, Irish quartet Girl Band open their new album with a self-administered stethoscope test. “Prolix” isn’t so much a song as a diagnosis—for nearly two minutes, we hear nothing but frontman Dara Kiely’s breathing over an ominous, reverberating drone. But as the track goes on, Kiely‘s breaths turn harder, faster, and louder, until he’s desperately gulping air like a desert roamer sucking on their canteen. It’s the sound of pure, visceral panic—which is to say, on their first album in four years, Girl Band are in perfect health. “Prolix” isn’t staged—it’s a document of Kiely's actual panic attack in the studio. And coming from an artist who’s made no secret of his mental-health struggles—which precipitated the band’s extended hiatus—the track is a grim reminder that, even though Kiely feels well enough to resume his musical career, anxiety is an insidious affliction that can creep up at any time without warning. But the process of airing out his issues in the press and in past songs has made Kiely less interested in exploring them through his music now—when writing The Talkies, he deliberately avoided the use of the words “I” or “you” to avoid the painful introspection they may trigger. But while Girl Band are no longer explicitly talking about psychosis, they’re still experts at sonically communicating how it feels, through screeching sensory assaults that hit like a migraine and relentlessly pulsate like a heart racing out of control. More so than 2015’s Holding Hands With Jamie, The Talkies finds each member functioning less like a typical musician and more like a loose lever on a console, crashing in and dropping out of the mix at random moments. Guitarist Alan Duggan has completely unlearned the art of riffs and solos, using his instrument solely for textural dissonance—the more nauseating, the better. Bassist Daniel Fox deals exclusively in gut-rumbling frequencies, while drummer Adam Faulkner avoids the snare like it might be rigged with electric shocks. The result is drained of any rock-band formalism, all scrap-metal clang and kick-drum thump teetering on collapse. Kiely‘s lyrics mimic this deconstructionist approach, atomizing everyday scenes and conversations into fragments. On The Talkies, you’ll hear references to pop-cultural icons like Ricki Lake, Zinedine Zidane, Bert and Ernie, and the Byrds, though when fed through Kiely’s cut-and-paste filter, they become disembodied figures thrown into a parade of freaks that includes “mental zoo boy,” “Crunchy Percy,” and the “bloke with The Man and The Legend shirt.” Kiely clearly delights in the beautiful absurdities of the English language: The post-apocalyptic chain-gang chant “Aibohphobia” references the (not officially recognized) fear of palindromes while piling them onto prospective victims (“Cain a Maniac! Salt an Atlas! Strap on No parts! Bird Rib!”) with all the merciless fervor of a waterboard interrogation. Kiely doesn’t so much front the group as submit himself to them: As “Couch Combover” builds into a seasick, distortion-soaked stomp, it sounds like Kiely is puking and crying at the same time. But later in that same song, the squall subsides to reveal Kiely gently singing the track’s chorus, offering a glimpse of the pop singer trapped in a noise band’s body. By the time we reach The Talkies’ tumultuous seven-minute climax “Prefab Castle,” Girl Band’s balance of composure and cataclysm has tipped toward the latter. The emergency sirens are ringing out, the walls are closing in, and Kiely reverts to his panic-attack gasp. And yet as the song begins its final descent, Kiely recites a mantra with unnerving calm: “When it’s depressed/Still in love/When it’s happy/Still in love/When it’s all sad/Still in love/When it’s anxious/Still in love.” It may not be everyone’s definition of a peaceful conclusion, but after all the punishment Kiely’s endured over the course of this record, it’s a minor miracle he’s still breathing at all.

Chastity Belt,Chastity Belt,by: Abby Jones,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d8905100480b10008ffa262/1:1/w_160/chastitybelt.jpg,2019-09-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/chastity-belt-chastity-belt/,Hardly Art,"Chastity Belt were roughly 100 miles from Asheville, North Carolina when lead vocalist Julia Shapiro reached her breaking point. Just before touring their last album, 2017’s I Used to Spend So Much Time Alone, Shapiro split up with her long-term partner and had a possibly cancerous portion of her thyroid removed. She toughed it out on the road for about a month, when her bandmates—guitarist Lydia Lund, bassist Annie Truscott, and drummer Gretchen Grimm—collectively decided it was time to hit pause. So, the Seattle indie rockers cancelled the remainder of the tour, simply citing “health concerns,” and Shapiro sought comfort by driving two hours east to stay with an Asheville friend. Shapiro was experiencing an existential dilemma of sorts: “I had a lot of questions going through my mind,” she explained. “‘Should I be doing something else with my life? What else could I do?’” Shapiro relays this anecdote on “Rav-4,” a highlight from Chastity Belt’s self-titled fourth album. “Fooled them all, then hit a wall/Lay in Kate’s bed, it’s true what she said/That giving up can take some guts,” she sings. “Lost my mind and much more, but who’s keeping score?” The rest of Chastity Belt reveals some of the “much more” Shapiro feels is vanishing: her ambition, her hopefulness, and maybe most of all, herself. But even when Shapiro was at her lowest, Chastity Belt never seriously considered calling it quits; their friendship has been going strong for over a decade now, and their combined force feels more evocative and pointed than ever. They’ve long abandoned the crude wit of their 2013 debut, but Chastity Belt still maintains that closeness of hanging out with friends in your living room, engrossed by each others’ ruminations until the wee hours of the morning. Friendship is a recurring theme on Chastity Belt, from “Rav-4”’s Kate to “Elena”—named after the pseudonymous Italian novelist Elena Ferrante, whose most well-known works centered around the companionship of women as their rural Neapolitan town collapsed at their feet. Chastity Belt seem to liken their own emotional turmoil to Ferrante’s ruins: “Changed all your plans to line up with his/Hanging onto every word he says/Measured your self worth/By his judgements,” Shapiro sings, an eerie retrospective after the collegiate tribulations of No Regerts and the whatever-forever demeanor of 2015’s Time to Go Home. This heightened self-awareness also presents itself in tracks like “Effort,” where Grimm envisions an immaculate version of herself while seeking refuge in a new relationship—perhaps in an attempt to avoid facing her own insecurities. “Running for cover, into another/It’s not what I need, but it seems to be what I want,” Shapiro sings. “I could be perfect, I could exist/Just how you need me to be in this moment.” Chastity Belt’s lyrics have always been clever, but here they attain a sort of nonchalant wisdom. “Been counting on someone, but I counted wrong/So now I’m feeling pretty dumb,” goes one particularly jarring line of “Half-Hearted,” before reaching a resolution in closer “Pissed Pants”: “Now I’m obsessing over endings/And all the things that are holding me back/You said, so casually, ‘Everything just works out.’” Chastity Belt’s best lyrics are just as casual and profound. The album was co-produced by Jay Som’s Melina Duterte, resulting in Chastity Belt at their dreamiest and most tranquil. As far as their Pacific Northwest predecessors go, there’s little evidence of their livelier original inspirations like Sleater-Kinney and Autoclave, instead leaning on hushed Elliott Smith-ish delivery, lush reverb, and traces of strings. The album’s lethargy can feel tedious, a little lacking in contrast; most of its songs stroll past at similar tempos and volumes, rarely culminating in moments that could be considered “big.” But Shapiro has something to say, and Chastity Belt is largely confessional; her words are the focus here, and these simple, serene landscapes are a fitting backdrop to hear her loud and clear.

Dead Man’s Pop,The Replacements,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d518373611b880008b575f9/1:1/w_160/thereplacements_deadmans.jpg,2019-09-26 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-replacements-dead-mans-pop/,Rhino,"The Replacements story is filled with what-ifs and near misses. Their legend, essentially, is that if the chips had fallen differently, they might have become a popular band and had success into the 1990s, like their friends and rivals R.E.M. What if they had played ball with their label? What if they hadn’t made so many enemies? What if they hadn’t been so fucked up? In 1989, the question of the hour had to do with the band’s sixth album, Don’t Tell a Soul, and it goes something like this: What if they hadn’t released a record full of slick, radio-friendly pop-rock? With proper production, could this have been another classic? The question is asked because Don’t Tell a Soul was, for many years, the most maligned Replacements album, even if its reputation has improved some since then. Dead Man’s Pop attempts to answer these questions. Featuring extensive notes from Bob Mehr, some of which are adapted from his essential Replacements biography Trouble Boys, the box set documents just about everything to do with Don’t Tell a Soul except for the finished album itself (Rhino reissued an expanded configuration in 2008). It aims to complicate the story of the record and rescue Paul Westerberg’s songs from production compromises made in service of a theoretical audience that never materialized. Don’t Tell a Soul had an unusually complicated genesis, involving a new band member (guitarist Bob “Slim” Dunlap), two periods of recording, each with a different producer (Tony Berg oversaw early dates that were ultimately scrapped but are presented here, while Matt Wallace helmed the sessions that led to the album), a surprise drop-in from Tom Waits at the height of his fame, and a great deal of confusion about what Sire Records wanted from the band and vice versa. Amid all this turmoil, Westerberg was writing some very good songs that built on the softer, gentler material from the last couple of albums. The heart of Dead Man’s Pop is a new mix and sequence of Don’t Tell a Soul inspired by the one Matt Wallace made just before he exited the project. Wallace wanted to mix the record himself, but could see the writing on the wall and knew the label wanted someone with a better ear for radio for the job (Chris Lord-Alge ultimately gave the record its modern-rock sheen). This was a common practice—track with a producer the band likes, get a corporation-approved pro to give it the proper polish (see: Nirvana). But in this case, the final mix became the record’s fatal flaw, and Westerberg himself even bad-mouthed it (“It sounded good until the label brought in people to mix it to make it sound like everything else on the radio,” he told Magnet in 2002). The quickie mix Wallace knocked out was thought lost until it turned up in Slim Dunlap’s basement and, once discovered, it served as the anchor for this set, which was named after the working title for the album. Many differences are subtle—it’s not like they turn Don’t Tell a Soul into Stink—and these are still the same songs and the same performances rendered with a simpler and more intimate tone. The opening “Talent Show” is perhaps the greatest improvement—Westerberg’s vocal is naked, the drums are reserved, and it comes over more like a studio jam than something assembled from individual parts. The guitars on “I’ll Be You” are more twangy and less cheesy, to use a common pejorative from the time of the album’s release. “I Won’t,” easily the worst song on Don’t Tell a Soul, sounds better here without the deeply corny isolated bassline and a better balance among the instruments. “Asking Me Lies” is newly airy and light, with the backing vocals more prominent. The common thread is that the guitars are cleaner, the vocals are clearer, and previously buried fills come to the surface, like the banjo in “Talent Show.” The set also re-sequences the album according to the Wallace tape. It’s more front-loaded now: No waiting until the second side to hear “I’ll Be You” and “Darlin One” (they are in slots No. 2 and 5, respectively). And ending the set with “Rock and Roll Ghost” after opening with “Talent Show” gives it a nice thematic frame, an innocent band taking a stab at one end and a fading relic thinking about the past at the other. The second disc of the box contains work from the disastrous aborted Berg sessions, recorded in Bearsville, New York. It’s hard to get a sense of where the record might have gone from the evidence here—they are basically full-band demos of unfinished songs. While it’s enjoyable to hear “Achin’ to Be,” “I’ll Be You,” and “We’ll Inherit the Earth” in these versions, they sound more like run-throughs. Westerberg delivers the lyrics offhandedly, with plenty of vocalese placeholders. Two outtakes, both of which landed on the expanded Don’t Tell a Soul, are the best thing about the sessions by far—the countrified “Portland,” which is fantastic, and the jittery rocker “Wake Up.” The six tracks taken from a drunken late-night session with Tom Waits—he was a fan of the band, and Westerberg of him—are of historical interest only. The two sound completely trashed and can barely play or even speak—a reminder it’s not always a tragedy when songs stay in the vault. That doesn’t apply to the live set included on the other two discs, which document a concert from June 1989 in Milwaukee. For anyone skeptical of Don’t Tell a Soul, the most convincing argument for their vitality is the live shows from this period. They played faster and crunchier than on record but the hooks were intact and, unlike a few years earlier, Westerberg remembered most of the words. And the setlist is stunning—the number of anthems they had on tap at this moment is almost unbelievable, drawing from 1984’s Let It Be through their then-new record and throwing in a few covers, including their terrific version of the Only Ones’ “Another Girl, Another Planet.” It gets a little ragged toward the end, by which time the band was probably plastered (“Here Comes a Regular” is a mess), but the set holds up to repeated listens. A few months after, the Mats would tour with Tom Petty and continue to unravel as Westerberg’s alcoholism consumed his life. All Shook Down followed in 1991, and then the band called it a day right as alternative music was poised to take off. And that was pretty much it for the Replacements until their reunion gigs this decade. Don’t Tell a Soul wasn’t the breakthrough anyone hoped for, but it turned out to be their best-selling album, which might explain why many bands later accused of ripping off the Replacements (the Goo Goo Dolls, Ryan Adams) sounded the most like this era, when acoustic guitars and hushed vocals were prominent in the mix. Whether the new mix and additional context improve Don’t Tell a Soul is hard to say—especially for me, since I bought the album the day it came out and loved it for 30 years. In its original form, I related to this stoic guy from the Midwest raised to stifle his feelings choosing to explore vulnerability. To some people, that meant that the songs occasionally tipped over into self-pity or sentimentality, but these excesses seemed part of the emotionally messy package. It was music you swallowed whole, the good stuff and bad—like a handful of pills. At a certain age, you want nothing more than to feel special, and in Westerberg’s best songs on Don’t Tell a Soul, he offers hope that someone out there just might see the specialness in you.

Princess Catgirl,Cashmere Cat,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d88f8c809b36e0009899f3b/1:1/w_160/cashmerecat_princesscatgirl.jpeg,2019-09-26 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cashmere-cat-princess-catgirl/,Mad LoveInterscope,"After all these years, Cashmere Cat is still shy. The musician born Magnus August Høiberg has nearly a decade of prismatic productions under his belt, which has led to appearances on the big stages at EDM festivals, collaborations with childhood heroes, and studio time with the biggest pop stars in the world. On some level, Høiberg has had to adjust to the practicalities that this success requires. He once wouldn’t even do in-person interviews, but a few years ago he finally decided to open up about his life story in a music video. One would imagine he’s no longer hiding in a bathroom, as a friend of his once described, when DJ Khaled unexpectedly turns up at the studio. But as he’s explained in the press materials for his new solo album, Princess Catgirl, he’s been unable to fully shake his reserved nature. To deal with all the attention, he decided to enlist some help from a cartoon cat: Princess Catgirl, the “face” of his music. “She makes me feel safe,” he says. That’s why the last couple of Cashmere Cat music videos have featured an animated cat with a shock of blue hair and traditional Norwegian dress, dancing in desolate locales. She’s the voice, Høiberg implies, behind the chipmunked vocal mutations that are all over this record. The idea that Høiberg has taken to collaborating with a Catsune Miku of sorts may seem like a silly concept, but it’s telling of where his head is these days. On 9, his debut full-length, he capitalized on his reputation for futuristic pop music. He called up famous friends like Ariana Grande and Camila Cabello to make a brash, extroverted version of his pillowy, reverberant beats. On Princess Catgirl, he’s largely backed off from that approach. There are collaborators here—Benny Blanco, Tory Lanez, SOPHIE, and Francis Starlite, among others, make appearances. But it’s Høiberg and Catgirl that take top billing, an indication that things are more personal and introspective this time around, which has always been his sweet spot. When the excesses of the EDM boom were at their garish peak, Cashmere Cat’s productions were soft and intimate. Even if they were playful enough to allow him access to that scene, he wasn’t making music for the ragers. “When I was making that music I was thinking more of a girl or a boy alone in their bedroom listening to it than a crowd full of people going insane,” he said in 2017. The seven songs on Princess Catgirl are a return to that fantasy. He favors comfy stuff, textures that you can luxuriate in and use to shut out the outside world. You can hear it in the way the gentle chimes of “EMOTIONS” swell into cloudy, shoegaze-y squalls that sound a little like Slowdive’s electronic experiments or the digital gusts of M83’s early works. “WITHOUT YOU” has a more standard pop structure, but it too is muted and diffuse—a low-lit reimagining of the neon sounds Høiberg might use on his higher-profile collaborations. The contributions that Høiberg would presumably ascribe to Catgirl herself are minimal but still important to the overall feeling of the record. Throughout there are digital voices that sound conscripted both from twisted samples of pop hits and Vocaloid-like software. Their messages are often limited to just a word or two, but they feel forlorn and weighty nonetheless. The vocals on “FOR YOUR EYES ONLY” and “WITHOUT YOU” resonate with a gravity and tenderness that Høiberg doesn’t always squeeze out of his human collaborators. Even if she’s not real, the feelings “she” expresses definitely are. And if Høiberg needs to pretend that he’s collaborating with an animated cat to access them, then long live the Princess.","The Norwegian producer invents a Vocaloid-inspired feline character and retreats from the spotlit pop of his last album, returning to the introspective hush of his earlier work.

Miami Memory,Alex Cameron,by: Anna Gaca,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d08dee5bb361469bb3508ae/1:1/w_160/Alex-Cameron.jpg,2019-09-26 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/alex-cameron-miami-memory/,Secretly Canadian,"Edgy comedians like to say they’re testing the waters. Alex Cameron wants you to come on in ’cause the water is fine. On his 2014 debut, Jumping the Shark, the Australian rocker masqueraded as an aging, washed-up musician. His 2017 album Forced Witness was a delightful and at times outright offensive journey to the center of the male psyche, full of sleazy, self-congratulatory exploits delivered with one eyebrow arched. Now settled in a long-term relationship with Girls actress Jemima Kirke, Cameron describes his third album, Miami Memory, as a more sincere statement. For the first time in his life, he says, he feels capable of writing a genuine love song. As with most things Alex Cameron, it’s best to take “sincere” with a grain of salt. Several of these songs appear scripted for a dirtbag divorcé; others, like “Gaslight”—“Hear me out, I’m a nice guy”—are clearly tongue in cheek. The most memorable line on the record, “Eating your ass like an oyster,” is more outrageous than romantic. And musically, Miami Memory feels like a stuffy reheat of Forced Witness’ groovy ’80s synth-rock. With the assistance of saxophonist Roy Molloy, that album managed to sound sophisticated no matter how self-evidently terrible its characters. Here, blocky synth structures feel mismatched to the themes, and heavy-handed arrangements sometimes threaten to overwhelm the lyrics. Cameron’s greatest skill is cinematic evocations of pouty, insecure men in stubborn denial of their failings, like Bruce Springsteen trying to get inside the head of Brett Kavanaugh. “I got friends in Kansas City with a motherfuckin’ futon couch/If that’s how you want to play it,” he scoffs on “Divorce,” the voice of a man too mad to recognize that he’s playing himself. Miraculously, the schtick also works outside the sarcastic register. He’s maybe most affecting on “End Is Nigh,” an almost countrypolitan synth ballad about an alcoholic fatalist who’s having a bad time at 12-step meetings: “They remind me of my daddy with that Bible shit/And drinking coffee makes me wanna die more.” You don’t necessarily need firsthand experience with this kind of personal dysfunction; Cameron makes it both painfully real and bleakly comical. When Miami Memory attempts to reach outside the discomfort zone, it’s less convincing. “Far From Born Again” is feel-good disco-funk about a woman who reminds me of Candy, Maggie Gyllenhaal's scrappy, self-made pornographer on HBO’s The Deuce. But while “Far from born again/She’s doing porn again” is excellent as a one-liner, Cameron never reaches in to explore that tension, the way Candy’s relationship with her puritanical mother complicates her success in sex work. Cameron’s narrator is close enough to the action to criticize hypocritical customers—“Same men that tell her stop are the same suckers that pay”—but distant enough that he comes off as a voyeur. The best Alex Cameron songs lift—or rather sink—you into worlds created by deeply flawed characters: On Forced Witness’ “Running Outta Luck,” his misguided antihero fell for a stripper and, blinded by love and jealousy, took off on the run from her other clients. On Miami Memory’s “Bad for the Boys,” he’s singing about the trick rather than doing it: “Good old Dane, what a shame/He got done for a sexual harassment claim … Never thought I’d feel bad for the boys.” You hate to say it, but this could be a far funnier song if oblivious, predatory “Dane” wrote it, and Cameron has the rare ability to illustrate the creeper perspective while simultaneously undermining it. Instead, his last lines—“Guess I don’t feel so bad, feel so bad, feel so bad for the boys”—seem like they were supposed to be the subtext. Perhaps Cameron boxed himself in here: He’s the loudest character in his own music, but he’s also established that it would be out of character for that music to be anywhere near as self-reflective as he is in life. As in the case of Stephen Colbert, it’s hard to drop a winning irony act and remain equally entertaining. It’s easy enough to see why Cameron would like to have it both ways—it’s a lot harder to pull off.

Hot Motion,Temples,by: Sophie Kemp ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3870a00ad9a700092558fc/1:1/w_160/hotmotion_temples.jpg,2019-09-26 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/temples-hot-motion/,ATO,"Prefab rock’n’roll revivalism never hurt anyone. Especially not Temples, a British three-piece who have built their career crate-digging for the trippiest and most aggressively overstuffed ’70s psych-rock. Their third album, Hot Motion, is crafted more or less in the same vein as their previous two. A showing of studied musicianship and strong arrangements, Hot Motion is fuzzy to the touch and easy enough to imagine hearing in the background. Unfortunately, very little lies beneath the surface. What makes Hot Motion weird is that it is the illusion of a psych-rock record; the melodies here are plucked right from pop songs, even more so than on past records. It’s Pink Floyd and Revolver in the streets, “Knights of Cydonia” in the sheets. Over time, the album reveals itself to be a subtle pop zombie. Take the spacey “It’s All Coming Out,” which follows the structure of a pop song, but just happens to have some weird, vaguely ’80s synth effects that resemble a scrapped MGMT demo. Lyrically, there’s not much to look at: Temples favor aesthetics and flashy production over memorable lines. “The Howl,” probably the weakest cut on the record, toggles between sounding trippy and actually being a song by the Black Keys. The focus is on the hard-to-stomach snare sound, while the guitar is a jarring El Camino pastiche that sounds out of place on a record otherwise coated in paisley and velvet. The song attempts to be a rallying cry for an unspecified event, but in reality, it’s something you might tap your foot to in a loud bar. “You’re Either On Something” feigns drug-induced deepness while vintage-sounding synthesizers flicker in the background and guitar parts go the way of the baroque. The song sounds good in theory, but beauty and technique don’t count for much when the music lacks any semblance of individuality. Temples are clearly skilled technicians; they probably could’ve produced this record in their sleep. What’s frustrating is that the project begins and ends at talent. These songs are hollow; you could listen to Hot Motion half a dozen times and feel nothing. What makes matters worse is that Temples have made three albums whose sound can more or less be distilled to “glamping while on ayahuasca.” Consistency can be admirable, but this is a bore.

Memory,Vivian Girls,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d88d20821339a0008396923/1:1/w_160/viviangirls_memory.jpg,2019-09-25 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/vivian-girls-memory/,Polyvinyl,"Even in their rebirth, Vivian Girls have death on the brain. “I live in New York City/And all my friends are dead,” Cassie Ramone sings flatly on “I’m Far Away,” a creeping, paranoid track off of Memory, Vivian Girls’ first album in eight years. That sentiment also serves as a general consensus about the state of indie rock in the half-decade since the band’s official breakup: Vivian Girls, along with the North Brooklyn DIY scene they came to represent, have died. But even after their demise, it was hard not to hear Vivian Girls everywhere. Their spirit existed, in their absence, in the school-choir harmonies of Girlpool and Ovlov, the electric fuzz that burns after a Deli Girls track or a Priests riff, the hesitant confidence of Frankie Cosmos’ lyrics. That’s not to suggest the band only touched the lives of female and nonbinary musicians—look no further than Wavves, The Pains of Being Pure at Heart, or the entire Orchid Tapes catalog for their stoned ennui. But perhaps these groups could thrive, both critically and in the harsh spotlight of the internet, because Vivian Girls forged a brave new world of punk rock that wasn’t afraid of a beautiful vocal harmony, one that could exist in between the uncompromising politics of riot grrrl and the soft hues of twee-pop. Ramone, bassist Katy Goodman, and drummer Ali Koehler could have cleaned up their sound and shaken off their harsher edges. Instead, from the first chord of opener “Most of All,” the band jumps back into fried guitar, loose percussion, and fast and easy repetition, as if they’d simply woken up from an eight-year nap in the middle of a set. If anything, the group leans into their garage rock roots a bit more, letting songs spiral out, as on “I’m Far Away”’s scorched guitar solo or the prolonged, slowcore-indebted outro to “Something to Do.” The band stretches their blend of punk and ethereal pop the farthest on the uncharacteristically slow-building “Lonely Girl,” where a muted kick drum hits like a resting heartbeat as layers build around it. And then, after two minutes of long vowels and drawn-out sentences, the song picks up steam, as if the band chugs a Red Bull each time Cassie repeats the titular phrase. By the end, they sound like a train running out of track: “No you can’t come here,” Ramone sings, louder and gnarlier, before putting her foot down—“No! Cuz I’m a lonely girl.” It sounds like a breakdown, a tantrum, a moment of clarity—and then, as if nothing had happened, it fades into washed vocal melodies, and then into silence. There are missteps, a risk on most punk albums that run north of 10 songs. The seesaw vocals that open “Mistake” are a bit too short of breath, like a child fervently reciting a playground rhyme. The longest song on the record, “All Your Promises,” pushes the band’s capacity for extended psych-rock jams to its limit with a four-minute, free-wheeling outro. But those indulgences are forgivable, even understandable, on an album that feels like a triumphant return. And seen through the frame of the critics they’ve outlived, who often interpreted their use of distortion pedals as amateur musicianship, the extra time spent on riffs seems like an abrasive “fuck you.” On their last pre-breakup album, 2011’s Share the Joy, Vivian Girls’ lyrics seemed mired in the heightened politics of blog-rock, with long spoken-word intros mocking their “girl group” status. On Memory, there’s a clarity and intensity to Ramone’s songwriting that leaves little room for gimmicks, employing the earnestness that made the Brooklyn DIY scene such a refreshing break from the coy art rock of early 2000s Manhattan. Despondency is a running theme, but more specifically, the album homes in on the quiet despair that comes with the passage of time—an ex-lover remarking that Ramone looks different, old wrongs that can’t be righted, driving drunk because God gets us all in the end. The anxiety that plagues Ramone runs deep—she’s itching to crawl out of her skin, screaming that nobody loves her; coming from a musician who admittedly agonized over harsh criticism in the past, it’s almost daring to admit to the level of self-hatred she does here. But wrapped in Vivian Girls’ dusty, rose-colored melodies, the anxiety goes down easy. Up until the release of Memory, the band’s arc followed that of their namesake: The Story of the Vivian Girls, the magnum opus of reclusive outsider artist Henry Darger. His stories and illustrations were completed at night; no one knew of his prolific output until they were discovered by his landlord shortly before his death. And while the Vivian Girls of certainly received recognition during their active years, it was only after their breakup that fans started to see their work as something greater, more representative of big questions about the state of rock music. After everything they’ve been through, Vivian Girls prefer to live on the outside.

Only the Blues,Dylan Moon,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d88d5ba09b36e0009899f2f/1:1/w_160/dylanmoon_onlytheblues.jpg,2019-09-25 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dylan-moon-only-the-blues/,Rvng Intl.,"Dylan Moon is a dreamer. On his debut Only the Blues, he sings that “sleepwalking days have found [him] now,” an explicit acknowledgement that he’s got his head in the clouds. But even if he hadn’t outright said so, you’d guess it soon enough from the pillowy arrangements, from the way his voice rises from silky baritone to his whispery upper register, from the sparkle in his voice when he sings about reaching “Xanadu’s shore” or when he pleads to Jerry Garcia for guidance. This is not music concerned with the mundane; Moon is floating somewhere above the everyday. Moon certainly isn’t the first to apply a turn-off-your-mind-and-float-downstream approach to guitar pop, nor is he ignorant of his forebears. In an interview with Aquarium Drunkard, he explicitly cites “’60s psych, shoegaze, and ’90s indie” as well younger songwriters like Emily Yacina as reference points for his music. Tracks like “Lines” recall the work of Felt, while others evoke the grayscale ambience of '80s 4AD. The overall mood—creeping, misty, and kinda sad—recalls a fair amount of slowcore bands. Texturally at least, it’s  pleasant stuff. But Moon's songwriting is stranger than those influences suggest. His music moves with the fragmented imagery and broken logic of dreams and memory; melodies and sections bleed and blur into one another until it’s hard to remember where one part starts and another ends. There are no anthemic choruses or even especially repetitive melodies—Moon moves fast, picking out a memorable riff then immediately twisting it into gnarled new shapes. This makes the music feel slippery and unsettling, in spite of the comforting arrangements. Moon sings of fantasy worlds and deep trips, but an undercurrent of anxiety and loss pulses underneath. On “Mind Troubles,” he lays out his concerns most explicitly, grappling with “the fight against a constant mind.” But elsewhere his worries communicate themselves in oblique whispers and clipped moans. He sings things like “Wish me away, blank hollow husk,” and even if you aren't sure exactly what he means, his desperation and despair are palpable. There are moments of fleeting whimsy; he gestures at the existence of characters named Midnight the Cat and Wednesday the Rat on “Analog,” and a few old Hanna-Barbera cartoons get shoutouts on “Mind Troubles.” It's unclear exactly what they're doing here, but that's how dreams work, isn't it? You can't control what ominous figures or childhood memories might haunt you, what unpredictable twists and turns your mind takes. You can only turn yourself over to it, then surrender your waking hours to unpacking the mysteries.

Entre Los Dos EP,Y La Bamba,by: Colin Lodewick,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d88d8e61f868e00096102b1/1:1/w_160/entrelosdos_ylabamba.jpg,2019-09-25 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/y-la-bamba-entre-los-dos-ep/,Tender Loving Empire,"Earlier this year, Y La Bamba (aka Luz Elena Mendoza) released the full-length LP Mujeres, examining her intersecting identities against the backdrop of the poisonous American political landscape. The album was Mendoza’s first in the role of producer, and she continues to lead her band in new directions on *Entre Los Dos —both in sound and message. As the title implies, this is a record concerning the intimate space between two people. Though still grounded by lo-fi percussion and surf-rock inspired guitar, the arrangements veer in more experimental directions, matching Mendoza’s inward turn. Her acrobatic voice fills each track, often evoking Angel Olsen when it trembles. The pared-down piano ballad “Octavio,” the only song sung in English, emerges in the middle without warning. More frequently, though, it transforms into something closer to a yell, as on the title track and on “Rios Sueltos” and “Las Platicas.” The record rumbles along at nearly the same pace and tone as Mendoza’s contemporary Molly Burch, but it never loses sight of where it’s headed. The title track of Entre Los Dos begins with a threat, calmly delivered: “Y me saltaré de mi ventana” (“And I will jump out of my window”). The EP is filled with similar sentiments, with Mendoza fighting to understand her place within her relationships and coming up against the brink of her composure. Later on the title track, she admits that she doesn’t think she can be what her lover needs, then repeats the phrase “No creo que puedo” (“I don’t think I can”) three times, her voice inflected with mounting desperation. It’s an arresting moment, her desire to make things work colliding with her dawning understanding that they probably won’t. The tracks collide and overlap in ways that mirror Mendoza’s lyrics: The end of “Entre Los Dos” dissolves into piercing bird calls and wind chimes, which carry over into the following track “Rios Sueltos,” bolstered by an ominous drone. Similarly, the delicate piano that backs her warble on “Octavio” falls out of tune as the song ends and turns into an unsettling, frantic twinkling—countered immediately by the enthusiastic guitar riffs that follow on “Soñadora.” On “Los Gritos,” she announces: “Mi piel es mi lengua, mi lengua es mi piel, los huesos son hechos, son hechos de pura sal” (“My skin is my tongue, my tongue is my skin/The bones are made, are made of pure salt”), and the music tremors with the same physicality. Entre Los Dos is an introspective folk record, yes, but it’s one that understands just how visceral introspection can be.

MISCREANT,Sueco the Child,by: Cat Zhang,Executive Editorial Assistant,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d88d75c21339a0008396926/1:1/w_160/sueco_miscreant.jpg,2019-09-25 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sueco-the-child-miscreant/,Atlantic,"Somewhere in a museum of the most outrageous sex lyrics—between 2 Chainz’s “Dos Cadenas … you can suck my penis” and JAY-Z’s “your breasteses is my breakfast”—is a bawdy declaration from Pasadena rapper Sueco the Child. “Put my D in her V got her singin’ a C note,” he brags in his grungy trap single “fast.” Sueco uploaded “fast” to SoundCloud in April. Then, when a viral TikTok challenge vaulted Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” to the top of the charts, he saw an opportunity. He asked Lukas Daley, a 16-year-old skateboard personality and TikTok star, to share a video featuring “fast.” The song became an immediate sensation, inspiring over 3 million TikToks. Shortly afterward, Sueco inked a record deal with Atlantic and dropped a remix featuring Offset and A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie. Sueco was primed for virality: Before “fast” blew up, the 22-year-old born William Schultz had already accumulated more than a hundred thousand Instagram followers by filming musical stunts with a friend, skateboarder Lamont Holt. He made beats blindfolded; he made beats out of condoms; he made beats out of a girl’s butt. It helps that he looks like the illegitimate child of Dwight Schrute and a blue raspberry Jolly Rancher, and yells things like, “I fucking wish I was an industry plant” in a trollish deadpan. “fast” is Sueco’s autobiography—a sleazy account of selling weed, making beats, and “whiskey dicking,” delivered in a croak-whisper reminiscent of the way Justin Bieber once said “chilling by the fire while we eating fondue.” Buoyed by an infectious siren wail and a beat that stomps like a teenager on a DDR machine, it was an easy fit for dance challenges and outfit transformation videos. It didn’t necessarily work beyond the 15-second sound bite: The longer you listened, the more Sueco’s sluggish delivery and monotonous instrumentals started to drag. But like many memes, “fast” could be devilishly fun. The same can’t be said for the other seven tracks on Sueco’s debut, MISCREANT. The rest of the album is both gross and soppy, like a drunk man who vomits on your shoes, and then, too hammered to realize what’s happening, groans “I love you.” “Put it her mouth have her drink it up like Danimals,” he growls in the album’s second single, “dork,” one of many songs preoccupied with the fact that a girl has touched his nuts. His goofy sex descriptions (“Hit it from the blind side/Sandra Bullock”) could be irreverent and ridiculous, if only the instrumentals weren’t so nauseatingly sentimental. “dork”’s starry-eyed gurgles recall nothing more than Owl City. The emo laptop-twinkles on “cayman” sound similarly trapped in a T-Mobile commercial. “I take a vegan bitch and I give her protein,” Sueco whispers, a pairing of style and subject matter as jarring as an ASMR dub of a “Real Housewives” fight. TikTok—that Wild West of incest sketches, country throwdowns, and emo kids pretending to choke themselves—can be so vertigo-inducing that “brilliantly terrible” and “terribly brilliant” begin to mean the same thing. But MISCREANT isn’t impish or unique enough to succeed, even on meme terms. Much of it is memorable not for what it is, but for who it rips off. “novacane:)” is taxidermied Green Day, and “no sleep in my body” and “sober” are generic imitations of Juice WRLD. “Call me when it’s over, I can’t function sober,” Sueco whimpers, a line that could’ve come from any codeined SoundCloud rapper. Sueco doesn’t have enough punkish nihilism to imbue the subject with much urgency, anyway. As sad white boys go, he lacks the big hooks and raspy, soulful howl of someone like Post Malone. Sueco’s been minorly famous for only a few months, but he sounds washed up, bragging about his glory days to a room that’s quickly emptying. His callbacks to “fast”—the reference to “400 on the dashy” in “dork,” a shoutout to “Cashville” in “626/305*”—make it sound as if he’s already run out of material. “I make a bitch sing pitch perfect,” he raps on “dork,” serving up a limp imitation of the joke he made on his first single. TikTok shaved two and a half minutes of “fast” down to mere seconds. It takes a particular kind of hubris to expect one viral moment to last 23 minutes straight.","The 22-year-old Instagram stuntman turned TikTok sensation has been minorly famous for only a few months, but he already sounds washed up.

Sunshine Kitty,Tove Lo,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d88d47bd118d20008aff3d0/1:1/w_160/tovelo_sunshinekitty.jpg,2019-09-24 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tove-lo-sunshine-kitty/,Island,"Tove Lo got big by breaking herself. She topped the charts with the stark, corrosive imagery of first hit, 2014’s “Habits (Stay High)”: vomiting in bathtubs, trapping her mind in a haze. Self-destruction has paved the way for self-care in much of mainstream female pop; you’re less likely to hear a woman on the radio brushing her teeth with a bottle of Jack than you are to hear her describing her skincare routine. Women are charged with empowering other women: Everyone’s a hot girl, no matter what the season. Tove Lo cracks this dynamic open on Sunshine Kitty, a title that she’s said is “a play on pussy power.” There are tote-bag-ready you-go-girlisms on the album, but they’re lit by neon and grounded in nuance. “Bad as the Boys,” a shiny single about the collapse of a queer relationship, has a fairly boring premise—women can break hearts, too! But the song surpasses its set-up, partly because of its shimmering production and partly because Tove Lo eloquently describes the specific pains of a bi woman trying to navigate a heterosexual-dominant dating culture. On the album, she sings about using women and being used by them, about competing for male attention with women she’s attracted to. “When I hate on you, I’m breaking the code,” Kylie Minogue confesses to Tove on one of the album’s best tracks. “Hard to be fair to you when I got my heart broke,” she admits seconds later. Sunshine Kitty holds some of Tove Lo’s most vulnerable writing; it’s also her clubbiest record. The result is a cutting confessional line like, “I think you like the way she kissed you better/Maybe I’m mistaken,” thrown over thrumming bass. These are house anthems and each track has a unique texture: undulating drums, layered effects that sound like a chain being rattled. She churns through emotions—lust, shame, defeat—as each winding beat paves the way to the next. Tove Lo once wrote a sardonic ode to the effortless “Cool Girl”; now, she revels in overthinking, highlighting the neuroticism that underpins each corner of a party. “I see you looking, so I turn my charm on, hoping I look awesome,” she sings on “Equally Lost.” She calculates when to ask someone for a cigarette. She deconstructs each kiss. There’s an entire track wrestling with whether or not to disclose an affair, another consumed with asking someone to stay over. Tove Lo’s songwriting is unsubtle but not uncomplicated, and while her scenes are well-worn in pop music—bodies tangled in purple lights, morning sun stabbing at hangovers—her best tracks are both blunt and polished enough to sound original. At its worst, the album can slump into fizzy banalities. The last track shows Tove Lo in love, and she wreaths her emotions with generic hyperbole. “I’ll follow you anywhere you go,” she cries over a beat ready to be bastardized by the Chainsmokers. “Jacques,” a mostly fun song with British DJ Jax Jones, can sound like the worst kid in your study abroad program trying to get past a bouncer: “Je m’appelle Tove, get the show on the road,” she chants.

Why Me? Why Not.,Liam Gallagher,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d66a1e68aeb9e0008ccf767/1:1/w_160/hmmmmm.jpg,2019-09-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/liam-gallagher-why-me-why-not/,Warner Bros.,"There’s a moment on “Halo,” the fifth song on Liam Gallagher’s Why Me? Why Not., where the rocker breaks down and a flute comes to the forefront in a flourish of purple psychedelia. At that precise moment, it’s hard not to think of “Halo” as a sideways dig at “Holy Mountain,” the pounding, flute-filled first single from Noel Gallagher’s 2017 album, Who Built the Moon? Then again, it’s generally hard to think of Liam Gallagher without thinking of his estranged sibling. More than being just brothers, the pair have historically had complementary strengths, with Noel providing Oasis their songs and Liam giving the band its voice and charisma. Noel managed to shake off the ghost of Oasis, but that task has proven much harder for Liam to achieve. Why Me? Why Not. is Liam’s second solo album, arriving after a pair of albums by Beady Eye, a group that was effectively latter-day Oasis without Noel. Considering that Noel was the chief songwriter in Oasis, this was a problem. It’s not that Liam didn’t write. He began contributing to Oasis albums in 2000, once rock’n’roll excess and sibling stress started to take a toll on Noel, and Liam continued to contribute a few tunes every few years, always maintaining a respectable level of craft without ever threatening to approach his brother’s level of mastery. Beady Eye eroded Gallagher’s sales but not his fame. Tabloids continued to pursue Liam not only because he was mired in personal troubles, but because he made good copy. Tales of divorce and illegitimate children kept him in the spotlight as he made the slow transition from lead singer to lone wolf. When he reintroduced himself as a solo singer in 2017 with As You Were, the move made sense, since he needed to draw a clear line between himself, Beady Eye, and Oasis. What is a mystery is why he’s chosen to replicate this same maneuver for Why Me? Why Not. Accompanied by a documentary film that attempts to justify Gallagher’s wanderings in the aftermath of Oasis—a movie that quickly devolves into an extended press kit, where the moments of high drama involve a late-night Twitter meltdown where friends plead, “Put the phone down”—Why Me? Why Not. scans as a re-introduction, right down to its title. That’s hardly necessary, in part because Liam has spent half of his life as one of the most documented humans on Earth, but also because musical forward motion is a foreign concept to him. Ever since Oasis conquered the world in 1995, he’s settled for singing psychedelic pop tunes, earnest ballads, and glam-rock stompers, a combination that also fuels Why Me? Why Not. The sound may remain the same but the vibe does not. Oasis were young men dreaming of escape, but Liam Gallagher is a middle-aged man who is happy to be here now; there is no hunger here, no yearning, just classy contentment. Familiarity is a tonic. Now, when Liam nods to the Beatles—“Once” opens with a melodic line reminiscent of John Lennon’s “Jealous Guy,” “Meadow” has a slide guitar straight out of George Harrison—it’s not a matter of arrogance: The fleeting Fab Four allusions are intended as a secret bond between Gallagher and fans. Similarly, nothing on the album sounds exactly like Oasis—it’s all too controlled and studio-sculpted—but not a song here would’ve been imaginable without the Gallaghers’ enthusiastic embrace of classic rock tropes. “The River” rambles along to crunching chords and swirling organs; “One of Us” indulges in a bit of nostalgic mid-tempo melancholy; “Gone” achieves a bit of cinematic grandeur with its spaghetti Western orchestration. Oasis never attempted to paint with such a colorful palette, and the increased level of professional craft is surely due to the presence of Greg Kurstin and Andrew Wyatt, producers and songwriters who also worked on As You Were. Kurstin and Wyatt were enlisted as collaborators because Gallagher recognized the limitations of his songwriting; he has no shame in this—it’s one of the plot points in the documentary. This pair, along with a handful of other behind-the-scenes musicians, help turn Liam’s ideas into songs, honing their hooks so they snag quickly and painlessly, polishing the production so it gleams like a wall of mirrors. Every trick in the book is here: sawing strings, fuzzy guitars, stacks of harmonies, all with sequenced rhythms that gently push Gallagher right into the mainstream of modern music circa 2009. Maybe it’s not exactly modern, but it’s closer than Gallagher has been in the past. The team of producers on Why Me? Why Not. helps refine Gallagher’s sonic signatures, but it also pushes him into adult-alternative territory. Which means that Liam, the last great rock singer of the 20th century, is now a pop vocalist. Age has softened his rasp, a change he modulates by singing with precision, not abandon. It can be pleasurable to hear him sing with such restraint—he’s turning into a nuanced ballad singer, as evidenced by the sepia-toned “Once”—but the shift underscores how his musical and emotional range is restrained by his adherence to the past. This fundamental musical conservatism still has its charms, but as he gets older, it’s beginning to be overwhelmed by nostalgia. Where Liam Gallagher once yearned for years he never experienced, he’s now pining for his glory days, a shift that gives his purportedly friendly music an accidentally pensive undercurrent. Despite the shiny, bright surfaces, what’s left unspoken is that Liam is not quite ready to admit that he’s already had the time of his life and is not quite sure what to do next.","The former Oasis frontman’s second solo album is pitched as a reintroduction, but forward motion—whether musical or personal—remains foreign to him.

Vol. 2,Topdown Dialectic,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d88d38ad09cd000084cde72/1:1/w_160/topdown_2.jpg,2019-09-24 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/topdown-dialectic-vol-2/,Peak Oil,"Six years after Topdown Dialectic put out their first limited-run cassette, we still know little about them besides what can be gleaned from the crackle and throb of their recordings, which take the facelessness of techno to Vantablack levels of opacity. Anonymity in music is often a ploy, but it can also be a form of world-building, a tactic for letting the work speak for itself. In Topdown Dialectic’s case, it’s tempting to speculate that mystery may be just a byproduct of their process. Peak Oil, the label behind this LP and its 2018 predecessor, has said only that the music is the result of feeding unidentified audio materials through unspecified procedures. How much human input goes in, we don’t know. Perhaps Topdown Dialectic are attentive sound sculptors, their fingers in constant motion on the controls; perhaps they’re more hands off, akin to a digital dance mom shepherding around her talented AI offspring in the virtual minivan. Doesn’t really matter, because the music is as ceaseless as it is cryptic, a mesmerizing swirl of vapor and grit. Topdown Dialectic’s aesthetic was already fully formed on that first, self-titled cassette, and it hasn’t really changed much since. All of their output remains untitled, except occasionally by date or catalog number; most of their tracks are exactly five minutes in length. The music is clearly descended from a dub-techno lineage that includes Basic Channel and Vladislav Delay; it contains traces of Vainqueur’s churning pulses, Dettinger’s elliptical loops, and Pole’s white noise. But if most dub techno already sounds like dance music that’s been exposed to bleach and a power sander, Topdown Dialectic’s music is further dissolved, further eroded. For fans of this style, Vol. 2 is that rare, perfect scenario: It sounds exactly like its predecessor, yet each of its tracks carves out new territory. All of Topdown Dialectic’s music is remarkably similar, and even the most attentive listener might be hard-pressed to tell two of their early tracks apart. But the music grew decidedly heavier on their Peak Oil debut, with beefier drums and denser clouds of fog; Vol. 2 continues that trajectory. With its rippling arpeggios and hard, bright conga thwacks, the opening “A1” summons the most crystalline sound Topdown Dialectic have ever made, and so does the clanking “A2,” its blasts of radiator hiss sculpted and sharpened to a fine point. The sound evokes a zone of confusion between lo-def and hi-def, where the individual grains of static are thrown into vivid relief. Everywhere you listen, there’s some detail clamoring for your attention. In the drum’n’bass-paced “A3,” it’s a looped voice recalls the pinballing samples of Massive Attack and Mad Professor’s No Protection; in “B1,” a plaintive, wordless vocal permeates the murk like a tendril of memory. There’s a weird, three-dimensional quality at work, reminiscent of holograms or lenticular images, as bits of sound pop out of the mix; the relationship between foreground and background is in constant flux. For something so dependent on generative processes, Topdown Dialectic’s music is remarkably expressive, and it’s tempting to want to peek behind the curtain at its makers. But I suspect that the who, how, and why aren’t really the point. Topdown Dialectic neither exploit their anonymity nor fetishize obscurantism. Perhaps they simply want to invite us to pay closer attention. We are surrounded by secretive processes; do you really know how your router works—or eyeglasses or gravity or THC, for that matter? Yet we never second-guess their functioning. Beauty is mysterious business too, and perhaps an arbitrary one.","The shadowy creators behind Topdown Dialectic make electronic music as ceaseless as it is cryptic.

12 Conversations With Thilo Heinzmann,Jóhann Jóhannsson,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d7f9a4f4bc6510008699aaa/1:1/w_160/johannsson_12convos.jpg,2019-09-24 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/johann-johannsson-12-conversations-with-thilo-heinzmann/,Deutsche Grammophon,"Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson was prolific, a fact made clear in the months since his tragic passing in 2018. Five scores completed just before his death have since been released, and there’s a reissue in the works for Jóhannsson’s ’90s synth-pop duo Dip, with Sugarcubes drummer Siggi Baldursson. And that’s before the second part of the massive Retrospective box set series arrives next year. 12 Conversations with Thilo Heinzmann accentuates Jóhannsson’s creative restlessness. Originally premiered three years ago in London, it’s based on the works of Berlin painter Thilo Heinzmann. In accordance with the composer’s wishes, these pieces were recorded by the Brussels-based Echo Collective. If you ever found yourself swayed by Jóhannsson’s first major work, 2001’s exquisite Englabörn, you’ll know that from the start, he exhibited a heightened sensibility to the timbre of a string quartet. Subsequent works bore that out, even when he deployed brass ensembles or a full orchestra. Surprisingly, 12 Conversations marks his first proper work for string quartet alone. Jóhannsson often eschewed such formalities in his compositions, weaving in piano, electronics, vocal samples, and rumbling drones to give his work grit, chasmic depth, and emotional range. His genius lay in part in his ability to invert expectations of classical instrumentation to give rise to new sonorities, as when he deployed 12 double basses for Sicario. How else to explain the immense foreboding and dread he conjures on “The Beast,” perhaps his defining movie theme? This means that 12 Conversations can sound like Jóhannsson at his purest, most deferential, and—in the scope of his body of work—perhaps slightly unfinished. “Manifest” stuns with its beautiful theme, moving from a somber opening to something more sweeping and teasing a gorgeous line from the cello that stays just this side of a drone. It’s Jóhannsson totally unadorned, and it feels all the more lovely because of it. “Shell” might resemble a Bach suite, but it moves achingly slowly, evocative because of its deliberateness. The stately “Lacrimosa” sounds like a subtle homage to the likes of Vivaldi. But the gestures of “Stuk” and “Zurich” feel oddly disconnected and unresolved, like thematic sketches awaiting delivery of a rough cut of a film before being fully fleshed out. Originally commissioned by British philanthropist and art collector Richard Thomas to convey the communal transfer of artistic ideas beyond borders, the set projects an underlying theme about the European Union. Or rather, a British patron connected with an Icelandic composer to convey the visual aesthetic of a German painter with help from a Belgian musical ensemble. At such a precarious time on the continent, it’s a noble pursuit. Only, many moments on 12 Conversations feel more like an ambient backdrop than a focal point. A piece like “Danse” is the kind of classical music you put on when you want it to be totally unobtrusive. But when the high frequencies of “Form” strafe across the stereo field on the latter half of the album, it startles you to attention. In that moment, one pines for Jóhannsson himself—for his willingness to sully and scuff up the most pristine and stuffy of Western musical traditions in a true expression of the collective spirit of the 21st century.

DSVII,M83,by: Noah Yoo,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d2753ab98713d00083bb80a/1:1/w_160/M83_DSVII_CoverArt_hires.jpg,2019-09-23 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/m83-dsvii/,Mute,"Though it’s rarely singled out for praise, 2007’s Digital Shades Vol. 1 is a Rosetta stone for the two classic M83 albums that followed: Saturdays=Youth and Hurry Up, We’re Dreaming. Anthony Gonzalez’s love of ambient and shoegaze ran throughout the serene collection of minimal soundscapes like digital waves washing up against a pixelating shoreline. The emotional ebb and flow of Vol. 1 was more patient than anything the French musician had attempted before, and those experiments would inform anthems like “We Own the Sky” and “Midnight City” in the decade to come. Twelve years, three LPs, and three soundtrack albums later, M83 return to the Digital Shades series with DSVII, a worthy sequel that demonstrates Gonzalez’s growth as a composer over the past decade. Where much of Vol. 1 focused on moody pad swells and filter sweeps, DSVII is ornate and loosely concept oriented. The tracklisting suggests that it might be the soundtrack to a high-fantasy video game, in which M83 follows in the footsteps of greats like Yasunori Mitsuda and Koji Kondo. When he first announced the album, Gonzalez admitted that replaying old games from his childhood had been a major inspiration for the record. “There is something so naive and touching about them,” he said of the games. “It’s simple and imperfect.” Like the best film scores, great video-game music refuses to be relegated to the background. Instead, it aspires to be inextricable from the experience. Because Gonzalez is untethered from the restrictions of an actual game, he’s free to design the universe of DSVII as he sees fit, and the album’s eclectic nature reflects that. The song titles may allude to some larger universe—there are vague references to colonies and temples—but their open-ended nature allows listeners to fill in whatever narrative they wish. M83 have long been synonymous with neon-drenched nostalgia and a sound indebted to the 1980s, but DSVII feels most captivating when Gonzalez harks back even further, to the earnest 1970s. Acoustic guitars meet proggy arpeggios, expanding upon the dramatic playbook established by Daft Punk’s retro-fetishist masterpiece Random Access Memories: Do what you’re good at, but play it all using analog gear, so it feels real. There are stunning, plaintive meditations (“Goodbye Captain Lee” sounds like a sci-fi update of Ryuichi Sakamoto’s iconic “Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence”) and even ambient in the vein of Vol. 1 (“Mirage”), but some moments feel overblown by comparison. Gratuitous drums threaten to topple an already delicate balance of exaggerated chord changes on “Feelings” and album closer “Temple of Sorrow.” The flute solos and Randy Newman-esque balladry on “A Word of Wisdom” might evoke a character wandering into the home of a humble village shopkeep who can give them that elusive quest item. And whether or not you have role-playing games on the brain, you may wonder what on earth an accordion is doing on a M83 record. Digital Shades began as an outlet for B-sides and ambient music that didn’t fit into the strictures of M83’s proper studio albums. With DSVII, the series evolves into a space for tinkering, where Gonzalez can embrace different influences. With neither someone else’s vision nor any cohesive album statement to fulfill, he reverts to maximalism, melding his two musical identities—synth-pop showman, serious composer for other mediums—to become the director of his own electronic daydreams.

Karaoke Angel,Molly Sarlé,by: Amanda Wicks,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d83b719960f3b000852bddc/1:1/w_160/sarle_karaoke.jpg,2019-09-23 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/molly-sarle-karaoke-angel/,Partisan,"For a singer whose voice sounds like an amber flame, Molly Sarlé hasn’t always been so sure about singing. Friendship led her to folk trio Mountain Man, where she, Amelia Meath, and Alexandra Sauser-Monnig entwined their vocals into uncannily intimate, honey-tipped harmonies. But if their lauded 2010 debut, Made the Harbor, and later tour supporting Feist seemed like a clear path forward, Sarlé had her doubts about a career in music. A break, a Zen center, and Sarlé’s brief pursuit of acting haven’t fully abated those doubts. “I’m far from knowing/What I’m doing here,” she sings on “Passenger Side,” from her debut solo album Karaoke Angel. She craves perspective, acknowledging her penchant for “looking for a bird’s eye view in my rearview mirror,” as her voice dips in register and an electric guitar echoes cavernously around her. The vantage may never broaden, but Sarlé’s come to see the magic in telling your own story as opposed to performing other people’s. Sarlé studied performance theory in college, and shades of that framework appear throughout Karaoke Angel, which bridges the sepia warmth of the Laurel Canyon sound with the rooted hymns of Appalachian folk. On “Almost Free,” she performs a doting daughter for her father, stretching the boundaries of her affection: “So I tell my dad what he wants to hear/I say ‘I love you,’ say ‘I need you here.’” Desire becomes a tangled performance on “This Close.” “Are we really this close, or is it just the drugs?” Sarlé asks, drawing out her phrasing and briefly luxuriating in pleasure, even if it’s tied to a destructive romance. Finding the space to fit Sarlé’s expansive voice required three years and three recording attempts—in Los Angeles, Durham, and finally Woodstock. The album finally coalesced at Dreamland, the former church turned studio, under the guidance of producer Sam Evian. Evian has said recording Sarlé felt like making a documentary, and viewed that way, her voice threads Karaoke Angel with a narrative cohesion. Absent the surrounding vocals of Mountain Man, or much instrumental framing beyond guitar, synths, and occasional drums, Sarlé’s voice comes into full frame. Performing for others becomes dangerous when our mask starts to reflect someone else’s needs. On the witty “Suddenly,” Sarlé stumbles into a moment of clarity. “I don’t know why/But suddenly I am exactly what I wanna be,” she sings, her voice radiating. But instead of internalizing that confidence, she uses it to please her lover. “After giving you head/I get the fuck up out of bed,” she sings, as her doubled voice nears a howl. The tempo stumbles, as if Sarlé grows weary of performing what Norman Mailer once called “a mirror of pleasure,” and she refocuses on her own cravings: “Melt some butter in a pan/Throw some cheese between two pieces of bread.” Whatever glow of self-recognition she felt before the bedroom fades. “I don’t know why/But suddenly I am no longer what I wanna be,” she sings, chafing at the frustration. Sarlé fluctuates between knowing who she is and what she wants, and convincing herself that others hold those keys. “I wanna tell you if you lead me back to myself/I won’t go running to anyone else,” she sings on “Human,” her billowy vocals making the loaded promise seem effortless. Her journey to understanding—that long drive with only a rearview mirror—may have its limits, but storytelling offers a space for control. On Karaoke Angel, Sarlé wields her voice with power, finding actualization in the act of telling. On “Dreams,” her whisper works its own pace against winding synths. “I’ve been working on a version of the truth/I think you’re gonna like it,” she sings. “Call it a song you can sing along to.”","Bridging the sepia warmth of Laurel Canyon with Appalachian folk, the Mountain Man singer’s solo debut revels in the magic of telling your own story.

The Brighter the Light,The Juan MacLean,by: Sean T. Collins,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d51863f611b880008b575fc/1:1/w_160/thejuanmaclean_thebrighter.jpg,2019-09-23 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-juan-maclean-the-brighter-the-light/,DFA,"Variety is the spice of the Juan MacLean. Like label co-founder James Murphy, this core DFA act—comprising frontwoman and LCD Soundsystem alum Nancy Whang and Six Finger Satellite guitarist turned synth wizard John MacLean—has historically taken a magpie approach to dance and electronic sounds. That’s how a Heaven 17 pastiche like The Future Will Come’s 2009 title track can accompany a piano-house banger like “Happy Home,” or how the New Order-esque “Love Stops Here” can share real estate on 2014’s In a Dream with “Charlotte,” a song that sounds more like Beaucoup Fish–era Underworld than anything Underworld have recorded since. Derivative? Pshaw: Whang and MacLean are so proficient and so soulful in their craft that TJM always feels like its own life-affirming entity. So what to make of The Brighter the Light, an album assembled with sameness in mind? A collection of previously released 12"" singles with fresh mastering and editing, along with a pair of new tracks (“Quiet Magician” and “Pressure Danger”), it is wall-to-wall four-on-the-floor. From the anthemic opener “What Do You Feel Free About?” to the closing title track (an instrumental, and the longest on the record), every song could be extracted from the record and inserted into a club night without missing a beat. The problem is that you can take “without missing a beat” literally, as nearly every track on the album moves along at the same brisk pace. Which, granted, is the express purpose of the record: a home for all of the group’s recent club-ready 12""s, with no distractions and no need to deliver on any other vibe or mood. Minor details differentiate tracks that share the same basic template: “Zone Non Linear” has a repeated, chill-inducing  arpeggiated synth hook; the instrumental “Quiet Magician” has a dub vibe, which the following track, “Pressure Danger,” echoes with an even sparser soundscape. Leadoff track “What Do You Feel Free About?” has a distinctive whistle/tom break, albeit a lackluster one. There’s nothing wrong with creating a club LP, but when you stack it up against TJM’s other, more adventurous albums, the consistency can’t help but drag. Much of the impetus to make individual tracks pop falls on Whang’s shoulders, and she more than holds up her end of the bargain. On “Zone Non Linear” she takes an appropriately non-linear approach to romance by singing about it before it occurs. “I wanna race to that moment when we meet,” she sings to a partner who’s not even in the picture just yet. That line, and the song’s repeated refrain of “I can’t wait to find out if I’m in love,” are reminiscent of similar sentiments in Björk’s “I Miss You” (as in “but I haven’t met you yet”); they present love as a thrilling discovery waiting to be made. Whang can pack a lot of power into wordplay. She spends “Can You Ever Really Know Somebody” wondering aloud in slight variations of the titular phrase: “Do you ever really know somebody? … Can you ever really love somebody?” But when she switches to “Can you ever really know my body?”—well, that’s a very different question, and it hits like an adrenaline rush. At times it’s less the phrasing of the lyrics than their delivery that stands out. “Feel Like Movin’” seems at first like a standard exhortation to shake your ass, but Whang chants the repeated hook of “Put your feet on the dance floor, show me what you’re made of” with the sing-song cadence of a schoolyard taunt, like she’s triple-dog-daring you to get down. Coupled with the peppiest production on the record—a bubbly bassline playing off spectral vocal snippets—it’s Brighter’s standout moment. But words can only get you so far, and even they often fall short. You’ve heard the sentiments animating “What Do You Feel Free About?,” “You Are My Destiny,” “Get Down (With My Love),” and “Pressure Danger” before, and there’s nothing particularly special about the variations presented here, whether lyrically, vocally, or musically. That’s the danger of drawing from the same well nine times in a row, even for a band as generally brilliant as the Juan MacLean: Each effort just leaves you thirsting for something new.

Heaven Surrounds You,Surf Curse,by: Abby Jones,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d6e8fbdb34908000800ff87/1:1/w_160/SurfCurse_HeavenSurroundsYou.jpg,2019-09-23 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/surf-curse-heaven-surrounds-you/,Danger Collective,"Los Angeles musician Nick Rattigan has always kept his artistic personas clearly divided. There’s the somber, introspective Rattigan, sole member of Current Joys, whose seclusion manifests in downtempo guitar pop that echoes like a tinny speaker in a cave. Then there’s the bolder Rattigan, drummer and singer of Surf Curse, whose self-deprecating heartaches spiral into restless guitar riffs. Current Joys songs feel like private reflections—particularly on last year’s A Different Age—but his music with bandmate Jacob Rubeck pulls you in by the hand. While early Surf Curse often fell victim to juvenile songwriting (“I’m Not Making Out With You” and “Forever Dumb” appeared on their 2013 EP Sad Boys), their third album, Heaven Surrounds You, is the most confident Rattigan’s ever sounded. Lead single “Disco” is the best song here, driven by clean, racing strums reminiscent of Vampire Weekend’s debut. But where Ezra Koenig bobbed his head under a chandelier somewhere near the Columbia campus, Rattigan shuffles and twists beneath prom-night decor with a Mia Wallace type. “Disco” invokes the allure of legendary couple dance scenes, the kind that make you want to fall in love with somebody just so you can replicate the choreography. As Rattigan coos “I can’t wait for you,” the track imparts a corresponding salacious urgency: Nothing is more important than right now. The closest Heaven Surrounds You comes to matching “Disco”’s silver-screen magic is “Safe,” with a whirling keyboard refrain worthy of a climactic montage. “Safe” swaps the lust of “Disco” for complacent loneliness. “I held you away… I can’t leave my home/I’m safer at home,” Rattigan sings, opting to withdraw entirely rather than risk getting hurt again. “I’m safe alone,” he concludes, though his repetition of the line suggests he’s second-guessing himself. With help from violinist Eliza Bagg of Pavo Pavo, songs like “Opera” and “Trust” exude a baroque-pop eeriness that compliments Rattigan’s occultish references: “Beware of the witching hour/’Cause I can feel you in my room/Is that still you?” he warns in “Hour of the Wolf.” “Tie my wrists and fuck my mind,” he demands in “Opera,” seeming more sinister than inviting. Rattigan isn’t the strongest vocalist—when he belts, it sounds like he’s really trying—but there’s an anguish that surfaces in his quiver, bringing an emotional depth to otherwise plain lyrics. When things get too plain, the album falls short: Lines about “another night of feeling lonely and confused” feel like they could’ve come from anyone. Dull melodies make tracks like “Labyrinth” and “Dead Ringers” mostly forgettable, and a borrowed title like “Midnight Cowboy” relies on the classic cinema reference to conjure what Rattigan’s uninspired lyricism can’t. In its final moments, Heaven Surrounds You attempts to deliver profound awareness of mortality: “I love all the people in my life/All my friends keep me alive,” Rattigan sings. As with much of the record, there’s likely a far deeper implication behind the clichés—he just needs a more insightful script.

He will one day rechristen himself Fenriz, after the Earth-swallowing wolf, Fenrir, who appears in Norse mythology and the Satanic Bible. But for now, he is Gylve Nagell, being raised by his grandmother, spending inordinate amounts of time alone. The pivotal moments of his childhood occur while listening to records, music introduced to him by an eccentric uncle named Stein. Pink Floyd catches his ear; a few songs by the Doors hold his attention; but it’s the English progressive rock band Uriah Heep that blows his mind. He’s entranced by the heavy organ sound, the cryptic lyrics, and the mysterious men with long hair who appear on the album’s cover. He cherishes the triple-fold LP like an heirloom from a past life, spending entire days in front of the record player. Soon, Uncle Stein is no longer invited to the house. When he starts elementary school, Gylve quickly falls in with the older kids, the class clowns, and discovers the magnetic pull of having a good sense of humor. As the ’70s draw to a close, a new genre of music is exploding, giving wild, communal voice to his young outlaw mentality. There’s a band in America whose members wear makeup and stick their tongues out on stages lit by flames; there’s another group from Australia penning youthful odes to breaking the rules. The guitars are loud, the lyrics are filthy, and the teachers don’t get it. “It’s like the dreams you had when you dreamt you were in a candy store and could take all that you wanted,” Fenriz will later reflect. “But metal was real, it was there.” It becomes his entire life. Eventually, his love for Kiss and AC/DC gives way to Iron Maiden and Slayer. At 15, he decides to start his own band. Gylve acquires a drum set, like all the crucial things in his childhood, through his Uncle Stein, and he invites his friends to record some songs under the name Black Death. Their music is sloppy and ridiculous. (Example lyric: “I was sitting in the living room watching the telly/Then something evil formed in my belly/Pizza, pizza, pizza monsters are bad.”) Reviews in the underground zines show no mercy. A writeup in Slayer Magazine—written by one of his most trusted penpals, no less—is mostly comprised of laughter and insistences to burn the tape in a garbage can. It does not deter him. Instead, the young metalhead learns a valuable lesson. In the not-so-distant future, he will proudly refer to Darkthrone as “The Most Hated Band in the World.” He’ll use interviews as opportunities to namedrop his favorite bands lost to obscurity, besmirching the tenets of modern, commercial metal. As a teenager, he is slowly falling into those ideologies; in his forties, this is what he’ll mostly write songs about. But for now, his primary drive is just to make more music and get better as quickly as possible. Gylve finds his match in 1988 when mutual friends introduce him to a guitarist from Oslo named Ted Skjellum, a misanthropic teen who will eventually call himself Nocturno Culto. They talk about music on the phone for an hour and decide to meet up at the train station afterward. Gylve tells Ted to “look for a strange bloke with rattail hair and a scarf.” He looks a bit like a pale, sickly, Scandinavian Slash. “It was not very difficult to point him out when I arrived,” remembered Ted, who, with his long blond hair and a chilling voice, would take on vocal duties in the band. The first great song they make together is called “Snowfall.” By this point, Black Death have changed their name to Darkthrone—based on a song title by Celtic Frost, the brilliantly inventive Swiss band who would serve as their most lasting source of inspiration. The group consists of Gylve and Ted, as well as guitarist Ivar “Zephyrous” Enger and bassist Dag Nilsen. They have an illegible logo that looks like a tangled pile of twigs coated in ice and dripping blood—among the first in a style that would become the standard for extreme metal. At the center, near the top, is a pentagram. The sound of the band is eerie and intense and fairly derivative. They find their voice as a death metal band, a style of music that’s popular in Florida and Sweden, defined by low, growling vocals and dissonant melodies that require a substantial amount of technical proficiency. Even without vocals, “Snowfall” shows the potential of the genre, winding through its movements like a compact showcase of the chemistry that would define Nocturno and Fenriz’s music together, conjuring images of barren landscapes and wind through shaking branches. They sound serious because they are serious. Upon completing the recording, Fenriz drops out of high school to devote himself to music, as if he had been simply waiting for the right song to convince him. Off the strength of their demo, Darkthrone start attracting attention. They accept a deal with an English label called Peaceville—because they want to share a label with their favorite death metal band, Autopsy—and set off to record their debut full-length at Stockholm’s Sunlight Studio—because they want it to sound like their favorite death metal album, Entombed’s Left Hand Path, which was recorded there. The album they make, 1991’s Soulside Journey, is a thrilling if uneven record. As soon as they’re finished with it, they start recording a more ambitious sophomore album, which they plan to call Goatlord. The music on Soulside Journey is gaining traction—far more than any other metal out of Norway at the time—but the band is changing their interests. “We hate that LP. It’s a silly, trendy death metal record,” Fenriz says in one of the few interviews he granted during the band’s early days. “Our first album is called A Blaze in the Northern Sky and it’s out before ’92. It’s gonna be one of the most evil and darkened albums ever! You’re all gonna hate it!” This is the moment when Darkthrone decide to become a black metal band. Where death metal is a labyrinth littered with quicksand pits that suck you under, black metal is an icy wind that pulls you heavenward. Death metal sounds like the plumbing of some hollowed-out lurching machinery; black metal is sheets of glass fed through a wood chipper. Death metal bands sound like they practice; black metal is a ritual. Death metal riffs are burbling and low; black metal riffs are played on the highest strings, quickly like staccato notes during the tensest part of a slasher film. If you squint, it’s kind of beautiful. It’s difficult to pinpoint what exactly changed between Soulside Journey and A Blaze in the Northern Sky, pushing Darkthrone to embrace black metal completely. They downgraded their gear and sanded their riffs down into simpler, gnarlier shapes. And unlike Soulside Journey, A Blaze in the Northern Sky was recorded close to home, in a studio in the back of a shopping mall in Kolboton, Norway. Half of its songs were revised ideas from their death metal days (“Paragon Belial,” “A Blaze in the Northern Sky,” “The Pagan Winter”), while the stronger half comprised brand new compositions in the black metal style (“Kathaarian Life Code,” “In the Shadow of the Horns,” “Where Cold Winds Blow”). The album’s wide range of material makes it all the more compelling. Fenriz’s drumming is simplified and sharpened—no more rolling toms, no jazzy flourishes. He recorded all his drum and a few vocal parts (some gurgled incantations, a shoutout to his bandmate in the second track) in just a few days and then passed out drunk while Nocturno did his vocals in a room filled with black candles. According to at least one report, they wore corpse paint while recording. While A Blaze in the Northern Sky lacks the intensity of its follow-ups—the masterful Under a Funeral Moon and the snowed-out hypnosis of Transilvanian Hunger—it is no less of a revelation. At this point, Darkthrone sounds less like their eventual peers—Mayhem, Burzum, Emperor—and more like a nightmarish collage of all the things they love. There are old-school riffs, gurgling spoken-word interludes, noisy solos that grind up against the infernal blast beats in a kind of sonic battlefield. “In the Shadow of the Horns,” their single greatest song, is replete with a devilish sound effect—created by Fenriz stuffing a cowbell with toilet paper—and a guitar part that sounds like Motörhead speeding down the side of a cliff on a motorcycle falling apart. Their brand of black metal had yet to be codified; on A Blaze in the Northern Sky, it is merely a feeling. Peaceville had no idea what to do with it. It’s late 1991, death metal had never been more popular, and these abstract blasts of noise might not appeal to the growing audience that was still just discovering Soulside Journey. The label suggested a remix; the band threatened to leave. The label conceded. Before the album was released, Peaceville included “In the Shadow of the Horns” on a sampler titled Vile Vibes II. Among songs by contemporary death metal bands like Impaler and Baphomet, Darkthrone sounded even more alien. Rob Curry, aka Death Dealer of the Australian metal band Vomitor, tells a story of hearing the tape on a tour bus and listening to Darkthrone’s song on repeat for the entire four-hour ride. This would be Darkthrone’s initial legacy: a well-kept secret among touring bands, zines, and extreme metal enthusiasts. In the United States and Europe, black metal wouldn’t make the rounds until later in the decade when gruesome circumstances brought it to people’s attention. A scene had situated around a Norwegian record store called Helvete, founded by Euronymous, the guitarist of Mayhem. Frequented by members of all the notable black metal bands, it became a toxic social circle where the tenets of white nationalism and Nazism spread, largely due to the increasingly radicalized Varg Vikernes of the one-man band Burzum. In 1993, after spearheading a series of church burnings in Norway, he murders Euronymous, goes to jail, and becomes a dark figurehead for metal’s most hateful tendencies. In the liner notes, Darkthrone dedicate A Blaze in the Northern Sky to Euronymous, “The king of black/death metal underground.” The scene was splintering. Nilson and Nocturno move deep into the wilderness, due to a growing disillusionment with what they describe, somewhat diplomatically, as a boys club. As the decade wears on, Fenriz’s rhetoric begins sounding a good deal like Varg’s, using the word “Aryan” to promote his music and “Jewish” as a pejorative. In 1994, Peaceville refuse to promote Darkthrone’s latest album and their relationship with the label—which they once dreamed of being on—ends unceremoniously. In a famous Kerrang! article that helped bring black metal to American audiences, Cronos, frontman of Venom, distanced himself from the Norwegian black metal movement that cited him as a primary influence. “When you talk about Satanism relating to Venom, it’s about worshipping yourself, giving yourself freedom of choice of love and hate, good and evil,” he explained. “It’s not about being beholden to a deity. It’s about being the best you can be. All of this is very sad.” By the turn of the century, Fenriz found himself creatively stagnant, falling into depression and isolation. If the story ended there, Darkthrone’s first decade of music might feel like an artifact of a troubled time and place. But eventually, they found their voice again, reborn as a duo of just Fenriz and Nocturno. After taking a defensive stance through the ’90s, Fenriz eventually apologized and disowned his behavior both in his words and his actions throughout the 2000s. He tore down the mystery and antagonism that once defined him and the second wave of black metal he ushered in. He granted every interview requested of him and used his platform to spread the word for good new bands. In the liner notes of a career retrospective box set Black Death and Beyond, he acknowledged his regret over the language he used in the ’90s. “There is no excuse,” he wrote. Nocturno still lives in the woods and has a day job teaching; Fenriz works in the postal industry and exhibits his passion for Norway’s wilderness by taking long hikes, going on camping trips and, briefly, holding local office. The 2010s have been among their most consistent decades, touching on all the subgenres of metal they hold dear, with the notable exception of black metal. Some fans aren’t into it. Darkthrone accepts that. “We change as all on this planet changes,” Fenriz explained. “In a natural way.” When you listen to A Blaze in the Northern Sky, it’s impossible to ignore all the violence that followed. But deep in its foggy, impressionist landscape, you can also hear the excitement, the inspiration. You can see kids in corpse paint in a recording studio in the back of a shopping mall crowded around the speakers playing a Black Sabbath album for reference as they try to bring a vision to life. You can imagine misfits traveling in vans dreaming about where on earth this sound was coming from. And you can envision a lonely kid somewhere with an entire world opening from the speakers, who might bask in its silence after the record ends, look out the window and see something bright and strange and burning somewhere far away.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

Spirit Counsel,Thurston Moore,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d824de8d5d1da00099a8e47/1:1/w_160/spiritcounsel_thurston.jpg,2019-09-21 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/thurston-moore-spirit-counsel/, Daydream Library Series ,"For 40 years now, Thurston Moore has maintained dual citizenship in the worlds of rock and the avant-garde. But where he spent his three decades in Sonic Youth straddling the line between those discrete realms, he’s spent much of his solo career jumping from one side to the other. For every tuneful acoustic collection he’s issued under his own name and every searing set of guitar jams he’s kicked out with his Thurston Moore Group, there are literally over a hundred small-run micro-label releases and one-off collaborations where Moore has indulged his unabating loves of improvised noise, free jazz, spoken-word poetry, and black metal without interfering with his official indie-rock discography. By contrast, Moore’s songs in recent years have hewed more conventionally classic rock, while his sideline pursuits have turned more extreme. But even though Moore is following up his most straight-up rockin’ album to date—2017’s Rock n Roll Consciousness—with a three-disc box set consisting of three mammoth instrumental movements that collectively run for over two and a half hours, he’s using the opportunity to build a bridge across the avant/rock divide instead of a wall. Even with its imposing length, Spirit Counsel is arguably the most accessible entry point into Moore’s boundless experimental canon. The three works that comprise Spirit Counsel showcase vastly different methodologies, but each pays impressionistic tribute to influential figures in his life and art. The first, “Alice Moki Jayne,” is named for spiritual-jazz master Alice Coltrane, Swedish visual artist/musician Moki Cherry, and political poet Jayne Cortez, three women who, perhaps not coincidentally, established singular artistic identities outside the long shadows cast by their famous husbands (John Coltrane, Don Cherry, and Ornette Coleman, respectively). But unlike Moore’s more explicit tributes to the female avant-guardians of yore, “Alice Moki Jayne” channels their radical spirit implicitly into a work that’s perpetually reaching for a higher level of consciousness while embodying the struggle to achieve it amid the disorder and distractions of modern life. “Alice Moki Jayne” is a rarity among Moore’s improvised releases, in that its personnel—namely, guitarist James Sedwards and My Bloody Valentine bassist Deb Googe—overlaps with his regular rock-band formation, and it feels like an extension of sounds and themes mined on Rock n Roll Consciousness. Here, we’re treated to a supersized version of the Thurston Moore Group with third guitarist Jen Chochinov and electronics wizard Jon Liedecker, a.k.a. Matmos/Negativland associate Wobbly, while the band’s usual drummer, Steve Shelley, is replaced by Róisín Murphy’s touring drummer Jem Doulton. But where it’s not uncommon for Thurston Moore Group to zone out past the 10-minute mark, here he employs his players in service of a monumental work that feels like nothing less than the eternal psychic tug-of-war between hope and despair rendered as a 63-minute, 12-string guitour de force. Following a few minutes of ominous, cymbal-washed ambient haze, “Alice Moki Jayne” starts to take shape through a shimmering refrain that provides a distant echo of Pink Floyd’s “Shine on You Crazy Diamond” in both its repeated four-note melody and willingness to let it slowly evaporate into the late-night air for a seeming eternity. But from there, the work acquires a step-like structure, answering its psych-rock ascensions with meditative plateaus. One-third of the way in, after a steady build, the group locks into a hypnotic, warmly lit melody and lingers on it for several minutes, providing the track with the closest thing it has to a chorus. But half an hour later, the tension between the group’s rock formalism and lawless exploration has turned to all-out war: following a free-form, drum-less passage of flatulent guitar spasms and electronic indigestion, the group drops some truly startling blasts of distortion that trigger a heavy-metal meltdown. All of which is to say, “Alice Moki Jayne” demands a lot of your time, and rewards your patience handsomely. Spirit Counsel’s second work is as intimate as its predecessor is expansive, with a relatively lean 29-minute runtime. “8 Spring Street” is named for the former address of Moore’s mentor and spirit guide into avant-underworld, the composer Glenn Branca. As the missing link between punk rock and Steve Reich, Branca’s densely layered guitar symphonies were foundational to the Sonic Youth sound. But instead of paying overt tribute to his late friend by attempting to replicate Branca’s heart-racing grandeur, “8 Spring Street” is a solo guitar piece that’s seemingly more interested in recapturing their moments of personal and musical connection in that SoHo apartment. As Moore recently revealed, when hanging at Branca’s apartment, the two “would listen to the rotary fan in his window in the summertime. We would listen to the overtones, and he would say, ‘that’s what we need to sound like.” Tellingly, Moore spends much of “8 Spring Street” furiously strumming and jabbing at his instrument, conjuring the choppy rhythm and blurring motion of fan blades cutting through air—though when he activates the distortion pedal around eight minutes in, the effect is more like exploding warplanes crashing into an ocean. But “8 Spring Street” navigates its way through periodic stormy sections to arrive at a transfixing ambient-drone conclusion that functions not only as a somber farewell to a transformative figure in Moore’s life, but also a fading memory of a bohemian Manhattan that no longer exists. If “8 Spring Street” finds Moore communing with his past, and “Alice Moki Jayne” showcases his band at full strength in the present, then Spirit Counsel’s final act points to his possible future. Recorded at London’s Barbican theater in April 2018, “Galaxies (Sky)” finds Moore leading an ensemble of 12 players on 12-string guitars for a cosmically themed composition inspired by a Sun Ra poem. The roster includes, among others, some familiar faces (Googe, Sedwards), old friends (Susan Stenger of Band of Susans, Alex Ward of N.E.W.), more recent road-mates (Rachel Aggs of Shopping/Sacred Paws, Jonah Falco of Fucked Up), the esteemed musicologist David Toop, and, perhaps most improbably, singer/songwriter James McCartney (son of you-know-who). Clocking in at 55 minutes, “Galaxies (Sky)” is the most demanding of Spirit Counsel’s pieces, and the one positioned furthest away from Moore’s rock vernacular. Prior to the performance, Moore admitted that he had never met some of the players before; as such, he gives his charges a little extra time to get to know each other in an extended opening free-for-all where the guitars plink and plonk like mangled kalimbas, purr like a sleeping wildebeests, and clang like cast-iron wind chimes. But at the 11:30 mark, all those random noises coalesce into an ecstatic, 144-stringed drone that clears a path for a vibrant, “Street Hassle”-style pulse to take hold. Compared to the more sectional construction of “Alice Moki Jayne,“ “Galaxies (Sky)” evolves through a more fluid, organic process, where the subtlest changes eventually have profound effects on the course of the piece. Over its second half, the psychedelic, trance-inducing qualities gradually give way to doomy dissonance, reaching particularly nauseous extremes around the 37th minute. But fitting for a release intended to coincide with International Peace Day (Sept. 21), Moore steers his troupe toward a calming come-down, harnessing the squall into a hypnotic feedback hum with lion-tamer poise. And, in the piece’s dying moments, all the guitars start ringing out like a thousand alarm clocks going off at once, a finale that feels less like self-implosion than a celebration—as if the seated players were giving themselves a string-strangled standing ovation. As the full-circle conclusion to a box set that mirrors Moore’s personal journey from avant-garde acolyte to rock-band ringleader and back again, “Galaxies (Sky)” reaffirms that, after all these years, he’s still traveling down the expressway to yr skull—it’s just expanded to a 12-lane superhighway.

The Return,Sampa the Great,by: Marcus J. Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d4d927497e3c8000869ef3c/1:1/w_160/sampathegreat_thereturn.jpg,2019-09-21 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sampa-the-great-the-return/,Ninja Tune,"Near the beginning of Sampa The Great’s debut album The Return, we hear a voicemail from a concerned friend. She implores the rapper to realize what she’s up against as a black woman in the music industry: “I don’t think you have time for all this ‘finding yourself’ spiritual shit.” But that’s just what The Return is about. Sampa—who was born in Zambia, raised in Botswana, and now lives in Melbourne—is trying to find a sense of place in a world where she’ll always be ticked as “other.” Accordingly, The Return is a dense and sometimes-challenging record, with beats that pull in bits of jazz alongside ’90s R&B and hip-hop. When taken together with her darting, head-cold flow, the album can be intimidating, but the arduous journey it traces is one toward peace. Running 78 minutes, The Return is a dynamic suite of a record, touching on multiple genres without losing focus. The sprawling sounds mirror her thoughts—racing, fully formed, everywhere at once. It requires a patient ear, and as it backflips from brassy dance tracks to languid soul, The Return occasionally feels like it’s beating you over the head.  But that’s also part of its charm: this is a record about the uncertainty lurking behind every major decision, the doubts that persist even as you tell yourself you're making the right choices. On “OMG,” Sampa interrogates the idea of ""home"" through the lens of her African upbringing; in her view, African natives should return to re-teach local language, culture and spirituality. With each interlude, the record shifts to a different mood—from uncertainty, to romantic love, to eventual reassurance. As the album plays, Sampa comes to understand that her contentment isn’t tied to geography. “I guess I found my fortune,” Sampa declares on “Mwana,” The Return’s opening track. “I don’t need home to feel important.” Then on “Dare to Fly,” the rapper doubles down on this epiphany: “Home is my home is my self … I will reside in myself.” The moment is as triumphant as it is poignant. Sampa’s 2017 mixtape, Birds and the BEE9, won the Australian Music Prize for Best Album, but it barely made a ripple in the U.S. It dropped in November, two weeks before Thanksgiving, right when music publications start thinking about end-of-year album lists, which might have accounted for the apathy. But she has the slow-burn intensity of someone who takes the long view. On “Final Form,” the album’s most pointed cut, Sampa quips, “only four years, fantastic,” reminding us that she’s only been rapping professionally for a short time and still has a ways to go. If her thousand-yard-stare determination on The Return is any indication, her journey is only beginning.

Of the Sun,Trupa Trupa,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d7a8ce453e80c0008f43a3e/1:1/w_160/trupa_ofthesun.jpg,2019-09-21 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/trupa-trupa-of-the-sun/,GlitterbeatLovittMoorworks,"Like any politically aware artist making music today, Polish indie rockers Trupa Trupa are particularly attuned to the tenor of our times. They understand that to be alive in 2019 is to perpetually grapple with two strongly oppositional states of being: paralyzing misery over looming ecological and social collapse, and whatever emotion it is—some might call it hope—that motivates us to get out of bed every morning, text birthday greetings to friends, sort our recyclables from our compostibles, and publicly shame fascists on the internet. The band’s fourth album, Of the Sun, doesn’t so much directly address the state of the world as vividly conjure the day-to-day sensation of existing within it, forever teetering on the tightrope walk between luminous ugliness and awful bliss. Of the Sun’s roiling energy is actually the product of fine-tuning and focus. On prior releases, Trupa Trupa were eager to embark on extended flights of psychedelic fancy or let their slack-rock jams messily unspool. But like juvenile delinquents shipped off to boot camp, they emerge on Of the Sun flexing a more militaristic muscle, their wandering experimentalism harnessed into a potent fusion of lurching post-hardcore and shimmering shoegaze. Trupa Trupa hail from Gdańsk, the Baltic seaside city that was the site of dramatic changes in the 20th century—namely, the first battle of World War II and the rise of Lech Walesa’s Solidarity labor-union movement in 1980. Earlier this year, the city was in the headlines again, when its progressive mayor, Paweł Adamowicz, was stabbed to death at a public event. This cycle reverberates through Of the Sun, as the band attempts to chart a steady course through the turbulence of history, its newly fortified sound serving as protective armor. Singer/guitarist (and poet) Grzegorz Kwiatkowski has stripped all the fat off his lyrics, reducing his words to staccato sloganeering that’s as brutally minimal as Wojciech Juchniewicz’s basslines. He’s especially fond of riffing on variations of a word in a kind of verbal improv (e.g., “Anyhow/Anywhere/Nowhere man/Nowhere land/No one/Nowhere”), but his surrealist soundbites can be as evocative as they are enigmatic. On the Goo-slathered standout “Remainder,” he turns a simple repeated refrain—“Well it did not take place! It did not take place!”—into a taunting critique of Holocaust deniers; the dub-punk wobble “Long Time Ago” centers on a line—“Long time ago! No one! No way!”—that obliquely echoes the old saw about what happens to those who cannot remember the past. Trupa Trupa’s trudging, Slintian drum beats, bass-battered grooves, and agitated lyrics mirror the gruelling rhythms of the modern world, and at times, this slow burn of a record begs for more moments of unbridled catharsis like the Wire-y blitz “Turn.” But Kwiatkowski frequently couches his communiques inside alluring, psychedelic melodies that lift you out of the morass. On “Satellite,” images of technological collapse are delivered with a Syd Barrett smirk, while the psych-pop stomp of “Longing” mainlines the hazy-headed rush of the first Stone Roses album. More than just revel in the tension between medium and message, Trupa Trupa are the rare dystopian post-punk band to embrace optimism and levity as necessary survival mechanisms. Amid the ominous predatory prowl of “Dream About,” Kwiatkowski’s exultant chorus cuts through the grey skies like a sunbeam. “I dream about!/I dream about! I dream about!” he repeats with trembling glee, before the song is overtaken by stormy distortion. We never find out what exactly he’s dreaming about, but that’s not the point: Trupa Trupa may not have the perfect prescription for a better world, but they welcome you to imagine one together.

Jaime,Brittany Howard,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d6e936a6136e40008cfb1bc/1:1/w_160/brittanyhoward_jaime.jpg,2019-09-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/brittany-howard-jaime/,ATO,"Brittany Howard tends to get a little restless when things get too comfortable. Just when she and her band Alabama Shakes were branded as innocuous roots-rock revivalists after their 2012 debut, Boys & Girls, she started pushing their retro-soul sound to its outer reaches and beyond. Sound & Color, from 2015, sprawled out into blues and funk and psychedelia, and won three Grammys doing it. Amid the Shakes’ growing popularity, Howard deviated from the course. In 2018, emotionally spent, she called a meeting of her Shakes bandmates to announce that she’d be stepping away for a bit after a spell of writer’s block; she didn’t know what she’d be doing next, but she’d be doing it on her own. In retreating from Alabama Shakes, Brittany Howard found herself on a voyage of self-discovery. From that process comes her solo debut, Jaime, which is full of that same restless energy. Unlike her work with her bands—including the amped-up rock group Thunderbitch and the alt-country outfit Bermuda Triangle—it speaks solely to the life she’s led, the love and hatred she’s faced, and the way they’ve shaped her worldview. Jaime is a daring turn in just about every way imaginable: bolder, freakier, riskier, more experimental, not just deeply personal but cuttingly political, sometimes quietly tender, sometimes brutally direct. Working in a greenhouse in Topanga Canyon, she mined her complicated personal history, first writing out a memoir of her life up until the founding of Alabama Shakes, then transposing it to songwriting. Howard has said that she needed to be in full control to make this record, and it’s easy to see why: It is the kind of soul-baring opus that first requires soul-searching. The album is named after Howard’s sister, who died at 13 after being diagnosed with a rare form of eye cancer. It was Jaime who first taught Brittany to write a song, and now she’s writing her most unyielding and vulnerable ones, songs about coming to terms with personal identity, guarded secrets, spiritual and social and sexual awakenings, deep-rooted family traumas. Though Howard feels united with her sister’s spirit, the album isn’t about Jaime. Instead, it is a boundless study of inner character, someone so used to speaking for others—the Shakes as a unit, the struggling masses on songs like “Hold On”—finally taking the opportunity to speak for herself. Jaime is the sound of Howard coming up for air, getting to know herself better, coming to terms with her place in the world, and then proudly standing in that truth. The songs may be rooted in the same vintage soul that powers Alabama Shakes, but they reach for greater heights and greater depths: convention-defying funkadelia, throwback rap breakbeats, streaking synth-rock, the tense jazz behind D’Angelo’s Black Messiah, the eclectic vocal power of Prince. As Howard breaks all the rules, some songs super busy, others bare, she finds her way home. The mastery of Jaime is balancing the beauty of Southern identity and culture with what Howard has referred to as “all the ugly things about the past,” both personally and historically. Howard is a queer, mixed-race woman, born to a black father and white mother in the same city as the founder of neo-Nazi message board Stormfront and a former Grand Wizard in the Klan. It’d be easiest to condemn the place itself outright, but it’s still her home. The saying goes: “Those who don’t know history are doomed to repeat it,” and on “History Repeats,” she echoes that sentiment: “We defeat ourselves.” In studying her own past, she finds reasons to keep fighting for change. “I am dedicated to oppose those whose will is to divide us and who are determined to keep us in the dark ages of fear,” Howard chants on “13th Century Metal,” amid a cacophonous, white-knuckle, one-take jam session. The song is full of positive affirmations, and though she reveals herself to be as weary as the rest of us, she won’t stop: “I don’t know about you/But I’m tired of this bullshit/And I wanna try/To do the best that I can.” Amid the noise and chaos, Howard shows that love can be the most radical tool of resistance. Even the love songs on Jaime feel like powerful political acts; not just because they revolve around queer love, but because it feels defiant to choose to love and be loved when you’re surrounded by hate. The sweetly skittish “Georgia,” sung with a flushed breathlessness, is written from the perspective of a young girl with a harmless crush on an older girl. The bluesy “Stay High” is about wanting to live in a single moment with a lover forever; the minimalist “Short and Sweet” is about knowing that time is finite, and savoring it. On the former, she lets her voice drift weightlessly skyward; on the latter, her words flit between acoustic strums, like the wick of a candle in an evening breeze. The only thing centering this album is Howard’s remarkable voice, a miraculous instrument of subtlety and power. Howard uses this versatility to ask: Why is all this hate and bigotry still happening? The fidgety piano-masher “Goat Head” poses rhetorical questions about a hate crime committed against her father when she was a baby. The story, later recounted to Howard by her mother, lifted the veil on a childhood filled with racism. The song is an unflinching vignette illustrating life as a mixed family among an unforgiving community. “My mama was brave/To take me outside/’Cause mama is white/And daddy is black/When I first got made/Guess I made these folks mad,” she howls. Many of those “folks” that were mad then are still mad today, and “Tomorrow” wonders aloud what must happen to enact change now: “We always talk about tomorrow/But now that we’re here/Without lifting a finger/How do you feel?” Her writing is always collected, naked in the way it presents the truth. Howard wrote and composed all of the music on Jaime, which manages to sound both far-reaching and solitary. She played all the assorted, mesmerizing guitar parts, and enlisted Shakes bassist Zac Cockrell, jazz pianist extraordinaire Robert Glasper, keyboardist Dan Horton, and drummer Nate Smith to play sessions with her. With these highly capable ringers driving the arrangements, Howard pushes the boundaries of sound and space in search of fulfillment and decency. In a world that requires so much fixing, the music works effortlessly. Armed with a deeper understanding of self, Jaime becomes her gospel of empathy. “I promise…to be wary of who I give my energy to. Because it is needed for a greater cause,” she vows on “13th Century Metal.” “And that cause is to spread the enlightenment of love, compassion, and humanity to those who are not touched by its light.” (Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)","The exceptional solo debut from the Alabama Shakes singer-songwriter is a thrilling opus that pushes the boundaries of voice, sound, and soul to new extremes.

Ghostface Killahs,Ghostface Killah,by: Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d768d5c2073fe00084eb230/1:1/w_160/ghostface_killahs.jpg,2019-09-20 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ghostface-killah-ghostface-killahs/,Music Generation Corp.,"After the high-water mark of 2006’s Fishscale, Ghostface Killah embarked on a series of intriguing collaborations with producers like Adrian Younge and BadBadNotGood. Receding into the middle distance of his own music, he offered solid verses that served as backdrop for a more free-flowing, live-band sound. It seemed, perhaps, that Ghost might be reverting to an older definition of MC in his middle age, turning from a microphone controller into a master of ceremonies. But on his new album, Ghostface Killahs, he strains to recapture the old Wu vibe, with limited success. It’s a brisk listen with plenty of strong tracks. “Me Denny & Darryl” features huge verses from Ghostface and a laid-back Method Man, who grants the song its title and whose verse is filled with vintage quotables. Ghostface does him one better on the second verse of “Flex,” jumping from a loving description of Wallabees with an Air Max bubble to “Fish tank so big even the babies can swim in/Rockin’ the toddler, four finger lacin’, ridiculous gems in ’em/Benjamins stuck together like boxes of Entenmann’s.” This is Ghost at his most undeniable, breathing new life into tired Wu-Tang tropes. On Ghostface Killahs he’s emerged from the fugue in which he’s seemed lost for so much of this decade; his energy is up. On “New World,” the producer Danny Caiazzo isolates the bassline from Aaron Neville’s “Hercules” (a favorite used to memorable effect by Action Bronson, Biz Markie, and UGK, among others) to give Ghost a vehicle. The rapper plays tour guide through bus windows to a world as ugly as ever, one where red meat makes people crazy and the police are murdering black people. It’s a great example of what late period Ghostface could be, a ringmaster bringing experience where youthful passion once raged. Were the album filled with songs like these, it’d be a minor revival, but Ghostface Killahs is marred by too many tracks that are either curdled by casual cruelty or just tired retreads. The sheer number and intensity of the gay slurs is indefensible, reaching its peak on “Pistol Smoke,” a barely-there beat with no imagination leaving Ghost spewing vitriol at effeminate enemies. The song, with a snarled hook by the Wu-Tang affiliate Solomon Childs, appears to be trying to approximate the menace of classic M.O.P. It doesn’t have half the energy or a quarter of the inspiration. And while the beats here are generally competent, they are beige imitations of the production granted to Ghostface over his career from some of the best producers in rap history. Not that Ghostface Killah needs inspiration or a Rushmore of beatmakers to sell records. The new album, which was released on the rapper’s website a week before it hit streaming platforms, shot to No. 2 on the iTunes charts upon its broad release, behind only Post Malone. That’s not Billboard, of course, but it shows that the rapper still has a dedicated audience, to whom the quality of the new music might be less important than their ongoing loyalty. Which is to say, if Ghost is to recover, he’ll be doing it for himself.

Means to Me,Long Beard,by: Abby Jones,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d791b5f53e80c0008f439be/1:1/w_160/meanstome_longbeard.jpg,2019-09-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/long-beard-means-to-me/,Double Double Whammy,"Leslie Bear’s second album as Long Beard is a narrative of home, albeit a nebulous one; across the 10 songs on Means to Me, the New Jersey dream-pop musician never refers to her town by name. She doesn’t illustrate tree-lined streets, or her favorite hangout spots, or the house she grew up in. The only landmark she cites is the local CVS, outside which she had her first kiss. On paper, this could be a record about any ordinary American suburb. The four years since Bear’s debut, Sleepwalker, have taken her all around the country: She quit her corporate job and toured with Japanese Breakfast before returning to her native New Brunswick to earn a computer science degree at Rutgers. She’s not referencing home as a place, but rather home as a feeling—or a lack thereof. Bear isn’t as concerned about winding up in New Brunswick again as she is about the disorientation caused by her time away. She’s grappling with the bittersweet nostalgia and alienation of migrating in reverse. Although the geographical setting of Means to Me is ambiguous, the closeness Bear conveys makes it entirely personal. Like her contemporaries Hatchie and Jay Som, Long Beard builds her music from wistful vocals and jangly guitars. On Sleepwalker, the dreamy effects often reverberated to the point of oblivion. Means to Me finds more stable footing: Bear’s enunciations are clearer, her instrumentation more active and forward-moving. Highlights like “Getting By,” “Sweetheart,” and the title track are tethered by steady percussion while still maintaining her celestial, atmospheric aura. The lucidity makes Bear’s anecdotes easier to grasp: Her high school sweetheart is now married, and as she resettles in this anonymous town, she finds her surroundings plagued with reminders of a love that dissipated a decade ago. Means to Me can feel one-dimensional, so preoccupied with the opinions of others—people whom Bear’s narrator hasn’t seen in years—that there’s hardly any room for catharsis or self-reflection. “Aren’t you better off without me rooted in your town?” she echoes on “Snow Globe.” “Still hoping you would talk to me/Through the colder months of fall/But you never called,” goes opener “Countless.” “I don’t know why I come/Just to see if you’ll have me,” she wonders in “Monarch.” Depleted, she likens her heart to an “empty bottle.” She writes about feelings of uncertainty and rejection but rarely goes deeper, offering little insight to her own growth and never explaining why she returned home in the first place. But in its layered textures and unguarded lyricism, Means to Me testifies to Bear’s upward trajectory as a writer and musician. Though she doesn’t give much clarity to her intentions, her emotions are transparent. She’s endured the kind of upheaval that could easily distort someone’s identity, yet hers is surprisingly apparent as she recalls these lovelorn memories. Patiently channeling pain and turmoil into airy, gorgeous dream-pop, she makes a nameless location—somewhere that might be almost anywhere—feel intimate and particular.

Home Made Satan,Chastity,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d2c8f117953c00009b97ae0/1:1/w_160/homemadesatan_chastity.jpg,2019-09-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/chastity-home-made-satan/,Dine AloneCaptured Tracks,"A Chastity lyrics bot would get banned from Twitter in about 15 minutes. “If you want to show the world love, kill a cop,” Brandon Williams smirks on “I Still Feel the Same,” pausing in the middle of that thought for just a moment so it sorta sounds like a joke. You know, he’s just kidding...unless you’re gonna do it. Cops are at the top of Williams’ very explicit and lengthy hit list on Home Made Satan, along with the military, Andrew Scheer, Justin Trudeau, Donald Trump, the Christian right, #notallmen apologists, the Ku Klux Klan, and bankers. Oh, and there’s a “special place in hell” for his conservative-voting parents. If Chastity sounded like metal or made hip-hop, Home Made Satan might be under government investigation. But he comes off as something a lot more unnerving to right-wingers: a violent radical hiding in plain sight, posing as a suburban centrist. “You call me commie like it’s a bad thing,” Williams shouts over music that recalls a cash-flush period of alt-rock that wasn’t opposed to much of anything—the gains of Kurt Cobain’s pyrrhic revolution sustained by Dave Grohl’s pragmatic centrism. The guitars are technically distorted, but they feel as clean and gleaming as a beam of pure sunlight off stainless steel. Even when Williams is shouting, his voice projects upward like he’s in a reclined position, not yelling at you. Though a loud, androgenic form of pop, it’s pop all the same, and on 2018’s Death Lust he sounded a bit spooked by his proximity to it, hinting at big hooks and roaring crowds just off screen. In most cases, it would be a slight to liken anything to Foo Fighters ca. There Is Nothing Left to Lose, but in the case of lead single “Sun Poisoning,” it’s Chastity fulfilling its potential. But while Williams embraces a violent populism in opposition to the “austerity in my country,” Chastity tends to lack the follow-through or commitment for decisive actions. “Sun Poisoning” has the windup of an alt-rock smash but not the delivery, squandering its biggest chorus on the album’s most inscrutable lyric (“Can’t you see how easily my teeth bleed?”). Conversely, “The Girls I Know Don’t Think So” and “Anxiety” can’t quite land a melody to equal the punch of their concepts. Home Made Satan is an even leaner record than the half-hour Death Lust—10 songs clocking in at 27 minutes—but discards hooks instead of bridges, verses, and other superfluous appendages of longer songs. “Spirit Meet Up” is a welcome blast of aggro post-hardcore amidst the otherwise-staid tempos, before swerving into a wheel-spinning grunge riff; “Bliss” mirrors Williams’ fruitless search for anything greater than a momentary joy. The songs that hit the most squarely are the ones where Williams is alone, turning his hatred inward when there’s no easy target where it can be directed. “I stay home/I make sure I’m not going to hell/I hear their pleasure, I wish them well,” Williams sighs on “Last Year’s Lust,” not wanting to die but not really stoked on living. Home Made Satan arrives quickly on the heels of the well-received Death Lust, which countered its suicidal ideation with visions of suburban uprising (“Sadness is the danger of being young/Dreaming of the days still to come”). It’s reasonable to expect Home Made Satan to be the follow-through, the leveling up, but it holds no such interest in rebuilding. “You wave a burning flag, I still feel the same,” Williams sweetly sings towards the album’s end. Perhaps Chastity is interrogating the utility of indie rock as revolutionary art, or just the realism of revolution itself after the past decade of wearying in-fighting and fleeting gains. Either way, he sounds less like a dissident and more like someone sitting this one out.","The Ontario musician slings revolutionary sentiments and blood lust for authority over bittersweet alt-rock.

Giving Birth to Thunder,Indian Summer,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d5174d68bbc27000a66bf35/1:1/w_160/indiansummer_birthtothunder.jpg,2019-09-19 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/indian-summer-giving-birth-to-thunder/,Numero Group,"Indian Summer are a quintessential Numero Group salvage project: Toiling in obscurity, the Oakland band founded a subgenre and produced a small, influential body of work that quickly went out of print. Today their records serve as both stylistic textbooks and collector’s items. But this is the first time the esteemed archival label felt weird about the optics. “Give emo a chance,” they recently tweeted, offering a playlist of formative genre tracks that ends in 1995, the year Cap’n Jazz broke up and months after Indian Summer did the same. Giving Birth to Thunder is Indian Summer in its entirety, but it’s also the essence of an entire era where emo was still strictly post-hardcore, before it started to cross-breed with pop and assume the form that today inspires such reverent nostalgia. Giving Birth to Thunder doesn’t unearth any new gems, as 90% of it already exists as Science 1994—an undisputed classic of second-wave emo, though nearly everything else about that 2002 anthology is up for debate. The versions available on CD and YouTube have completely different track titles than the one frontman Adam Nanaa posted on Bandcamp; those comprise a nine-word poem that inspired this collection’s name. The band was famous for declining to name any of its songs, leaving the business of titles to its fans. Setlists would read like hieroglyphs, with songs designated by guns, planes, and angels; the band members went either uncredited or by their first initials. The idea of an actual full-length was likely anathema to the band, or maybe just an economic impossibility. Indian Summer scraped by moment to moment during their one-year existence; they played approximately 100 shows on wretched tours guided by a tattered copy of Book Your Own Fuckin’ Life, fueled by the minimal amount of fast food and stolen gas to make it to the next gig and whatever else it took to get home and cut the next track before money ran out. And then they’d do it all over again. In the liner notes, Nanaa is upfront about dollars and cents, in terms that seem stark even for 1994—a $50 bass, 30-minute sessions at a $75-per-day studio, $175 monthly rent in Emeryville split among the four members, driving 12 hours to play a gig for $20, making it from Vancouver back to the Bay with only $10 between them. Their stage setup was reliant on duct tape, cinder blocks, and a microcassette playing back a dubbed copy of a Bessie Smith record. Smith’s voice was the binding agent on Science 1994, appearing intermittently throughout the post-hoc collection of the band’s scattered works. It’s tempting to think that Nanaa imagined future crate diggers rescuing his own band’s 7""s—enticed by the cryptic cover and overwhelmed by the pure torment in the voice—the same way he’d plucked the blues LP from an Oakland junkyard. With Indian Summer, the most pretentious explanation is usually the correct one. But not here: Like any number of rap producers around the same time, they simply liked the crackle and spectral presence—they felt it would add color, and that a 70-year old blues recording could do that is a testament to their unrelenting austerity. They wanted, Nanaa writes, to “emulate the nights in Oakland we spent fucked up and passed out with the needle dragging at the end of the LP.” On a prior release of Science 1994, Nanaa made a similar claim, specifying, “the needle dragging on the Slint LP,” which describes a good portion of Giving Birth to Thunder in its meditative moments. It’s metal music in a literal sense—guitars strung with pipe cleaners playing barbed note clusters, splash cymbals covered in tinfoil, the dulled meat-locker reverb of “Orchard.” Traversing the quiet moments of Giving Birth to Thunder is like walking on a polluted beach. It does sound a hell of a lot like Slint, which was probably the point—Indian Summer were deadly serious young men, but also punk rock fanboys, their enterprise guided by entirely by their favorite bands, not authors, not poets, not abstract painters, not philosophical tracts. They nicked as much from Slint and Fugazi as they did from Texaco and Denny’s, seeing how much they could get away with before being caught and discarding anything that didn’t suit an immediate need. The name Indian Summer itself was on loan from a deep cut from the Doors’ Morrison Hotel, though they took nothing else from that band. Nearly their entire identity was derived from Dischord and SST: Nanaa’s pre-Indian Summer band was named Sinker, in tribute to an Ignition 7"", and he coined their last tour “Celebrated Summer” (after the Hüsker Dü song). They had principles, but no politics. “Emotional revolution. Fucking pain,” an old Sinker ad proclaimed. For his Repercussion Records imprint, “Emotional, angry, or pissed music preferred.” The Nanaa brothers and Marc Bianchi aspired to Fugazi’s democratic vocal delegation, but they foreswore call-and-response or even alternating leads; they just all crammed together behind one mic and shouted whenever they saw fit. Even their use of octaves attests to their thrift: It’s the easiest, most economic way to make a riff sound bigger than it really is, leaving no space for thirds or fourths or anything else that would complete an actual triad. But this all worked in favor of a band that prioritized immediacy above all else. There are no builds on Giving Birth to Thunder, no clever transitions. There is nothing medium about Indian Summer. Though Nanaa described Indian Summer as “quiet thunderstorm” on his Bandcamp, their defining moments are like a flash flood—torrential, merciless, and not even remotely beautiful, mowing down everything in its path. Nanaa often reads his lyrics rather than pruning them for melodic contours, and his words are elegant in their violence: People are walking weapons in “mm.,” and “Woolworm,” alternately known as “Angry Son” or “Sleeping,” is not a biblical parable. Nanaa was abandoned by his father and he’s extremely pissed off about it. “When you start screaming ‘I am the angry son,’ it’s hard to read that any other way,” he admits in the liner notes. There’s only one song that isn’t already available on Science 1994, a closing squall titled with three lightning bolts. The liner notes and “propaganda” included in the physical edition are the real draw here, creating context for a band who had a blast making exquisitely bleak music about not having a friend in the world. They were more expansive than their peers Antioch Arrow and Heroin, who were making primordial screamo in “white belt country” (i.e., San Diego ca. 1992), more artful than the punk that their occasional roommate David Hayes was releasing on Lookout!, more experimental than the ascetic Ebullition bands from Goleta. Most notably, Indian Summer struck up a friendship with Cap’n Jazz through Mark Pearsall, a sonic and spiritual guide for the band and Midwest emo ambassador who ran Man With Gun, the imprint that released Shmap’n Shmazz and almost nothing else. The parallels between Cap’n Jazz and Indian Summer are unmistakable: two brothers forming a band to process the trauma of their broken homes (the Kinsellas grew up with an abusive, alcoholic father, the Nanaas’ was an absentee), self-styled weirdo punks that unwittingly defined emo for the rest of the decade and quickly called it quits after touring broke their spirits and friendships. But otherwise, they’re distinct products of their environment: Cap’n Jazz were led by a future college professor and University of Illinois students who would soon discover post-rock, jazz, and Steve Reich. Their music was anxious but approachable and exuberant, well-suited for house parties and basements throughout the Midwest. Conversely, Nanaa was a high-school dropout who ended up in the Bay Area after three days on a Greyhound bus, and Giving Birth to Thunder is shaped by crushing poverty and omnidirectional anger. The offshoots of Cap’n Jazz shaped nearly every form of popular emo for the next 25 years, while the members of Indian Summer mostly played in even more obscure punk bands, with the exception of Bianchi, whose Her Space Holiday was something of an inverse Postal Service at their artistic peak. An instrumental version of 2003’s The Young Machines would’ve been a minor classic in the burgeoning lap-pop subgenre, but Bianchi’s off-key, beyond-TMI lyrics about his sex life and distaste for music critics (occasionally both) were more in line with The Ugly Organ and ...Is a Real Boy at the time. Like most formative bands from emo’s first and second waves—Cap’n Jazz, Moss Icon, Rites of Spring, the Hated, Embrace—their scant output is celebrated for its purity as much as its innovation. Still, Indian Summer’s imprint is unmistakable on the thornier outgrowths of emo; as Nanaa mutters over his band’s tensile anti-grooves, he establishes a template for the literary, conceptual post-hardcore of La Dispute and Defeater. Isolate “mm.” in a petri dish and a Bay Area version of Thursday might sprout—perhaps their late-career highlight “Millimeter” isn’t a direct tribute, but “I Am the Killer” may well be. Brand New shrewdly pointed out Steve Albini’s work on In Utero and Goat as guides for their post-emo pivot on 2009’s Daisy, but that indelible trick on “Vices” that knocked everyone on their collective ass, where a gospel vinyl crumbled under a violent blitz of guitar distortion? Pretty much a verbatim rip of “Aren’t You Angel?” If the intention of Giving Birth to Thunder was to present Indian Summer as something separate from current-day emo, it only proved that the genre is right where they left it.

The Fall of Hobo Johnson,Hobo Johnson,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d77cab32073fe00084eb317/1:1/w_160/HoboJohnson_TheFallOfHoboJohnson.jpg,2019-09-19 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hobo-johnson-the-fall-of-hobo-johnson/,RepriseWarner,"To Hobo Johnson, Earth’s imminent demise won’t be because of climate change or nuclear war. Instead, the apocalypse will arrive the next time a girl he likes doesn’t text him back. Hobo Johnson is the product of a section of a pop culture fandom whose life was changed by a Kid Cudi lyric, went to Warped Tour once, started shopping at Zumiez, and learned about love from 500 Days of Summer. The 24-year-old’s music is a genre-bending mash of spoken-word pop and Lin-Manuel Miranda-style raps, backed by a versatile band called the Lovemakers that play punk, folk, and jazz with the same sexless energy as the group of dads that played your local church fundraiser. But the core of Hobo Johnson’s music is his emotional honesty and an occasional ability to detail his battles with crippling insecurities. This would be relatable and maybe even affecting if his material wasn’t all sourced from jealousy and disappointment at the women that continue to pass up on the good guys like him. Last year, the California-raised Hobo Johnson entered NPR’s Tiny Desk Contest with a live backyard video for a song titled “Peach Scone.” His entry went viral on social media garnering millions of plays in less than a week, but the response to the video was polarizing. A few people reasonably called out his insincere approach to rap. “My name is Hobo Johnson, I’m a rapper/I’m actually not a rapper, I like to say musician,” he raps, while implying falsely that his use of live instruments distances himself from the genre. But the majority of the reactions to Hobo Johnson—born Frank Lopes Jr.—was warm. He was positioned as a hopeless romantic, despite “Peach Scone” being a possessive story about his falling in love with a girl who has a boyfriend only because she was the first person to show him any attention. The track features his teary-eyed emotion and his brand of quirky comedy. He became the latest love of moody teenagers desperate to find music that reciprocated their temperamental and lonely online aesthetic. The Fall of Hobo Johnson is his first album since his viral moment, and it stays true to “Peach Scone”’s unstated goal of making music for guys who are angry that a person they’ve never spoken to doesn’t love them back. Fame hasn’t changed Hobo Johnson’s view on relationships. At all. “Fear the girl who he really thinks is a different species, she’ll rip your heart out,” he says on “Mover Awayer,” justifying her decision to ghost him. His songwriting is mostly composed of ramblings that could double as overly deep black-screen background Instagram stories: “She makes my Mondays feel like Fridays,” and, “Every single guy she’s ever loved to me sounds really fucking dumb.” If you haven’t noticed, Hobo Johnson doesn’t take rejection well. On the surface he does—he fills his ex-crushes’ inboxes with shallow compliments and warm wishes. “I really hope that you find happiness,” he says in the opening line of “Happiness.” Though that’s before he spends the remaining three minutes spiraling, placing the guilt on her for not sharing those feelings through pill-popping and drinking himself to near-death. These emotions don’t connect or make you think of similar times from your own past. Instead, you just feel sorry for him. Aside from his never-ending heartbreak, the other major theme on The Fall of Hobo Johnson is death. It often comes across melodramatic, especially on the cliche and unimaginative “Moonlight,” which features him in the afterlife: “And if I go to hell I will think of you, I will think of you and everything will be OK,” he says moodily. “Sorry, My Dear” is similarly heavy-handed and made unlistenable by scratchy voice-alteration and production that is like if Bon Iver retired the weed for Juul pods. What Hobo Johnson does have going for him is that there’s no artist within the reach of the mainstream consciousness that sounds like him. He laughs, screams, and cries like an open-mic slam poet. But the last thing the music world needs is more “I don’t understand girls” rap that feels it’s above the genre. His goals are mundane: On “I Want a Dog,” he talks about his life goal to be married with a wife, a dog, a house on a hill, and a kid that plays guitar. His approach to relationships would make him the villain of every reality television dating show and the Lovemakers are probably set to be the first band replaced by artificial intelligence. Now Hobo Johnson is left to wait for the next viral moment that keeps his world spinning.

Ma,Devendra Banhart,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d77cd232073fe00084eb31b/1:1/w_160/DevendraBanhart_Ma.jpg,2019-09-19 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/devendra-banhart-ma/,Nonesuch,"At the start of the century, Devendra Banhart emerged as the ecstatic pied piper of an esoteric folk resurgence, a magnetic singer-songwriter who mingled childlike wonder and guru-level insight over glittering fingerpicked guitar. Unapologetically inquisitive and ardent, Banhart’s early works seemed to provide a sort of instruction manual for life. But Banhart soon seemed lost himself, or at least distracted in the search for something more. Since 2005’s discursive Cripple Crow, his records have veered wildly into magpie obsessiveness, recombining genres and criss-crossing borders in search of revelations that didn’t come. In the process, he’s made messes of records, though they’ve always included a few stunning moments, songs like “I Remember” or “Never Seen Such Good Things” that insisted the singular spark of those early works remained. The beguiling Ma—his tenth album and best and most cohesive statement in more than a decade—starts to rekindle it. Approaching 40 and dealing with the death of parents and mentors, Banhart realized in recent years that he may never become a father. Ma, he has said, is his attempt to gather the insight he might pass along to his hypothetical child, lessons he wished he’d learned as an adolescent. The broad prompt gives Banhart a necessary sense of direction but ample leeway to roam, a space to pull together the messy threads of his life. There is jubilation and mourning, existential unease and everyday amusement. He sings in four languages, gliding among English, Portuguese, Japanese, and Spanish, and he shifts smoothly during one three-song stretch from electric country-funk to string-buoyed piano balladry to elegiac finger-picking. This time, the moves make Banhart’s messages feel ecumenical rather than disjointed, hard-won wisdom he’s ready to dole out in any way he can. Banhart steps fully into these songs with a vitality that recalls his beginnings. The songs are arranged and rendered with nuance by a veteran band, as comfortable with synthesizer squall as they are saxophone fantasies. Puckish and tender, Banhart seems again delighted to be here, too. From the opening notes of the smart little “Is This Nice,” where pizzicato strings and loping bass ingeniously invoke the sway of a baby being rocked, he is a singer with renewed purpose. “Is this real? Do I mean it?” he coos in the second verse, in the tone of a nursery rhyme. “I really wanna be here with you.” The lessons flow freely from there. Banhart handles death with gravity and grace, with “Memorial” honoring the complicated feelings that remain after a person is gone. The irrepressible “Kantori Ongaku” reads like a user’s guide for reckoning with a world more complex than the one you might have imagined. During “Carolina,” wrestling with a bout of unrequited love, he is funny and self-effacing, crooning in Portuguese over dreamlike strings that he’d stand a better chance if he actually learned the language of his would-be lover. He touches on the peril of global warming and the paradoxes of globalism, and he admits that it’s OK to have mixed emotions about living in this world at all. “The older I get, the less I fear anyone I see/And yet all the more, I fear humanity,” he sings, condensing the album’s vast emotional topography into a striking couplet. In the last decade-plus, Banhart has seemed so busy searching for a new way to say something old that he’s not managed to say much at all. But Ma is a record rich with takeaways, about how to get by and how to be kind in a social order that tempts us to be indolent and indulgent. It is alternately soft and steely, somber and ebullient, confused and confident—as true to life as “The Body Breaks” and “I Feel Just Like a Child.” “I love you the way I want everyone to know/How very much I love them but never told them so,” he sings during “Will I See You Tonight?,” a wrecking ball of a duet with Vashti Bunyan. It is a complicated confession of failure—a fitting end for an album guided, for the first time in years, by Banhart’s probing vulnerability.

Another lurks in “Grown Folks,” a concerned-but-scolding soul track off his sophomore album Ray Ray, about parents who can’t seem to prioritize their children. And even “Good Man,” from his 2011 retro-R&B album Stone Rollin’, is filled with contempt for the would-be patriarchs that just can’t get it together. He’s walked a fine line between approaching these self-destructive figures—stand-ins for the ruptures and trauma in African-American communities—with empathy and pity. Which is perhaps why his latest album Jimmy Lee feels like a long-held exhalation. Named after his late brother who died of an overdose around the time Saadiq left legendary R&B group Tony! Toni! Toné!, Jimmy Lee is a multi-perspective, multi-genre examination of addiction and family breakdown that pushes Saadiq to his most humanizing work yet. Jimmy Lee is Saadiq’s first solo album since 2011’s Stone Rollin’, but his fingerprints are all over the past few years of Black American culture. “Mighty River,” which he co-wrote with Mary J. Blige for the 2017 film Mudbound, earned the duo an Academy Award Best Original Song nomination. On the small screen, Saadiq has served as composer for HBO’s Insecure since 2016. But his greatest artistic feat since Stone Rollin’ has by far been serving as executive producer of Solange’s 2016 album A Seat at the Table. Working with artists like Solange (and Kendrick Lamar, who also features on Jimmy) seems to have emboldened Saadiq. Both the charging blues song “Kings Fall” and neo-soul groove “I’m Feeling Love” offer sympathetic, heart-rending perspectives on addiction from within the storm, while the Motown-steeped protest song “Rikers Island” brims with an urgency and mourning the artist has usually reserved for love songs. Mid-album cut “My Walk” slides gritty, beating synths beneath his easy blues and soul cadence; it’s his biggest musical departure, and also the album’s most frankly autobiographical track. The R&B legend still stays close to the sounds that raised him, as on the straight-up gospel song “Belongs to God.” But even that inclusion belies an artist more willing to embrace loose ends, disorienting interruptions, and the unknown. On Jimmy Lee, Saadiq shout-sings, whispers, and croons with new abandon. It feels like a refutation of his old reserve, and it also represents a welcome stretch from Saadiq before he takes his sound all the way back to his beginnings: He recently announced that a Tony! Toni! Toné! reunion is in the works.

All My Heroes Are Cornballs,JPEGMAFIA,by: Stephen Kearse,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d77c33d2073fe00084eb2df/1:1/w_160/JPEGMAFIA_AllMyHeroesAreCornballs.jpg,2019-09-18 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jpegmafia-all-my-heroes-are-cornballs/,EQT,"From the DC Universe to the internet writ large, JPEGMAFIA’s heroes span genres and mediums. The producer and rapper’s pantheon is expansive and colorful, a bustling splash page of influences and pop culture totems. While JPEG has never downplayed the prominent roles that anime, video games, and wrestling play in his music, the adrenalized politics of his past projects sometimes obscured that scope. Listening to a song like “I Just Killed a Cop Now I’m Horny,” for instance, the morose Ai Aso sample always felt overshadowed by the flamboyant title and JPEG’s anti-cop lyrics. All My Heroes Are Cornballs adjusts that imbalance by laying bare the sprawling collage in his brain and showcasing how seamlessly it all fits together. The record feels like a public access show on an interdimensional cable channel: unhinged and trippy, but still deeply earnest. All My Heroes is a significant departure from his earlier work. But for as dense as it sounds, there’s a quiet accessibility to how JPEG performs and structures these songs. He adopts gendered terms like thot, slut, and girl, leaning into Peggy, his feminine nickname, and stages a few songs from the perspective of a woman. It’s unclear what they might signify about his own identity, but they further the idea that his fearlessness is his superpower. As a producer, he builds his hyper-syncretic songs around concord rather than contrast. The distorted guitar riff on “Rap Grow Old and Die x No Child Left Behind” acts as a springboard for the vocals and other instruments, converting all the friction into motion. The crackle of a recorded fire on “DOTS FREESTYLE REMIX” fills the spaces between JPEG’s boasts and the cutesy synth tune. He’s adept at making disparate sounds and images cohere without sacrificing texture or invoking an exaggerated sense of audacity. In a year full of nods to diaspora and lineage, his productions are a reminder that even randomness can be personal. Sounds and sequences that would have been codas or flourishes in his past music are allowed to fully blossom, even in passing. “Kenan Vs. Kel” shuffles through keyboard melodies before settling on a riff that morphs into a dusty beat. Then, halfway through, a crunchy power chord shows up and is stretched like sheet metal as it’s hammered with percussion. JPEG raps on both parts, and as busy as that sounds, the shifts are effortless, like swiping between smartphone apps. “Grimy Waifu,” a gun ode with a gorgeous downtempo backbeat, folds in flute spirals and acoustic guitar riffs as JPEG sings in AutoTune of his weapon’s commitment to him. It’s as ridiculous as it is dazzling. Amid all the chaos, his rapping remains his greatest tool. JPEG is an impish writer and an athletic vocalist. He can slither in and out of rhythms and hopscotch through the densest arrangements without losing momentum. Here, he raps in compact spurts, volleys, and streams, his words slurred, stretched, and compressed as he channels his heroes and roasts his enemies. His references are personal and evocative. “BBW” is named after the Beach Boys’ Brian Wilson (JPEG claims to be his black counterpart). On “Post Verified Lifestyle,” he likens himself to DOOM, Beanie Sigel, the Beatles, and 98 Degrees. The first half of “Rap Grow Old and Die x No Child Left Behind” uses Bobby Brown and Michael Jackson to skewer music industry whitewashing in the chorus, and ends its second verse with a shout out to Tom Hardy’s Bane. What’s striking about all these name drops is their constant sense of dimension. JPEG threatening to turn former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon into Steve Hawking on “PRONE!” is incredibly brash and aggro and ableist, yes, but it’s also a sincere expression of rage against a propagator of white nationalism. Similarly, JPEG’s reference to The Dark Knight Rises alludes to the album’s title while conveying his genuine belief in armed revolt against cops. As nerdy and gushing as this album is, it’s no less unabashed about JPEG’s political stances. He may want to be your girl (“Thot Tactics”), but he’s still blasting the alt-right (“Beta Male Strategies”) and incensed by police brutality (“PTSD”). There’s no hierarchy to his touchstones or his tactics; his idols coexist with his ideals. Given the record’s wild song titles and manic energy, it’s tempting to attribute that equivalency to the internet, but JPEG’s fluency feels more tied to his life experiences than his web history. He’s lived across the world and country as an airman, artist, and black man (“I been everywhere around the world and nobody likes niggas,” he once observed). He grew up listening to reggae singer Michael Prophet (“Free the Frail”) and has recorded sincere covers of Carly Rae Jepsen and now TLC (a dissonant cut of “No Scrubs” appears as “BasicBitchTearGas”). “Don’t rely on the strength of my image,” he sings on “Free the Frail.” It feels like a public warning as well as a personal mantra. In balancing the stridence of his politics with the aesthetic overload of his many influences, All My Heroes reintroduces JPEGMAFIA as an imagineer as well as a provocateur. He remains a hellraiser, but also comes across as bubbly and inventive, technicolor and cyberpunk—real anime supervillain shit. In a scattered .txt file titled “thoughts” included with his previous album Veteran, he wrote, “U can never make a type beat for me I’m to [sic] varied.” Back then, the statement rang true mostly for his boisterous, glitchy beat-making. All My Heroes shows that it applies to his full skill set. Get this man a shield.","The experimental rapper remains an impish writer and an athletic vocalist on his latest album, one that lays bare the sprawling collage in his fiery, fascinating brain.

The Time for Peace Is Now,Various Artists,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d77cfca6eee70000829f40b/1:1/w_160/TheTimeForPeaceIsNow.jpg,2019-09-18 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-the-time-for-peace-is-now/,Luaka Bop,"Forget the old canard about paying for your Saturday night sins by attending church on Sunday morning. The post-war explosion of recorded music was fuelled by artists transforming gospel music into earthly, earthy pop. Ray Charles built his carnal 1959 breakthrough hit “What’d I Say” on the call and response of a gospel choir, Little Walter changed “This Train”’s call for salvation into an ode to “My Babe,” Sam Cooke turned testimony into sensual pleading. By the time Aretha Franklin ruled the pop and R&B charts in the late 1960s, the open dialogue between gospel, soul, and pop meant even Paul Simon and Paul McCartney were writing songs that were effectively secular spirituals. The music chronicled on The Time for Peace Is Now, the second volume of Luaka Bop’s World Spirituality Classics series (the first was 2017’s The Ecstatic Music of Alice Coltrane Turiyasangitananda), dates from just after this era, when a mention of Jesus didn’t preclude a single’s appearance on the charts. The Edwin Hawkins Singers blazed this path by taking the jubilant “Oh Happy Day” to No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1969, but the touchstone for much of The Time for Peace Is Now is the Staple Singers. Recording artists since the late 1950s, the Staple Singers became hitmakers once they signed to Stax, the home of deep Southern soul. “Respect Yourself” and “I’ll Take You There” were smash hits in 1971 and 1972, climbing the pop charts by camouflaging their messages of self-betterment and deliverance underneath funky grooves. Each of the lesser-known acts on The Time for Peace Is Now adopts this aesthetic for their own purpose. They may be singing about Jesus, but the message is soft-pedaled within pleas for peace, love, and understanding, and the churchy origins are obscured by an emphasis on groove and feel. Since the artists on The Time for Peace Is Now recorded for tiny regional labels and never received national attention while they were active, the compilation represents larger trends within gospel and soul; these singers weren’t on the vanguard, they were riding a wave. They recorded when local studios and pressing plants were plentiful, as were professional musicians eager to make a quick buck at a session, so they were able to cut tracks that felt complete. Nothing on The Time for Peace Is Now seems like outsider art. There isn’t a household name among these 13 artists, but many of the musicians worked regularly on the gospel circuit during the 1970s, when all these recordings were made. The Triumphs gained enough of an audience to play at the inauguration of Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley, the Floyd Family Singers opened for Rev. James Cleveland at Madison Square Garden and cut an LP for Savoy, while the Gospel I.Q.’s are said to have recorded for OKeh. Due to bad breaks or distaste for the music industry, these artists receded from view, leaving their recordings to be unearthed by collectors and experts such as Greg Belson, who compiled this set for Luaka Bop. Belson selected singles and album tracks that illustrate how deeply intertwined these working musicians were with the prevailing funky, soulful sounds of the time. Much of this has to do with the uncredited supporting bands, who evoke the sultry southern grooves emanating from Memphis and Muscle Shoals in the late ’60s and early ’70s. Occasionally, the production gets a little slicker and the rhythms a little heavier, as on the four-on-the-floor disco of “That’s a Sign of the Times” by the Floyd Family Singers. “That’s a Sign of the Times” dates from 1980, making it probably the latest cut here, but it sounds like it could be a few years older—an assessment that can be leveled against any song here. As much as the music on The Time for Peace Is Now sounds like a ’70s period piece, individual trends aren’t always easily identifiable. The Staples Singers are a pervasive influence—“We Got a Race to Run” is by the Staples Jr. Singers, who named themselves in homage to their heroes—and there are echoes of Curtis Mayfield and Gamble & Huff’s Philadelphia International evident in the compilation’s silky guitar runs and velvety vocal harmonies. Occasionally, a song even suggests something outside of soul: The lanky rhythms and swirling organ of “Peace in the Land” by the Gospel I.Q.’s are cousins to the British pub rock bashed out by Nick Lowe and Graham Parker. The concentration on rhythm and vibe means The Time for Peace Is Now doesn’t feel like gospel music in the traditional sense: the chord changes often are elegant, the harmonies are never as raucous as a church service, and the songs seem to aspire to the crossover achieved by the Edwin Hawkins Singers and the Staple Singers. The spiritual message isn’t overt; it’s tucked away within lyrics that otherwise serve as affirmations and inspirations—sentiments that sought healing in the wake of the Civil Rights Movement, assassinations, and the Vietnam War. From a distance, it can sound like soulful pop music, but a closer listen reveals that’s not true. Set aside the celestial lyrics: the songs and production are not quite polished, the musical ideas just slightly too common to stand out. What distinguishes the recordings on The Time for Peace Is Now is how the passion of the singers is tempered by the professionalism of their supporting players. Everybody involved was attempting to appeal to a broad audience: They were converting doubters into believers by playing gospel that could masquerade as pop.","Luaka Bop’s collection of ’70s rhythmic gospel rarities doesn’t feel like gospel in the traditional sense.

The Highwomen,The Highwomen,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d72b2a8fd34990009cf89e3/1:1/w_160/thehighwomen_thehighwomen.jpg,2019-09-18 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-highwomen-the-highwomen/,Low Country SoundElektra,"At the start of their powerful self-titled debut, the Highwomen—four leading women, banded together from distant corners of the country-music universe—go for the genre’s androgenic throat. “I was a Highwoman/And a mother from my youth,” sings Brandi Carlile, who helped recruit the quartet after fellow singer Amanda Shires realized how few women rank as modern country stars. It is a rewrite of “Highwayman,” of course, a composite sketch of the fabled spirit of valiant men. Written by country hit machine Jimmy Webb, the tune gave the collective of Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, and Waylon Jennings their collective name, The Highwaymen, in the mid-’80s. For some, rewriting “Highwayman” may be an act of sacrilege, tantamount to, say, riffing on “The Star-Spangled Banner” or goofing on “Stairway to Heaven.” But Shires and Carlile rewrote it with Webb’s blessing, turning its four macho verses into remembrances from persecuted women—a Honduran immigrant, a Salem witch, a Freedom Rider, a pioneer preacher—and testimonials to their immortal temerity. “We are the Highwomen/We sing a story still untold,” everyone sings in the chorus, fashioning a mission statement into magnetic harmony. “We carry the sons you can only hold.” It is at once better than its classic original and a brilliant gambit, at once illustrating the genre’s gender gap and rushing to fill it once and for all. The membership of the Highwomen is a marvel alone, an effort to reach across the aisles of country and then out of them. Maren Morris is the quartet’s exuberant star, having channeled the magnetism of early hits like “My Church” into a city-slick, chart-climbing bauble with Zedd and a second album, Girl, that unapologetically offers her up as a stadium-sized star if the world will have her. Carlile, meanwhile, is the adult-contemporary crossover dissident, as whip-smart as she is poignant. She has inched her way towards the spotlight over the years, and on last year’s enormous By The Way, I Forgive You, it found her. Shires has deep country bona fides; a fiddle-playing mystic, she sings like Emmylou Harris and writes like Van Morrison. And Hemby is one of her generation's Jimmy Webbs, a prolific hitmaker who co-wrote Kacey Musgraves’ “Butterflies” and Lady Gaga’s A Star Is Born standards. The Highwomen’s collective résumé quietly says that a woman’s place in country music is, well, anywhere. These dozen songs pull all those perspectives toward the center. Country music has tended to reduce women to stereotypes, like the doe-eyed lover or the vengeful ex-lover or the sassy sex symbol. But The Highwomen contains and welcomes multitudes, reflected by “Crowded Table,” an ode to the value of intersectionality and solidarity that calls back to the folk revivalism of Pete Seeger and Joan Baez. (To that end, Yola, a black, English-born country-soul singer sings the title track's early verse about being a Freedom Rider, hurtling over a half-dozen expectations at once.) During “Old Soul,” Morris gracefully embodies a woman who has given herself over to domestic duties and reasonable responsibilities but daydreams about escaping into the life of a “wild child for a day.” Playful and political, the irrepressible “Redesigning Women” alternately invokes Paula Deen and Rosie the Riveter, or the impulse to buy too many shoes and rear a generation sparking a social revolution. Motherhood is both deeply meaningful (tenderly voiced by Hemby on the swaying “My Only Child”) and sporadically annoying (as on “My Name Can’t Be Mama,” a modern honky-tonk ringer fit for Dolly Parton). Love looks different here than the standard country conception, too. During “Loose Change,” Morris sings about a dude who doesn’t appreciate her value and her quest to leave him romantically bankrupt; Carlile and Shires arrive in the chorus, a unified posse you’d be a fool to fuck with. But the album’s centerpiece and wrecking ball is “If She Ever Leaves Me,” written by Shires with her husband and the band’s guitarist, Jason Isbell, for Carlile, who married another woman before it was even legal stateside. It is, on the surface, a sardonic kiss-off for a man hitting on her wife, a piece of you’re-not-her-type perfection anchored by the quip, “That’s too much cologne/She likes perfume.” The song’s real power, though, is its vulnerability, expressed through Carlile’s confession that she’s not the best partner, but she’s trying all the time. The Highwomen is a safe space for all kinds of honesty. The Highwomen have expressed a rebellious kinship with their predecessors in The Highwaymen. “Wanting to do things their own way is what we’re sort of trying to mime,” Shires told The New York Times of the connection. But in the ’80s, The Highwaymen were aging outlaw gods, banding together after the initial glow of their own careers had dimmed; between the awkward drum machines and a Bob Seger cover, you could hear them fumbling with questions of relevance and senescence. The Highwomen, however, are now at the height of their respective powers and part of a larger cultural push, as vital as any four stars might be. The Highwaymen have often been called country’s best supergroup, but the Highwomen are better. They do here what the men never could—stretch the notions of what country can and must become. Correction: An original version of this review misidentified the singer of a line in the title track.

None More Negative,Type O Negative,by: Sean T. Collins,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d79266c8699b30008f1ae36/1:1/w_160/nonemorenegative.jpg,2019-09-18 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/type-o-negative-none-more-negative/,Roadrunner,"Type O Negative sounded how clove cigarettes smell, how crushed red velvet feels, how black hair dye looks when it stains your bathroom sink. Led by singer and bassist Peter Steele—a towering figure with bone structure to die for, best described as either Evil Thor or Dracula with a gym membership—these Brooklyn-based purveyors of goth metal spent their career exploring the genre’s inherent tension between seriousness and schtick. Originally released on Record Store Day in a limited run and now reissued (on gorgeous green vinyl), None More Negative packages nearly that entire career, featuring all six albums from their years on Roadrunner Records. (Their final effort, Dead Again, was released on another label and isn’t included here.) It’s a suitably massive set for a band best known for its eerie epics. The best-known of these kick off 1993’s Bloody Kisses: “Christian Woman” explores its subject’s sublimation of sexuality into the crucified body of Christ with all the subtlety of “Ken Russell’s The Devils: The Musical.” It continues with “Black No. 1,” an affectionate send-up of a goth girl’s beauty regimen that launched the band into the public consciousness, via a striking black-and-white video that received heavy Beavis and Butthead rotation. Both songs showcase Steele’s distinctive, vampiric baritone, complete with theatrically rolled R’s and overemphasized consonants (“on her milk-white neck-kkh, the devil’s mark-k”). The man eroticized diction. Steele shared vocal duties with his gifted guitarist Kenny Hickey, who handled the shouty bits; over time, this allowed Steele to hone his voice into something not just creepy or sexy but actually romantic, even abject. He closes October Rust’s anthemic “Love You to Death” by plaintively asking the object of his affection “Am I good enough for you?”, clearly already believing the answer to be “no.” World Coming Down goes even further down this guilt-ridden road. It’s effectively a concept album about the death of people close to Steele, who by then was dealing with life-threatening addictions of his own. (He died of an unrelated aortic aneurysm in 2010.) Two songs—the savage, hook-laden “Everyone I Love Is Dead” and the harrowing and bittersweet “Everything Dies”—tackle that pain by wondering if it’s worth going on without those he’s lost. The song’s ferocity emerges from the band’s hulking exterior and Steele’s lyrical vulnerability, which sounds trapped inside it. The music itself displayed a similar duality, alternating between doom-laden dirges and swirling psychedelia. The latter element manifested not just in the Type O’s choice of covers (Neil Young’s “Cinnamon Girl,” Seals & Croft’s “Summer Breeze,” an honest-to-god Beatles medley) or in its nickname (“The Drab Four”), but in lush original compositions. My current favorite: Life Is Killing Me’s “(We Were) Electrocute,” an ode to turning neighborhood heads side-by-side with an old flame. These songs showcase keyboardist and producer Josh Silver’s ability to create colorful soundscapes that belie the band’s strict black, white, and green color palette. But this is a box set, not a greatest-hits comp or even an a-la-carte reissue of the catalog, and that means putting up with the bad and the ugly along with the good. In particular, it means shelling out for vinyl versions of the band’s first two thrash and hardcore-influenced records, which predate the full flower of Steele’s voice. These feel more like an elaborate prank played on the listener than a new group finding its sea legs: Album two, The Origin of the Feces, is essentially album one, Slow, Deep and Hard, re-recorded with new titles for the same songs and, for some reason, fake crowd noise edited in for a faux-live effect—complete with hecklers. (That Type O chose to exchange insults with an imaginary audience on its “live” album tells you a lot about Type O.) There’s little of musical value on either album, which are also the main, but by no means the only, outlet for the band’s most dunderheaded Noo Yawk shock-jock-style material about class, race, gender, and sexuality. Even the album covers—a blurry closeup of sexual penetration and a crystal-clear photo of Steele’s anus respectively—all but invite you not to listen. This regrettable strain of their work continues on and off through 2003’s Life Is Killing Me and its infantile heterosexist anthem “I Like Goils,” in which Steele roars “I’m proud not to be P.C.!” like he’s auditioning for a Netflix standup special.  New liner notes that emphasize this aspect of the band in 2019 do them no favors either. But just a few songs after “Goils,” this same band absolutely tears through a straight-faced, straightforward cover of “Angry Inch,” as in Hedwig and…. No joke, no irony: Steele simply adored this story of a glam-rock star who underwent botched gender-reassignment surgery and wanted to spread its gospel to his fans. That’s the Type O I hear in their best love songs and death songs: a band torn between the pleasure of an open heart and the pain of having it ripped out, determined to lend its sensual voice to both sensations.

The Practice of Love,Jenny Hval,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d5c1ecc2dcbbc0009949295/1:1/w_160/jennyhval_thepracticeoflove.jpg,2019-09-17 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jenny-hval-the-practice-of-love/,Sacred Bones,"In a statement accompanying the announcement of her seventh record, The Practice of Love, Jenny Hval admitted some trepidation about the overarching subject. “Love as a theme in art has been the domain of the canonized, big artists,” she wrote. “I have always seen myself as a minor character, a voice that speaks of other things.” Since emerging as a solo artist over a decade ago, some of these “other things” have included vampires, menstruation, gender identity, and capitalism. With those fascinations in mind, the Norwegian avant-garde artist manages to take the exhausted topic of love and transform it into something that feels both erudite and primal, a work that encourages both contemplation and movement. Inspired in part by Valie Export’s 1985 drama of the same name, The Practice of Love looks beyond traditional definitions of love; Hval seldom mentions romance, even of the conceptual sort. Instead, across eight tracks, love is an amorphous entity. It’s finding rituals of intimacy beyond the norm. It’s celebrating otherness. It’s two friends questioning their choice to not have children over Skype. The practice of love, Hval seemingly says, is creation, survival, and community sustained and defined on one’s terms. Written and produced by Hval after she completed an upcoming novel about the coming-of-age of a lonely Norwegian teenage girl in the 1990s, the record moves away from the experimental art-pop of her earlier work and embraces the hypnotic spirit of ’90s trance music, a world Hval says she never experienced firsthand. This new alchemy of four-on-the-floor rhythms with heady theory makes Hval’s music more accessible and affecting than ever before. The Practice of Love eases into its grand ambitions by opening with the origin of all life: Earth. “Lions” invites a subject to search for sanctity in the trees, the grass, the clouds. “Study this and ask yourself: Where is God?” a distant, measured voice implores over rhythmic bursts of white noise. Then, as the voice’s focus shrinks towards the ants, mushrooms, and flowers of the forest, the song’s structure expands. A shuffling synth nestles against the percussion and as Hval’s voice enters the scene, “Lions” accelerates until it bursts into dancefloor euphoria. The feeling continues on the stellar “Ashes to Ashes,” as it manifests the cerebral songwriting process as a physical act. Atop a dreamy, buoyant arrangement, Hval sings of beats burrowing into the ground and playing an instrument that is “just a shape in the earth,” of sinking her hands into the soil and tasting the detritus of memories. Despite this carnality, Hval’s voice is light, airy, and calming. “She was certain the lyrics went about burying someone’s ashes/And then having a cigarette.” Songwriting mimics a life cycle: As you exorcise the past, you move closer to your demise. “Ashes to Ashes” and the skittering, saxophone-tinged “High Alice” are the only songs on The Practice of Love that feature Hval on her own. As on previous records, a group of guest vocalists (here, artists Vivian Wang, Félicia Atkinson, and Laura Jean Englert) provide a collage of perspectives, their voices often blending into one organism. Hval, Wang, and Englert converge on the title track, which is composed of two overlapping dialogues, one of Wang reciting the narration of a film by Hval’s frequent co-producer Lasse Marhaug, the other a conversation between Englert and Hval about existence. “I have to accept that I’m part of this human ecosystem but I’m not the princess and I’m not the main character,” Englert remarks. Many artists explore ego death, but few have made it into such a personal and physical sensation, something that reverberates through the body long after the song cuts out. “Flesh in dissent” or the rejection of heteronormative obligation is further explored on “Accident,” a song flush with wonder. As Hval attempts to rectify the transition from being “the closest her mother came to magic” to being “no longer a mystery of life,” she envisions women simulating the various rituals of pregnancy. One woman discovers stretch mark cream in an Airbnb bathroom. When she spreads the product on her stomach, she feels no shame. “So many years. So little fruit,” she blasély murmurs later while picking at a container of dried figs. “Accident” reaches a powerful conclusion as the narrator rediscovers her magic through art: She’s “Born to write/Born to burn.” The way Hval reconciles with destiny makes you want to seek out your own. If “Accident” is Hval at her most corporeal, “Six Red Cannas” floats off into the metaphysical. Over a thumping beat that could soundtrack a grimy techno show, she chops up a fictional memory into a meditation that encompasses female genius, songwriting philosophy, and the passage of time. While driving through the New Mexican desert on a pilgrimage to Georgia O’Keefe’s home studio, Hval somewhat unwittingly connects herself to a lineage of innovators. “I think I was trying to write to Georgia O’Keeffe/Like Joni Mitchell writes to Amelia Earhart when she is driving in the desert,” she observes, letting her falsetto spiral atop a wobbling synth. “As if a song can communicate with the spirits or awaken the dead/I mean—isn’t that what it’s for?” Nodding to Mitchell’s own desert observations on Hejira’s “Amelia,” Hval looks upward and notices six of O’Keeffe’s signature fiery red flowers streaking across the sky. As the song dissolves, the thought arises: Who else could make a banger out of conjuring Georgia O’Keeffe? The Practice of Love concludes with its most understated track. “Ordinary” is a gauzy, spoken-word wisp about finding comfort in the familiar. “Can I only write these things, not all the other things?” a stoic voice asks. As bells, horns, and drums gradually creep in and build, the song subtly swells into an opulent trance track. But right as it reaches its peak, “Ordinary” begins to wash away until only its outlines remain. Its payoff is intimate, a fitting comedown after a record that pushes Hval towards her most emotionally vulnerable. She’s an outsider claiming a piece of the mainstream for herself without sacrificing what makes her music so special.

Beneath the Eyrie,Pixies,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d1390ecf9684d0008de2cb7/1:1/w_160/Pixies_BeneathTheEyrie.jpg,2019-09-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pixies-beneath-the-eyrie/,InfectiousBMG,"During all those years that fans clamored for new music following the band’s 2004 reunion, who could have predicted that expectations for a new Pixies album would ever sink so low? After nearly a decade spent growing rusty on the reunion circuit, the band deflated what little excitement remained following Kim Deal’s departure with Indie Cindy, a comeback that not only failed to recreate their old mystique, but struggled to even understand what made the band so alluring in the first place. The sinister spark, the mischief, that giddy confusion they stirred with their blur of candy and sadism—it was totally absent, replaced by an at best anonymous, at worst obnoxious shrug of secondhand tics. At least things couldn’t get any worse. It didn’t buy them back much goodwill, but 2016’s Head Carrier was perfectly fine, a serviceable effort roughly on par with the average Frank Black album. And over the last few years the band’s concerts have begun to show signs of life again, thanks in part to replacement bassist Paz Lenchantin, whose happy-to-be-here presence sets an example for her tired bandmates. Having new material to perform doesn’t hurt, either. It at least offers the group a chance to mix it up a bit after years of bleeding the same old Doolittle staples dry. The Pixies’ modest rebound continues on their pleasant, undemanding, and completely respectable new album Beneath the Eyrie. It won’t win back scorned fans who took the band’s fall from greatness as a personal betrayal, yet it comes closer to conjuring the gleeful chill of the Pixies’ classic albums than anything they’ve released since reuniting. There are moments where, if you zone out just a little bit, it feels like you’re listening to some Bossanova B-sides that you somehow missed. The Pixies have finally made an album that scratches the itch for new Pixies music. It’s got some rippers on it, too. The romping “Graveyard Hill” (one of several tracks co-written by Lenchantin, an eager presence throughout the album) sets up Black Francis for some of the freest, most feral barks he’s unleashed in two decades. “The Long Rider,” meanwhile, is the album’s big earworm, and prime radio fodder on the off chance alternative stations decide a new Pixies single might be something they’re into. It’s made from recycled parts—repurposed pieces of “Velouria,” mostly—but it lifts off in a way few classic Pixies imitations do. The band is also learning how to make change work in their favor. Francis’ slithery, sexual energy of yore has given way to an old-man crotchetiness. Instead of feigning the mystique that now eludes him, he leans into candor, touching on his recent divorce in unguarded terms, at least on the tracks where he isn’t singing about witches or mythical half-human sea creatures. The blustery opener “Arms of Mrs. Mark of Cain” and the naked “Ready for Love” cast him as heartbroken and cursed, picking up where his confessional final effort with the Catholics, Show Me Your Tears, left off. Even the spritely jangle of “Bird of Prey” does little to temper the resentful bite of Francis’ lyrics. “You’ve stolen my tomorrow/So I come for it today/You stole it when you stole my yesterday,” he sings in a smoldering, Leonard Cohen growl. The Pixies recorded Beneath the Eyrie at a creepy old church, which must have helped juice the gothic sound that they’re going for. Of course, in their prime this band could make even the most sterile studio sound haunted, but after two records grasping for ambience, it’s nice to hear a Pixies album with a moody sense of place again. It’s weird that “better than nothing” became the bar for what was once one of the most celebrated bands of their era, but if it’s a choice between more records as solid, if unspectacular, as Beneath the Eyrie or nothing, the Pixies might as well keep them coming. It’s been a long time since this band had anything left to lose.

Metronomy Forever,Metronomy,by: Aimee Cliff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d77ca01fd34990009cf8bf7/1:1/w_160/metronomyforever_metronomy.jpg,2019-09-17 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/metronomy-metronomy-forever/,Because Music,"Metronomy Forever would be a braggadocious title if the music weren’t so self-deprecating. The sixth studio album from Devonshire musician Joe Mount is a tangled and tongue-in-cheek meditation on legacy, ending on a sparse postscript titled “Ur Mixtape,” which functions as a sort of punchline. Speak-singing his way through the memory of a fumbled young romance, Mount describes running into his crush’s brother, years later. The brother, recognising Mount, enthusiastically tells him how much he cherished the mixtape that Mount made, a decade earlier, to impress his sister. It’s a wry ending to an album that grapples with the question of how you’d like to be remembered: Even if you dedicate your life to crafting a legacy—in Mount’s case, a successful career at the forefront of ’00s and ’10s British electro-indie—you can never really control other people’s memories. The sardonic bait-and-switch characterises the mood of Metronomy Forever. Having co-written and co-produced Robyn’s cathartic 2018 record Honey, and moved to a house in the English countryside with space to build his own studio, Mount made this album alone, just for the heck of it. (The live band includes drummer Anna Prior, bassist Olugbenga Adelekan, and Oscar Cash and Michael Lovett on keys and guitars.) You can hear this lack of inhibition in the directionless psychedelia of the instrumental interludes, and in some wilfully shallow lyrics: “She’s like a dream/Salted caramel ice cream” is a hook as delicious, and as meaningless, as its subject matter. With Mount content to simply get in his groove, the casual approach gives rise to some of Metronomy’s best songs in years. The dreamy surf guitars, funk bass, and taut drums of “Whitsand Bay” hark back to their 2011 hit “The Bay” in more ways than one. “Salted Caramel Ice Cream” is a dancefloor stomper drizzled with zany synth melodies, plus a hint of the güiro that made a playful appearance on “The Look.” On the daft yet lovable “Sex Emoji,” Mount duets with himself in a coy falsetto over blown-out electro-funk; meanwhile, dance interludes like the twilight creep of “Miracle Rooftop” provide moments of introspection alongside the bombast (and a heady reminder of his skills as a producer). These retreads of Metronomy’s best bits are not all nostalgia for nostalgia’s sake—instead, subtle changes indicate an older, wiser band with new emotional maturity. On “Insecurity,” a song dripping in macho swagger, Mount sings about the harmfulness of masculine posturing. In front of the blindingly bright synths of lead single “Lately,” his plain, unadorned singing about the hard work of love has a real pathos. For anyone not already misty-eyed with nostalgia for Metronomy, however, a meandering 17-track album is a hard sell. As one instrumental interlude is titled, “Forever Is a Long Time”—and Metronomy Forever is a long album. At times, it’s difficult to determine whether the recycling is deliberate. “Wedding” kicks off the album with a grandiose, church organ sweep, but later, on the plodding “Wedding Bells,” Mount delivers a “gotcha!” by revealing that the titular bells are “not for me.” This at least seems like a choice, while his use of both “Insecurity” and “Insecure” as track titles scans as a rehash. The decision to keep all these short, unfulfilled song ideas is either carefree or cynical, depending on your perspective. “Now, basically all music is ambient music, or can be. I think it gives musicians a load of freedom,” Mount told Dazed. “Drake records are, like, one hundred tracks long? And half of it’s awful—but it’s wicked.” Intentionally making musical wallpaper doesn’t sound like an exciting prospect, but Mount seems invigorated by abandoning the pursuit of the perfectly structured 10-track record. Perhaps it’s this liberation that allowed him to write a handful of brilliant new entries in the Metronomy catalog—comfortable in the knowledge that listeners who missed the band’s first wave are most likely to discover their work in fragments, regrouped and playlisted in the context-free world of streaming platforms. There, “The Bay” will slide timelessly into “Salted Caramel Ice Cream,” strutting on and on, forever.

Adult Baby,KAZU,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d77c5f72073fe00084eb2e1/1:1/w_160/Kazu_AdultBaby.jpg,2019-09-17 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kazu-adult-baby/,Adult Baby!K7,"Kazu Makino’s voice always served as ethereal counterpoint to Blonde Redhead’s music—if they were a gut punch, she was a gust of wind. Gradually, over the years, the group followed her lead, shedding the thick, serrated dissonance of its early records as though molting a buzzsaw cocoon. Five years since Barragan, the band’s last and presumably final album, Adult Baby marks Makino’s solo debut, and on it she sounds practically disembodied. It’s an intriguing new direction for both her voice and her songwriting. The viscous drip of the guitars, the electronic exoskeleton of Blonde Redhead’s last few albums—all of it is gone, replaced by layers of Makino’s breathy head voice. She dissolves together gasps, wordless cries, and half-intelligible sung phrases in a cottony swirl of synthesizers, gongs, flute, strings, and other diaphanous textures. She has assembled a formidable ensemble: Ryuichi Sakamoto appears on five songs, credited with piano, field recordings, and “organic instruments,” though you’d never necessarily know he was there; by design, his contributions are inextricable from the whole. Her drummers play more forceful roles: Ian Chang (Body Language, Son Lux) is an anchoring presence on several songs, his pointed attack a muscular counterpoint to the music’s flyaway textures. The Brazilian percussionist Mauro Refocso (Atoms for Peace, Forró in the Dark) lays down flickering figures on “Salty” and “Coyote,” his touch featherweight and diamond-tipped. And on “Undo,” Deerhoof drummer Greg Saunier’s spacious, exacting drumbeats punctuate cloudy keys and a distant, almost inaudible shriek that brings to mind Portishead. At its best, Adult Baby is a drowsy delight, swaying lazily in waltz tempo. The foggy sonics are suffused in Lynchian mystery, while Ian Mclellan Davis’ lush string arrangements lend a sense of Old Hollywood grandeur. But the album can also be frustratingly opaque. Makino’s lyrics, when they can be made out at all, don’t hold up under scrutiny. Stream-of-conscious and relatively prosaic, they read like diary entries, serving mainly as springboards for her to explore the outer reaches of her range. And it can be difficult to tell the album’s nine tracks apart from one another, or even tease apart the elements of a given song. The mix is hazy and abstracted, everything quieter than everything else. But that seems like precisely what Makino and her collaborators intend. Adult Baby works best with the volume turned up, a soft mattress beneath you, all distractions on hold. And even though the music often resists forming into anything as solid as a hook, Makino’s vaporous melodies have a way of creeping up on you long after the record has stopped spinning; they have a sneaky tenacity, like a dream you can’t shake, even if you can’t quite remember its particulars.

House of Sugar,Alex G,by: Anna Gaca,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d38748fc0574f00088cc75c/1:1/w_160/alexg_houseofsugar.jpg,2019-09-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sandy-alex-g-house-of-sugar/,Domino,"Alex Giannascoli’s songs draw weird poignancy from the ordinary. The artist who records under the enigmatic name (Sandy) Alex G mixes the real and the imagined, the possibly-biographical and the probably-fictional in the same breath. His songwriting is detailed but stubbornly opaque, swathed in a fuzz as thick and soft as dryer lint. This unassuming style, initially developed over a half-dozen EPs and albums released independently online, bleeds together DIY rock and homemade folk with snatches of country, industrial, or electronic. He’s become an undeniable, if low-wattage star of 2010s indie rock. His third album for Domino, House of Sugar, is the clearest and most inviting articulation of his skewed aesthetic. It employs most all of the things that make Alex G songs sound like Alex G songs: sturdy, ragged chord progressions; abstract, existential-leaning lyrics; Molly Germer’s homey violin playing; squeaky, pitch-shifted vocals like the voices you’d give your own bad ideas. The title refers to both the SugarHouse Casino in Philadelphia and the gingerbread house from “Hansel and Gretel.” Like a fairy tale, the album is both sweet and sinister, layering different modes to obscure its true intentions. These are songs about feeling discomfort in the gaze of others, vignettes that shift to reveal and conceal themselves in ways too unpredictable to be easily faked. “You and me/These are titles I can hardly speak,” Alex croons over the barn-dance sway of “Southern Sky.” Mixer Jacob Portrait, who’s worked on Alex G albums since 2015’s Beach Music, brings out professional-quality fidelity without clearing the cloudy textures. House of Sugar is full of little instrumental parts and mumbled background vocals that come through and fall away without necessarily building or resolving, like students in a school pageant. As with earlier albums, it’s studded with experiments: “Project 2,” an interlude of fluting vaporwave synths, and “Sugar,” where melodramatic violin and piano are coated in Vocodered gurgles. They’re less interruptions than camouflage; “Sugar” leads into the open chords and tender Elliott Smith coos of “In My Arms.” “He lay his head/Back on my chest/Once had a wife/Now nobody’s left,” Alex murmurs. The best moments on House of Sugar are like this, bittersweet and empathetic. “He was a good friend of mine/He died/Why write about it now/Gotta honor him somehow,” he sings in the matter-of-fact opening lines of “Hope,” but the scene fades to a raucous celebration of life: “In the house they were calling out his name/All night/Taking turns on the bed/Throwing bottles from the windows of the home/On Hope Street.” Alex’s late friend isn’t named; the only name is the street, Hope, an emotional coincidence too improbable to believe from anyone else. In his dreamy, surreal landscape, it makes total sense. The album closer, recorded live at a November 2018 show in St. Louis, is another of these perfectly imperfect Alex G gestures. “SugarHouse” is a song for closing down the bar, but Giannascoli’s words transform the concert crowd into weary gamblers at the end of a long, artificial day: “You never really met me/I don’t think anyone has/But we can still be players together/Let SugarHouse pick up the tab.” They’re the words of a man conflicted about himself, but not his intentions—an appeal to the type of community that comes from the bottom, not from the top. There’s enough space in Alex G’s stories to tell your own.

October Song,Lightning Bug,by: Patric Fallon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d489547286dd9000878c489/1:1/w_160/octobersong_lightningbug.jpg,2019-09-16 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lightning-bug-october-song/,Marbled Arm,"It was nearly five years ago when an unknown band named Lightning Bug uploaded their first recordings to SoundCloud and Bandcamp. The New York-based trio had yet to play a show by the time their debut album, Floaters, was released to an audience of friends, family, and a keen-eared blogger or two. Yet that 10-song LP belied a rare confidence and versatility. The music was a pastel tapestry woven from the threads of Stereolab, My Bloody Valentine, Camera Obscura, and plenty of early ’00s indie rock, stitched into a unique pattern. Floaters gradually accumulated new listeners and eventually found a spot on NME's list of the best debut albums of the year. Then, once again, Lightning Bug went away. In the middle of 2016, singer and primary songwriter Audrey Kang had to remind her fans she didn’t abandon them. “We are still here,” she wrote on Facebook, “just keeping quite still and quiet at the moment.” A modest four-song record called the torment of love arrived nine months later with no fanfare. Named after a French Caribbean pastry sold by widows, the 2017 EP was markedly intimate and somber, as if meant to share an honest glimpse of how Lightning Bug had been growing slowly in secret. More than two years later, that period of personal discovery culminates in October Song. The second Lightning Bug album focuses more than ever on Kang’s hushed voice and simple, soulful lyrics. Her longtime collaborators, multi-instrumentalist Kevin Copeland and producer Logan Miley, are no less vital, but now they serve to support Kang's vision. “I’m carrying a song to sing but I do not know when,” she begins on “(intro),” as applause and crowd noise nearly drown her out. Her voice never rises above a murmur, but when she sighs “A secret thrill, I know I will, and spring will come again,” her stillness draws you in. That small, unassuming space—where whispers ring out like bell chimes, guitar distortion feels like a downy blanket, and emotions swell but never burst—is where October Song thrives. In the middle of the bobbing drums and tape-warbled guitar of “The Lotus Eaters,” Kang sings as if she’s the only one listening: “Will my own past forget me?” The lyrics are among the shortest on the album, but they feel like a detonation. Kang ends her stanza in defeat: “Sometimes I think nothing changes,” she sings, and the music explodes around her in a whorl of glittering synth, rich choral harmonies, ringing chimes, and crystalline guitar. October Song is bisected by a beatless, textural piece called “The Root,” which owes as much to Tim Hecker as it does Grizzly Bear and Grouper. At its rumbling center, Kang emerges with an angelic falsetto only to fade back into the ether. It’s utterly immersive, from its sound design to its melody. On “I Looked Too Long,” they tip their hat to Ennio Morricone, an unexpected turn that functions as a palate cleanser for the wistful balladry of “September Song,” which show how quietly multifaceted and adept Kang is as a songwriter. Just before the release of Floaters in 2015, Kang told the music blog yvynl about Lightning Bug’s early days. “At first, it was a very private project and working together felt like being in a secret club,” she wrote. “We had this loosely enforced rule that while we were working, there always had to be one person napping. It was pretty magical.” October Song never surrenders the sense of cozy grandeur that made Floaters so magnetic, even as it zooms in further and reveals more of the person behind it.","The gorgeous and hypnotic second Lightning Bug album focuses more than ever on songwriter Audrey Kang’s hushed voice and simple, soulful lyrics.

Blacks’ Myths II,Blacks’ Myths ,by: Piotr Orlov,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d68482b02a1db000895d5a9/1:1/w_160/blacksmyths_II.jpg,2019-09-16 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/blacks-myths-blacks-myths-ii/,Atlantic Rhythms,"Armed with a pulpit, an amp, and impeccable timing, Blacks’ Myths II rolls up to the intersection of two contemporary cultural storylines—one thematic and one musical. There, where history and sound meet, the Washington, D.C.-based duo, bassist Luke Stewart and drummer Warren Crudup III, cobbles together an unlikely, thorny recording: a slab of punk jazz that is outside of genre and era but can also be heard as an auspicious fight for the soul and sound of a nation—noisy minimalist improvisation as a present-day language communicating timeless truths. The broader narrative that Blacks’ Myths’ sophomore album embraces is America’s current reappraisal of blackness as central to the country’s meaning—which in the eyes and ears of Stewart (of Irreversible Entanglements and Heroes Are Gang Leaders) and Crudup (stickman for James Branford Lewis, among others) is taking place too late for the entire planet’s health. The album’s core narration comes in the form of four monologues courtesy of Dr. Thomas Stanley, whose polymath resume (poet, black studies professor, astral jazz and (P-)funk scholar, DIY concert producer) makes him a uniquely qualified collaborator. His noetic visions not only feed into the resonance of the band’s name; they are also a counterpart to recent journalistic works like Hannah Nikole-Jones’ “The 1619 Project.” Instead of wanting to fix America’s manifest history, Stanley and Blacks’ Myths are looking to wipe its slate clean for whatever comes next. This plot is underpinned by music only slightly less grand—and engages a pair of debates being waged inside the jazz and noise/punk communities these two musicians call home. The central questions here are “What is it?” and “Who is it for?” One springs from a new generation of players reassessing jazz’s structure, language, and storied place within the African American tradition. The other is forcing punk to figure out how to embrace its black roots and ascertain its musical purpose in a Trump-era cauldron. On the evidence of the album’s messy lo-fi textures, pervasive rock dynamics, and two-player intricacy (Stewart’s electric bass and electronics and Crudup’s kit account for all the sounds), bolstered by Dr. Stanley’s inquests, Blacks’ Myths are eager to partake in all these and any other discourses America may want to throw at them. II’s conversations actually continue the ones Stewart and Crudup kicked off on Blacks’ Myths self-titled 2018 debut, even as they also lurch into the unknown. The first album’s atmosphere had traces of ferocity but was more occupied by hypnotic revolution—minimalist dub notes and figures, or slow-developing tides of sound, wrapping around rhythm and reflecting back upon themselves, only occasionally coming to a boil. It was wordless and musically potent, sketching a great migratory movement and a past that came alive in symbiotic bass-drums interactions. Filled with worried notes of Stewart’s distorted upright, first-take-best-take slurred lines, and low-frequency electronics, its sound remains unlike any album in recent memory, a perfect addition to the gathering storm of improvisational oddities charging the atmosphere in all corners of so-called “jazz.” The follow-up is cut from a familiar heady cloth but powered by a distinct energy. If Stewart and Crudup’s communication was previously built on groove telepathy, here the objectives are more specific, feral, primordial. It’s a prehistoric creation of post-history power sources: cascading feedback, barbed electronics, and oversized drums. Stanley’s own words seize upon the environmental theme, describing the “goo” covering much of the planet as “the source of history… carry[ing] forward the stark relationship of matter to itself.” The world-building scope is boundless, on the scale of Stanley Kubrick or Octavia Butler, as living sound, fed through one of Crazy Horse’s Marshall stacks from Rust Never Sleeps but emanating music from Arc. Over half the tracks are short, rising bursts with distinct roles to play. Some are vehicles for the album’s themes, with Stanley’s words—on the heroism of “non-violent warriors empowered by myth science” fighting “the triumph of white supremacy gentrified as American exceptionalism”—gliding over Stewart’s unnerving electrical currents, or amplified by Crudup’s volcanic thrashing. Others are here to keep punk’s loud-fast rules at the center of a conversation that can admittedly turn bookish and didactic. Only a moment with the strumming thrash of “Rapture” or the martial power of “Northern Confederate” is needed to once more quicken the pulse. Yet it is the longer pieces that push Blacks’ Myths II beyond mere post-hardcore prophecy toward something approaching transcendence. Carrying titles weighted with meaning for black America (“Stand Your Ground,” “The Bluff,” “Mammy’s Revenge”), they bring together composition and improvisation as pursued through a playful, masterly push-and-pull between technology, electricity, and rhythm; by design, it is only tenuously controlled. Take “Free Land,” the album’s centerpiece and vessel of its most distinct melodic figures: Stewart’s stately motif, played on a deeply distorted electric bass, sounds capable of being swallowed up at any given moment, even as its echoes begin to reverberate in a kind of elegy. Or take “Redbone,” on which Crudup digs out an elastic pocket while Stewart whimsically messes about with a set of fuzzed-out, organ-like textures, moving from a heavy-metal Jackie Mittoo vibe to approximating the sound of steel-drum dub. The acoustic mis-recognition and contextual confusion provide a rare kind of delight. These exercises in structured freedom and interrogation of form, amid a historic pool of boundless blackness, bring to mind a compliment that the artist/filmmaker Arthur Jafa paid black America a few years ago: “We create culture in freefall.” Imagine the hope in that statement. Stewart and Crudup soundtrack a version of that engagement with American gravity, one existing at an intersection that, though specific to our recent times, also has lineage and precedents. As their band’s name makes clear, these sounds did not arrive here by chance.","On a thrilling slab of punk-jazz noise, the D.C. duo argues for the centrality of black American culture in the fight for the nation’s soul.

Utility,Barker,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d4899eb3a40180008ff3bf5/1:1/w_160/utility_barker.jpg,2019-09-16 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/barker-utility/,Ostgut Ton,"There is a small but significant faction of the dance-music underground that seems bent on teaching us that drums are overrated. There’s the UK’s “weightless” contingent, led by Mumdance and Logos, whose productions smear grime’s glassy accents into a viscous shimmer punctuated only by the occasional gunshot; there are flickering, arpeggiated tracks from Actress and Kassem Mosse that take lo-fi aesthetics to a new extreme, suggesting beaten-up cassette tapes where all the heavy bits have simply shriveled up and flaked off. Lorenzo Senni has reimagined trance music as an exercise in pure geometry, unaccompanied synth stabs bobbing as nimbly as knitting needles. And a recent Resident Advisor mix from Objekt, a reigning headliner of the global techno underground, was stitched together entirely from what he calls “no-kick rollers”—heavy-hitting club tracks with no anchoring bass drum. Sam Barker is the latest to take up this idea, and his debut solo album, Utility, might be its fullest and most satisfying realization to date. The music resembles techno in all the style’s outward characteristics: the pulsing chords, the rippling high end, the gut-punching oomph of the bass. But where you might expect to hear techno’s usual percussive trappings—hardened kick drums, metallic cymbals, meaty snares—there are only the soft, fluid curves of his synthesizers. The closest that Barker comes to techno’s traditional drum palette is when he focuses a spray of white noise into a crisp, chattering attack akin to staccato hi-hats. In its rose-tinted mood, the album often resembles mid-1990s ambient techno at its most wistful, like Larry Heard’s Alien or John Beltran’s Ten Days of Blue. But where classic ambient techno took club music’s signature elements and made them gentle enough for afterhours comedowns, Barker’s Utility does the opposite, borrowing ambient’s billowing forms and reinforcing them for the needs of the dancefloor. These tracks are weaponized clouds, cotton candy wrapped in Kevlar. The record begins on a dreamy, romantic note with “Paradise Engineering,” drizzling a honeyed synth melody over buoyant chords, but it quickly turns tougher: On “Posmean,” taut, rubbery synths seem to send calls for help in Morse code; “Hedonic Treadmill” hits you in the chest like a sack of gold dust, even as the fizzy high end mimics the bag’s contents dispersing in slow motion. For anyone who has ever fantasized about dissolving into the dancefloor, Utility is about as close as it gets. On highlights like “Models of Wellbeing” (which nods to Rhythm & Sound’s aerated dub) and “Utility” (redolent of the fragrant Balearic staple “Sueño Latino”), Barker puts minimalist techniques to opulent ends, conjuring ecstatic visions out of just a handful of sounds, and teasing vast shapes out of a silvery mist. Behind the album’s title lies a crucial irony: By using ambient materials to remake techno, Barker has come up with the exact opposite of a purposefully percussive DJ tool. Instead of rote functionalism, Utility is distinguished by its surfeit of feeling.","For anyone who has ever fantasized about dissolving into the dancefloor, the debut solo album from techno artist Sam Barker is as close as it gets.

Sentimentally Yours,Patsy Cline,by: Stephen M.

He probably didn’t give it much thought when he had a demo made, or even when he drove that demo over to Patsy Cline’s home in Madison, Tennessee, to play it for her personally. But Cline made that “or” the song’s emotional hinge. “She’s Got You,” which opens Sentimentally Yours, the final full-length she released during her lifetime, is about the souvenirs of a romance that ended abruptly; Patsy has his class ring, his photograph, all the physical objects that typically signify love and commitment. But she doesn’t have the man himself. He’s someone else’s now. “I’ve got your memory,” she sings, sounding as though this alone might sustain her. Then she backtracks: “Or…. has it got me?” The way Cline sings “or” isn’t a sigh or a sob. It’s more like a deflation. She might have convinced herself that there was comfort to be found in those old objects, but that “or” obliterates any such hope. With that aching note, Cline reaches out of the song, out of the past, and right into the present moment. “She’s Got You” was another major hit for Cline, one in a series of country-pop smashes that signaled a comeback after several years in the wilderness and established her as one of the most successful crossover artists in Nashville. In the studio and on the stage, Cline did not initially walk those lines confidently: Preferring the cowgirl outfits her mother Hilda sewed for her and the yodeling country and western numbers she cut her teeth singing in Virginia, Cline initially fought against attempts to change her repertoire and gussy up her image. She didn’t want to record her 1957 hit “Walkin’ After Midnight”; she thought it portrayed her as a prostitute, and she certainly didn’t want to perform it on Arthur Godfrey’s Talent Scouts, a popular singing show on CBS—sort of a black-and-white version of American Idol. Her opinion softened considerably when she won the competition and the song quickly ascended the pop and country charts. It should have been a career-maker, but the horrible contract she signed with 4 Star Records severely limited her material and left her more financially strapped than she had been before her breakout. Within her small catalog of recordings, however—and especially on her third album, 1962’s Sentimentally Yours—Cline sounds like she has no misgivings whatsoever. She makes pop-country sound natural, inevitable: a reassurance that country music could survive the onslaught of rock’n’roll that threatened to render it obsolete. More crucially, the album marked the culmination of her own development as a vocalist and interpreter. She hit her stride at a crucial moment in Nashville history, when a wave of talented songwriters were redefining the genre’s conventions. Cline was a favorite of Cochran, Willie Nelson (who wrote her hit “Crazy”), and Harlan Howard (“I Fall to Pieces”). She essentially rewrote their songs simply by singing them, elevating their words and wringing every one of their rhymes for maximum dramatic potential. Cline similarly became identified with what had been dubbed the Nashville Sound—later referred to as countrypolitan. After the explosion of rock’n’roll in the mid-1950s, country music saw its market shrink and its influence wane. Established artists were playing to half-empty venues and suffering significant sales slumps. The Nashville Sound was perhaps a desperate attempt to reach new audiences by essentially de-twanging country music. Fiddles and banjos were replaced by lush string arrangements, high lonesome harmonies with smooth backing vocals. Two-steps and honky-tonk beats gave way to more urbane rhythms. Working with Owen Bradley (considered one of the primary architects of the Nashville Sound) and a stable of ace session players locally known as the A-Team, Cline suppressed the heavy twang that had defined some of her earliest recordings, backed away from belting, and cut yodeling from her act entirely. The transformation extended to her wardrobe, as she traded fringed jackets for cocktail dresses and cowboy boots for high heels. She was by no means the first artist to popularize the Nashville Sound, but she was shaping up to be one of its biggest stars. Cline shouldn’t have lived long enough to enjoy this career resurgence. In June 1961, she was involved in a head-on collision on Old Hickory Boulevard in Nashville, not far from where the Grand Ole Opry is today. She was thrown through the windshield and suffered a dislocated hip and broken ribs, and a cut that resulted in a scar running the length of her face. Bloodied by the side of the road, the still-conscious Cline demanded that paramedics treat the other driver first. Almost as soon as she was released from the hospital, she was back on the road and in the studio. She made an appearance at the Opry in a wheelchair, and she performed all over the Midwest on crutches. Reportedly, it took her nearly four hours to apply makeup to hide her scar. It’s difficult to gauge the effect of that accident on her craft. Recording at Bradley’s famous Quonset Hut Studio in downtown Nashville, Cline found that her tender ribs prevented her from singing as forcefully as she once did, and she had to cut some sessions short due to fatigue and intense headaches. This brought a new restraint to her performances, as she created more space for nuance and imagination. Remarkably, there is no sense in her recordings from the early 1960s of an artist re-learning her instrument. She’s not coming into her own as an artist; she’s already there. The fact that she was even recording long-players like Sentimentally Yours reveals the faith her new record label Decca had in her as a commercial force: Most country artists were recording singles, which appealed to a younger demographic, namely teenage girls who could scrounge together change for an inexpensive single. That audience was a growing presence at Cline’s concerts; a full album catered to the adult crowd as well, suggesting Cline was uniting demographics as well as genres. Sentimentally Yours shows how Cline navigated a compelling middle ground between the demands of country tunes and pop standards. The chipper “Heartaches” had been a hit decades earlier for bandleader Guy Lombardo. Cline’s version retains that swinging momentum, allowing her to bounce over the melody like a stone skipping across a lake. “That’s My Desire” was a song most closely associated with Frankie Laine, who had a hit with it in 1946, but no one could muster the mature sexuality that Cline invests in a line like, “I’ll gaze into your eyes divine.” Perhaps the most stunning transformation is “You Made Me Love You (I Didn’t Want to Do It),” most popular as a song Judy Garland sang to a photograph of Clark Gable in the film Broadway Melody of 1938. What had been an ode to starstruck puppy love here becomes something much graver and darker. As for country, Sentimentally Yours includes her versions of “Lonely Street” (a hit for Carl Belew and Kitty Wells) and Eddy Arnold’s “Anytime,” as well as not one or two, but three songs associated with Hank Williams. This version of “Your Cheatin’ Heart,” a favorite from earlier in her career, gets a more cosmopolitan arrangement that crackles with guitar and piano, and she responds by drawing out the last syllables of every line, as though unwilling to cede the spotlight to her backup singers, the Jordanaires. At times Sentimentally Yours plays like a commentary on the history of Nashville crossovers and Cline’s place within that trend. “Half As Much” had already been covered by pop artists like Rosemary Clooney (with Percy Faith & His Orchestra, no less), and Cline strikes a compelling balance between the weighty emotions of Williams’ original with the bouncy cadence of Clooney’s pop cover. Sentimentally Yours reinforces Cline’s persona: She is always the lonely one, the heartbroken, the one who suffers so that another woman can thrive. Love is a zero-sum game. This is the province of country music starting with the Carter Family and Jimmie Rodgers and codified by Hank Williams at the century’s midpoint. But few artists have managed to find so many facets of despair or to express them so carefully, so precisely, and she was digging even deeper into heartaches on the singles that followed this album. “If you’ve got leavin’ on your mind,” she sings on 1963’s “Leavin’ on Your Mind,” “hurt me now. Get it over.” “Leavin’ on Your Mind” was Cline’s last single released during her lifetime, before the plane crash that killed her on March 5, 1963. Cline truly did have leavin’ on her own mind; she told close friends, including Loretta Lynn and June Carter, that she didn’t expect to see 30. Her death at that age cemented her reputation. But her star corroded over time, especially in the late 1970s, when country outlaws, new traditionalists, and southern rockers rejected attempts to polish or de-twang country music. Cline was dismissed as an oldie, the figurehead of an earlier era with questionable aims and outmoded sounds. Her crossover success became a burden to her legacy: proof of some inherent inauthenticity. In the 1980s, however, Cline’s tragically small catalog was reappraised, first with the 1985 feature film Sweet Dreams (a horrendous biopic that’s mostly interested in her ne’er-do-well second husband) and later with compilations like 12 Greatest Hits (a fine starting place for newcomers) and the box set The Patsy Cline Collection (which arranged her catalog chronologically for the first time). Ken Burns devotes a hefty chunk of his new documentary Country Music to her story and her influence in Nashville, and Lifetime has a new biopic that examines the close friendship between Cline and Lynn. Her legacy extends to subsequent generations of young country artists who experiment with pop sounds and vocal stylings without the same hand-wringing that accompanied Cline’s innovations. Well beyond the loss of life and artistic possibility, her early death remains a central aspect of her legacy, threatening to overshadow the stylistic innovations she made at a pivotal moment in country music history. She defined herself with songs about heartache and yearning, and her voice—simultaneously emotive and restrained—made her deeply sympathetic and endlessly relatable. And yet, that plane crash means we never got to see that suffering abate. We never got to see her expand her repertoire to songs that elaborated on that sadness or countered it with contentment. Patsy Cline never even got a chance for a happy ending.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

Days of the Bagnold Summer (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),Belle and Sebastian,by: Zoe Dubno,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d176748b9b74b0008606a99/1:1/w_160/Belle-Sebastian.jpg,2019-09-14 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/belle-and-sebastian-days-of-the-bagnold-summer-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/,Matador,"Belle and Sebastian have soundtracked so many real-life depressed teenagerhoods that they practically invented the genre of “songs to stare out car windows to.” This is probably why, in their 23-year tenure as indie-pop royalty, so many movies and TV shows have relied on their songs, from Juno to High Fidelity to “The O.C.” and “Gilmore Girls” and beyond. Their original film soundtrack Days of the Bagnold Summer will feel familiar to anyone who’s heard the band underscore a dreamy montage sequence. The film, an adaptation of the graphic novel of the same name from rookie director and Inbetweeners star Simon Bird, stars Earl Cave (son of Nick Cave) as a teen equally obsessed with metal and moping in the bathtub. His ennui is only heightened when plans to visit his father in the U.S. are canceled and he’s forced to spend summer vacation alone with his mum. The soundtrack consists of 11 new Belle and Sebastian songs and some instrumentals, along with “I Know Where the Summer Goes,” from the 1998 This Is Just a Modern Rock Song EP, and “Get Me Away From Here, I’m Dying” off of 1996’s If You’re Feeling Sinister. Also on the album is the ancient and excellent “Safety Valve,” a paean to codependency Stuart Murdoch wrote before Belle and Sebastian formed but had never released. “It’s maybe 25 years old,” he wrote in a press release. “The only time I can remember ever playing it was in a coffee shop with a friend of mine and people scratching their heads.” Perhaps we live in a time more accustomed to anxiety and excessive emotional dependence on friends, because there’s no need for head-scratching now: The lyrics (“’Cause sometimes I just need a pal/Thanks for being my safety valve… Hey, I’ve been there before/I’ll save you, it’s a serious bore”) nail the feeling of knowing you’re emotionally overburdening a friend but doing it anyway. Days of the Bagnold Summer’s instrumentals, which comprise the score of the film, are actually are some of the album’s best moments. “We Were Never Glorious,” a greensleeves-y fiddle track, nails the delicate balance of “hopeful yet totally melancholic” and is just the kind of music suited to walking around pretending you’re in a movie. The new songs, meanwhile, feature a return to form for Belle and Sebastian, whose more recent releases have ventured away from their trademark style of “puckishly depressed” and into explorations of the dancy, the jazzy, and, occasionally, the kinda bad. No one can blame them for wanting to experiment, but it’s good to see they’ve shelved the synths for this album. When you have Belle and Sebastian soundtrack your film, there’s likely a particular sound you’re after, and the band doesn’t disappoint. Some numbers, like the excellent “Sister Buddha,” seem like “Classic Belle and Sebastian”—vivid storytelling conveyed through pithy lyrics and sprinkled with empathy. “Step across the lonely threshold of your selfish mind,” Murdoch instructs “Sister Buddha,” “and embrace the loving goodness of your human kind.” Okay! Good advice. Others, however, sound like “Belle and Sebastian doing an impression of Belle and Sebastian.” “Did the Day Go Just Like You Wanted?” seems a bit like an older outfit trying to recapture the tone they’d perfected in a younger iteration. Lyrics like “When the tears roll down on your cheek/You know you’re alive/Let the rain pour down/Let the winter come” feel on the nose in a way they’ve never been before. Perhaps it’s the lyrical complexity of the “oldies” on the album that throw this particularly into focus, making the newer songs seem relatively facile. Which isn’t to say those songs aren’t good—just, it’s hard to beat the champs, even when you are the champs. “Nobody writes them like they used to,” Stuart Murdoch sings on the re-recording of “Get Me Away from Here, I’m Dying,” “so it may as well be me.” Good point.

Mirrorland,EarthGang,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d76619f53e80c0008f437cc/1:1/w_160/earthgang_mirrorland.jpeg,2019-09-14 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/earthgang-mirrorland/,DreamvilleInterscope,"One of the most impressive feats of Donald Glover’s surrealist FX show Atlanta is how it captures the sheer multiplicity of the city’s many characters. The dope dealer turned rising rapper is managed by his homeless Princeton dropout cousin, whose Afro-German girlfriend is a grade-school science teacher with a homegirl who scams pro athletes; it’s on and on like that down to the most minor roles. Atlanta has often been dubbed Black Mecca, in part for the wide swath of black identities it fosters. Among the inheritors of this broad lineage is EarthGang, an ATL duo comprised of rappers Olu (also known as Johnny Venus) and WowGr8 (also known as Doctur Dot), founders of the wide-ranging Spillage Village collective that includes J.I.D., 6LACK, Mereba, Lute, and more. Their debut album, Mirrorland, released on the heels of their Dreamville label’s touted compilation Revenge of the Dreamers III, longs to be a black world unto itself. Mirrorland was inspired by The Wiz, the all-black 1978 adaptation of The Wizard of Oz featuring music produced by Quincy Jones for Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, and Lena Horne. “Atlanta is the Land of Oz,” Olu said in July. “It’s black people just being unafraid and unapologetically creative. Just running around being themselves.” The album certainly has the whimsy and spectacle of a musical, and it’s clear Olu and WowGr8 consider themselves unapologetically creative, too, but there is the sense that this is less about them and more about honoring that down-home creative spark. There is a theatricality to the music, as if they are donning personas and performing bits, paying homage to the many types of people they encounter and the place that produces them. The scope of Mirrorland is wide enough to capture the inexhaustible magic of Atlanta. The songs on Mirrorland are clear attempts to chart the city’s diverse sound. They are rich and constantly shifting and evolving. Produced by Olu, Elite, DJ Dahi, Bink!, Childish Major, and others, this is EarthGang’s most complete record and their most unpredictable one. It is as captivating as it is unusual. When the songs don’t erupt into full-on parades like the groovy hoodoo opener “LaLa Challenge,” they split open into alternate arrangements, like “This Side,” its rippling synths receding to uncover slapping drum programming. The album can swing from funk-rap to trap so quickly that it almost inherently reveals how these styles trace back to the same roots. The shifts are anchored by the two rappers, who dictate the flow with their larger-than-life styles and their flamboyant execution. Some of that performance is at the expense of more personal songwriting. There’s nothing as reflective as the songs on their EP trilogy, Rags, Robots, and Royalty. In place of rapping that communicates more of their individual identities, madcap demonstration takes the fore. Both Olu and WowGr8 can rattle off semi-automatic raps or bellow tuneful chants, or even fuse the two together, as they do on “Top Down.” Olu leans into the cartoonishness of his voice a bit more, while WowGr8 has the conversational tone of a rambler. Both are prone to breaking out into song at any moment, channeling gospel soul or freaky country-fried blues. Their eclecticism and their risk-taking ways are indebted to OutKast; their music, less so. It’s a comparison they’ve gotten almost constantly, and an unfair one, really. They aren’t the rappers André and Big Boi are, nor are they the storytellers. Their relationship to one another is a parallel, oddball to oddball, as opposed to free spirit to pragmatist. Big Boi kept André weighted to the ground; neither here is a tether to Earth, so there’s nothing preventing them both from drifting out into space. But it’s better for them this way. No one can be OutKast, and EarthGang’s unrestrained looseness gives them free rein to do and try just about anything. The ideas sprawled across Mirrorland are mostly in service of songcraft, adding color and texture to their vibrant visions of a super-black Emerald City. It’s Atlanta rap fantasia, manifold in form and style, each track a new, distinctive set design in the production. There’s the trumpeting Afrobeat sashay of “Tequila,” the throwback neo-soul of “Blue Moon,” the out-there BTG-ish balladry of “Proud of U” (with Young Thug in tow). The songs aren’t necessarily about anything in particular, and none of the writing really grabs you, though it does usually contain kernels of insight (“Nigga that you hatin’ on probably got something he could teach your corny ass/While you in the corner grindin’ teeth,” WowGr8 raps on “Avenue”). The album works because of its holism, the sense that its songs make up an entire picture. “Cinematic” is a word they’ve used to describe Mirrorland, but EarthGang’s album isn’t 2D, it’s multidimensional—a marauder’s map of Atlanta as a black paradise.","The debut album from Spillage Village founders Olu and WowGr8 is a whimsical, theatrical attempt to capture the inexhaustible magic of Atlanta.

Devour,Pharmakon,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d77bf9f53e80c0008f43903/1:1/w_160/Pharmakon_Devour.jpg,2019-09-14 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pharmakon-devour/,Sacred Bones,"Throughout her work as Pharmakon, Margaret Chardiet stages existential conflicts—between the self and the body that houses it, between the individual and the unknowable other—by setting her own voice in opposition to brambly, industrial electronics. She cries out against nightmares of her own making as if in the grips of pain or panic. Her fourth full-length album, Devour, simulates a skirmish whose boundary lines are less clear. Instead of pitting the self against an external antagonist, she grapples with the horror of the self attacking the self. Chardiet dedicates Devour to “all who were lost to their own demise, all who have been institutionalized; whether in prison, psychiatric facilities, or drug rehabilitation.” Institutionalized people are often scapegoated for individual problems with systemic causes; crime, self-harm, and addiction get painted as character defects, rather than symptoms of a dysfunctional world. With one of her most harrowing and powerful albums to date, Chardiet zeroes in on the seam between the sick person and the sick ecosystem, the locus where global horrors register on the individual. Devour is the first Pharmakon album Chardiet has recorded live in studio. The A and B sides of the record each comprise a single, continuous session, which lends momentum and immediacy to the music. Though she doesn’t uproot her longtime palette of abrasive electronics, Chardiet deploys new strategies for her vocals, which wobble and fray against a blaring bass tone on opener “Homeostasis.” She howls against instrumentation that seemingly wants to smother her, singing deeply from her diaphragm as if straining to be heard. If some of her earlier work, 2014’s Bestial Burden especially, induced a sense of claustrophobia, then Devour does the opposite: It radiates in open space, as though Chardiet were screaming for help into empty darkness. Between lurches of electronic noise, Chardiet squeals and rasps and growls, her voice lacerated by the barbed-wire sieve of effects. These songs center her prowess as an industrial vocalist, someone who can transmute the chronic trauma of survival under capitalism into an appropriately scathing outburst. But somewhere between the hypnotic throb of “Spit It Out” and the military clip of “Self-Regulating System”’s percussion, Chardiet’s chaos paradoxically prompts a deepening sense of calm. It’s as if, by giving voice to the mesh of self-loathing strangling so many of our brains, she can momentarily dislodge it. One of the most enduring images of autocannibalism is the ouroboros, the snake who eats its own tail. It’s a symbol that creates itself in an attempt to destroy itself: The snake wants to eat its own body, to vanish inside its own digestive tract, but in doing so becomes something more than just a snake. Externalizing the desire to obliterate the self similarly reroutes a destructive impulse into an act of creation. With Devour, Pharmakon furthers industrial music’s decades-long history of seeking truth about the self in noise and negation, of boring holes in the propaganda that assures us everything about the system is working just fine.

Charli,Charli XCX,by: Michelle Kim,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d02570cb6e2e39814c9d294/1:1/w_160/Charli-XCX.jpg,2019-09-13 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/charli-xcx-charli/,Atlantic,"Long before she had firsthand experience with pop music’s star-making assembly line, songwriting camps, and royalty splits, 14-year-old Charli XCX thought that people made music because they were brainwashed by robots. “Who writes the songs/The machines do,” she sings with bug-eyed terror on her unreleased 2008 debut, 14. The lyrics are a little ridiculous, but Charli wasn’t exactly wrong in the assumption that there are complex mechanisms lurking behind most chart-topping songs. She witnessed them in the 2010s, after she signed to a major label and began penning hits for Icona Pop and Iggy Azalea, content to give her most straightforward pop songs to others. On her own albums, whether the gothic True Romance, the punky Sucker, or the avant-garde Pop 2, she subverted mainstream pop conventions, projecting the image of a rave-happy club kid. Always at Charli’s core was the contradiction of loving pop music, yet needing to rebel against the pop machine. Her third studio album, Charli, invites back many of Pop 2’s contributors, as if hoping to recapture its predecessor’s magic. But the record feels conflicted about its intentions. Take Lizzo-featuring “Blame It On Your Love,” a reworking of Pop 2’s transcendent “Track 10” that loses its impact by trading dial-up screeches for a widely appealing, Stargate-produced EDM drop and a dembow-inflected groove. This and the frivolous yet fun chart-pop song “1999” (featuring Troye Sivan) don’t jell with the rest of Charli’s warped club tracks and intimate ballads. Like many self-titled albums, it’s a reflection of the artist: in Charli’s case, one who wants to veer down experimental, transgressive, and queer pathways but constantly contemplates what it would be like to fully enter the mainstream. Much of Charli’s sound is an extension of the corrosive electronics on Pop 2, with producer A. G. Cook at the helm of both. He and his PC Music cohorts (Planet 1999, umru) embrace the synthetic and shiny: Glossy, arena-sized ’80s rock drums, rippling power synths, squeaky J-pop arrangements, and the relentlessly positive sound of Swedish Eurodance are repurposed and exaggerated, evoking the eerie sheen of a hyper-realistic 3D render. On “Shake It,” Charli’s voice is manipulated to sound like bubbling water, before the track is infiltrated by a small army of collaborators including Big Freedia, CupcakKe, Pabllo Vittar, and Brooke Candy, like a futuristic remake of Busta Rhymes’ infamous posse cut “Touch It (Remix).” The beat sounds like someone furiously clanging on boiler room pipes, transforming a nasty strip club track into a soundtrack for mutiny. The credits for “Click,” which ends with a montage of jagged and distorted SOPHIE-like sounds not dissimilar to farts, name 100 gecs’ Dylan Brady as responsible for “harsh noise.” Compared to the bouncy electro-pop of “1999” or the trop-pop production of “Warm” (featuring Haim), these moments provide a thrilling adrenaline rush. Charli’s crisp writing mirrors the vivid production. On “Click,” she turns herself into an onomatopoeic sound effect. The sensory details of “Next Level Charli” establish a scene in seconds: “I go speeding on the highway/Flame burning/Tire screech.” Charli credits Max Martin with teaching her the technique, commonly used by Swedish songwriters, of using words’ natural melody to create catchiness, instead of intentionally rhyming. Lifting the most effective ideas from different schools of production, she’s able to construct her own mutant strain of pop. The album’s most potent song is the synth-pop anthem “Gone,” which blends vulnerability with outré sound. Through gritted teeth, Charli describes a party full of people who make her feel alone: “I feel so unstable/Fucking hate these people,” she sings, using the image of ice melting in her fist to illustrate her sense of panic-inducing isolation. In response, Héloïse Letissier of Christine and the Queens poses questions that are somehow relatable in their absurdity: “Am I a smoke?/Am I the sun?/Who decides?” Letissier’s abstractions are the foil to Charli’s concrete lyrics: The former evokes the spiraling crisis of the mind, the latter the blood-boiling anger that rises in the body. Together, Charli and Letissier reach a cathartic breaking point, a rattling breakdown filled with frosty percussion, dramatic synth stabs, and stuttering vocal chops. In a recent i-D interview, Letissier asserts that Charli’s musical aesthetic, which she describes as a “hybrid” of club experimentation and earworm pop, is “deeply queer.” But in “Gone,” Charli invites another hypothesis for why her music has become so beloved by the LGBTQ+ community: Her ability to evocate a profound sense of unbelonging. When “Gone” explodes, it sounds like two people shattering the box that confined them. Charli’s goal is self-examination—a new step for Charli, who’s better known for her up-tempo hedonistic bangers than her emotional deep cuts. Throughout the album, she pinpoints the source of her anxieties, investigating her relationships with substances, with her romantic partner, and with herself. She does this with heart-wrenching specificity on the ballad “Thoughts,” when, in a drugged-out stupor, she wonders if her friends are genuine. And on the electro-bop “February 2017,” featuring Clairo and Yaeji, she recaptures “Track 10”’s candor. “Sorry ’bout Grammy night/Was lying on my mind/Was in a different place/Tortured and drifting by,” she sings to her partner. So when “Official” arrives, it feels breathtakingly hopeful, as Charli sings of the little details (breakfast in bed, a magical kiss) that make her love real. Charli uncovers a singer-songwriter unafraid to display the cracks in her facade, crafting a striking portrait of what happens when a robot glitches.

Hypersonic Missiles,Sam Fender,by: Joshua Copperman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3b432487626200084cd877/1:1/w_160/SamFender_HypersonicMissiles.jpg,2019-09-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sam-fender-hypersonic-missiles/,Interscope,"Raised on a council estate in North Shields, England from the age of 10, Sam Fender took solace in the music of Bruce Springsteen, finding common ground between Springsteen’s Asbury Park and hardship in his own hometown. Now 25 and a songwriter himself, Fender landed a deal with Polydor and won the Critics’ Choice award at this year’s BRITs before he’d released his first album. When he takes a swing at “pop machine” artifice, or milquetoast peers like James Bay or Ed Sheeran, it’s not just outsider posturing—except that Fender now finds himself on the inside. Label executives have heralded Hypersonic Missiles, his debut album, as the second coming of Bruce. But though Fender’s commitment to addressing serious social issues sets him apart, the well-intentioned Missiles is only intermittently transcendent. The album’s best songs come from the most honest, intimate places. Fender wrote “Dead Boys” in response to friends’ suicides, and the words are terse and direct: “We close our eyes/Learn our pain/No one ever could explain/All the dead boys in our hometown.” It has the fewest lyrics of any song on the record, a restraint that underscores the stigma surrounding male mental health. “The Borders” initially sounds like a stiffer War on Drugs, but its lyrics about the pain of dysfunctional family life are more grounded than Adam Granduciel’s soul-searching. The song ends with some legitimately chilling final lines (“You pinned me to the wall and smashed a bottle/Your eyes the door to hell and all within”), proving Fender is a capable storyteller when he zeroes on a single topic. It’s the kind of intimate, emotional writing that may resonate with other young men questioning their assumptions about masculinity and vulnerability. Fender runs into trouble when he tries to tackle everything at once. The title track climaxes in a thrilling Boss homage (complete with Clarence Clemons-y saxophone solo), but stumbles on the way there as Fender’s protagonist groans, “The tensions of the world are rising higher/We’re probably due another war with all this ire.” The lowest moment is a folk ballad called “White Privilege.” Taking a different approach than the Macklemore songs of the same name, “Privilege” pairs dense harmonies with an onslaught of societal grievances: Brexit, social media, liberal arrogance, political correctness. The critiques are often shallow and, unlike the better songs here, devoid of empathy. Fender says the song was written as a series of characters, but the lyrics are so muddled it’s hard to tell when the perspective shifts. “Privilege” at least represents a risk, while Hypersonic Missiles eventually retreats into previously released singles and songs Fender wrote as a teenager. In his own estimation, the album has “a couple of stinkers” on it, including Hozier pastiche “Call Me Lover.” That song’s peaks and valleys actually help to set it apart: Elsewhere, Fender treats surveillance states (solid 2017 debut single “Play God”), one-night stands (Strokesian romp “Will We Talk?”), and landlord gripes (misbegotten gospel exercise “Saturday”) with identical shouty intensity. The only real non-single highlight from the back half is closer “Use,” which enters intriguing, Nina Simone-inspired territory when Fender dips his voice. Fender may yet live up to the praise he’s received, but the lack of focus and mostly formulaic arrangements on this record won’t get him there. Snow Patrol collaborator Rich Costey’s antiseptic, airless mixes don’t help, robbing even the flourishes (strings, backing choirs, more saxophones) of their potential. In the blandly apolitical landscape of modern rock, Fender’s blend of social commentary and huge choruses offer the suggestion of real conviction.  When he tells stories about human beings rather than philosophizing about the human condition, he sounds like he’s on his way to greatness. But Hypersonic Missiles on its own is unsatisfying, and the overconfident presentation risks stifling his voice before he’s found it.

Lookout Low,Twin Peaks,by: Abby Jones,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d656e1826e2b40009eed791/1:1/w_160/TwinPeaks_LookoutLow.jpg,2019-09-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/twin-peaks-lookout-low/,Grand Jury,"Twin Peaks are one of the most prominent Chicago rock bands of the past decade. If you’re not convinced, scroll through the subreddit dedicated to the quintet, who are lovingly nicknamed “the dudes” by many a Peakshead. For much of the band’s career, the loyalty to Cadien Lake James, Clay Frankel, Jack Dolan, Colin Croom, and Connor Brodner was justified; since their 2013 debut mini-LP Sunken, the band have crafted bustling garage rock that was typically at least pretty good. Like their peers in Whitney and Post Animal (and even their old high school buddy Chance the Rapper), they owe a great deal of their success to the propitious Chicago scene, which builds a safety net from the devotion of their city’s audience. “You want to play well [at hometown shows], but if you play like shit, you know no one’s gonna care,” Frankel told Vice. In a live setting, the band’s music was a catalyst for those rowdy gigs that fans embraced—but on Twin Peaks’ fourth album, Lookout Low, it sounds like they’re finally tired of crowd surfing. Considering Twin Peaks have been at this since they were 19, signs of them growing older were inevitable, but much of Lookout Low sounds more fatigued than mature. This album brings piano and a Croom-arranged horn ensemble to the forefront, invoking classic rock touchstones like the Grateful Dead and the Hollies. Old rock’n’roll influences are nothing new to the band; usually, they’ve been able to manipulate cues from their predecessors into an aesthetic that still felt contemporary. But this time around, like the Dr. Dogs and Edward Sharpes before them, Twin Peaks rely too heavily on these retro methods and often sound blatantly borrowed. As a result, there isn’t a fresh moment throughout the album’s 43 minutes. “Ferry Song,” inspired by Croom’s daily commute into the city during his stay in New Orleans, is about as invigorating as such a commute itself. Opener “Casey’s Groove” is too lethargic to earn its name, and the closing “Sunken II” only reaffirms the record’s monotony. Lyrically, the album doesn’t do too much to redeem itself, and the platitudinal references to “the ice within my heart” and “sing[ing] our favorite songs” feel even more stale amid the tedious instrumentation. Lead single “Dance Through It”—which the band joked recalled Sheryl Crow—lived a short life as a Twitter meme, but it doesn’t leave a lasting memory otherwise. “Got a problem everywhere she goes/But she doesn’t pay mind to it,” James sings, although the stakes must not be so high: All she has to do is “dance through it,” as we’re reminded over 20 times throughout the song. “You’ve been bummin’ around/The bitter heart of December/Blame it all on the weather/Needless to say, I’m glad it exists,” Dolan sings on “Unfamiliar Sun,” as if to say he’s relieved to be able to attribute his laziness to the calendar alone. And then there’s “Better Than Stoned,” where Frankel howls gleefully about finding a love that gets him even higher than marijuana does. There are fleeting moment on Lookout Low, like the rollicking “Oh Mama,” where some of the band’s old charm starts to poke through. There’s a reason local press dubbed Twin Peaks Chicago’s “Next Big Rock Band” in their early days, and for a while, that prediction seemed quite viable. But here, they mostly sound exhausted—like they’ve run out of ideas or motivation. When Dolan sings “I really run my mouth/I hardly use my brain,” he and his bandmates make it difficult to disagree.

Something Like a War,Kindness,by: Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d72993c2073fe00084eb108/1:1/w_160/Kindness_SomethingLikeAWar.jpg,2019-09-13 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kindness-something-like-a-war/,Female Energy,"Though Adam Bainbridge, the British producer who records as Kindness, hasn’t released a record in five years, they remain quietly influential. Their credits aren’t extensive, but they are consistent, and Bainbridge’s handiwork is on some of the decade’s most gorgeous songs: Solange’s “Cranes in the Sky,” several tracks on Blood Orange’s Cupid Deluxe and Freetown Sound, and Robyn’s simmering nostalgia reverie “Send to Robin Immediately.” In 2012, the brushed-chrome polish of their arrangements set World, You Need a Change of Mind a little off the popular pulse; now the sound is everywhere. Like all of Kindness’s work, Something Like a War is produced with deceptively invisible skill. Contributors and session musicians include Arthur Russell collaborator Mustafa Ahmed, a cadre of rising jazz stars, and several guest artists, many of whom appeared on Bainbridge’s monthly RBMA radio show. While the album is named for a documentary about India’s population control program, and begins with a fairly explicit statement of political themes—an Underground Resistance sample leads into the slogan, “build your people, make them equal”—more often it’s a record of personal as political, subtle as pointed, softness as weapon. Bainbridge’s production is always tasteful and seldom bad, but is only great when heightened by its guests. On Something like a War, those guests are generally pretty good; sometimes they are very good. Bainbridge lends Gambian Swedish singer Seinabo Sey an arrangement as sumptuous as her voice, something her solo album didn’t always do. They bring Jazmine Sullivan out of hiatus for funk standout “Hard to Believe,” and she shocks the track alive. Several songs feature Robyn. The downside is that when Bainbridge’s guests recede into the background, sometimes the songs do as well. “Who You Give Your Heart To” and “Dreams Fall” aim for intimate and wind up sleepy. “No New Lies” is a nocturnal brooder made for late-night sets and half-lit streets; it’s also a little lost amid its surroundings. The mood becomes so muted that when ’90s Philadelphia rapper Bahamadia appears on the title track, a verse full of overearnest psychspeak (“mood switched up to the gaslighting stuff … the narcissist in ’em I couldn’t tame”) nevertheless provides a jolt of tempo that makes the feature sound better than it is. This effect, a stylish melting into the background, is maybe best seen on the Robyn tracks. Kindness is more interested in mood-setting than big moments, which means that “Cry Everything,” a song about the heavens bursting open, doesn’t work; there’s no moment of catharsis, and somehow, a Robyn song about sobbing becomes a letdown. She’s better deployed on “The Warning,” a ballad that meanders but soon finds its way to a chorus—the almost a cappella plaint “will you tell me, did you ever care?”—that plays so directly to her strengths it’s almost funny. And “Softness as a Weapon” brings out the best in both artist and producer: Robyn’s warmth matches the slow-growing, horn-flecked instrumental, production perfectly matched to theme. Like Bainbridge’s highlights of the decade, it kindles tension, rather than slackening it—building a mood, rather than assuming one.

Free,Iggy Pop,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d717ce547318e000977d846/1:1/w_160/IggyPop_Free.jpg,2019-09-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/iggy-pop-free/,Loma VistaCaroline,"Years ago, the world tacitly accepted there was a line separating Jim Osterberg and his feral creation Iggy Pop. Osterberg devised the street-walking cheetah persona of Iggy Pop as a way to tap into his primal urges, but the idea that he was playing a role only came into focus when he managed to survive to tell tales about his hedonism. At this point, decades after his image softened enough so he could score a Top 40 hit and sell travel tickets on TV, the split personality is so accepted it nearly seems like a cliché: Whether he’s on or off stage, he plays the part that’s expected. Free finds Iggy Pop embracing the notion that he’s playing Iggy Pop. In its liner notes, Iggy admits “this is an album in which other artists speak for me, but I lend my voice,” and that he consented to this peculiar situation because he felt “drained” at the conclusion of the cycle for Post Pop Depression, his 2016 collaboration with Queens of the Stone Age’s Josh Homme. A clever fusion of the gnarled fuzz of the Stooges and the arch artiness of Pop’s ’70s Berlin collaborations with David Bowie, Post Pop Depression sounded like an Iggy Pop album was supposed to sound like. It was, to use a phrase Pop coined himself, “a rock album with popular punks,” the snide explanation he gave for his record company rejecting his Francophile 2012 album Après. Free belongs to the same lineage as Après and Préliminaires, the 2009 album where Iggy returned to his jazzy arthouse inspirations. It’s such a departure from Post Pop Depression that it nearly feels like a repudiation, yet that isn’t quite true. It’s merely another iteration of the divide between Iggy Pop and Jim Osterberg: Homme brought out the rocker, while Free allows Osterberg to turn inward and meditate. It’s a guided meditation, directed by Leron Thomas, a jazz trumpeter from Houston, and Noveller, the stage name of the Brooklyn-based musician Sarah Lipstate, who specializes in “guitarscapes.” Neither Thomas nor Noveller are particularly well-known. Pop happened upon them both as he was searching for music to play on his regular BBC Radio show and within their music, he recognized a moody elasticity that suits his flights of introspection. Hiring the pair to tap into this dusky, brooding vibe, Pop gave them a pair of poems to act as a lodestar for their compositions—Lou Reed’s “We Are the People,” Dylan Thomas’ middle-school prerequisite “Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night”—and then sat back, collaborating on occasion but otherwise performing songs handed to him. Thomas and Noveller both make a conscious decision to appeal to the parts of Pop that lie above the waist, writing songs that address matters of the head, heart, and soul. The closest Free gets to the carnal is “Dirty Sanchez,” a Thomas-written screed against online sexuality that Pop had to be persuaded to record. It’s odd to think that the author of “Cock in My Pocket” and “I Wanna Be Your Dog” balked at the line “Just because I like big tits/Doesn’t mean I like big dicks,” but the song isn’t meant to be kinky or titillating; it’s tired, enervated by the onslaught of cheap online sex and, in that sense, it fits the rest of Free, which is filled with songs where the narrator yearns to be anywhere other than where he is at the moment. That yearning isn’t especially urgent, however. Free runs a mere 34 minutes but it meanders, lingering in shimmering twilight vistas, luxuriating in reverb and gaining a bit of momentum when the bass line of “James Bond” nods at spy movies. Every element, whether electronic rhythms or swells of keyboard or stabs of a trumpet, is used as texture, letting Iggy savor the words he recites and croons. Often, the lyrics are as skeletal and suggestive as the music, lending Free a certain spectral quality; the album threatens to come into focus but resolutely resists to offer anything more concrete than whispers and suggestions. The haziness of Free has its share of frustrations—as alluring as the pensive soundscapes are, it’s hard not to wish they were occasionally more sculpted—but there’s something curiously human and appealing about its ungainly nature. Once again, Iggy Pop is standing outside of the zeitgeist, separating himself from the digital clamor and processed noise that constitutes popular culture at the twilight of the 2010s. Age certainly plays a factor in Pop’s current cultural isolation. Now in his early 70s, Iggy can’t be bothered with the clatter that constitutes hipness, yet he’s not ready to settle down. He’s restless but in a subdued fashion, happy to play the part of Iggy Pop not because he lacks energy or imagination, but because this subjugation allows him the freedom he craves.

Lifetime,Klein,by: Thea Ballard,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d726dd67cf67c000854d5f3/1:1/w_160/Klein_Lifetime.jpg,2019-09-12 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/klein-lifetime/,ijn inc,"The musical sensibility that the South London experimental producer Klein has developed over the course of her previous records and assorted performance commissions is unmistakable and evolving. Jagged soundscapes made from loops of melodic fuzz and pop-culture samples harbor memories both personal and cultural. Klein’s own voice floats throughout—sometimes as sung language, sometimes in the form of abstract groans or ululations. Her surfaces are uneven, and there’s a multitude of weird, hyper-specific detail to get lost in; the overall effect, though, feels like searching—for sounds, for workable forms, for lost or hidden selves. On Lifetime, Klein sprawls more comfortably into sonic space than she has before in her recorded music. Totality becomes a possibility: the approximation of a whole. Lifetime is structured as a series of interlocking cycles, and as it resolves and unfurls, it seems to ask: What does the tension between duration and transformation sound like? Klein has said this is a deeply personal album, akin to “giving someone your diary.” That doesn’t mean it’s informative in some extractive sense—more that it’s characterized by an abstract sort of openness throughout. Especially on the album’s A-side, she plays with proximity in the way she collages sounds: The opener toys with a wordless sung pop hook, first at the front of the listener’s ear, piled atop ambling distortion, and then, once the instrumental portion of the track has suddenly dropped away, at an echoey distance. A chorus emerges, combining both vantage points to a lightly dissonant effect. If we can access a person through their voice—an idea that is present but certainly not stable in these songs—we contend with her as simultaneously a performer and an intimate. I’ve long associated Klein’s sound with a combination of vocal experimentation and the distorted grain of digitally collaged sound. Instrumentation, however, comes more crisply to the fore here, drawing our attention away from the record’s crackling interstices and toward a set of classical sounds perhaps more confidently invested with representational power. “Silent” blooms with cycles of hurried, ecstatic percussion, against which a brief, stunning piano line is introduced; a version of this pairing resurfaces a few tracks later on the choppier, more discordant “Never Will I Disobey.” Saxophonist and sound artist Matana Roberts guests on the gently roiling “For What Worth,” and her playing is one of the clearer shapes within the blurry samples that form the song’s shifting ground. Present, too, are samples of dialogue from Spencer Williams’ early-20th century American race films, sculpted with spiritual vocals on “We Are Almost There” into a swell of vocal expression—featuring Klein’s voice, too, and thus developing a textured chorus that spans a century. The 10-minute track “Honour” is one of the least musical offerings here, and gives Lifetime its unlikely pinnacle. Spoken voices—Klein’s? Her mother’s?—are presented in a sort of field-recorded argument about theology, faith, family. “Forgiving and forgetting. What does forgiving and forgetting require? Accountability. The Bible also speaks about accountability,” Klein says. The voices that make up the conversation become processed with vocoder effects, and background sound takes the shape of an ominous, percussive squelch. We return from that sound to music proper, ambivalent ambient tones and a series of swelling, slow-burning textures: to resolve the conflict to which we were just privy? To echo or to burn away the everyday pain of family and faith? In these soundscapes, the banal and the intense, music performed and sound happenstance, collapse into one another. Lifetime is marked by aesthetic and personal conflict, and while it doesn’t uncover easy resolution, its beauty (and it is a remarkably beautiful record) derives in large part from the acceptance, or even embrace, of those conflicts as what generates a lifetime’s meaning.","On her most personal album to date, the UK experimental musician retains her focus on the ambiguities of the processed human voice while bringing traditional instrumentation to the fore.

When We Are Inhuman,Bonnie “Prince” BillyBryce DessnerEighth Blackbird,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d63f6e626e2b40009eed696/1:1/w_160/whenweareinhuman.png,2019-09-12 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bonnie-prince-billy-bryce-dessner-when-we-are-inhuman/,37d03d,"When We Are Inhuman is a prickly collection of traditional folk tunes interspersed with Bonnie “Prince” Billy songs, all of them arranged for the contemporary classical ensemble Eighth Blackbird. The mood is both playful and haunted: The arrangements are so spare that the instruments seem to hover a few inches off the ground, and Oldham’s voice, always a little eerie, winds through the space between them, sounding disembodied. The folk tunes were arranged by Bryce Dessner, the Oldham songs by Eighth Blackbird pianist Lisa Kaplan, and taken together, they address approximately the same things: the cruel side of devotion, the animalistic side of love, the devotional aspect of sex. Like all good folk songs, they seem to mix everything up with everything else. Sex has always been rich soil for Oldham; in his writing, even the most graphic acts (see “So Everyone,” from the 2008 album Lie Down in the Light) sound tender. “Beast For Thee,” from his 2005 album with Matt Sweeney, is one of his most fervent (and horniest) love songs: “Astride my horny horn/You’ll be in glory born/And I’ll be a beast for thee,” he exults. Kaplan’s arrangement, centered around mallet percussion, piano, and plucked strings, is a little anodyne —it sounds like it could soundtrack a bank commercial—but it also reveals a new fragility to Oldham’s promise to be “a beast.” It sounds less ribald than humble, an act of abjection. Oldham seems to watch the animal kingdom closely, understanding, maybe, that we’re going to share their vantage point on the earth sooner or later, so he might as well learn what he can now. “One With the Birds,” another of his most beloved songs, appears here, with an arrangement that goes the obvious route of suggesting birdsong. But it also makes great use of the piano, with a music-box verse melody so delicate it sounds dreamt and some ominous low notes that rumble out at the end, reinforcing the lurking note of death. Snuck into the middle is “Underneath the Floorboards,” a piece that Dessner adapted from the Sufjan Stevens song “John Wayne Gacy, Jr.” The thematic connection between Stevens’ song and the other material on When We Are Inhuman is unclear, but it probably has something to do, again, with the intimacy of violence: Stevens’ song is a work of empathy, impossible to listen to without feeling an uncomfortable shiver of pity for Gacy. Dessner’s arrangement is macabre, more interested in evoking the things rotting beneath the floorboards than exploring the mindstate of the man hiding them. There’s another name included on When We Are Inhuman: Julius Eastman. Eastman was a brilliant, contentious, troubled figure in Downtown NYC history, a composer whose acidic intelligence often rattled his contemporaries. He performed and improvised; he blended the minimalism of Steve Reich and Philip Glass with swing and jazz; he sang with Meredith Monk on Dolmen Music. When he died, he was homeless and it took eight months to publish an obituary. To conclude When We Are Inhuman, Eighth Blackbird offers Eastman’s “Stay On It,” a 1973 piece in which a bright, leaping piano figure gets string double stops daubed over it like Bob Ross clouds. High voices sing “stay on it” in the background, a little off beat and a little off-key. It is the sound of a city block party, full of human bustle and clamor and sidelong interjections from clarinet and violin like honking cars. There’s a peculiar edge to it—something in the slightly soured edges of the harmonies suggests an underlying irony, but it never hardens into sarcasm or cruelty. All of Eastman’s work shared this gnawing, anarchic restlessness. It is entirely unclear why Eastman’s music is sharing this particular space, or what Dessner and Eighth Blackbird wish to suggest about Oldham’s similarities to Eastman. They both have a subversive spirit, maybe? Eastman’s music has steadily accrued new champions over the past decade, and it’s gratifying to see another high-profile inclusion of one of his vital works. But in general, this confusion is endemic to the project, which is full of excellent performances of strong repertoire without a lot of obvious common ground. Eastman’s work is brilliant, fiendish, devouring—he upended conventions and expectations wherever he performed, and there’s something uneasy and odd about his bookend status here.

Sun Rings,Terry RileyKronos Quartet,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d693d1fb6cdc30008611614/1:1/w_160/kronosquartet_sunrings.jpg,2019-09-12 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/terry-riley-kronos-quartet-sun-rings/,Nonesuch,"To call Terry Riley a minimalist is to ignore a large part of his history. Yes, the iconic American composer and his seismic 1964 signature composition In C all but codified the modern classical genre, but Riley has been adding teeming elements to his music ever since, most ambitiously with his writing for Kronos Quartet. Beginning with the string quartets of 1985’s Cadenza on the Night Plain, Riley and the members of Kronos have enjoyed a decades-long dialogue. Along the way Riley’s music has absorbed many other timbres and rhythms, including jazz, rock, waltz, electronic polyrhythms, and Latin music (and that’s not counting the many sounds contained within their epic Salome Dances For Peace), in a way that’s decidedly maximal yet still feels streamlined. The scope of Riley’s Sun Rings transcends terrestrial music altogether, turning an ear to the sounds beyond Earth and utilizing recordings sent back home by Voyager I and II. The cosmic is inherent in Riley’s most exquisite works, but in making it explicit on Sun Rings, that theme becomes pedestrian. When they played the piece at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 2004, the musicians waved their hands to set off motion sensor-triggered whooshing sounds; it was cringingly archaic. The performance was set against a backdrop of space visuals, but the multimedia piece would have seemed outdated even on a 1980s episode of Nova. Numerous performances have followed in the subsequent decade, giving them opportunities to refine some aspects of the piece. The presentation of Sun Rings in full here—one movement from a studio recording previously appeared in Kronos’ 2015 Terry Riley box set—feels decidedly more mellow, if still a little underwhelming. A sampled voice discussing “whistlers” (or very low frequency or VLF electromagnetic waves) introduces the piece as sounds swirl. NASA transmissions and outer-space noise have been a part of electronic music since the 1990s, but hearing them folded into Riley’s work in the 21st century feels stiff and a little cheesy. The subtle, thrumming rhythms and hovering melodies of the quartet make early movements like “Hero Danger” a pleasant, albeit mild, listen; the warbling electronics approximate what a Kronos Quartet remix from the Orb might sound like. The murky metallic humming that courses beneath the elegant melodic lines of “Planet Elf Sindoori” almost tip it into the nebulous realm of dub. But the zigzagging, overwrought theme of “Beebopterismo” wholly disrupts the spacey ambience that precedes it. The quartet saws away in a bizarrely intrusive, busybody fashion, as if trying to simply make their presence known. For all of that showiness, the strings are soon drowned in a wash of garbled electronics. “The Electron Cyclotron Frequency Parlour” similarly toggles between refined, elongated passages that swim amid the sonic detritus of the Voyager recordings and a more frantic and dramatic theme that lashes against it. That’s not to suggest that some balance isn’t struck, as the noisy, clanging charge of “Venus Upstream” fares far better. Reveling in the strange, otherworldly textures of outer space may have made Sun Rings a placid enough home listen, but it’s as Riley turns his gaze back to Earth and strives to make grand, overarching platitudes that the piece sputters and buckles under its own weight. Luminous choirs emerge on centerpiece “Prayer Central,” but as voices recite lines from “A Child’s Bedtime Prayer,” the atmosphere turns cluttered. Riley’s desire to “represent the voice of humanity in its struggle to understand the meaning of our place in this unfathomable universe” becomes too much for the piece to bear across its 16 minutes. The finale, “One Earth, One People, One Love,” drives that point home like a spaceship crashing into earth. “Do you really know where you are at this point in time and space and in reality and existence?” asks a voice, as Alice Walker recites the titular phrase and bits of percussion flutter around in the mix. Such samples would be a virtual godsend were you making an ambient house track in the 1990s, setting up a big, profound, guilty pleasure of a break. But Riley and Kronos oddly tiptoe around such a payoff. Instead of delivering a maximal release, they give us minimalism at its least effective.

Resonant Body,Octo Octa,by: Chris Randle,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d7178d547318e000977d842/1:1/w_160/OctoOcta_ResonantBody.jpg,2019-09-11 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/octo-octa-resonant-body/,T4T LUV NRG,"“I loathe crowds,” the novelist Edmund White wrote after visiting the Flamingo, one of New York’s first gay discos. “But tonight the drugs and the music and the exhilaration had stripped me of all such scruples. We were packed in so tightly we were forced to slither across each other’s wet bodies and arms; I felt my arm moving like a piston in synchrony against a stranger’s—and I did not pull away. Freed of my shirt and my touchiness, I surrendered myself to the idea that I was just like everyone else.” Dance music promises relief from self-consciousness, even while the class system reified by many clubs inflames it. Resonant Body, the new album by DJ and producer Octo Octa, celebrates moments like that night at the Flamingo—when temporary intimacy coaxes the bashful into gasping emotion. Octo Octa named her last record Where Are We Going?, a note of ambivalence that echoed through its tracklist: “Adrift,” “No More Pain (Promises to a Younger Self),” “Fleeting Moments of Freedom (Wooo).” Maya Bouldry-Morrison had just come out as a trans woman, and her songs kept circling discursively, as if feeling their way beyond anxiety. Resonant Body sheds any lingering unease, beating in time with the palpitations of euphoria. Lead single “Spin Girl, Let’s Activate!” is a wry joy, looping together get-on-the-floor vocals before teasing the tempo down again. When Bouldry-Morrison introduces piano stabs, the chords race endlessly upwards, growing more ardent each time they return. “Imminent Spirit Arrival” shows off that ear for dynamics: A shouted “go!” cuts through the bass’s lustrous darkness, like some neon sign flickering briefly to life, until she strips everything back to the hi-hats alone. It’s the shiver of recognition amid collective bliss. Resonant Body finds words for its exuberance in a raucous chorus of vocal samples. The title phrase of “Move Your Body” blares out over and over, refracted into many parallel variations—a banger that works your subconscious. “Can You See Me?” pinballs around between breakbeats, always returning to the same line: “I know exactly how you feel.” The message could be house music’s oath, but by isolating that intensely tender vocal, Bouldry-Morrison deepens its ambiguities. Resonant Body celebrates 1990s rave anthems with a bittersweet sense of vanished time—the party ended long ago, the dancers shut their eyes against daylight, but balloons still float around the room on inherited breath. That spiralling ecstasy gets relieved by a late interlude, “My Body Is Powerful,” which calls back to the earlier, more introspective Octo Octa. Its sound world of trilling birds and ambient tones feels both haunting and comforting, an ecosystem recreated from memory. As distant chimes broke the tranquility, I thought of a passage in Alan Hollinghurst’s novel The Spell, when the shyly dorky narrator goes clubbing for the first time: “The music possessed him, he lived it with his whole body, but his ear had become so spacious and analytic that he could hear quite distinctly the hubbub of everyone talking, like the booming whisper of tourists in a cathedral.” At the end of Resonant Body, every lone voice merges into a loud multitude. One short snippet in “Power to the People” comes from a 1980s ACT-UP rally, but otherwise the protest marchers that Bouldry-Morrison samples chant inaudible words. Letting them drown each other out, she captures that moment when individuals become the masses, a divinely ordinary transfiguration; you can even hear an organ playing. Solidarity is the work of relating to strangers, understanding people who might have nothing in common besides a shared cause. Until it finds a sympathetic form to resonate against, music is only noise.","Maya Bouldry-Morrison’s album is a celebration of the qualities—intimacy, ambiguity, physicality, release—that lead to dancefloor catharsis.

The Blue EP,Death Cab for Cutie,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d6fe5f7b34908000801000a/1:1/w_160/theblue_deathcabforcutie.png,2019-09-11 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/death-cab-for-cutie-the-blue-ep/,Atlantic,"2018’s Thank You For Today was Death Cab For Cutie’s first album completely divorced from guitarist/producer Chris Walla and the first where they didn’t really try anything new. Offering proficiency and easy nostalgia over emotional investment, it was a safe-bet vote for fan service over the flawed experiments of Kintsugi and Codes and Keys. On its best (or at least its most familiar) moments, longtime fans could close their eyes and briefly forget that “Black Sun” ever happened. The dullest Death Cab single in their history by a wide margin, “Black Sun” was the band’s attempt to endear themselves to KROQ neighbors Muse and Imagine Dragons, inflating their lyrics with meaningless portent and their arrangements with blown-out solos and production befitting a guy named Rich Costey. The disconnect with Gibbard’s bashful vocals made “Black Sun” the equivalent of a Duplass brother donning a CGI-sculpted muscle suit for a Marvel movie. And yet on The Blue EP, Gibbard seems to have taken the commercial reception of “Black Sun” as a mandate for more of the same. Where he used to find indirect ways to sneak brute force into his writing, here he moves in lockstep with the band’s bolder sound, writing in the biggest and broadest strokes. A rock band gets big enough and they eventually write a song like “Before the Bombs,” which pits an anonymous couple against some unspecified atrocity in an unnamed part of the world.  What is “the only thing” the bombs couldn’t take away from the doomed lovers? I’ll give you one guess. Meanwhile, “Kids in ’99” offers a retelling of the Olympic Pipeline Explosion in their hometown of Bellingham, Washington. It has an obvious precedent in “Grapevine Fires,” a highlight from 2008’s Narrow Stairs, their last near-great album. But where the latter slowly smoldered, “Kids in ’99” leaves little room for Gibbard to expand beyond a disappointingly dispassionate, literal rendering of the event—he’s “thinking ’bout those kids back in ’99” without ever indicating what he thought, or why. “Man in Blue” is more in line with Thank You For Today, melodically sweet and lyrically inert and proof their robust sound isn’t going anywhere, regardless of who’s behind the boards. (They produced this one themselves.) Every Death Cab EP contributes at least something essential to their catalog, and “To the Ground” nearly compensates for the rest of Blue’s flaws. Death Cab have long been fixated on Krautrock, a style of music that relieves Gibbard from having to be the focal point for a band that’s basically just him in the public eye. So it’s surprising that “To the Ground” contains some of his most vivid lyrics since Transatlanticism, as he watches a totalled car become one with the earth: “Down in the charred remains/Stripped the chassis clean/And the bramble grew through the frame/’Til it swallowed everything.”  “Blue Bloods” is likewise a best-case scenario for late-period Death Cab, reconciling the underrated mean streak of Gibbard’s work on Barsuk with his current budget: “All these East Coast blue bloods that come out west/And I watch them argue about who loved you the best,” Gibbard sings, his thoughts “tied together like boulders with a piece of twine.” It’s a nice metaphor for a concept that never quite holds, and a tease at the ever-elusive “return to form.” Could Death Cab For Cutie make a whole album like this if Gibbard really wanted to? But you know who doesn’t seem to miss old Death Cab For Cutie? Ben Gibbard. He sobered up in 2011 and took up “ultrarunning,” and now he’s a magnetic presence in peak physical shape leading a hit parade on stage after years of being an inessential live act even during their artistic peak. He can ignore Codes and Keys altogether. He’s been on a Chance the Rapper album. “Northern Lights” might recall the band’s glory days about as much as Silversun Pickups do Smashing Pumpkins, but it gets regular spins on alt-rock radio because it’s the new Death Cab For Cutie single. If Gibbard can’t or won’t access the emotional stakes that might help Death Cab’s new music transcend mere brand stewardship, I don’t blame him.

Is He Real?,IDK,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d7179c013ff690008c6ef8b/1:1/w_160/IDK_IsHeReal.jpg,2019-09-11 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/idk-is-he-real/,ClueWarner,"Maryland rapper IDK wants to be rap’s next great aesthetician. His major-label debut, Is He Real?, is a concept album of sorts, in the way all of his projects are; there is a theme and a structure but it isn’t actually beholden to them. The “He” in the title is God, the framework around which the album is built. It opens with a kid denying God’s existence, and an uneven discourse unfolds from there, with rap theology serving as plot points along the album’s arc: a DMX prayer, a conversation about divinity with Tyler, the Creator, a hood psalm from GLC, and IDK playing Devil’s advocate. In the end, these outlooks crescendo into the PG County rapper arguing that humans don’t have the capacity to dispute His being; the end result of his probe is basically the shrugging emoticon. His unspooling scriptural thread is easy enough to follow. It’s what happens in between that makes the album perplexing. It doesn’t always track, and its pursuit of grandiosity feels largely fruitless. Even at its most lucid, it falls well short of lofty ambitions. IDK, whose name stands for Ignorantly Delivering Knowledge, considers himself a polymath and educator. (He helped people get their GEDs in prison.) He clearly wants his songs to appeal to the rap thinkers, for listeners to have to peel back the layers of meaning and have epiphanies. He has labeled his music “suburban trap” or trap with substance, trying to collapse a nonexistent lowbrow-highbrow trap binary, as if Jeezy’s The Recession never happened. His songs aren’t deep enough to warrant or hold up under dissection and they aren’t ignorant enough to scan as brainless amusement. A student of Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar, he aspires to hifalutin aesthetics and big ideas. This album is a self-professed effort to lay a foundation for future classics. “This will be the Section.80 mixtape before my good kid, m.A.A.d city,” he vowed in The Fader. But Is He Real? isn’t the raw display of talent Section.80 was, and it is far less inspired—musically and conceptually. There is a whiff of self-importance that IDK struggles to live up to. He is an intriguing, occasionally even stimulating rapper who has yet to really bring any of his (sometimes bland, sometimes bold) visions to life. In this instance, IDK never really gets to the point. What is to be gained by posing this question here and now? What is to be gained by failing to answer it? The aesthetic argument claims that art itself is proof of God’s existence, but this album never scratches the surface of something that meta, much less a conclusive purpose. Given the heavy Kendrick influence, IDK almost forces a comparison he can’t possibly do justice to. It’s hard not to wonder how much more depth the Compton rapper could’ve brought to this idea. IDK can be a clever writer, but he doesn’t have nearly the skill or the range to prevent a subject this huge from crushing him beneath its weight. Neither preacher nor parishioner nor nonbeliever, he has a hard time saying anything definitively and with emphasis. Within a clusterfuck of thoughts, he strains to connect songs like “Alone” and “Digital” into his larger spiritual saga. The songs are designed to transition seamlessly from one to the next but the shifts are inconsistent; sometimes hollow, sometimes overwrought, sometimes challenging. His singing, however, is pleasantly surprising. He ably flips the dancehall classic “Murder She Wrote” (on “December,” with a more than game Burna Boy) and Amerie’s “Why Don’t We Fall in Love” (on “I Do Me … You Do You”), interpolating the latter and using the former as a backbone for an afro-fusionist jam. He also doles out his unexpectedly malleable voice to expound upon on the album’s lesser ideas: the collective consciousnesses’ diminishing attention span (“No Cable”), money as the root of all evil (“24”), and golddiggers as embodiments of sinfulness (“Lilly”). In one instance, he’s jaded and mournful; the other, he’s flamboyantly flexible; the third, he’s impish. He cites Frank Ocean as an influence, and his croons are a nice chaser for his rap bravado. The album’s best song has nothing to do with its almighty dialogue: “Porno,” a libidinous collaboration with Pusha-T and J.I.D., feels like an extension of Pusha’s “Sociopath.” At its core, it’s a song about a sexualized society that, among other things, finds space to mimic the intro of “Wannabe” by Spice Girls. (IDK’s attempt to weave this into the wider narrative is to simply rap, “Bad hoes is the devil, like 666” and “The bible say beatin’ my dick and killin’ is equal/But that don’t add up.”) Unlike so much of what happens on this album, “Porno” is fun-loving and low-stakes. He isn’t overthinking it. Along with outliers like “No Cable,” it is the nexus of an interesting thought experiment: If IDK wasn’t so married to tawdry themes, his music would be much better. His songs wouldn’t be undermined by his desire to be recognized as a philosopher and auteur. For all the album’s shortcomings, Is He Real? has many really exciting compositional flourishes. A team effort helmed primarily by IDK with beatmakers Eden Eliah Nagar and Rascal, the production is rich and diverse, often familiar but never derivative: the Pi’erre Bourne-ish funhouse thrills of “Digital,” the ugly, “HUMBLE.”-esque piano mash of “24,” and the meditative sampling of “No Cable” and “Julia …,” are all satisfying in their own ways. “Julia …,” for its part, also happens to be a gut-wrenching remembrance of his mother, who died of AIDS in 2016. The album could’ve used more of those personal revelations and less biblical revelations.","The major-label debut from the Maryland rapper clearly wants to appeal to the thinkers, but even at its most lucid, this loosely conceptual album falls well short of lofty ambitions.

The Competition,Lower Dens,by: Kevin Lozano,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cef4735c13a4570e4e836c3/1:1/w_160/Lower%20Dens_The%20Competition_4200x4200_300%20dpi.jpg,2019-09-11 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lower-dens-the-competition/,Ribbon Music,"The Baltimore band Lower Dens are no strangers to fitting sophisticated political thinking into pop songs. 2015’s Escape From Evil imagined a queer utopia built from the sounds of the past, and frontperson Jana Hunter’s rich voice made that future sound both vivid and elusive, an inspired marriage of sound and message. Their latest record The Competition might be their most explicitly political and theoretical yet, which is to say it is also their most didactic. It’s called The Competition because, according to Hunter, the album considers the “socio-psychological” impact generated by the aggressions of capitalism and the free market. Conceptually, it’s almost an extension of Escape From Evil: Where that album mined pop history to track a course toward a queer future, The Competition is mired in the muck of the present, finding beauty and horror in the everyday. Sonically, it shares a lot with Escape From Evil, steeped in the sounds of the ’70s and ’80s, evoking at once the heat of Throbbing Gristle and the sheen of Roxy Music. It’s a lot for one album to take on, and while Lower Dens tackle their themes with commendable ambition and skill, they run into some rough spots. Forced through the sieve of the overarching concept, some of the songs, both in sound and content, come off as overwrought and obvious. Take “Empire Sundown,” the closest the album comes to a call to arms. Hunter sings about the urgent need for revolution—“They take everything but they/Can’t tell us how to defend ourselves/The tide is gonna turn”—but the robotic drawl of their voice and chug of the drum machine denudes the effect. Amidst a frenzy of flashing synths on “Simple Life,” Hunter reflects on the the class divide, a little clumsily: “Chain ourselves to circumstances/I needa/Gotta know/If we ever had a chance.” There are moments where the beauty of the music matches the seriousness of the writing. In “I Drive,” featuring the singer :3LON, Hunter spins a tale about the hegemony of heterosexuality wrapped up in the pure pleasure of retro pop. And on “Young Republicans,” which is about the death drive of the right wing, Hunter delivers the album’s sharpest line (“Born without souls or blood or skin/We’re young republicans”) with elan. The strongest songs are the simplest: The Competition’s highlight is “Real Thing,” which came out three years before the album was even announced. It’s a heartbreaking track, made to sound like a sock-hop standard, redolent of the Boomer ennui of The Big Chill. Using all those symbols, Hunter tells the album’s best story: of the love one goes searching for outside the confines of traditional marriage. “I’m married to a terrific guy/I’ll never leave until I die/But I just love to get out and get it on/I don’t wanna live possessed by a memory,” Hunter sings at the start, before a beautiful tangle of guitar synth joins them. What makes this song so effective—so affecting, maybe—is pretty basic: The power of Hunter’s voice, the clarity of the writing, and the richness of the sound stick in the way the album’s more labored songs can’t. It’s a political song, in so much as it inverts expectations, it hijacks tropes and makes them something new. But it’s exceptional for a whole other reason, too. It’s a great love song—one that just cracks you open.

Hollywood’s Bleeding,Post Malone,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d71762bc7531e0008f96fd8/1:1/w_160/postmalone_hollywoodsbleeding.jpg,2019-09-10 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/post-malone-hollywoods-bleeding/,Republic,"Nothing about Post Malone suggests “career pop musician” but that is exactly what he has become. Speaking purely in numbers, he’s just about the most ubiquitous pop musician alive: His songs multiply in the culture right now like kudzu or prairie dogs. He takes Jimmy Fallon to the Olive Garden and Medieval Times; he sells his own limited-edition Crocs. He emerges from Rolls Royce crashes unscathed and touches cursed objects on episodes of Ghost Adventures. Pop music is a little bit like Post Malone’s very own Hanna-Barbera cartoon right now, and he is somehow both Shaggy and Scooby. There are plenty of valid reasons to bemoan his dominance. He is kind of a sentient keg stand; he has a pretty lazy and unexamined relationship with hip-hop; there is strong evidence that he might not exactly be the sort of person who thinks through his actions. But if you can wriggle free from all that for just a moment, there is a lot to appreciate in his music. There could be, and have been, far worse pop hegemonies, and in a few years, when his cherubic-face-tatted mug has receded somewhat, the virtues of his music will become more apparent. Yes, the lyrics can be infuriatingly lazy, particularly when he’s tracing over hip-hop tropes about the Mille on his wrist or the 50 carats on his fist. But Post Malone’s choruses are just stupefyingly good. Each one sounds like it could furnish a down payment on a personal helipad. Hollywood’s Bleeding has about 10 titanium-grade hooks on it, choruses so immediate they erect stadiums in your head while they play—“I’m Gonna Be,” “Staring At the Sun,” “Allergic,” Enemies,” “Myself,” “Wow.” He seems to almost belch these out: “Got so many hits, can’t remember ’em all/While I’m taking a shit, look at the plaques on the wall,” he yawns charmingly on “On the Road.” “Sunflower,” his Swae Lee duet that hit No. 1 at the beginning of this year, shows up again outside of last year’s Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse soundtrack, and its presence here among all these other soon-to-be Top 10 hits feels almost like arm-twisting. We get it. He is also a sneakily agile singer, switching from red-faced howling to smoky crooning to something warbly and strange in between these two poles. He uses all three of those voices plus a surprisingly lithe falsetto on “Allergic,” which features a chorus that feels like a down-the-middle split between 2003 Fall Out Boy, 2002 Weezer, and 1983 Billy Joel. It is an immaculate pop construction, and the words—“You’re friends with all my demons/The only one that sees them/Too bad for you”—are just delivery systems for the thrill. Post’s music comes from that zone of confusion where hip-hop and alternative rock overlap. Artists keep wandering out of this spot, which widens every year, but it’s hard to imagine the vortex producing someone as ready for algorithmic dominion than Post. Depending on how hard you squint, his music sounds alternately and suspiciously like Stone Temple Pilots or Sugar Ray or Everlast or Rae Sremmurd or Def Leppard or Tame Impala. The team behind this sound—a chewed-up ball of the last 25 years of rap and rock radio—consists of Louis Bell, Frank Dukes, and Post. Together, they made most of the brightest and most memorable tracks on last year’s Beerbongs & Bentleys, and having established their winning formula, they work it relentlessly on Hollywood. There is no streaming playlist he could not plausibly land on. There are two kinds of Post Malone songs: Useful and Not Useful. Post Malone’s best and dumbest songs (usually one and the same) are intriguing for the appealing note of panic in them: He might have been singing “She got beautiful boobies” but the way he sang it, it sounded like secret code for Please, the combination to the safe, they have my family. This is Useful Posty, and there is a lot of UP ROI on Hollywood’s Bleeding. “I’m Gonna Be” is a standard inspirational “be yourself” anthem on paper, but Post bellows the hook with a conviction that suggests a trap production of the musical Cats. He sings the hook to “Internet” with the same lunatic gusto—the message is “the internet sucks lol” but he and co-writer Kanye make it sound like a luxury ocean liner going down. Moody Posty, by contrast, is not Useful Posty. On the title track, he moans about his demons and wonders who will be at his funeral; nobody needs melancholy despair from the guy who headlined a Bud Light Dive Bar tour. There are too many brooding fashion-plate numbers in general (“Die For Me,” “On The Road”) and they bog the album down. The aforementioned “Circles” is kind of pretty, kind of smooth, kind of sad. It is not a vehicle for Useful Posty: It sounds like a demo that someone meant to hand directly to Sheryl Crow and accidentally sent to Bobcat Goldthwait. His hair sounds combed. Washed, even. When he’s not wasting time trying to glower, he proves himself surprisingly versatile. “Myself” is a co-write with Father John Misty, of all goddamn people, a wry song about not being about to slow down to appreciate the spoils of success—or, to hear Post tell it, “We slammed butts and Bud Lights to write a cool, top-down, summer cruising song about doing all this shit, being everywhere, but not having the time to fully enjoy it.” Post’s silly-putty voice twists once more until, voila, somehow he’s dirtbag Randy Newman, cruising through the perverse California night. His voice is both malleable and unruly—just as Led Zeppelin attempting reggae somehow managed to sound just like Led Zeppelin, Posty sounds Post-y no matter where you put him. There are a lot of guests on Hollywood’s Bleeding, and all of them sound engaged; when you are this famous, artists tend to give you their first verse, not their fifth or tenth. Rising star DaBaby crushes his turn on “Enemies”; Halsey, on the otherwise drab “Die For Me,"" breaks into her boyfriend’s phone, finds all the girls in his DMs, and takes them all home. And then there is the power ballad “Take What You Want,” featuring Travis Scott and Ozzy Osbourne. Osbourne sounds pristine and ageless as always; his towering vocals seem teleported directly from the same studio session as “Mama, I’m Coming Home.” Post takes over the hook from Osbourne the second time around, and he holds his own against the cyclone of his vocal take—remarkable, considering that by the time the song is over, you have forgotten Travis Scott existed at all. And then: a guitar solo. Not any guitar solo, but one so ludicrous it needs a rider stating it can only be played while straddling twin burning Camaros. It is screamingly wretched and undeniably mind-blowing and the most fascinating musical decision I have heard on a pop song all year. It makes me think about Rick Ross circa 2010, happy and audacious, enlisting full symphony orchestras for him to rap over, but not before demanding a cigar. There is no one else on earth who would attempt to put such a thing on a pop album destined to break streaming records. These moments—when he dares to suck, gloriously and bravely—is when Post Malone ascends.","The divisive pop star still gets bogged down in melancholy, but the charm of Post Malone’s third album is in his versatile voice and his ability to make a great hook inside pretty much any song.

Monos (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),Mica Levi,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d717b3113ff690008c6ef8f/1:1/w_160/MONOSsoundtrack.jpg,2019-09-10 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mica-levi-monos-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/,InvadaLakeshore,"By most quantitative measures, Jonathan Glazer’s 2014 film Under the Skin was a bomb. Whereas some Scarlett Johansson vehicles can break a billion dollars at the box office, Under the Skin is nowhere near making back its original budget. Reviews called the abstract body-horror film “torpid and silly” and “without dramatic, emotional or psychological substance”; Glazer hasn’t made another film since. But thanks to the bracing, skin-prickling score from Mica Levi (her debut as a soundtrack composer after years fronting Micachu and the Shapes), Under the Skin and its soundtrack continue to exert an eerie gravitational pull five years on. Indie musicians like Geoff Barrow, Colin Stetson, and the Haxan Cloak’s Bobby Krlic now make similarly visceral and atonal sounds for the screen, and the experimental imprint PAN has even created its own cinematic sublabel. Levi’s score for Brazilian writer/director Alejandro Landes’ Monos is similar to her work for Under the Skin: It utilizes only a smattering of sounds to craft a world of deepening dread. The story follows a group of teenagers-turned-soldiers in a mountain retreat tending to a political prisoner and a milk cow named Shakira; the film’s quick erasure of the line between innocence and heartlessness brings to mind Apocalypse Now (while a pig’s head on a stick pays clear homage to The Lord of the Flies). But while characters named Wolf, Dog, and Smurf shed their last vestiges of civility and turn feral, Levi’s score keeps a firm grasp throughout, growing unhinged yet never quite losing control. If there’s an onscreen character that best represents Levi, it’s Sofia Buenaventura’s Rambo, who somehow keeps her humanity intact through the tribulations. For the first part of the film, the child soldiers occupy a mountain fort, and Levi’s cues expertly match the spare setting. Hushed as the mists that enshroud the characters (many shots show them on lookout with the clouds gathering below them), small sounds suggest deeper forces at work. With the distant rumble of tympanum on “Funeral” and “A La Selva,” Levi heightens the tension on screen and hints at the interior struggle as each character slowly, unnoticeably shakes free from the constraints of society. The soundtrack’s main theme is a four-note whistle, which sounds throughout the film. At some moments, with the kids silhouetted with guns in hand, it brings to mind the iconic whistle theme of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. It’s deceptively simple and devastatingly effective, an elemental childlike sound made from just cupping your hands together and blowing. But as it continues to sound, a sense of exhaustion becomes audible, the fourth note raspy like a last gasp. As digital effects burst in and drums rumble closer, the whistle turns forlorn and increasingly isolated. On “Helicóptero,” Levi digitally manipulates and elongates its tone into a flickering, dreamlike drone. Even a playful cue like “Honguitos,” wherein the kids nosh on some magic mushrooms sprouting from cow dung and have their environment flipped from garrison to playground, the effect is short-lived. A whimsical air rendered on flute floats by, then gets dragged down by a nose-diving synth line. It’s as if a huge EDM drop lay just around the bend. More flickering synth themes swell on “Castigo” and at other intervals in the film, making for a provocative suggestion: In another time or place, rather than carrying machine guns in bloodied hands, these mud-caked kids might simply be going primal on a saucer-eyed weekend at a countryside rave.","Much like the UK composer’s score for Jonathan Glazer’s Under the Skin, Monos uses just a smattering of sounds to craft a world of deepening dread.

We Love You Tecca,Lil Tecca,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d7285360db1d10008f1fa96/1:1/w_160/weloveyoutecca_tecca.jpeg,2019-09-10 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lil-tecca-we-love-you-tecca/,GalacticRepublic,"Lil Tecca turned 17 just days before releasing his debut project We Love You Tecca, and unlike other teen rappers who have bounded up the charts in recent years, he looks his age. He’s not 17 in Riverdale casting years. He presents as an actual high schooler, complete with braces and glasses that look straight off of a CVS rack—a pointed departure break from the outsized stylist budgets and Manic Panic color palettes of rap’s biggest, youngest stars. That’s about where the distinction from his peers ends, though. Tecca’s look may be unique, but his sound isn’t. The Queens-born rapper rhymes in the melodic patter of New York sing-rap phenom A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, with a flow that splits the difference between Chief Keef’s gruff irritability and Gunna’s glycerin slickness. He’s got a strong voice and natural instincts, and although his flow is completely secondhand, it’s precisely pitched to the moment, especially when his songs glower their way into Juice WLRD incel-rap territory. That rapper looms especially large over We Love You Tecca. Juice WRLD’s producers Nick Mira and Taz Taylor helmed Tecca’s breakthrough hit “Ransom,” and he contributes the album’s only guest feature, on a remix of that track. Tecca’s success story has played like a smaller scale echo of Lil Nas X’s, another internet-savvy young rapper who built a listenership online too big for major labels to ignore. After millions of streams on SoundCloud and a viral video for “Ransom” on the taste-making YouTube channel Lyrical Lemonade, Tecca inked a deal with Republic Records, making him labelmates with Drake and Ariana Grande. His rise may not have stirred an all-consuming debate about genre classifications or resuscitated Billy Ray Cyrus’s career, but it’s always impressive seeing an artist so young cut through the industry’s yellow tape so quickly. Some rappers grind their whole lives for their moment. Tecca netted his between Xbox Live sessions. Still, he could benefit from putting a little more work in. It’s not for nothing that Tecca harps about guarding his flow on “Ransom,” because throughout We Love You Tecca he clings to it like a tennis player trying to fake his way into the pros with only one serve. That flow sounds fantastic on “Ransom,” and even better as it figure-skates through the tuneful “Shots.” But Tecca wears it into the ground over the course of the album’s repetitious 40 minutes, especially in its second half, as his tracks bleed into one endless rewrite of each other. Tecca’s most glaring deficit, though, is how indifferent his lyrics are. His songwriting consists entirely of repeating genre tropes he’s absorbed through osmosis. “I got twin Glocks, turn you to a dancer,” he threatens on “Ransom,” but annotating on his lyrics on Genius, he concedes that’s a fabrication (”I don’t have no straps for nobody,” he writes). That’s not a problem in and of itself, but some conviction or imagination is, and Tecca doesn’t even bother to disguise how empty his recycled boasts are. In his Genius footnotes for the lyric “She know I got the Fendi, Prada when I hit Milan,” he admits he doesn’t wear designer clothes, either. “Just fitting what works together,” he comments. “I have never been to Europe or nothing.” Even great rappers cut corners and lean on filler sometimes, and even the best ones repeat themselves. But the reward of rap music in the quantity over quality age is those little glimmers of inspiration that somehow work their way into even the most mechanical exercises: the unexpected punchlines, the uncharted trains of thought, the WTF moments, the zigs that come where there should be a zag. Those are the moments that make the redundancy worthwhile. We Love You Tecca doesn’t offer many of them.","The 17-year-old Queens rapper went viral off a certified hit, but his debut project is repetitive and uninspired.

The People I Love,Steve Lehman,by: Seth Colter Walls,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d72887a2073fe00084eb0fd/1:1/w_160/thepeopleilove_lehman.jpg,2019-09-10 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/steve-lehman-the-people-i-love/,Pi Recordings,"When the saxophonist and composer Steve Lehman posted a list of his favorite MCs on Twitter this summer, he wasn’t just playing along with a popular social-media pastime. He was also expressing something about his own history. In citing Ka and Buckshot, Lehman produced a list deep with New York underground talent—fitting for a player who has worked in the city’s most adventurous jazz clubs alongside names like Vijay Iyer and Tyshawn Sorey. And by including Antipop Consortium and the Senegalese rapper Gaston Bandimic, the saxophonist was shouting out his sometime collaborators (most notably, on 2016’s Sélébéyone). Lehman’s new album, The People I Love, offers a further glimpse of his listening habits, without anything approaching caginess or irony. The covers here include tunes from Autechre and onetime Wynton Marsalis drummer Jeff “Tain” Watts as well as new versions of a couple of Lehman’s own compositions, previously recorded with other groups. The songs from his own back pages don’t seem like a form of self-love, though. Instead, they suggest an air of reinvestigation. They raise questions. As in: What made those bands—full of collaborators that Lehman clearly admires—click? And how might those effects be reproduced by other hands? Some of those other hands belong to the pianist Craig Taborn—another New York heavyweight, but one who hasn’t appeared on a Lehman recording before. Here, he joins Lehman’s longstanding trio (including bassist Matt Brewer and drummer Damion Reid) to tackle a few new compositions, plus those covers. It makes for a stirring set, if not a full-throttle mind-meld between two of the best player-composers on the contemporary jazz scene. Lehman and Taborn share joint writing credits on three tracks: the “Prelude,” “Interlude,” and a “Postlude.” They’re well-wrought miniatures, but not the main event. It’s in the other songs where you get a sense of two individualists getting to know one another better. “Ih Calam and Ynnus,” a Lehman original, ably showcases both artists’ respective aesthetics. The performance starts out with some of the minimalist stillness of Taborn’s own compositions, while Lehman’s entrance introduces some of the updated post-bop freneticism for which he is justly admired. There’s a tension building here: Taborn keeps laboring over a few chords while Lehman crafts increasingly heated figures—until the pianist breaks his form open. Or does he? When Taborn’s solo turn comes, he matches Lehman for burning energy in the higher register of his instrument. But check out his other hand; it is still obsessing over some of the same droning chords from earlier in his performance. Instead of picking one mode, Taborn’s doing two things at once—slyly, and without any evidence of strain. This is a trait common to some of his own bands, in which an Olympian dexterity winds up feeling like the output of someone playing casually, on the corner. While it’s no surprise that Taborn can make himself at home in Lehman’s complex, fiery music, it’s still thrilling to hear. (“Ynnus” is worth the price of admission, all on its own.) Elsewhere, Taborn reimagines some of the sound of the saxophonist’s past groups—most memorably in his work on a tune like “Beyond All Limits,” where his vaulting intervals stand in for some of the more thickly orchestrated material from Lehman’s octet. And he also knows when to pull back, as on “qPlay,” the Autechre cover. After establishing some of the harmony from the original track, the pianist hangs in the background, allowing the song to become a feature for Brewer and Reid, who jointly adapt Autechre’s unpredictably pulsing electronic sound for jazz-quartet context. All that’s missing here is a sense of Lehman’s immersion into Taborn’s compositional mold. It would be fascinating to hear the saxophonist’s sound lingering inside the slow-boil style of the pianist’s working groups. Happily, the results of this first recorded meeting make an ample case for future encounters.","Assisted by pianist Craig Taborn, the New York saxophonist’s longstanding trio balances minimalist stillness with post-bop freneticism, and covers Autechre and Jeff “Tain” Watts along the way.

At the Party With My Brown Friends,Black Belt Eagle Scout,by: Peyton Thomas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d655fb7c7e6ee0009d820e9/1:1/w_160/blackbelteaglescout_attheparty.jpg,2019-09-09 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/black-belt-eagle-scout-at-the-party-with-my-brown-friends/,Saddle Creek,"The backdrop of Black Belt Eagle Scout’s video for “Run It to Ya” is, crucially, a prom, and not a protest. Katherine Paul picks flowers, strums her guitar, and croons, her voice blurred and dreamy, while swaying against a wall of balloons. The visual is unmistakably queer, and unmistakably indigenous, but it represents a softer, more subtle sort of resistance. Rather than curl into a closed fist, her hand takes the hand of another pretty girl and leads her out to the dance floor. Paul is among the many indigenous artists to garner hard-won and long-overdue recognition from white outlets and tastemakers in recent years. Indigenous artists have taken home Canada’s prestigious Polaris Music Prize four times in the past five years, and the Indigenous Music Countdown, founded by David McLeod in 1998 as a small-scale weekly broadcast, now airs worldwide on satellite radio. Upon signing to Saddle Creek, Paul was eager to use her new platform in service of her community: “Getting signed to a record label and getting a publicist and booking agent—those are privileges that I could take advantage of to try and do good indigenous work.” The work of her debut, Mother of My Children, written during the resistance at Standing Rock, was to steel her loved ones for struggle. At the Party With My Brown Friends, by contrast, concerns itself not with work, but with play and rest. This is not to say that Paul has made an apolitical record. She is mindful, on opening track “At the Party,” of white audiences, the sort who might marvel at the mere existence of an indigenous woman holding an electric guitar. “How is it real, how is it real,” she sings, “when you don’t even notice it?” Later, on “I Said I Wouldn’t Write This Song,” she takes note of “eyes, staring right at you,” crying “tears filled with joy/And hindrance, too.” Paul is aware of the complex, and often contradictory, priorities that present themselves to her as an artist: to make herself visible, but resist tokenization; to educate the public, but weather the fragility and hostility of their responses. Still, her first priority is to give indigenous listeners a space to love and care for themselves without white spectatorship. From the hazy, low-lit prom of “Run It to Ya,” to the sweet morning-after of “Half Colored Hair,” Paul floats through a small, safe world of her own creation. Her songs are encased in soft, vague swirls of dream-pop production—the influence, in particular, of Japanese Breakfast, is deeply felt—and she gives no thought to anyone outside this serene bubble, devoting herself instead to everything she sees and feels within it. There is a grey day at the beach, in the Pacific Northwest, with a close friend. There is a bed, and a girl, and sheets “gleaming from the two of us.” There are dreams, too many to count, which recur from song to song, until the listener loses track of what is and isn’t true in Paul’s portrait of her own reality. Especially touching is the record’s gorgeous closer, “You’re Me and I’m You,” sung from Paul to her mother, like a lullaby in reverse. “I am the one, the one she loves,” she sings, “No matter what my heart becomes.” Paul is free, so long as she sings, to draw no lines around who she is and what she loves. She is the daughter of her mother. She is the girlfriend of her girlfriend. She is the heiress of Geneviève Castrée and Courtney Love and Carrie Brownstein, a worthy ascendant in a long tradition of Pacific Northwest rock which, for too long, has excluded indigenous women. She makes no apologies, feels no inadequacy. Over the course of the album, this near-hour spent in the presence of the people she loves, she is reminded that she is equal to any challenge which may befall her. “You like flowers?” she sings, to a brown-eyed girl, on “Run It to Ya.” “I pick flowers.” (Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)","Encased in swirls of dream-pop production, Katherine Paul’s second album represents a softer, more subtle sort of resistance.

Close It Quietly,Frankie Cosmos,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d6ed26ab6cdc300086117d5/1:1/w_160/cosmos_closeitquietly.jpg,2019-09-09 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/frankie-cosmos-close-it-quietly/,Sub Pop,"Greta Kline’s early work as Frankie Cosmos earned the New York songwriter a reputation as a dazzling twee prodigy, a teenager who deftly encapsulated the weighty uncertainties of humanity in two-minute bites of melody. On her EP Fit Me In, the followup to 2014’s breakout album Zentropy, she mocked her own press coverage, which seemed more preoccupied with her age then her work: “Have you heard? I am so young.” Every Frankie Cosmos album since has felt like an attempt to take stock of what transpired since Kline’s last release, with moving meditations on touring, friendships, and the alienation of being a public-facing figure keen on safeguarding her private life. On Close It Quietly, her fourth studio LP and second Sub Pop release, she gamely stares down her middle twenties, that messy period where one’s early projections about the future tend to start unraveling. Kline’s language has always been the tightly coiled heart of her work, and here she offers a wealth of indelible imagery that smears together the winsome and the grotesque. “Spit out diamonds/Cough up rubies,” she sings blithely on the chorus to “Windows,” a beguiling couplet that offers no window onto her interior state. The song’s peppy, full-band instrumentation recedes at the hook, an inversion of typical power-pop song dynamics—the synthesizers melt away and Kline’s voice darkens, supported by little but the tick of a cymbal. “I wanna give you all my marbles,” she offers over a spare fingerpicked guitar on “Marbles,” twisting an old phrase until it becomes an expression of generosity rather than instability: If she’s going to lose her marbles, she might as well give them away. On “So Blue,” she envisions a cheery sky soaking the whole world in its melancholic hue (blue’s only a happy color when it doesn’t touch the ground). And with “A Joke,” Kline enlists wildflowers in an embrace of her own chaos: “Flowers don’t grow/In an organized way/Why should I?” She observes a field of dandelions and then pans down to where they’re strangling the soil, imbuing a well-worn image with new ferocity. Listening to Frankie Cosmos, I hold up the person I was at 19 and the one I was at 25, a six-year chasm full of molting and tumult that the first self never could have foreseen. I had a good sense of self in my late teens, and then I shed it, and shed what replaced it. Kline wades fearlessly into that process of continual unearthing, casting off what used to make sense and what doesn’t anymore—old relationships, old habits, old vantages on a world that grows more complex by the day. Close It Quietly is honest about the pain of rebirth, but it doesn’t dwell there. Kline’s more interested in what grows out of that mess.

Twelve Nudes,Ezra Furman,by: Steven Arroyo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d6840c7b8b930000899be21/1:1/w_160/furman_twelvenudes.jpg,2019-09-09 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ezra-furman-twelve-nudes/,Bella Union,"Ezra Furman is a highly thoughtful interviewee, often at the expense of convenient, neatly packaged answers. Hearing the songwriter dish on religion, rock’n’roll, and the United States of America with frequent pivots and pauses isn’t so different from hearing the four albums she’s recorded post-Harpoons—the first of at least four different backing bands that Furman has led—which jumped around doo-wop, blitzing sax-inflected pop, and scratchy-edged garage. Furman gives the same impression in both contexts: She has a lot going on up there, and she seems to feel a responsibility to sort through it all. An impatient conversationalist might prod her to just spit it out. On her most direct and brash album yet, Twelve Nudes, Furman does exactly that, and spits in a few faces along the way. By the time of last year’s Transangelic Exodus, Furman’s cinematic opus about going on the run with an illegally harbored angel lover, she had moved on from her latest backing band, the Boy Friends, which she once defined as “a punk-soul-garage band.” Her new, nameless backing band has pared down to just one of those descriptors: punk. It’s volume over verbosity on Twelve Nudes. She’s upset; she’s enraged; she “should not be alone, the way things are going”; she has no time for saxophones or keyboards, let alone silly band names—not in 2019, when equality appears to be the last priority of the powerful. She gives specific, unpoetic examples and doesn’t mince words: “The kind of sex you want is the kind they’d like to make illegal”; “You register to vote, they make it impossible.” Three years ago, Furman offered solace to fellow Perpetual Motion People on “Restless Year,” when she offered that “If you can’t calm down, you can listen to this.” She calls back to that lyric directly on Twelve Nudes’ opener, “Calm Down aka I Should Not Be Alone,” to disclaim that she can’t offer such respite here: “I know you can’t ’cause I can’t calm down,” she shrieks, blasting three-chord, major-key floodlights into accounts of habitual panic-sweating and thrashing around in bed at night. What she can offer, however, is a kick in the pants. “If you’re really at the end of your rope/No, you don’t take the night off/Too many demons to fight off,” she barks later. One thing that remains the same with Furman on Twelve Nudes: She likes using classic templates to sing about new changes. That’s settled once “Sympathy for the Devil” is lifted not even 35 seconds into the album, but it’s especially moving on the one song where Furman unclenches her jaw and pulls back—all the way back, so that we can see what’s beneath her fight. Her governing ambition, she sings, is that she just wants to be someone’s girlfriend. “I Wanna Be Your Girlfriend” adopts a chord progression not far off from that of “Will You Love Me Tomorrow,” and Furman reveals that she’s “been thinking about ditching Ezra and going by Esme” (she rhymes her new, Salinger-evoking name with “résumé,” as in the thing she’s been neglecting while “responsible friends” are updating theirs—a groaner, but an endearing one). She takes this breather, speaks her truth, exhales, and then it’s right back to our regularly scheduled rage. It’s a bold inclusion framed by a fine choice in pacing. “I’m a shy person whose very presence has become a confrontation,” Furman said in a recent interview, 12 years after her debut with the Harpoons declared “I Wanna Be Ignored.” There’s been an evolution between that early song and the recent quote, as though Furman has accepted and now decided to embrace this confrontation. If confrontation is what they see, it’s what they’ll get, Twelve Nudes seems to say. If there is progress to be made for the marginalized, it won’t come without being loud. Furman musters her best rallying cry on “Evening Prayer aka Justice”: “If your frail human heart is still pumping/Then make this one night you remember,” she pleads. “Time to do justice for the poor.” Furman pushes her growl to its limits to get this out. She knows what time it is.

Town Centre,Squid,by: Jazz Monroe,Associate Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d387304eefc47000891a86a/1:1/w_160/squid_towncentre.jpg,2019-09-09 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/squid-town-centre/,Speedy Wunderground,"On their signature single “Houseplants,” Squid chronicle the struggle to find decent lodgings on the cheap in London. Rather than grumble along with the rest of us, they dismantled their gear and drove a few hours south to Brighton, where core duo Ollie Judge and Louis Borlase rented an apartment by the sea. Ditching the capital wasn’t necessarily an act of industry subversion, but it stems from the same irreverence that animates their anarchic music. For one thing, they have no frontperson: Lead singer Judge is also the drummer, so if anything he’s a rearperson. As with contemporaries black midi, their frenzied live shows emanate from the drum kit. Guitarists and bassists, typically the phallic standard-bearers, are swallowed up like detritus into a whirlpool, then soundtrack their fight to survive. “Houseplants” doesn’t appear on this Dan Carey-produced debut EP, but plenty rivals its antic spirit. On “The Cleaner,” a jittery seven-minute duet between Judge and Borlase, an indignant shop cleaner yelps about coworkers who “don’t even know my name” before clocking off to orchestrate his own glory on the dancefloor. “Match Bet,” at first a hurtling indie rock tune, plateaus and re-emerges in a motorik dreamscape, via the portal of a 32-bar cornet solo. Judge, who is 25 and usually yelling, jerks between bewilderment and martial discipline, defying anything resembling a speaking cadence. His “Match Bet” narrator faces a perilous choice: to cut the “red wire” or the “blue wire” when, “well, they all look the same to me.” The politically disillusioned are an object not of mockery, but of primal empathy. Comparisons between Judge and the barking Brits of early postpunk are there to make—some will find the likeness jarring—but Judge’s rhetorical tone lands closer to David Byrne and his mania of the mundane. (“This is my beautiful house/But I can’t afford to live in it,” he trills on “Houseplants.”) The vocals vamp and contort until circumstances too often presented as normal—encroaching social alienation, preposterous living costs—suddenly appear insane, and we wonder who wouldn’t bounce off the walls in despair. When it isn’t on the offensive, Town Centre waltzes from Tortoise-shelled post-rock (“Savage”) into oddities like “Rodeo,” a morass of Neu! ambience, shuddering cello, and elliptical spoken-word. Being unselfconscious mostly suits them: Once an audacious young band starts to sound like a little of everything, they’ll eventually go full circle, sound like nothing else. Squid are getting there, avoiding genre constrictions they’d later have to wiggle from underneath. More than the map to a promising destination, Town Centre sounds like a declaration of limitlessness.","The wonderfully anarchic British post-punk outfit tries out a little of everything on a promising debut EP.

Ingénue,k.d. lang,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d72ab030db1d10008f1faa0/1:1/w_160/kgland_ingenue.jpg,2019-09-08 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kd-lang-ingenue/,SireWarner Bros.,"k.d. lang’s career started with a round of open-heart surgery. In 1983, the woman born Kathryn Dawn was involved in a 12-hour performance art piece in which she and her peers in Edmonton, Canada, re-enacted the first artificial heart transplant, using pickled carrots and beets for the organ. There are no surviving reports of the audience’s response, but lang recalled that the players came away dazed. A year later, she took her career in a more conventional direction, albeit marginally. lang was an androgyne from rural Canada who considered herself to be the reincarnation of Patsy Cline, convinced she was born to be a country star. Even in outlaw terms, she was a long shot in conservative Nashville, a city nonetheless seduced by her punky verve and saucy rambunctiousness, a hay-bale alternative to the genre’s burgeoning cosmopolitanism. She was accepted, to a degree—her vegetarianism and PETA allegiance notwithstanding—but lang knew that acceptance was creative death. By the early ’90s, she felt that she had exploited country’s full creative potential. Now was time to develop her own romantic language. That’s a challenge for any artist—how to create an original expression of love or heartbreak when those emotions have been so comprehensively codified by decades of pop music? lang’s circumstances were very particular. She was irrevocably in love with a married woman, and there was nothing she could do, no cooling-off period she could wait out, to get what she desired. The crush was a lost cause, and despite heavy rumors about her sexuality and a much-remarked upon lesbian contingent in her fanbase, lang was also not yet officially out. It was the early 1990s: Ellen DeGeneres wouldn’t come out for five years, AIDS-related deaths wouldn’t peak for another four, and President George H. W. Bush was renouncing his earlier support for gay marriage in a shameless attempt to maintain power. And yet, lang wanted to convey the specificity of her pain to as broad an audience as possible. She was also perturbed by how pop was starting to crowd out the singing parts with the rhythm parts. Seeking a vehicle worthy of her voice, lang decided to hark back to the age of Peggy Lee, Julie London, and Rosemary Clooney, the adult contemporary sound of her parents’ generation. The gulf between her artistic whims and mainstream potential could hardly have seemed wider. But lang, who had sewn plastic farm animals to her gingham skirt in her earliest, kitschiest phase as a country star, was skilled at subverting what seemed anachronistic, even if the growing queercore scenes in Olympia and London wrote her off as a mopey blight on their cause. That is the beauty of 1992’s Ingénue, which looks however you want it to look depending on the light—radical queer ur-text or MOR reverie—and lets lang shapeshift accordingly. It was her first all-original album for a reason, allowing her to create modes of tragedy, defeat, and roleplay as she tried to distill the truest essence of her own heartbreak, a state that makes subjugated clichés of us all. Ingénue is irresistibly seductive, so much so that it drives home just how unavailable lang’s crush was: How could she resist this? lang described the sound of Ingénue as “post-nuclear cabaret” and “nouveau easy listening”: Opener “Save Me” soothes the room like a bath filling up, making the light swim and the temperature rise. From there, lang and stalwart collaborator Ben Mink conjure a sense of intimacy so acute it feels like a confrontation. Their obsessive “sonic cleanliness” heightens the atmosphere to a peak of sensitivity: The tapering bass of “Wash Me Clean,” a song that is otherwise pure, sustained glow, might as well be a finger running down the inside of your wrist. Long before the term ASMR was coined, lang knew how to simulate the sensations of heartbreak: the obsessively lovelorn can trigger the memory (or fantasy) of connection until it’s wrung dry, the spark drained. But lang also threw in showpieces that showed exactly how dizzying heartbreak can be. Sometimes she vaulted between the two impulses in one song: “Season of Hollow Soul” starts with tense bass, brushed rattles, and clipped hi-hats, lang singing about her pain with the coyness of a detective surveying a crime scene but knowing better than to leave any trace. Then a skirt-ruffling, timpani-bashing chorus rushes in, a manic celebration of love’s capriciousness—“Fate must have a reason!” lang booms—familiar to anyone who has ever grasped for rationale in the pit of despair. lang upped the drama with nods to klezmer music and other European traditions, as well as the work of Kurt Weill and George Gershwin. The insistent dulcimer strings that herald “Still Thrives This Love” and the accordion that plumps the chorus of “So It Shall Be” set Ingénue further out of time, and heighten its underrated playfulness. Obviously, nowhere is this clearer than on “Miss Chatelaine,” which earned its high camp credentials even before the lang accompanied it with a video where she wore the high-bouffanted, ballgown-clad drag of femininity, the lesbian Liberace. Here, lang is perplexed at how unrequited love has reduced her to this quivering parody, but also evidently delighted by it. You could read a little internalized misogyny into this—the song was named for a Canadian home-keeping magazine—but that would be boring, and miss the point. She takes the mickey out of herself: “Every time your eyes meet mine/Clouds of qualm burst into sunshine!” is not a lyric that found a second life on a Valentine’s Day card. And “Miss Chatelaine” is a towering millefeuille of accordion, frisky percussion and strings, a succession of audible exclamation points—a song with so many ornate moving parts that it’s easier to imagine its blueprint as a cuckoo clock than a black and white musical staff. Ingénue—an album named for the roles ascribed to young women, and one that early screen stars wilfully exploited for professional reward—often finds lang questioning who she has become in the wilds of heartbreak. “The Mind of Love” comes from a similarly comic school to “Miss Chatelaine,” a pillowy torch song where she considers her plight with tender impatience. “Talking to myself/Causing great concern for my health,” she declares, with operatic boldness, only to circle in on the joke and ask, “Where is your head, Kathryn?” in an all-time great example of a star singing their own name. But lang also plays it dejected, a mode that can seem to weigh heavy given her evident spryness. “Tears of Love’s Recall” is, at least technically, the album’s least interesting song—lang’s usual pin-drop vocal delivery is flattened to a series of unengaging sustained notes, and its cinematic air feels rote compared to the creativity elsewhere. And the lyrics are oblique, even tortured, like bad Shakespeare: “Love, thing of might and dread, stays the savior and poison to all of heart and head,” she sings over a pattering dirge. But what feels like emotion held at arm’s length spoke specifically to the elusive experience of queerness at the time. Reflecting on Ingénue for its 25th anniversary, lang remarked that its sometimes obtuse nature felt like a form of protection: “It was our own prison that we were trying to break out of, but it was also our comfort zone.” On Ingénue, you hear lang brushing against the limits of internal experience. It’s an album about purgatory, a place where you work out who you are. But then there’s the lonely, self-flagellating hermitage of it. There is the private fantasy of a self, a side that lang makes genuinely sexy: “I can exist being caught by your kiss,” she belts on “So It Shall Be,” a moment of subjugation that soon melts away. “Outside Myself,” Ingénue’s most beautifully written song, explicitly evokes that dislocation: “I’ve been outside myself for so long,” she heaves, answering the earlier question from “The Mind of Love. It’s a great, rueful sigh of realization that obsession is as much self-neglect as self-indulgence. Ingénue’s final track, “Constant Craving,” is lang’s conclusion to all this, a brilliant song about how yearning runs deep within us all, yet one that feels tacked on, in sound and in spirit. It’s brisker than everything that came before it, as if her label had asked lang to come up with a potential hit, although its plaintive accordion and melodramatic vocal tumbles probably weren’t going to shake Kriss Kross and Sir Mix-a-Lot from the top of the Billboard charts. And lang’s sanguine takeaway was another depersonalized construction—“Constant craving has always been.” She had sewed up the wound. That it was this song that became a hit (No. 38 on the Billboard Hot 100; later peaking at No. 15 in the UK) probably protected her. She released Ingénue in March 1992. Three months later, k.d. lang came out in an interview to The Advocate magazine, and her heartbreak had to bear the weight of a massive socio-cultural shift. Suddenly, Madonna was likening her to Elvis and seeing the potential in letting rumors about a dalliance spread; Cindy Crawford was sensually shaving her face on the cover of Vanity Fair magazine, the best magazine cover of all time. lang enjoyed the performance of stardom for a little while before retreating again. She knew it wasn’t her.

Soft Landing,Sandro Perri,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d4893e6749a66000874452a/1:1/w_160/perri_softisland.jpg,2019-09-07 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sandro-perri-soft-landing/,Constellation,"Time is both our most omnipresent yet precious resource, always moving too slow or running out too fast. The convoluted career of Sandro Perri can be seen as an ongoing effort to find the right balance between those two states, to make time feel like it’s moving at just the right pace. Whether it takes the form of chilled acoustic pop, abstract electronica, or post-rock odysseys, Perri’s defiantly unhurried music asks that we savor the moment. His records are busy, vibrant, and bursting with life, but aren’t ever in a rush to get anywhere. But even an island-time adherent like Perri can appreciate that the seven-year layoff between 2011’s Impossible Spaces and 2018’s In Another Life was probably a bit too leisurely, so he’s followed the biggest gap in his solo discography with the shortest one. Soft Landing arrives just a year after its predecessor and, on the surface, assumes a similar structure, in that it features one very long song followed by a handful of much shorter ones. But each of Perri’s albums to date have existed in their own distinct, discrete sonic universe, and Soft Landing is no different. Where past releases have showcased the tropical troubadour, the Arthur Russell-inspired avant-funk alchemist, and Eno-esque conceptualist, Soft Landing emphasizes a heretofore underrated facet of his personality: Sandro Perri, guitar hero. Sure, Perri’s sublime use of pedal steel has long been a signature of his work (both as a solo artist and as ambient-techno producer Polmo Polpo), but Soft Landing sees him plug in and work his six-string magic on a record that caters to WIRE and Guitar World subscribers alike. Where many artists initiating conversations between pop music and the avant-garde deploy strategies from the latter to corrupt the former, Perri works the other way—he makes meticulously layered, experimental music that feels as breezy and inviting as the smoothest yacht rock. Soft Landing is his most traditional singer/songwriter-oriented release since 2007’s Tiny Mirrors, but it both embraces the melodic integrity and warmth of ’70s AM-radio standards while stripping away the pop-song packaging to let the contents unspool in unpredictable ways. The album opens with a tranquil, tiki-torch-lit love song, albeit a 16-minute one dedicated to time itself, as Perri grapples with the ultimate dysfunctional long-term relationship: “I can remember, not long ago, I said you move too slow/When people tried to tell me that you were on my side/Now that we’ve spent some years together, it seems like you’re more indifferent/You don’t take sides.” And so, four minutes in, he liberates himself from the limitations of time and redirects this wind-chimed beachside ballad into a gloriously messy, extended jam that suggests the Velvet Underground if Warhol’s Factory were relocated to a South Pacific cruise ship. But as the song swells into an all-consuming tsunami of tangled guitar lines, mutated piano plinks, and unidentified squeals, its slow-motion groove remains as steady as waves on a moonlit ocean, reminding us of time’s ceaseless march despite Perri’s best efforts to halt it. If “Time (You Got Me)” is a masterclass in controlled, calming chaos, Soft Landing’s shorter tracks favor a formal and tonal clarity, using their surroundings to amplify their emotional undercurrents. With exception of the atypically irreverent sleepwalking soul of “God Blessed the Fool,” the remainder of Soft Landing features some of the most direct, affecting songs in Perri’s canon. “Wrong About the Rain” drizzles a clavinet-funk groove in luxuriant guitarpeggios, but that plush exterior can’t conceal a festering urban angst: “I need the sand, I need the swim, I need that thing that happens when, out there all day, time slips away.” And with “Floriana” and the title track, Perri applies his guitar wizardry to a pair of drifting yet dramatic instrumentals that conjure mid-’70s fretboard-squeezers like Santana’s “Europa” and Jeff Beck’s “Diamond Dust” with their tear-jerking technique. Those aren’t the sort of names that normally come up in discussions about a Constellation Records release—or about any left-field indie artist for that matter—but as ever, Perri manages to filter these unexpected influences through his own humble, perpetually zen personality until they feel like a natural part of his meditative milieu. Accordingly, Perri counterbalances Soft Landing’s more audacious indulgences with the disarmingly simple and effortless “Back on Love,” a plaintive acoustic plea that not only echoes the melody of John Lennon’s “Imagine,” but also its message of holding onto our compassion in a cruel world. In both sound and sentiment, the song epitomizes that cherished quality Perri has been chasing his entire career—it is, in a word, timeless.

Saves the World,MUNA,by: Eve Barlow,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d6eaa87b34908000800ff8c/1:1/w_160/muna_savestheworld.jpg,2019-09-07 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/muna-saves-the-world/,RCA,"We listen to pop music because we see our reflection in it, and so we’ve welcomed in more non-heteronormative figures to reflect our realities. L.A. trio MUNA were ahead of pop’s greater recent queering—a space occupied by King Princess, Clairo, and Kim Petras, to name a few. The ’80s-style synths and dark narratives of their early songs prompted the press to label them the “gay HAIM,” a disservice to both acts. Besides, MUNA emerged as punks—producing their own 2017 debut About U, presenting as sexually fluid, and educating on gender pronouns. Yet they’ve hidden in plain sight; the defiant melodies and corresponding political rhetoric of “Loudspeaker” or “I Know a Place” echo in Maggie Rogers’ air-punch moments and the 1975’s slogan campaigns. In 2017, the group toured with Harry Styles. They are major-signed but remain on the mainstream’s fringes. With their second album, Saves the World, they don’t bask in being on the right side of history. Instead they put themselves on trial, dissecting their own frailties before addressing those of their enemies. “Saving yourself is the key to saving the world,” they say, explaining the spunky title. You can’t function as an activist if your personal fiascos need attention. So MUNA peer into murky puddles and ask who stares back. “I’ve been looking at myself in the mirror,” lead songwriter Katie Gavin sings on “Number One Fan,” as her bandmates Naomi McPherson (producer) and Josette Maskin (guitarist) flex their alt-rock muscles towards state-of-the-art pop. The soundtrack to Gavin’s transformation is as sentimental as it is versatile. The more she unwinds, the further her bandmates extend their arms, shifting from the Coyote Ugly country-lite of “Taken” to the warbling “Memento,” a meditative vignette about a bee sting. The trio met at USC; they’re a college-pop band, and they peck like magpies from ’80s and ’90s FM radio. “It's Gonna Be Okay, Baby” is Bon Iver as the Police, cradling Gavin’s coming-of-age. “Good News (Ya-Ya Song)” and “Number One Fan” are wordy, turn-of-the-millennium-style confessionals, as bewildered with life’s nonsense as they are humored by it (“So I went to an art exhibit, there wasn’t any art”). “Never” follows the school of Robyn, raving through crisis. The pain and self-worthlessness Gavin exhibited on MUNA’s debut is abandoned in favor of enlightenment. She documents sex, drugs, and suicidal tendencies with less melodrama and more compassion. “You finally read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance,” she sings, smiling at her own Angeleno new ageism. A triad of desolate songs at the album’s heart race by as though seeking to end their anguish. MUNA are at their most cinematic on “Navy Blue,” which sparkles like a Nicolas Winding Refn movie. Gavin drives adjacent to the ocean, imagining herself drowning in post-breakup misery. Her notes fly so lightly across the bassline, you can taste the salt spray. Layered club nocturn “Never” serves as the album’s quarter-life-crisis rock bottom. “Consider this my resignation… I'll never sing again,” she broods, and as her voice nears exhaustion, guitars erupt into digital screams of distress, or perhaps rebirth. The brighter, more buoyant “Pink Light” sets her up for a fresh beginning, but the chorus springs her back to the past: “I keep retracing that storyline, thinking if I start again, I can change the way it ends.” The album’s bookends sound like lullabies. Over simple arpeggiated piano, opener “Grow” wants to let go of “childish things.” Its opening line—“I want to grow up”—is a universal plea for a generation lacking in reliable mentors. Closer “It’s Gonna Be Okay, Baby” addresses those past phases of life, protecting Gavin’s voice within the band’s wall of synthetic effects. She addresses her younger self with the candidness of a journal entry, repeating the titular mantra with the benefit of hindsight. You’re gonna feel much more like God is a mystery
and Jesus is a metaphor
Yeah, you’re gonna tell your reflection
It’s gonna be OK, baby Eyeing the mirror one last time, she finds a trust in an older, wiser self. After three years in the public eye, Gavin reveals her flaws more plainly. Though her story is one of heartbreak, it’s not about who breaks hearts, but rather what: inherited patterns, old habits, misinformation. Saves the World approaches adulthood with unabashed honesty, so you’ll be ready to smash the system a little more gently. And while MUNA’s pop is preoccupied with that greater sense of purpose, it carries its heavy heart to the dancefloor.

Wallop,!!!,by: Jesse Dorris,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d6565a7c7e6ee0009d820eb/1:1/w_160/!!!_wallop.jpg,2019-09-07 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/-wallop/,Warp,"In Lizzy Goodman’s 2017 oral history Meet Me in the Bathroom: Rebirth and Rock and Roll in New York City 2001-2011, Nic Offer, who’s spent the 21st century hosting party monsters !!! across eight albums and many more singles, talks about looking back. “Each decade pays for the sins of the last,” he says. He’s talking about the way the grunge and rave of the 1990s sought to counter the stadium rock and dance pop of the 1980s with what he called “a new sort of slickness,” a kind of trashy authenticity. Over the years !!! have countered the po-faced myopia of the early 2000s with their own trashy authenticity. They slapped a dad-joke patch on mom-jeans funk to critique the police state with “Me and Giuliani Down by the School Yard (A True Story).” They’ve again and again ordered up the ugliest sleeves that their label, hero-to-all-your-designer-friends Warp, has ever approved. They turned one of the Magnetic Fields’ best songs, a conflicted invocation of MDMA as a psychic and physiological bulwark against homophobic violence, into affable coffee-shop disco, then turned Stereolab’s Marxist-feminist French disko into Brooklyn boys’ noise with a live cover band, Stereolad. They’ve done it all with an accomplished, if ironic, panache. But Wallop begins with a great whooshing sound, like a sort of time travel, and indeed this solid collection is a change of course: a serious embrace of the sounds of the ’90s, an attempt to come to grips with that “new sort of slickness.” Opener “Let It Change U” is a cocky hulk that could’ve waddled onto an early Chemical Brothers or mid-career Beastie Boys album; the titular it is, of course, rhythm. The next track, “Couldn’t Have Known,” cuts acoustic guitars and stuttering breaks into a nod to Akufen’s 2002 barnstormer “Deck the House,” one of the first tracks of the new millennium that, with its kaleidoscopic cut-up of country licks, R&B runs, and a million other bits of cultural detritus, really sounded like the future. Bookends in place, the rest of Wallop fills in the ’90s timeline. “Off the Grid” gathers Liars’ Angus Andrew and longtime !!! co-vocalist Meah Pace for a roiling bit of nihilism. “Get up, it’s here/You’ve got to start to assume/The end is near/And not a moment too soon,” they chant. It’s like Primal Scream covering “1999” in 1999. Like a few other tracks, it dissolves into a dubbed coda (“In the Grid”) that’s just long enough to make you wonder what a No Protection or Echo Dek-style version might achieve, yet not long enough to demonstrate it. But then in crashes “Serbia Drums,” built off a riff drummer Chris Egan recorded while on tour; with its crunchy guitars and DX-7 style bell melodies, it sounds about as dangerous as the dominatrix number in Showgirls. It doesn’t suck. None of Wallop sucks, really, although “Rhythm of the Gravity” duckwalks up to cock-rock with an ostentatious guitar solo and breakbeats that are probably fun live but flatfooted on record. “$50 Million” and “My Fault” are selfies of a funky schmuck who doesn’t deserve these limber party jams but earns them like a salary anyway; the latter boasts a particularly lovely, fluttering synth sound with the exact timbre of empathy. “UR Paranoid” is hyper-tense until detonation and even tenser afterward, as effects drip down the walls of a good house beat and gaggles of vocals chase each other, crying out, “I’m not the one who’s paranoid!” But of course the ’90s were a decade very much in its feelings, and the best parts of Wallop are its most emotional. “Domino” is among the prettiest and most intelligent songs !!! have ever recorded; its delicate investigation of urban planning avoids “Me & Giuliani”’s smugness, building a multi-level argument mirrored by a multilayered sound in debt to IDM. “Slow Motion” has an undertow of a drum loop and a chorus of Offers ruminating on regret while Uzor talks herself into trouble. “Everyone’s a total fucking idiot sometimes, right? Right?” she asks, while icy-hot melodies rise and fall. “When I look back on this moment/Think about hindsight/What am I going to say I was a total fucking idiot about then?” The loop just loops until it loses its will to rise out of a bed of indiscernible chatter. Nostalgia is a killer, but luckily penultimate track “This Is the Door” is one inflatable bootie balloon short of a Lizzo anthem, and a hell of a showcase for Meah Pace. “Maybe you think that I don’t notice/But I do/So I thought I should show this to you,” she sings, her voice casual as if escorting you around her gracious living room while tasteful (and, yes, slick) adult-contemporary pop plays on the stereo. “This is the door.” And you’re out. Horns arrive to celebrate, Pace repeats her breakup line with increasing force to make sure you heard it, and in a few minutes the track has burned better than sage in clearing out the sins of the past. Onward.

Lost Girls,Bat for Lashes,by: Ben Hewitt,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3b70937943ca0008c14f2b/1:1/w_160/lostgirls_batforlashes.jpg,2019-09-06 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bat-for-lashes-lost-girls/,AWAL,"Natasha Khan writes songs that sound not quite of this earth. She spun strange fairy tales on 2006’s Fur and Gold, summoned celestial grandeur on 2009’s Two Suns, invoked intimate magic on 2012’s The Haunted Man. And 2016’s The Bride had the candlelit chill of an old M.R. James story, with Khan singing from the perspective of a woman whose fiancé, killed in a car crash on the way to their wedding, would not rest quietly. Lost Girls is no less fantastical. Loosely centered around a new character (Nikki Pink) and a gang of biker women who roam the sunset streets of an eerie, make-believe vision of LA, it’s essentially a love letter to the ’80s sci-fi and fantasy films of her youth. She wrote the songs while working on a script of her own, and the starry-eyed, big-screen synth-pop of “Kids in the Dark” sounds like the soundtrack to the big romantic clinch in her own coming-of-age flick. Otherworldly flourishes are everywhere—but they’re also steeped in nostalgia. Familiar scenes flash by like a supercut of worn-out Blockbuster VHS tapes: vampires jumping off of bridges a la The Lost Boys, an ET-inspired nighttime bike ride, a glimpse of the infamous Hollywood Forever Cemetery that hosted the undead frights in One Dark Night. Dark electronics flicker with the mystery of John Carpenter or swell with the euphoria of John Williams. On standout “The Hunger,” Khan lusts for blood over the throb of a haunted church organ, while a creepy saxophone slithers around what sounds like the bones of a lost Cure song on the gothy instrumental “Vampires.” It’s a vivid world, although less singular or startling than Khan’s previous creations; these touchstones have become so deeply embedded in the cultural fabric that they offer the same comforting glow as an episode of “Stranger Things” rather than the shock of the new. Lost Girls is richest when Khan puts her own devilish spin on those sacred texts, like the beats that boil and bubble under the shimmering disco of “Feel For You” or the mutated and masochistic Giorgio Moroder banger “So Good.” She has a deliciously macabre ball on “Jasmine,” using her incongruously clipped British accent to narrate a very American horror story in the Hollywood hills. “Little girl cracks your heart in two/Sucks the juice,” she whispers, keyboards pulsing eerily as she revels in the spilled guts and grisly details. “I know it’s the real thing,” sings Khan longingly on “Kids in the Dark.” It’s a reminder that her magically theatrical songs are most powerful when rooted in simple, stark human needs, from the desperate desire that floods “Peach Sky” to the heartbreak that propels “Mountains” into its crushing coda. It’s far from the most explicit homage here, but in those fraught moments when she’s struggling to get to grips with something huge and scary and thrilling, she sounds just like the overwhelmed kids from her beloved ’80s films—the ones who also got in too deep and had to somehow make sense of the inexplicable, however daunting it seemed.

About Us,G Flip,by: Colin Lodewick,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d656b20c7e6ee0009d820ef/1:1/w_160/GFlip_AboutUs.jpg,2019-09-06 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/g-flip-about-us/,Future Classic,"When the Melbourne band EMPRA broke up in 2016, touring drummer Georgia Flipo took it as a signal to start making her own music. She spent the following year isolating herself in her bedroom, eschewing friends and family and emerging with the viral hit “About You” in early 2018. Built around a rumbling synth and cresting with a massive, over-the-top drum fill, the song bore traces of Art Angels-era Grimes and seemed preordained for success, especially paired with its endearingly lo-fi video. “About You” was an anthem of unspecific longing and indecision: “Just let me go/Give me one more chance, baby,” she pled in the bridge. About Us, her debut album, spends its entirety in this same purgatory. The first lyric of opener “Lover” is effectively the album’s thesis: “I just wanna be your lover/You know that we ain’t friends.” The song revolves around that couplet at a glacial pace, and each time Flip repeats it, her voice grows more ragged. Without any specificity to add color to the troubled relationship in question, though, the song remains shrouded in opacity. A surprising number of other torch songs follow “Lover,” considering the album’s modest 10-track length, and none is more revealing than any other. “Morning” sees Flip pining for the same absent lover but admitting no fault for why that lover might be gone (“I fucked up” is all she reveals). Immediately after is “Waking Up Tomorrow,” which sounds like the same slow piano ballad, just more plaintive and desperate. “Bring Me Home” leads the album’s come-down and is a rewrite of Rihanna and Mikky Ekko’s “Stay.” Between the fretting love songs are Flip’s more straightforward attempts at crafting viral hits. On “I Am Not Afraid,” she offers up a self-help anthem on the order of Kelly Clarkson’s “Stronger (What Doesn’t Kill You)” and Katy Perry’s “Roar”: “I am not afraid to do this alone/I know that it scares you but I am my own home,” she sings. The piano intro to “Drink Too Much” generates a little excitement with its almost-quote of Dolly Parton’s “9 to 5,” but again succumbs to the plight of non-specificity. It’s a song about losing someone because of your bad habits, but that much is evident from the title alone. “Stupid” tries on the glowering noir-pop production of Banks and Halsey. “Why we always actin’ stupid?/Why we always do this, do this, do this to ourselves?” she asks. But—do what to themselves? Act stupid how? Without more detail, it’s hard to care. There is one welcome moment of certainty on the album. On “Killing My Time,” G Flip’s voice gains a self-assured edge that’s not present anywhere else. The song opens with a dancehall-inspired beat that simmers in the background as she exclaims: “Leave me baby/Please leave me alone.” It’s perhaps the most definitive statement on the whole album, one made more effective by an infectious hook that echoes “The Middle,” last year’s inescapable collaboration between Zedd, Maren Morris, and Grey. “Killing My Time,” with its feeling of resolution, would do well as the album’s penultimate track—a position held instead by “About You.” Structured as it is, the album concludes in largely the same place where it begins.","Georgia Flipo follows up her viral hit “About You” with a pop debut that hopes to re-bottle the song’s charm.

Whities 023 (The Act of Falling From the 8th Floor),Carl GariAbdullah Miniawy,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d6ed5029cec850008642d3c/1:1/w_160/gari_whities.jpg,2019-09-06 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/carl-gari-abdullah-miniawy-whities-023-the-act-of-falling-from-the-8th-floor/,Whities,"Early in 2016, Will Bankhead’s eclectic electronic label The Trilogy Tapes dropped a thrilling run of club-melting 12""s from Rezzett, Four Legs, and Call Super’s Ondo Fudd alias. Slotted among these was an eerie, queasy release credited to Carl Gari and Abdullah Miniawy, with a stark photograph of Tahrir Square and the scorched exterior of the former parliament building in Cairo. The music matched that smoldering, post-revolutionary scene; the heavy atmosphere of the country and the bitterness of the military dictatorship resonated in haunting drones, ominous throbs, and a voice incanting in digitally processed Arabic. Despite what the credits suggested, it was not a duo, but rather a spontaneous collaboration between the German electronic trio Carl Gari and Egyptian singer/trumpeter Abdullah Miniawy. Three years on, Carl Gari and Miniawy emerge on another trailblazing English imprint, Nic Tasker’s Whities, again offering a bewildering, heart-shaking detour from normal club fare. The Act of Falling From the 8th Floor is a harrowing and desolate listen that captures the mood and mindset of Miniawy and numerous other Egyptians living under the brutal oppression of the Al-Sisi regime. Miniawy only escaped by fleeing to France. The move makes for a less hurried collaboration than the group’s debut, which the musicians recorded in Cairo after their first meeting; these recordings took place at a remote house in the Bavarian forest. Even if the meaning of Miniawy’s lyrics escapes non-Arabic speakers, Carl Gari amplify their poetry with bleak, turbid electronics bringing to mind Joy Division and post-industrial soundscapes transported from Europe to North Africa. The dread-filled throb of “Haj” recalls the Scott Walker-penned “The Electrician,” from 1978, which itself put the brutal right-wing regimes of Chile and Argentina into song form. But where that song pressurized until it finally burst at the chorus, here Carl Gari and Miniawy make the atmosphere more leaden, the pressure inescapable. In a broken voice, Miniawy’s words suggest volumes in only a few lines: “I beg you, man who ploughs/If I left after being a witness to the accident/Please don’t erase its traces.” With its sluggish drum machines, minor-key synths, and heavy guitar reverb, “Zawaj” suggests the dour gloom of early Portishead emanating from a more desperate time, Miniawy’s voice pushing through the morass and soaring over the rubble. The centerpiece of the six-track release is “B’aj بعاج,” pairing metallic drones with a poem by Miniawy that follows a man’s fall from an eighth-floor window. Against a beat like an electric wire scraping against corrugated metal (echoing the sparse, desolate percussion of Joy Division’s “Decades”), his delivery is straightforward as he details how he plunges past each floor of his building. His downward path charts a microcosm of Egyptian society, everyday scenes that take on a fraught aspect; as the facade of home life slips, despair surges to the surface. There’s the fleeting image of a skipping rope that turns into a hangman’s noose, the tactile feel of fingernails against metal, a vertiginous succession of slides. All these details, these little failures, add up to convey a broader sense of dread, depression, and societal collapse. But rather than offering the release of final impact, as the narrator reaches the end, Miniawy howls the kicker: “High diving from the first floor/Taking you again to floor number nine.” It’s a damnation worse than death, the very act of falling turned into its own Sisyphean hell. The Act of Falling From the 8th Floor is a gripping soundtrack to the inner despair not only of Egyptians, but anyone feeling bereft of hope in the modern world—a sound that keeps growing louder.","Three years after their debut collaboration, the Egyptian singer/poet/trumpeter and the German electronic trio reunite for six haunting tracks of socio-political despair and existential dread.

"-Ugh, those feels again",Snoh Aalegra,by: Stephen Kearse,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d6567cfff9129000824150e/1:1/w_160/snoh_thosefeels.jpeg,2019-09-06 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/snoh-aalegra-ugh-those-feels-again/,ARTiumAWAL,"For LA-based singer Snoh Aalegra, feelings hit like tear gas, seeping into the skin and scrambling the senses. Whether in the throes of love or heartbreak, the romance she sings of is forever smoldering, a breath away from flaring into full-blown passion or asphyxiating into ash. Snoh has been workshopping this dramatic take on soul for half a decade, and on her second album, the process finally bears fruit. Signed to No I.D.’s ARTium Recordings alongside Vince Staples and Jhené Aiko, Snoh is a bit of a polyglot, straddling R&B, soul, and rap. She has described her music as “cinematic soul,” and the label is florid but not inaccurate. -Ugh, those feels again is a sequel to her 2017 album, FEELS, and shares that record’s emphasis on mood. In the vein of her idols Stevie Wonder and Whitney Houston, Snoh prefers lush, grandiose arrangements. That grandeur often served as a crutch on FEELS and the EPs that preceded it, puffing up vanilla writing and competent but anonymous singing, but on Ugh, indulgence becomes integral to the storytelling, swelling and subsiding in cadence with Snoh’s impassioned vocals. Snoh wrote Ugh after returning to dating following the end of a long-term relationship she’s characterized as “depressing” and “exhausting,” and that freshness of perspective resonates throughout. She sounds excited to be back in the mix, complications and all. “I Want You Around” pairs the zero-gravity nausea of a fast-evolving fling with the thrill of defining its pace. “I don’t wanna kiss you, yet/I just wanna feel you,” Snoh sings, dousing the flames without extinguishing them. “Situationship” swings between frustration and insouciance, questioning an undefined relationship with a whimsical, almost anthropological curiosity. “So many times you and I made love in my mind,” Snoh sings, thinking out loud yet going with the flow. There’s a clear sense of wonder beneath the “ugh”; for Snoh, a vexing romance is at least a new experience. The record’s sequence allows the highs of life on the rebound (side A) to give way to loneliness and reflection on past love (side B). The pivot makes sense thematically, but stylistically it’s regressive. The front half is full of strobing midtempo compositions that push Snoh to perform intuitively, switching between compact rap-inflected flows, glossy melodies, and sultry ad-libs. As she trades moans with the electric guitar on “Toronto,” leads a choir on “Find Someone Like You,” and bounces with the bass line on “Whoa,” she feels loose and personable. The tracks on side B often push her into a corner, forcing old habits. The Portishead-indebted flip of “Danube Incident” on “Peace” is lazy and dry. No I.D. and Steve Wyreman’s psyched-out swirls of synths on “Charleville 9200, Pt. II” are beautiful, but Snoh’s writing can’t match the lavishness. Though her smoky, melancholic voice has plenty of heft, when she sings, “Paris doesn’t feel the same,” and “LA doesn’t feel the same,” it feels like she’s drafting humblebrags for Insta rather than mourning lost love. Wintry, ethereal production by Toronto’s Maneesh on “Be Careful” fits better, but Snoh’s pen again falls short. “These are bad times,” she reads from a church marquee. The album’s nucleus is a three-song run in which Snoh addresses her recent ex directly, moving from abandonment (“You”) to bitterness (“Njoy”) to intolerance (“Nothing to Me”). The strength of the sequence is Snoh’s candor, which she applies to herself as well as her ex as their love definitively becomes past tense. “He wants to hold me/I’m alone,” she sings bittersweetly on “Nothing to Me.” That sense of quiet resolution is what makes Ugh such a leap for her. The feels remain noxious and suffocating, but as she embraces the delirium, the “ughs” slowly turn into insights.","On the sequel to 2017’s FEELS, the Iranian Swedish singer’s dramatic take on soul finally bears fruit.

Fear Inoculum,Tool,by: Jeremy D. Larson,Reviews Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d683f24b8b930000899be1f/1:1/w_160/Tool_fear.jpg,2019-09-05 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tool-fear-inoculum/,RCA,"Tool are just King Crimson in Joker makeup. They thrive in an enormously popular world of polyrhythms and prurience; of Jungian philosophy and Bill Hicks memes; of pewter dragon statues with orbs in their mouths and guys telling you that DMT is actually a chemical in your brain. Forged in the mad-at-my-dad fires of ’90s post-grunge and nu-metal, the progressive metal quartet has sustained a decades-long career on equal parts technical precision and psychedelic bullshit. Their multi-part songs are loosely about embracing pain, grief, desire, transgression, until all your chakras are open and you know exactly why the pieces fit. They’ve been a punchline for years. But ever since hiding a song at track 69 of their 1993 debut album, Tool have always been sort of in on the joke. A song on their second album Ænima dramatically recited the recipe for weed cookies in German, they have pulled many exhausting April Fool’s jokes on their fans, including one that claimed they were in a horrible bus accident and one that stated the famously apostatical lead singer Maynard James Keenan had quit the band and found Jesus. It’s just that these edgy, twisted, “funny” parts of Tool are empirically stupid. Sure, Keenan has a versatile, emotive voice that granted Tool an audience beyond metalheads. But what he’s actually singing about is and has always been the province of pseudo-spiritual stoners and gamer intellectualism. You see, “Forty Six & 2” is about the Jungian concept of the shadow, and “Rosetta Stoned” is about tripping out and seeing aliens. His trickster humor has curdled of late, culminating in Keenan writing a song in response to a bad Yelp review about his winery. In recent years, Keenan has spoken to the press far more about his Arizona winery than Tool’s music. (Keenan is a very serious winemaker who, nevertheless, named his vineyard after a pubic wig.) Recording sessions for the band’s fifth album, Fear Inoculum, revolved around his grape harvesting schedule. His wine, his other bands Puscifer and A Perfect Circle, and his restless and enigmatic nature are, in part, the reasons behind the 13-year break between now and Tool’s previous album, 10,000 Days, a gap made almost mythic by the band’s absence from streaming services until earlier this year. The band’s discography roared back into the digital marketplace, smashing Billboard records in the process. Fear Inoculum arrives at a moment of high demand for Tool’s music, filling a vacuum they themselves created. If there’s one thing that the 86 minutes of Fear Inoculum provides, it is the sound of four people making long, complicated songs together. There are hardly any overdubs, production flourishes, or additional instrumentation, just Keenan’s delicate howl, bassist Justin Chancellor, guitarist Adam Jones, and one of the most lauded drummers in modern rock, Danny Carey. The stripped-down purity of sound here means that everything hangs on the songs themselves, all of which run over 10 minutes, save for a few ambient interludes and a palate-cleansing, nearly five-minute Carey drum solo backed by a giant custom synth. You get what is expected of an album over a decade in the making: a more mature, sometimes exciting collection that feels both overworked and undercooked. It is hard to parse the difference between which choices here are wise (Keenan taking a back seat to showcase the interplay of the band more) and which are stale (for all the band’s rhythmic exploration, they couldn’t find one new harmonic mode to play in?). One of Tool’s problems on Fear Inoculum is that, with few exceptions, the songs feel static and brittle. They don’t have the live-wire feel of 1996’s Ænima or 2001’s Lateralus, the album that Fear Inoculum sounds most in thrall to. Songs like the opening title track feel long because they exist in protracted straight lines of mechanical riffs, as if assembled through an instruction manual. The hybridization that made Tool so popular on the radio in the late ’90s has rusted: They are part stoner metal, part prog rock, part mainstream metal, all working in ignorance and opposition to each other. Things do come together a few times. The 15-minute closer “7empest” brings the biggest fireworks from Carey and Jones, the two undoubted stars of the album, adding alluring melody and texture to these bloated epics. But the highlight far and away is “Invincible,” with Keenan singing a revealing refrain about a struggle to “remain relevant” and “consequential.” It feels vulnerable in a new way, a lyric that finally doesn’t come from a defensive, get-off-my-lawn stance. And yet there’s still that Morrissey-level smugness when looking back at his glory years: “The things we’ve done/Caligula would grin.” That line lands poorly in light of a 2018 allegation from a woman on Twitter who claimed Keenan sexually assaulted her in 2000 when she was 17, an accusation that Keenan has denied. “Invincible” builds to a climax where all the polymeter comes together in a mezzo unison that feels like “Forty Six & 2” with a mute on it. The fact that the ending of “Invincible” doesn’t try to kick you in the ribs points to the larger issue: When Tool think they are using time as a psychedelic additive, it comes off as simple riff-repetition from a band that sounds tired. The stoners of Sleep or the experimentalists of Sumac own this lane of daring, hypnotic metal songs because they bring stakes; you hear people moving in on the instruments and ripping out the notes. Save for  Jones’ slide guitar solo, the 23 minutes that make up “Descending” and “Culling Voices” feel so barren and overwrought, you can practically see the band sitting on cushioned stools in the studio, quietly counting out the meter with polite head-nods. What does the third decade look like for a band whose hit singles include “Prison Sex” and “Stinkfist”? It looks like an aging quartet betting on being calculating and precise, carefully reining things in and keeping everything familiar. Fear Inoculum could have come out any time in the last 13 years, or even the last 20 years. Above all, Fear Inoculum pays homage to Tool itself, a long-delayed encore that has fans racing back to the arena. In a recent interview, Keenan said that one of the main reasons this album took 13 years to make was fear, crippling self-doubt, and constant second-guessing. There’s no joke there, just a bit of self-reflective honesty, which is the one thing that helps keeps this hulking record afloat.

Let Love,Common,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d644eab26e2b40009eed6d8/1:1/w_160/letlove_common.jpg,2019-09-05 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/common-let-love/,Loma Vista,"Let Love is clean, edifying rap that is as trusting as it is noble. The album, which Common has dubbed a companion to his new memoir, Let Love Have the Last Word, released earlier this year, is a meditation on love and its many forms—familial, romantic, five-pillars love (aka a love of hip-hop), self-love, the love of God, and an unconditional love he’d like to foster among all humans. Common would like to use his platform to change the world, but he’d settle for giving pep talks to anyone listening. “I’m in a phase, all I see is victory/You on that wave, then come and get with me,” the Chi-town guru raps on opener “Good Morning Love,” and while it’s unclear where exactly he’d like to lead us, his hope can be galvanizing. Produced with a trio of jazz specialists—percussionist Karriem Riggins (who last collaborated with Common alongside Robert Glasper on 2018’s August Greene), composer and pianist Samora Pinderhughes, and upright bassist Burniss Earl Travis II—Common’s Let Love often sounds more like lounge music than rap music. It suits him. The live instrumentation, mostly warm keyboard chords and soft pattering drums, build mellow, subtle grooves that support both his vibe and demeanor. From the jam-heavy energy of “Leaders (Crib Love)” to the more muted “Show Me That You Love Me” with Jill Scott, these songs feel understated, constant, and tender, often in service of firsthand revelations. Where the album falters is when it stops illustrating how love can be applicable in our everyday lives and starts looking at the entire world through rose-colored glasses. It isn’t that he’s too optimistic; it’s that his optimism isn’t pragmatic. It’s the sort of naivety that overlooks how loving A.I. could easily lead to Skynet. Common transcended conscious rap and evolved into virtuous rap in the wake of his hollow Oscar-winning Selma collaboration with John Legend, “Glory,” becoming a living, breathing social justice hashtag in the process. The fury and force that fueled 2016’s Black America Again have dissipated. If August Greene was a call-to-arms for unity, Let Love is simply a plea for compassion. Occasionally, Common loses the plot and gets so theoretical that real love isn’t at the center of his verses anymore. After a bit of word salad on “Hercules,” he raps, “Slow down, we can hold down/The fort of profound, thoughts that go ’round/The world is your town, it’s my town/It’s the new wave, we on high ground.” The concepts can become so abstract that they lose all meaning entirely. Across the album, his raps sometimes sound as if they were generated by an algorithm from an inspirational quote word cloud. Take this one: “Read me truth, lead me truth/The birth of freedom can’t be induced.” He wants so badly to make love a doctrine here, but love is a feeling, not an idea. Common finds the most success exhibiting the ways love has played a role in his own life. On “Memories of Home,” he reflects on the interactions that shaped him, bravely opening up about being molested as a child and how love helped him heal. “What’s a kid supposed to do?/When they goin’ through, what I was goin’ through,” he asks before having an epiphany: “Emotions meltin’, I began to release it/Things you can’t change, you could come to peace with.” Dilla cut “HER Love,” a spiritual sequel to his seminal Resurrection cut “I Used to Love H.E.R.,” finds Common falling for rap once again. It’s as if he’s renewing his vows. He raps to hip-hop as if it were a woman, exuding true love. There’s a wholeheartedness to its cornball enthusiasm that only he could pull off. Common is still an impressive rapper, though a bit more simplistic now than in the past. As he’s become more positive, his raps play it a bit safer. He leans into his signature flows like a crutch but he remains graceful. He can still puzzle out wordplay (“Tryna feed your fam, get Fed time”) and stack phonetic sounds with the best of them. He can still unravel an intricate thought with a string of words so elegant that listening demands empathy. Then there are the times where he’ll compare himself to a metaphorical cake just to preserve the structural integrity of his internal rhyme schemes. Sometimes it really does seem like he’s rapping to instill love, sometimes he’s rapping for rap’s sake, and those lines get smudged at times, but more often than not he’s methodical. It is in the moments where his precision underscores his affection that Let Love truly conquers.

Free Company,Boy Scouts,by: Peyton Thomas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d488b28331bd7000859d720/1:1/w_160/boyscouts_freecompany.jpg,2019-09-05 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/boy-scouts-free-company/,Anti-,"Music briefly deserted me last year after a boy kicked my heart in the ass. No song was capacious enough for all that I felt. Not a fists-in-the-air empowerment anthem, not a fuck-you punk tirade, not even a gently masochistic ballad. Obviously, the happy stuff was out, too: the grand swoon of Wolf Parade that had scored my daydreams; the Taylor Swift hook he sang to me that one afternoon, our legs swinging from the highest platform of a children’s playground. It was a little like that stage of grief where food turns to cardboard on your tongue. Nothing tastes good; nothing sounds good. You starve; you sit in silence. Free Company is an album I wish I’d had last autumn. Taylor Vick, an Oakland songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who performs as Boy Scouts, has made a generous and gorgeously empathetic chronicle of the aftermath of love. Through sunny arrangements and spare songwriting, Vick compresses the dust of her romantic disappointment into a glittering jewel. She loves the subject of her songs, but she loves herself, too—loves herself more, enough to step away and carry on, alone, with her head held high. Though Boy Scouts’ backing tracks are hazy and dreamlike, calling to mind tour mate Jay Som, Vick’s writing is direct, sharp, more bee-sting than butterfly. Free Company lulls the listener with short sentences and single syllables, until a tripwire of a lyric—“And now you’re mad at me/And I’m no longer twenty-three”—sends you sprawling headfirst into her perspective. Like the prose of Sally Rooney, Vick’s lyrics explore the vast complexity of human emotion by reveling in the simplicity of its expression. The indelible chorus of “All Right,” for instance, makes a meal out of a mere eight words: “I’m all right, I swear/I’m all right, how dare you?” In a song that explores weighty, existential questions—the existence of heaven, the permanence of souls, the mortifying ordeal of being known—Vick’s verbal economy keeps her feet planted firmly on the ground. This is not Vick’s first album as Boy Scouts. Her substantial Bandcamp output stretches back nearly a decade, studded with bedroom recordings and borrowed instruments. (On 2016’s “Homeroom Breakfast,” she offers endearing thanks to “rosie’s piano,” “scott’s guitar,” and “ben’s bass.”) What is clear in the arc from those records to this one are Vick’s substantial gifts not only as a writer, but as an editor. A throwaway line from “Homeroom Breakfast”—“Everything great has an expiration date”—resurfaces on “Free Company,” sharpened to a sad, subtle point in the service of a stronger song. A kind of emotional editing is evident, too. Vick has always contended, in her music, with rejection and resentment. But on “Free Company,” the woman who once wrote, “The world doesn’t need me like the world needs you” now writes from a position of hard-won, sober self-respect. “I don’t know why you’d fall through,” she sings. “I never did for you.” The arc of Free Company is shot through with tender compassion, even for those who’ve wronged her. On marvelous opener “Get Well Soon,” she offers her best wishes—but “no balloons, ’cause they just die, too”—to a former love. She doesn’t apologize for asserting herself: “Hardly a fight when you know I’m right.” In the depths of her grief, on “In Ya Too,” she likens herself to “the desert sprawl—empty, but still forceful.” She is still adjusting to aloneness, but she is learning to love its strange rhythms, its small pleasures. On “Momentary Love,” perched in her “favorite place,” she lets her thoughts wander to an old love during a moment of solitude. The memory still makes her ache, but that’s okay, she sings: “This doesn’t keep me sane/But the views up here lessen the pain.” We’ve devised no end of performative mechanisms to distance ourselves from our more unsavory emotions. But on “Free Company,” Taylor Vick dares to feel everything. Reflecting on the death of a friend, on gorgeous closer “You Were Once,” Vick sings, “I knew I’d never be the same again/I know it now and I knew it then/There is only so much you can pretend.” Vick wants her listeners to know both the fullness of her grief and the strength and spirit with which she freed herself of it. She renders each subtle swell of anger, embarrassment, and regret with something almost like gratitude, the retreat of each wave only affirming the solidity of her place on the shore.

Braindrops,Tropical Fuck Storm,by: Shaad D’Souza,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d684227b8b930000899be24/1:1/w_160/tropicalstorm_braindrops.jpg,2019-09-05 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tropical-fuck-storm-braindrops/,Joyful Noise,"With their 2018 single “Soft Power,” Melbourne quartet Tropical Fuck Storm wrote a eulogy for a world addled and spent by toxic internet culture. The sluggish garage blues number cycled from nuclear arms to class inequality to the impending release of Top Gun 2, unable to bring anything into focus. By the time it was over, lead singer Gareth Liddiard was glitching, drowning in a sea of cultural ephemera: “Bye bye Richie, Chachi, Fonzie, Ralphy, and Joanie Cunningham,” he mumbled, finding final solace in thoughts of the Happy Days gang. It was a disturbingly visceral interrogation of the ways we distract ourselves. But it’s hard to strike gold twice. On their sophomore record Braindrops, which arrives just a year after last year’s A Laughing Death in Meatspace, Tropical Fuck Storm are still sifting through the grubbiest entrails of politics and internet culture, but their perspective sounds stilted. Where once he came across as a kind of greasy, tweaking prophet, Liddiard is now, more often than not, an orator with nothing to say. If anyone’s qualified to make music about all-encompassing terror, it ought to be Tropical Fuck Storm. As part of legendary art-punks the Drones, guitarist Liddiard and bassist Fiona Kitschin dissected Australia’s toxic nationalism; keyboard player and guitarist Erica Dunn leads punk trio MOD CON, whose 2018 debut seethed with anti-capitalist fury; and Lauren Hammel is the drummer of ferocious anti-colonial metal band High Tension. Liddiard and Kitschin recruited Dunn and Hammel in 2017, after deciding to retire their 20-year-old Drones project in favor of a band with more women involved. Less than a year later, they released Meatspace, a twisted polemic against asinine political discourse and self-destructive internet echo chambers. But Braindrops isn’t animated by the same vigor and depth of thought, and Liddiard’s verbose witticisms now border on the insufferable. Lead single “The Planet of Straw Men,” ostensibly about the corruption of the Chinese and Russian governments, rambles abstractly about how states attempt to distract their citizens. It feels like tiresome galaxy-brain babble, itself an over-complicated attempt to distract from the fact that all points made are incredibly obvious. Even the satisfyingly irregular phrasing of Liddiard and Dunn’s twitchy yelps—“They’re always going for the coup de grâce!”—can’t make those words meaningful. Similarly, “The Happiest Guy Around” aims to make a point about the self-perpetuating nature of online arguments, but can’t find a greater conclusion than, “When you ever gonna learn to let things go?” Liddiard has cited Captain Beefheart as an influence on Braindrops, and you can hear the angular, upsetting rhythms of Trout Mask Replica and Doc at the Radar Station in more upbeat tracks like “Straw Men” and “Happiest Guy Around.” But Braindrops is more interesting when it leaves this realm. Album highlight “Who’s My Eugene?”, written and sung by Dunn about the notoriously unethical psychotherapist Eugene Landy, rides a hypnotic industrial chug that eventually slides into a convulsing, fuzzed-out denouement. The record’s slow, quiet final stretch coheres in a way the rest of Braindrops fails to: The introspective “Aspirin” plods and clatters, vividly conjuring the discomfort of glimpsing an ex at the gas station. Too often Braindrops’ commentary feels arbitrary or pro forma, but eight-minute closer “Maria 63” reconjures the album’s missing pathos. The song tells a fabricated story of Maria Orsic, a mysterious and, in Liddiard’s estimation, entirely fake Nazi witch exalted by online conspiracists. In Tropical Fuck Storm’s telling, Orsic is a trickster capable of duping even a keen-eyed Mossad agent. It’s not just a ham-fisted fake news allegory; like “Soft Power,” it’s an engrossing, haunted fable, a way to link society’s obsession with conspiracy to our basic needs for security and comfort. It’s proof that Tropical Fuck Storm are still clever when they want to be, able to channel obsessive rage into real insight. Braindrops could’ve used more like it.

Forever Turned Around,Whitney,by: Sophie Kemp ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3683ac1852280008e54248/1:1/w_160/whitney_foreverturnedaround.jpg,2019-09-04 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/whitney-forever-turned-around/,Secretly Canadian,"Whitney’s music lives in the harmonious space where contemporary indie rock melts into ’70s soft rock. It’s part of what makes them so easy to enjoy, like a nuzzle from someone else’s dog. They sound nice, simple, scruffy, which doesn’t always amount to compelling music, but the band’s palatability works in their favor. At this point, Whitney are a phenomenon, a commodifiable entity. They’re legends in their hometown of Chicago: They have their own holiday and a beer named in their honor. Even to the casual indie-rock listener, they’re inescapable. And rare as it may seem, the reason for the fervor is because they’re actually good. Their second album, Forever Turned Around, is welcoming and wooly, yet slightly more isolated and somber than its 2016 predecessor. There aren’t any standouts here, no “Golden Days” equivalent that you could bop along to at a cookout. Instead, Whitney dial it back to a gentle lull. Forever Turn Around ends up being meandering, sleepy sometimes to a fault, a charmingly doe-eyed take on the kind of classic rock revivalism that plays well at music festivals. Forever Turned Around is a study in environments for falling in and out of love, finding beauty in the little things, and meditating on the passage of time. The imagery comes in the form of redwood trees, rhododendrons in bloom, and dewy grass on a cool morning. On “My Life Alone,” co-frontman Julien Ehrlich sings of “lonely nights/Waiting for the sunrise” and passing the time by watching “rivers roll,” while swelling horns and honeyed guitar stretch into AM-radio rock territory. “Valleys (My Love),” a reflection on the late stages of a relationship, is a more effective environment for Whitney to explore what it means to feel lovelorn. Fingerpicked guitar meets vintage organ, warming the space around Ehlrich’s words like blush blended into a cheek. The lyrics feel stark in comparison: “I feel like I’m holding on/To a place in your heart that’s long gone,” he sings, his voice heavy with melancholy. At its worst, Forever Turned Around is a bit boring. If you listen to it too many times you might forget it’s on; it blends into the background easily. But the mood it conjures is surprisingly rich. The album plays out like a gorgeous day at the end of the summer and the bittersweet calm that follows as the weather gets cooler. It encapsulates the idea of the saddest and most perfect time of year: You put on a song as buoyant as “Giving Up,” or “Rhododendron,” and you see a version of yourself that you may have lost touch with. Whitney haven’t changed much since their last album, and truthfully we don’t expect them to. They’ll keep releasing beaming soft rock albums coated in golden-hour light. But dependability is its own kind of virtue. Like holidays and beers, Whitney are the same each time.

Like the River Loves the Sea,Joan Shelley,by: Graeme Thomson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d488dae286dd9000878c485/1:1/w_160/joanshelley_liketheriverlovesthesea.jpg,2019-09-04 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/joan-shelley-like-the-river-loves-the-sea/,No Quarter,"The fifth solo album from Joan Shelley, the Kentucky folk singer-songwriter, arrives with the promise of sanctuary. Like the River Loves the Sea is a 12-track dispatch from a carefully cultivated microclimate in which the worlds of nature and love coexist and co-depend, each offered a fighting chance to blossom away from the persistent clamor of the everyday. On paper, perhaps, it reads like a retreat. (Shelley calls it “a haven for overstimulated heads in uncertain times.”) In practice, it sounds like a bolstering of defenses—strong and unapologetic. Over the past five years, Shelley has subjected her music to a process of rewilding. The noisier post-rock terrain of earlier albums, notably Electric Ursa, has been grassed over to create something naturalistic and unadorned. Aided by her core collaborators, James Elkington and Nathan Salsburg, she has pared down her songs to the base elements of acoustic instrumentation and her softly luminous voice: cool, unshowy, conversational. Now and then there are drums, marking time rather than disturbing it. Yet with each step she adds a new flavor. On her last album, 2017’s Joan Shelley, the surprise ingredient turned out to be a wholesome pinch of Jeff Tweedy, who added bass and guitar and produced Shelley at his Loft studio in Chicago. This time Shelley and her bandmates recorded in Reykjavik, and although the sound is fashioned from an intricate blend of guitar, piano, and keyboard, the emphasis has changed once again, primarily due to the violin and cello orchestrations of Icelandic sisters Þórdís Gerður Jónsdóttir and Sigrún Kristbjörg Jónsdóttir. Their contributions lend these songs their wings. On “Cycle” and “Stay All Night,” the tensile shimmer recalls the high-wire tumble of strings at the climax of Van Morrison’s “Astral Weeks.” Large parts of the album are almost overwhelmingly beautiful. On “Teal” and “High on the Mountain,” the melodies tumble down like mountain water, at once fresh and familiar. These are summery, late-1960s folk-pop songs left to meander in the meadows. Other tracks are tougher than tree trunks. “Coming Down for You,” a rigid, crackling, minor-key bluegrass tune with vocals shared between Shelley and her fellow Kentuckian Will Oldham, firmly rebuffs any whiff of the bucolic. On a record where the smallest movements matter, both musically and lyrically, Shelley proves hyper-attuned to the twitch of the moment. On “Teal,” she recalls the instant when “the bones of my neck lifted.” On “When What It Is,” a distant rattle of harmonium somehow conjures the precarious nature of commitment. Several songs track shifting romantic fortunes via the changing seasons, recognizing that change is hard-wired. “The Fading,” where she is again joined by Oldham, links broken-down love to the inevitable churn of harrow and harvest, drought and flood. On “The Sway”—a sepia country-blues, reminiscent of Cowboy Junkies—fences fall and rivers turn to mud, just as the many forms of love investigated here are similarly buffeted by outside forces. All that’s left to hold on to is the certainty that what has changed now will in time change again. In the flux, coupling becomes a matter of sacred communion. On “High on the Mountain,” Shelley recalls a time “when the bed wasn’t mine but ours.” On “The Fading,” the outline of a lover’s form remains after they are gone, both comfort and curse. “Tell Me Something” makes explicit the raw carnality underpinning many of these songs: “Take me to the bed, shake me to my knees,” she sings, as a lone viola slices through the pheromones, “where I can find a piece of you, and you can have a piece of me.” There are other moments where the animating spark is less present, when the simple nursery-rhyme cadences of Shelley’s melodies feel a little too homespun. “Awake” is almost cutesy, “Any Day Now” a routine jog. Mostly, Like the River Loves the Sea succeeds in elevating Shelley’s ruminations on “the ground I am bound to” and “the tender things around me” to matters of universal resonance.

Dykes to Watch Out For,DUMP HIM,by: Linnie Greene,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d644cdcc7e6ee0009d8203e/1:1/w_160/dumphim_dykes.jpg,2019-09-04 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dump-him-dykes-to-watch-out-for/,Get BetterMusical Fanzine,"The easiest analog to DUMP HIM’s debut LP, Dykes to Watch Out For, is ’90s riot grrrl and queercore—the Massachusetts punk quartet named their label after a Team Dresch song. But easiest doesn’t mean exact, and while DUMP HIM borrow from and build on a legacy, DTWOF traffics in internet-age subjects: climate anxiety, Alison Bechdel (the album shares its title with her long-running comic strip), and self-preservation in the face of disenfranchisement. Earnest and referential, it’s a 23-minute elegy for past selves, a fuzzy, distorted paean to loss and regeneration. DTWOF is built on the same four(ish) chord progressions that have powered many a power-pop anthem, but the lyrics are as sharp as touching a bruise. These are songs to scream with, and their elegant expressions of rage sound like arguments rehearsed for weeks in the shower. “Vilify, refuse to contemplate possible mistakes,” Jac Walsh sings coolly on “Ache,” “but keep making your own, it’s okay.” Terms like trauma, detachment, and embodiment might sound like pop-psych jargon in less capable hands, but the band weaves them seamlessly into depictions of angst and pain. This is heavier than pedestrian heartbreak. Like Gauche, another queer outfit addressing the junctures of the personal and political, DUMP HIM blend contemporary omens with private dramas. “Panic over now-pointless archives/The fragility of our ability to thrive/Doomsday prepping in my bedroom/Breaking down over what we can’t do,” Walsh sings on “Judi Bari Almost Died for Our Sins,” an homage to the Earth First! activist who narrowly survived a 1990 car bombing that was never solved. It’s easy to lose these lyrical pearls in the musical fury, but all the more rewarding to excavate them over multiple listens. Matched with the songs’ furious pace, the references urge a confrontation with history: Who do you remember? Who forms your canon? Though the majority of tracks burst with a similar fervor, closer “Don’t Kiss Me, I’m in Training” is a sweet, refreshing exception. Backed by harmonist Briar Lake, Walsh and Mattie Hamer’s duet sounds like a ’50s ballad at a radical prom. “It isn’t easy to be around people/When people have caused all the hell that you’ve been through,” Hamer sings. The tempo picks up as Walsh and Hamer consider the ways trauma—yes, that word—warps our ability to love the people trying their best to love us back. The individual songs on DTWOF might not sear quite as hot as they do together. But each is a galvanizing thrill, insisting on naming what some would ignore. DUMP HIM offer recognition, a sound and voice for the ways the world shapes and silences those of us on the margins.","Building on the legacy of ’90s riot grrrl and queercore, the Massachusetts punks’ debut album is a galvanizing thrill that insists on naming what some would ignore.

Saw You Up There,Yeesh,by: Nina Corcoran,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d64515e2dcbbc00099496c7/1:1/w_160/yeesh_sawyouupthere.jpg,2019-09-04 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/yeesh-saw-you-up-there/,self-released,"The punk rock trio Yeesh formed at Bennington College in 2010, but they quickly relocated to Chicago and became a favorite in the city’s basement scene. Where other bands recreated  the tried-and-true formula of sloppy yells and melodic riffs, Yeesh brought shape-shifting post-hardcore and a studio-quality live sound. They released a boisterous debut in 2015, swiftly signed to Tiny Engines, and dropped their gnarled sophomore album Confirmation Bias in 2016 before calling it quits — though not without the promise of a posthumous full-length. Two years later, that album has finally arrived. Saw You Up There is a fitting farewell for Yeesh, emphasizing the chaotic blend of post-hardcore, noise rock, and Midwest emo that made them such a beloved local act. Their arrangements are consistently surprising—singer-guitarist Alex Doyle and bassist Greg Obis often swap instrument registers so that the guitar chugs through low chords while the bass tackles the higher range. On “The Crossing,” they play off one another, pausing a wave of noise to break into an impromptu frenzy of math rock. Drummer Peter Reale frequently changes lanes, shifting from a barreling drum pattern to cymbal showers on “Escape Plan” or hitting every sixteenth note on “Shagohad” without crowding the field. On paper, Yeesh may sound like another Dischord-obsessed guitar band, but in execution they channel the personality of satisfyingly aberrant acts Unwound and The Dismemberment Plan. Saw You Up There lets Yeesh flaunt what makes them special: subtly complicated bridges, melodic basslines dipped in grunge, and two-guitar refrains played on one. It’s tempting to award Obis extra credit for Yeesh’s slick balance of levels and EQ. As he did on the band’s early releases, Obis doubles as a mixer, fine-tuning the album’s hairpin turns. (At his day job, he’s an audio engineer at Chicago Mastering Service, which is co-run by Shellac bassist Bob Weston.) He draws out Yeesh’s slyest moments, like the amplified distance between Doyle’s howls and the microphone on “Concave,” or the warp of a guitar string bend on “Collective Sin.” Looking back, it’s strange Yeesh never gained crossover word-of-mouth fame the way PUP or Pile have. They embody the perpetual tragedy of DIY scenes in that way: professional-level bands whose sound is far bigger than the 100-cap spaces they’re stuck playing. Saw You Up There is a steadfast parting gift that asks what Yeesh could’ve been in a few years. On emotional closer “Victory Lap,” an ode to the inevitable changing of the guard in music scenes, Doyle is stuck wondering the same thing: “The race is run, but you won’t get off the track/From the top, boys, let’s do this again.”","The punk trio disbanded in 2016, but their final album serves up the chaotic blend of post-hardcore, noise rock, and Midwest emo that made them beloved.

Norman Fucking Rockwell!,Lana Del Rey,by: Jenn Pelly,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d5ec71f8aeb9e0008ccf296/1:1/w_160/LanaDelRey_NormalFuckingRockwell.jpg,2019-09-03 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lana-del-rey-norman-fucking-rockwell/,PolydorInterscope,"In 2017, Lana Del Rey stopped performing in front of the American flag. Where the singer-songwriter born Elizabeth Grant had once stood onstage before a wavering projection of stars and stripes, charged by a brash apple-pie and blue-jeans patriotism, she now deemed the flag “inappropriate,” preferring a screen of static instead. For a woman whose songs are like miniature syllabi in American Studies—saturated in references to jazz, girl groups, heavy metal, Springsteen; Hemingway and Fitzgerald; money, power, glory; excess and loss; Whitmanian multitudes—it felt like an act of defiance. Norman Fucking Rockwell! is Lana at her deepest, and it arrives at a time when the history of America as we know it is being rewritten. Norman Rockwell himself illustrated idyllic images of American life and its history, spending 50 years with the Americana propagandists at the weekly Saturday Evening Post. His best-known works used a wondrous narrative style to center comfort and simplicity: A pastoral idea, painted and personified, of the American Dream. Lana neatly cuts through that outmoded fantasy with an emphatic fucking hyphen mark of irreverence, or enthusiasm, or both. As Lana revives American myths, with an empty deadpan that would make Lou Reed proud, she also exposes them. Like the Beach Boys, she’s looking for America; like Elvis, she’s discomfiting; like Dylan, she’s a trickster, and we are all potentially fooled. Lana is one of our most complicated stars, a constantly unresolvable puzzle—someone who once called her own work “more of a psychological music endeavor” than pop. But on Norman Fucking Rockwell! that ground-swelling complexity coheres to reveal an indisputable fact: She is the next best American songwriter, period. Trading much of her hardboiled trap-pop and trip-hop malaise for baroque piano ballads and dazzling folk—equal parts Brill Building precision, windswept Laurel Canyon, and 2019 parlances—Lana has begun a dynamic second act in profundity. “I really do believe that words are one of the last forms of magic,” Lana once said, and she exalts each syllable more than ever here. Where her elegant wordplay once made her the Patron Saint of Internet Feelings, she now sounds like a millennial troubadour—singing tales of beloved bartenders and broken men, of fast cars and all of the senses, of freedom and transformation and the wreckage of being alive. The stakes have never been higher. Sometimes Jack Antonoff productions seem to fly because they have been given a trampoline or a children’s bouncing castle. But here, with delicacy and grace, he and Lana find new wings in minimalism, fresh air to breathe, a structural relief. From its cascade of opening piano notes—“God damn, man child” are felicitous first words and the national mood—Norman Fucking Rockwell! achieves levity, tension, and a disarming self-awareness. The languor of Mazzy Star and downbeat skitter of Portishead meet the easy pop-rock breeze of Carole King on 1971’s Tapestry, or the searching resilience of Joni Mitchell on 1972’s For the Roses. It feels like a wall has come down, like Norman Fucking Rockwell! is less to do with camp, and more to do with real life; less to do with scripting the incandescent character of Lana Del Rey and more to do with human complexity; less about aesthetics than being. You can hear the room everywhere, and for all the spectral harmonies and cinematic splendor, it sounds like Lana alone, embracing classic Angeleno isolation. Lana’s pillars are intact before you even hit play: glamour, eccentricity, the absurd, wit. “Your poetry’s bad and you blame the news,” she proclaims on the title track, with a raised eyebrow, and this forthright song grows more savage from there. On a nine-and-a-half-minute lullaby called “Venice Bitch,” she sings the line “fresh out of fucks forever” like a lilting lady of the canyon—in pop tradition, Lana treats California like a conceptual promised land, and here is the smoggy sprawl, stretching into a neo-psychedelic ballad for a new age of acid festival jams. She curses like the sailors on the cover. She employs old-school lingo on the one hand (“Catch ya on the flipside”) and a narcotic slur on the other. And there is no other pop star who could palatably cover Sublime’s “Doin’ Time” and turn its mall-reggae into something so balmy and sweet. Above all, Norman Fucking Rockwell! is the sound of a heart shattering and reforming just to shatter again—of troubled people attempting to navigate the mess of love. Her ache is from empathy: for our crumbling world, for the down and out, for lovers at war with their minds. “If he’s a serial killer/Then what’s the worst that can happen to a girl that’s already hurt?” she sings like a crime novelist on “Happiness Is a Butterfly,” which is to say it is fleeting, setting herself up for a kind of heartbreak so torturous it should be possible to have it surgically removed. Many of these exquisitely narrated songs contain reminders that the trappings of masculinity—breaches in communication, emotional stiltedness, fear of vulnerability—come from the same toxic status quo as systemic patriarchy. On the wrenching “California,” Lana processes as much: “You don’t ever have to be stronger than you really are,” confessing in a tumbling rush that “I shouldn’t have done it but I read it in your letter/You said to a friend that you wished you were doing better.” Each word is on a pedestal; the song exists to amplify them. Her faint country warble wells more with each verse, and it’s devastating. Radiating new dimensions of sensitivity and eloquence, “Mariners Apartment Complex” is a towering peak on Norman Fuckng Rockwell!, a four-minute drama about fateful potential romantic energy. But its turbulent grandeur could speak to the whole Lana Del Rey story. “You took my sadness out of context” and “They mistook my kindness for weakness” are bold refusals to be misunderstood. Referencing Elton John with her pristine declaration “I ain’t no candle in the wind,” a phrase originally inspired by the early deaths of Marilyn Monroe and Janis Joplin, is a patent embrace of life from a woman who once wrote, “I wish I was dead.” When she sings, “I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus/Can’t a girl just do the best she can?” it could be a mic-dropping rebuttal to the ludicrous standards she faced from the start (and the overblown, Internet-engineered Lana outrage that now seems sexist and pathetic). The Hollywood author Eve Babitz once wrote, “Once it is established you are you and everyone else is merely perfect, ordinarily factory-like perfect… you can wreak all the havoc you want.” Lana’s evolution follows suit. “Mariners Apartment Complex” is the sort of ballad that makes teens want to bang on pianos and spill their souls. Lana zooms out to find her zenith. A piano ballad to close down the bar at the end of the world, “The greatest” collapses time, as if Lana is writing the zeitgeist on a typewriter, her lines raving up with fevered reference to rock’n’roll and depression and a proverbial “Kokomo.” Turning the weight of a generation into light, her words crest like the white of a tidal wave—“L.A.’s in flames, it’s a getting hot/Kanye West is blonde and gone/‘Life On Mars’ ain’t just a song/Oh, the livestream’s almost on”—and they feel on arrival to have existed forever. As ever, Lana regards the despondency of existence as a realist, offering a funhouse reflection of the way we live. Call her Doris Doomsday: “The culture is lit/And if this is it/I had a ball,” she resolves with ecstasy and fire, a lightning rod of humor, sadness, and perception; flip jadedness and abiding love. Fanning the flames of a culture ablaze, Lana sings each word like a prayer, finessed with conviction and smoke, chaos and control. “The greatest” is a galaxy-brain moment in the pantheon of pop, and it belongs to a generation fully aware we are at risk of being distracted into oblivion, Juuling towards early death while watching Earth burn. But hope does not elude us yet. And Lana has an anthem for that, too. The title of Norman Fucking Rockwell!’s grand finale is itself a doomy 16-word poem called “Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have - but I have it.” Whatever it was that brought Joni Mitchell and Leonard Cohen together half a century ago, that middle ground is in the solemn mood, hollowed space, and spiritual fortitude of this haunting song. In the muted resignation of her voice you can see her “trust no one” tattoo. She rejects a world of luxury, rejects happiness and sadness both, calls herself “24/7 Sylvia Plath.” And in this slow, glowering procession, she points more directly to her own personal history than ever—“spilling my guts with the Bowery bums” as a volunteer, FaceTiming her father “from beyond the grave”—and soberly she sings: “Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past.” In the vacant spaces between her dark phrases is the unassailable fact that people bury their pasts in order to endure them. Norman Fucking Rockwell! is the apotheosis of Lana Del Rey, songs of curiosity and of consequence, darkness and light, a time capsule of 2019, proof that a person cannot escape herself but she can change. Lana has said hope is dangerous because of her own experience, because in Hollywood she “knows so much.” Hope is dangerous because women are rarely taken seriously, from matters of authenticity to cases of assault. Hope is dangerous because the world fails women, and the bigotry to which American power is currently pitched ensures it. Lana calls herself “a modern-day woman with a weak constitution,” witnessing “a new revolution,” with “monsters still under my bed that I never could fight off.” What makes this final song of survival so cutting is the palpable difficulty in her delivery. When she lands on “a gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off,” it sounds like an oblique image of corrupted power, as upsetting as it ought to be, one to finally drain her of hope. But she still has it. In a piercing falsetto we rarely if ever hear from Lana, perhaps saved for her most pressing truth, she touches the sky: “I have it, I have it, I have it.” And when she does, you believe her.

Threads,Sheryl Crow,by: Alfred Soto,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d65689c1ce1350009a5d8e1/1:1/w_160/SherylCrow_Threads.jpg,2019-09-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sheryl-crow-threads/,The Valory Music Co.,"Sheryl Crow’s first two albums were to ’90s kids what Anita Baker’s Rapture and Paul Simon’s Graceland were to their siblings a decade earlier: minivan mainstays blasted by parents aging out of their misspent youth. Raucous within limits, sardonic without blurring into cruelty, Tuesday Night Music Club (1993) and Sheryl Crow (1996) buried sly experimental touches and an encyclopedia’s worth of classic rock knowledge under a radio-ready sheen thick enough to survive heavy rotation. Sheryl Crow, her first self-produced album, threw together Wurlitzers and Neil Finn, Penny-Owsley pianos and the Attractions’ Pete Thomas—it was all good to Crow, master of ecumenical mom rock. In other words, Sheryl Crow has always gotten by with a little help from her famous friends; she once billed a live album Sheryl Crow and Friends. On her eleventh studio album Threads, she summons another phalanx of luminaries, the lot of them pledging their troth to the SoCal ideal, the ’60s’ most persistent legacy. Inspired and incongruous juxtapositions abound. Stevie Nicks and Maren Morris? Right on. But Bonnie Raitt and Mavis Staples? What about Crow and—get this—St. Vincent? Years with little to prove have muffled Crow’s ear for cool new sounds, hence the preponderance of songs with chords and lyrics generic enough to support, well, Maren Morris and Stevie Nicks. Nonetheless, Threads makes an admirable case for the continued survival of “L.A” as synecdoche and pension plan. The remakes comprise the album’s least compelling section. Thumbs up for choosing relative Boomer obscurities like George Harrison’s “Beware of Darkness” and Bob Dylan’s “Everything Is Broken.” But “Darkness” is little more than an excuse for an extended jam session with Eric Clapton, Brandi Carlisle, and Sting, and Jason Isbell sounds like an aide escorted him to a mic at knifepoint on “Everything Is Broken.” A bigger problem is that Crow is incapable of projecting unease. Accepting romantic entanglements with a quip—that’s the Sheryl we love, the songwriter who flashes the line “you’re my favorite mistake” like an épée. The wry Keith Richards-sung Stones number “The Worst” and Kris Kristofferson’s ramblin’ anthem “Border Lord” are better fits. News alerts on Crow’s smartphone inspire the most atypical collaborations. A gesture of noblesse oblige called “The Story of Everything” depicts a world where “troubled souls” walk into churches and “gun everyone down” while Chuck D and Andra Day huff and puff over Gary Clark Jr.’s axmanship and a clattering rhythm track. The not-funk complements the determination to avoid offense. Better is “Wouldn’t Want to Be Like You,” about a topic she has insight into: moneygrubbers. Apparently St. Vincent in 2019 is Eurythmics’ David Stewart in 1985: superproducer for stars who want a dollop of her coolness and just enough of her discreetly mad studio modernizations. Nevertheless, the track works. St. Vincent and longtime Crow collaborator Jeff Trott trade increasingly scabrous licks over a more convincing Crow rap than Chuck D’s. Besotted with harmony as an end in itself, Crow wheedles animated performances from Vince Gill (“For the Sake of Love”) and James Taylor (“Flying Blind”). If they need material for their own albums, I hope they keep her contact info. Same goes for Joe Walsh, briefly recapturing the careening essence of the James Gang on the on-the-nose “Still the Good Old Days”—why wasn’t he paired with St. Vincent? Threads’ most poignant moment demonstrates what imagination and thousands of dollars of craft can accomplish. A series of renunciations spun as affirmations, “Don’t” presents Crow at her piano, still chewing on the bite-sized ironies of “My Favorite Mistake.” Lucius’ backup vocals shadow her, seizing the title by turns desperately and threateningly. She’s together and alone, as much a truth for insiders as the rest of us.

Kleinmeister,Ruth Garbus,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d65594726e2b40009eed78a/1:1/w_160/garbus_kleinmeister.jpg,2019-09-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ruth-garbus-kleinmeister/,Orindal,"The title of Ruth Garbus’ second record, Kleinmeister, translates to “Little Masters,” a German term for a group of 16th-century artists who produced prints from miniscule, labyrinthine engravings. Viewing their work half a millennium later, one is awed by the patience of such handmade precision. Such is the experience of listening to Garbus’ music, the intricacies of which inspire a similar quiet reverence. Before she was a musician, Garbus applied her attention to furniture design. After dropping out of art school, the younger sister of Tune-Yards’ Merrill joined the vibrant music scene in Brattleboro, Vermont, first playing in the acid-folk collective Feathers and then in the bratty garage-pop trio Happy Birthday, alongside Kyle Thomas (aka King Tuff) and Chris Weisman. Weisman and his brother Kurt, Garbus’ bandmate in Feathers, encouraged the burgeoning songwriter to pursue her own music. Garbus’ first solo release, 2006’s Ruthie’s Requests, was so minimalist and delicate that it felt like it might dissolve into its own fuzz. Four years later, her full-length debut Rendezvous With Rama pushed this insularity towards darker realms. After two pop-leaning EPs, Kleinmeister returns to tranquil, careful compositions that encourage introspection. While Garbus, her guitar, and her idiosyncratic melodies remain the foundation of these nine songs, producers Travis Laplante and Ryan Power adorn opening tracks “Strash” and “Pain” with aqueous textures. Garbus’ crystalline mezzo soprano emerges from the ambience like a headlight on a foggy evening. From these hazy beginnings, Kleinmeister focuses on the careful intertwining of Garbus’ chords and voice, which has expanded with recent opera training. But the heights she reaches stand in stark contrast with the album’s lingering sadness. While Garbus has not explicitly defined Kleinmeister as a record rooted in the climate crisis, she makes frequent references to Earth’s devastation. On the synthy “Strash,” she’s surrounded by a horrifying mix of organic and manufactured detritus: “Plasticated paper and popsicle sticks covered in algae,” “insurmountable heaps, hot and green,” and “visceral viscera wet cardboard steam.” Elsewhere, she sings about “Adirondack littering,” a vision of dead squirrels, pesticides, and needles—pine or hypodermic, it’s unclear—scattered across forest floors. “It doesn’t matter who, we’re all gonna be underground,” Garbus sings on “Pain”; the final word stretches until it disappears, leaving a void of despair. But despite this somber sense of reality, Garbus never submits to doom and gloom. Rather, she calmly reflects on how to acknowledge the planet’s decay without becoming apathetic, and how to balance grief and fear without succumbing to them. “I’m not willing to say that everything’s bad, but I’m sad,” she intones on “Pain.” “Why can’t I remove all this psychic sludge?/Is it okay to feel not okay?” she wonders later on “Grey Sweatshirt.” The tenor sax-driven closer “Fetty Wah” imagines the titular character deceased at the bottom of the Atlantic, toes nibbled away by fish and skin glossed in “bivalve shine.” Kleinmeister accepts this fate with open arms.","With tranquil, careful compositions that encourage introspection, the Vermont musician reflects on climate anxiety without succumbing to doom and gloom.

Venus in Leo,HTRK,by: Joshua Minsoo Kim,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3878e2c0574f00088cc794/1:1/w_160/htrk_venusinleo.jpg,2019-09-03 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/htrk-venus-in-leo/,Ghostly,"In the wake of bassist and founding member Sean Stewart’s passing in 2010, HTRK’s sound changed considerably. The now-duo shed the cold, industrial leanings of their earlier releases for a more overtly sensual approach, something that could soundtrack moments of intimacy or ennui, or both. HTRK explores these same rich themes on Venus in Leo, but the mood is suffocated by melancholy. If the steely electronics of Work (work, work) recalled Antoine D’Agata’s alluringly grotesque photography, Venus in Leo suggests those same photos shot in broad daylight, all obscurity and mystery erased. HTRK are at their most vulnerable here, sounding in desperate need of sating desires before they are paralyzed  by listlessness and disappointment. On opener “Into the Drama,” Jonnine Standish’s vocals are equal parts disaffected and fatigued as she contemplates her obsessive tendencies. “And you dance me to the edge of romance/And you called and I heard/I hang onto every word,” she sings over the nonchalant strumming of an acoustic guitar. Her craving for physical contact is palpable on “Mentions,” a track that details everyday experiences with beauty counter workers (“The touch of your hand to my face/And the way that you’re talkin’ softly/It’s not enough attention for me”) and social media (“Even with another mention/You should’ve made a difference by now""), and how both prove insufficient. Even on the woozy cover of Missy Elliott’s “Hit ’Em Wit Da Hee,” Standish highlights specific lyrics—like the evocative “slurp me swiftly”—to highlight her yearning. More than any other HTRK album, Venus in Leo is filled with anguish. It looms over “New Year’s Day,” where Standish confesses her fears about the upcoming year: “I’ve got a sinking feeling I’m gonna do the wrong thing, eventually.” On “New Year’s Eve,” she recalls a failed teenage romance and broods on how it has come to define her. For Standish, her memories are a remorseless window into the person she is today, and the one she thinks she’s destined to be forever. As such, Venus in Leo is an album for those who feel doomed to a repeating cycle of failed loves and dashed hopes, for when one’s existence can resemble the fading apparitions that adorn the album cover. “I could be free somehow,” Standish sings on “Dying of Jealousy.” That sense of freedom—tangible yet unattainable—makes Venus in Leo as harrowing as it is intimate.","The duo depicts moments of great longing and melancholy on their sensual and gloomy new album.

"In My Lifetime, Vol. 1",JAY-Z,by: Paul A. Thompson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d48921d331bd7000859d724/1:1/w_160/jayz_life.jpg,2019-09-01 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jay-z-in-my-lifetime-vol-1/,Def JamRoc-A-Fella,"One night in the fall or winter of 1996, JAY-Z and The Notorious B.I.G. were relaxing at Daddy’s House, the studio that Bad Boy owned in Midtown. This was almost certainly after the car accident that shattered Biggie’s left leg and forced him to use a wheelchair, and later a cane, as he worked slowly on the sophomore album that he planned to call Life After Death… Til Death Do Us Part. The rappers were friends if not exactly peers: Big’s first LP, Ready to Die, had taken on a mythic quality, where Reasonable Doubt, Jay’s debut from two years later, had been a modest success. That night in the studio, Big played Jay some works in progress: “Hypnotize,” “My Downfall,” a handful of others. Jay was a little envious, looking at somebody who by the age of 25 had mastered virtually every popular style of rap and was slipping tangents about kidnapping plaintiffs’ daughters onto radio singles. He was, it seemed, peerless. Worse: Jay only had one new song of his own to share. It didn’t sound like Reasonable Doubt—it had a little more gloss and bounce—but it was knotty, sarcastic, vivid. It was called “Streets Is Watching,” and it ramped up to a virtuosic, 42-bar final verse full of drug operations that teetered on state lines, looming droughts, visions of God, impaneled grand juries. Big heard it once, and then he played it again, then five more times. Finally, he stopped, and looked at Jay out the corner of his eye. “Is the whole album gonna sound like this?” He wouldn’t live to find out. In the early morning hours of March 9, 1997, Big was shot and killed at the intersection of Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue in Los Angeles. The case, as you probably know, is still unsolved. After Biggie’s death,  Puff Daddy, who had discovered Big and then put himself all in the videos, dancing, set out to pay tribute. He asked Jay to write verses for “I’ll Be Missing You,” a flip of the Police’s “Every Breath You Take” that would also feature Big’s wife, the singer Faith Evans. Jay declined. Instead, he drove down to Virginia Beach and channelled his grief into a song called “The City Is Mine,” which was produced by Teddy Riley, featured Blackstreet (plus saxophone by a then-unknown, pre-Neptunes Chad Hugo), and was built around a sample of Glenn Frey’s “You Belong to the City,” which sounds like an extremely sensual elevator ride. “What’s the deal, playboy?” he asks at the song’s beginning. “Just rest your soul.” “The City Is Mine” is In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 distilled into a four-minute sample: wrought with grief and buoyed by extraordinary technical skill, packaged in (and maybe marred by) a fixation on the most commercial sounds of the moment. It captures Jay doing things he’d try more audaciously in the future: “I’m the focal point like Biggie in his prime/On the low though (shh), the city is mine” is the polite precursor to what he’d do four years later on The Blueprint: “And if I ain’t better than Big, I’m the closest one.” It’s the sound of a remarkable talent attempting the leap into superstardom and fucking up the landing just a little bit. Big’s death had left a vacuum in rap; that Jay was in a position to dream of filling it was a minor miracle. After brokering a small deal to promote a single and then a slightly bigger one to distribute Reasonable Doubt, his label, Roc-A-Fella records, was able to leverage that album (along with Jay’s work as a ghostwriter on Foxy Brown’s Ill Na Na) into an unusually favorable arrangement with Def Jam. Jay’s appearance on Life After Death helped signal this next, presumably more lucrative era for the Roc. The song he was on, “I Love the Dough,” is a perfect little triumph, all sheen and sneer. Big washes Jay, but that’s beside the point. He was welcome in the real-cash Monopoly game. The first way to understand Vol. 1 is as Jay’s Bad Boy album. Despite jilting Puff for “Missing You,” Jay recruited that label’s producers to handle about half of the album’s beats, and the ones they didn’t touch mostly replicate Bad Boy’s signature shine. At times, this works beautifully: the way the O’Jays are flipped into a somber suite for confession on the jarring closer “You Must Love Me,” or the way Rene & Angela, who were the basis for “I Love the Dough,” morph into something sinister for “Imaginary Players.” But, as is characteristic of every Bad Boy release (even that skit on Ready to Die), there are lapses where the album seems to have been thrown together haphazardly. For example, it’s impossible to reconcile the fact that the unforgivably desperate “I Know What Girls Like” is made to flow right into “Player.” In the latter, you have one of the slickest, most irresistibly arrogant songs in Jay’s catalog, complete with that absurdly condescending final monologue. But you spend half of that track trying to scrub your brain of clumsy bullshit from the song before, like: “I never seen a face like yours before/And I’ve been around some cute whores before.” Fortunately, Jay has always had a gift for giving emotional depth to his albums without cheating or showing his hand too early. The violence that’s introduced on “Rhyme No More” (“Shoot up the whole block, then the iron I toss”) and complicated on “Streets Is Watching” (“For the first time in my life, I was getting money, but it was like my conscience was eating me”) is given a second, more harrowing layer of guilt on “You Must Love Me.” That song opens with a verse to Jay’s mother, who was struggling with her own addictions just as Jay began hustling: “All you did was motivate me: ‘Don’t let ’em hold you back!’/What’d I do?/Turned around, and I sold you crack.” The next verse recounts the time that Jay, at just 12 years old, shot his brother in an effort to retrieve some stolen jewelry. His brother survived, then asked to see Jay in the hospital the following day. You must love me, he raps. The album’s masterpiece, though, is “Where I’m From.” The scaffolding is an Yvonne Fair sample that sounds like a steel city grinding its inhabitants into dust. Jay raps vividly about the Marcy Houses, describing himself and his neighbors as “foul” all while taunting outsiders: Prodigy, the Mobb Deep MC who feuded with Jay for years, took the line about Marcy being where “you and your mans hung in every verse in your rhyme” as a direct shot. It’s also the most acrobatic rapping Jay had done to this point in his career: There are times when he’s deep in the beat’s pocket, and others when he’s rapping as if the beat is a mere suggestion. In the middle of the second verse, there’s an absolutely breathtaking passage: I'm a block away from hell, not enough shots away from stray shells
An ounce away from a triple-beam, still using a hand-held weight scale
You're laughing—you know the place well
Where the liquor stores and the base dwell This sort of free, cascading run, where every line is extraordinarily technical but sounds as if it was ripped from casual conversation, is something he’d continue to perfect over the next several years but would mostly abandon by The Blueprint, opting instead for digestible midtempos. With hindsight, Vol. 1 is more gripping as a show of raw skill than it is as an act of myth-making: The way he floats over the beat on “A Million & One Questions” and burrows into it on its twin song, “Rhyme No More,” or that extended, staccato climax to “Streets Is Watching,” is the element of his post-9/11 catalog that’s most sorely missed. The softer songs are tougher to grapple with. “Lucky Me” has its own cult following (Lil Wayne has its title tattooed on his neck and a verse from it tattooed on his leg) but is stiff and overproduced; its complaints about fame are more exhausting than insightful. And then, of course, there’s “(Always Be My) Sunshine.” “Sunshine” shares a Kraftwerk sample with a Whodini song; it’s the sort of thing that can be rehabilitated with time, but would have seemed painfully out of date in the moment. And then there’s its video, where dancers run through fierce choreography in what looks like the stomach of a Rubik’s cube while Jay mugs in a lime-green suit. It’s awful. “Sunshine” has mostly been relegated to the footnotes in Jay’s career—it wasn’t a big enough success or spectacular enough a failure to seem, today, like a turning point—and that’s fortunate, given how close it flew to an extremely fluorescent sun. Eight years before Vol. 1 came out, Jay-Z was living in London. His mentor, a fellow Marcy Houses native who went by Jaz and who, for a time, had a reputation as one of the best unsigned rappers in Brooklyn, had been advanced nearly a half-million dollars by the record label EMI. He brought Jay across the Atlantic, to the flat in Notting Hill, to soak up whatever he could while the album got made. At first, the label guys seemed nice enough. Jaz’s finished records were sounding close enough in spirit to their demo versions. But at some point, EMI insisted Jaz record a gimmicky, ukelele-driven song called “Hawaiian Sophie.” It was an utter disaster. The video was full of hula dancers gyrating in front of green screens and palm trees painted on large tarps that were hoisted clumsily toward a soundstage “sky.” Imagine the Lost pilot staged by kids at a summer camp. Jay, who appears in the video behind giant sunglasses, draped in a lei, would later say it was “nearly career suicide.” “Hawaiian Sophie” was supposed to turn Jaz into a star. But when it inevitably bricked, the label stopped returning his phone calls. The album dropped in May 1989 as little more than a tax write-off. That’s when executives at EMI finally picked up the phone—to call Jay, wondering if he was interested in a record deal of his own. This turned Jay’s stomach. He buried whatever rap dreams he had, skulked back to the States, and moved his crack trade from East Trenton, New Jersey down to Maryland. This was a good idea until it wasn’t: There were shootouts in nightclubs and rumors of sweeping police investigations. When Jay returned to music, he was wary of and wearied by the EMI experience. The “Sophie” debacle seemed to shape his approach to the industry for the years to come: It confirmed his distrust of record companies; it urged him to hone the double- and triple-time skills he’d been developing, then shed them for something more communicative. The impeccably dressed kingpin from the Reasonable Doubt cover could never be seen in Bermuda shorts. He even references “Sophie” on the opening song of Vol. 1—both the fact that it exists, and the fact that it made him disappear. And yet it’s impossible to see the “Sunshine” video without thinking, for a second, about all those plastic palm trees. There’s this incredible trick that Big pulls at the beginning of Life After Death. It opens with a narrative song called “Somebody’s Gotta Die”; the broad strokes are that one of Big’s old friends knocks on his door in the middle of the night with blood on his shoes, saying that their mutual friend had been shot. A revenge plot whirs to life—and ends with a tragic mistake. Straightforward. But in the first verse, as he’s talking himself into a frenzy, Big shatters the implied divide between these crime tales and real life: “‘Cause I’m a criminal,” he raps, Way before the rap shit
Bust a gat, shit—Puff won’t even know what happened On an album that is primarily about the experience of being a rap star, Big is staring into the camera and smirking, as if to say: For all you know, I could be in the streets right now. The times when Big shows you the seams of this stardom add to the effect—the barbs at New York rappers on “Kick in the Door,” the tongue-in-cheek ode to the other coast on “Going Back to Cali.” By comparison, Vol. 1 labors to achieve the same feeling. Its plays for radio feel deliberate, as if they were pulled from a totally different set of sessions than the “Where I’m From”s and the “Streets Is Watching”s. Big blurred those lines between pop and pure instinct (“Playa Hater”) or reveled in just how arbitrary they were (he has those threats to kidnap daughters on “Hypnotize,” he raps about phone taps on “Mo Money Mo Problems”); the only time Jay comes close to this fourth wall-fracturing magic is on “Friend Or Foe ’98,” when he’s about to kill a rival hustler in a “two-hotel town,” and leaves him with a message to send Big in heaven. The songs on Vol. 1 are almost uniformly excellent. But the greater the commercial and mythic stakes Jay tried to attach to the set as a whole, the more the vacuum threatened to swallow them all at once.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

Iconology EP,Missy Elliott,by: Stephen Kearse,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d63e980ff91290008241279/1:1/w_160/missy_iconology.jpeg,2019-08-31 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/missy-elliott-iconology-ep/,AtlanticGoldmind,"In the decade-plus since her last album, Missy Elliott has been trapped in a cycle of returns and retreats. Albums have been teased, then coming soon, then renamed, and later scrapped. Singles have been released and choreographed but then left at sea, never followed-up or built upon. Though Missy has remained an active producer, songwriter, and guest artist, it’s hard not to think of those efforts as busywork. When she rapped, “Thought I fell off, I ain’t quite finished,” on 2012’s single “9th Inning,” it felt like a Freudian slip more than a threat. Released the weekend before her receipt of the VMAs’ Michael Jackson Video Vanguard award, Iconology confirms what’s long been implied by these recurring starts and stops: Missy Elliott is no longer the future. There is nothing rapped or sung on this EP that is not beholden to Missy’s past. “Throw It Back” is a tepid nostalgia trip that does little to hide its lack of inspiration. Retracing her steps, Missy recycles tired rhyme schemes and stuffs her verses with dry nods to her hits. Her allusions to her glory days are so artless and undercooked that they could be Genius annotations: “Missy still got ’em losing control/And every night is still ladies’ night.” The production, courtesy of Timbaland, Missy, and Atlanta producers Wili Hendrix and Michael Aristotle, is a toss-up. The drum programming on “Throw It Back” and “Cool Off” is shifty and colorful, but painfully quantized. As Missy raps in staccato lockstep with the beats, the lack of bounce becomes grating. The doo-wop sway of “Why I Still Love You” fits Missy’s vocals well, but it’s damning that the a capella sounds better than the full song. The sole outlier, “DripDemeanor,” is groovy and indulgent; at one point background coos bleed into a guitar and harmonica melody that’s peppered with what sounds like hiccups. Paired with Sum1’s sultry crooning, the result is weird and charming and sensuous—but then Missy starts rapping. There’s nothing insightful or fun about Missy looking back rather than ahead, especially when she’s already released two compilation records during her hiatus. The focus on iconography is frustrating in its neglect of Missy’s extensive influence throughout the past decade (Missy’s genes can be found in Tierra Whack, Tyler, the Creator, Azealia Banks, M.I.A., FKA twigs, J. Cole, among many others) and her lauded accomplishments (earlier this year she was the first woman rapper inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the third rapper, period). Missy invited listeners to view her body on her terms; she condensed emotions into the perfect onomatopoeia; she befriended and supported the artists around her. Iconology could have tapped into all these dimensions. Instead, it settles for the safe and familiar. Throw it back.","The pop music icon spends too much time looking back on a seemingly rushed, mostly forgettable collection of tracks.

LOVE AND AFFECTION FOR STUPID LITTLE BITCHES,Black Dresses,by: Colin Joyce,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d63f933ff9129000824127c/1:1/w_160/blackdresses_loveandaffection.jpg,2019-08-31 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/black-dresses-love-and-affection-for-stupid-little-bitches/,self-released,"Like many noise musicians, Black Dresses have a lot to say about pain. Over the last couple of years, the Canadian duo of Devi McCallion and Ada Rook has screamed, rapped, and moaned about the lasting impact of trauma and the indescribable psychic effects of existing in a world that wants you dead. The music that has accompanied those feelings has been appropriately twisted. Their 2018 debut, WASTEISOLATION, felt like pop radio being pulled into a black hole, stretching and destroying the connective tissue that held together the memorable melodies. Across their many solo efforts and side projects, they’ve often worked with fellow pop mutators like Katie Dey and  100 Gecs’ Laura Les, which might give you an idea of the overwhelming sort of music you’re in for with their songs as a duo. And if it doesn’t, they’ve recently been tweeting about the parallels between Kesha and early Nine Inch Nails, seemingly conscious that their music falls somewhere in the murky Venn diagram between those two wildly different acts. Since WASTEISOLATION, they’ve released a second full-length album, THANK YOU, as well as a pair of EPs and a smattering of one-offs and side projects. Their music has adopted a variety of tones and moods, but it’s been almost universally heavy, a pool of emotional sludge that they can’t help but coming back to swim in. This prolific run has been exciting to follow for those who appreciates work that interrogates, like, the weightiness of existence, but it’s easy to see how such work might take a toll on its creators. They’ve said recently that they don’t even like to think about the events that inspired their earliest songs. “It’s not useful for me to stew on [the topics that informed earlier records],” they wrote on Twitter earlier this month. “So we moved on.” That’s the headspace in which they released their third album in two years, LOVE AND AFFECTION FOR STUPID LITTLE BITCHES. The title alone hints at how different their disposition is this time around. Many of the songs are about enduring pain, but they’re also about finding camaraderie and friendship through it all—a reminder that “compassion” comes from the Latin words for “suffering” and “together.” The record opens with a song called “STATIC” that starts, appropriately, with wheezing electronics and a scream shredded enough to induce sympathy pain, but it’s a bit of a fake-out. As McCallion and Rook trade verses, it’s clear that there’s something more complicated going on. The lines that peek through the maelstrom feel almost hopeful. In the chorus, they offer something of a thesis statement for the record: “So fucked up but honestly/I’ve never felt more alive.” The record is still incredibly heavy. “HERTZ” is a grinding track about enduring a life of physical and psychic pain. On “CARTOON NETWORK,” they wish their real lives were just a TV show so they could just watch the troubling narratives unfold and tweet about them. “DROOL” features a sternum-snapping industrial breakdown that’d make Pharmakon proud. On “MY HEART BEATS OUT OF TIME,” Rook describes her body as a “rotting shell” and the world as a “fucked-up hell.” But the spirit of the record is triumphant; the crushing sounds are surrounded by more colorful, uplifting moments. They haven’t given up on the gloom or the fuzz, but there’s this feeling that even if the clouds never pass, peace, or something like it, is possible. McCallion puts it nicely on “MUSIC,” a meditation on how their art won’t necessarily deliver them from evil. “The pain’s still loose in my head,” she sings. “But that’s ok.”","Pop and noise make for strangely suited bedfellows on an album, by turns colorful and crushing, steeped in physical and psychic pain.

In the Spirit World Now,Ceremony,by: Noah Yoo,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d655761c7e6ee0009d820e5/1:1/w_160/ceremony_inthespiritworld.jpg,2019-08-31 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ceremony-in-the-spirit-world-now/,Relapse,"As each new album takes them further from their powerviolence days, former hardcore outfit Ceremony recognize the pitfalls of genre pivots. On 2012’s Zoo, they toyed with garage rock; on 2015’s The L-Shaped Man, they indulged explicit Joy Division hero worship. They are also sick of hearing about how they don’t sound punk anymore and would appreciate if you could please shut up about it. (“Not reflecting on the evolution of the band is what keeps us motivated,” guitarist Anthony Anzaldo said in a press release.) If The L-Shaped Man was Ceremony‘s first attempt to channel not only the spirit, but also the sound of their idols—the band takes their name from one of Ian Curtis’ final songs—then In the Spirit World Now is their first foray into New Order territory. The guitars remain, but new wave synthesizers take center stage. Mileage will vary depending on your affinity for post-punk and motorik-esque beats, but after some nebulous false starts, the group has finally found space to begin carving their own lane in the crowded field of ’80s-indebted groups. Ceremony are hell-bent on not making the same record twice, and when they make good on that promise, it’s easy to forget that they were once a hardcore band. Lead single “Turn Away the Bad Thing,” with its gleaming dream-pop interlude, is a cathartic highlight with a mysterious turn from an uncredited female guest vocalist. In a different vein, “Presaging the End” finds Anzaldo flexing his adoration of Prince with a crispy funk line that would have been unfathomable four years ago. In the Spirit World Now would benefit from more of these experiments, especially in its amorphous second half. Instead, the album is defined mostly by squiggly synthesizers. At best, they add much-needed texture, serving as a backbone for some of the catchier songs. At worst—as on the title track—they sit so high in the mix that they're a distraction. More than half of the songs here were written with synth as a lead instrument, but those arrangements don’t always translate to memorable music, and the electronics sometimes feel like an afterthought. Nevertheless, frontman Ross Farrar sounds far more exciting behind the mic than he did on The L-Shaped Man. The Curtis imitation is gone; over the course of 32 minutes, Farrar delivers the sort of shouty double-tracking you might expect from Parquet Courts, and even sneers like Alex Turner. While his laconic verses about free will and desire can seem like free association, they’re still his most fun since fan favorite Rohnert Park. For that, he’s indebted to young alt-rock guru Will Yip, who handled production, helped to guide Farrar’s voice, and contributed some melody ideas. Ironically, Farrar’s most captivating words aren’t sung, but rather spoken by the American poet Brooks Haxton, who oversaw the completion of Farrar’s poetry MFA at Syracuse University last year. Afterwards, Farrar asked his mentor to lend him his voice. Three dry readings of stanzas from Farrar’s poem “California Jungle Dream States End” paint a more vivid image than most of his lyrics, which can feel clipped and sometimes lose their impact as the rest of his band chug along listlessly. “Love saying, without you even less, as I felt my will jettisoned, a thing out in the street,” Hoxton intones near the end of the record. For the first time in some time, Ceremony are mingling their shifting influences in a way that rarely feels like an attempt to rebottle the magic of their forebears. But the fact remains that most of what happens on In the Spirit World Now has been done before. Anyone can play some chromatic riffs or make synths squawk. This band knows how to break new ground, yet they sound as though they’re trying to summon songs that will miraculously slot in with their old material. It’s a balancing act that’s holding them back.

May the Lord Watch,Little Brother,by: Marcus J. Moore,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d643a8a2dcbbc00099496bd/1:1/w_160/maythelordwatch.png,2019-08-30 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/little-brother-may-the-lord-watch/,NationFor Members OnlyEMPIRE,"The prospect of a Little Brother reunion seemed so unlikely that both Day One fans and this guy expressed excitement and disbelief when it happened. For the past decade, the North Carolina trio—consisting of producer 9th Wonder and rappers Phonte and Big Pooh—were in different places, creatively and personally. They arrived with fanfare in 2003 via Okayplayer’s message boards and a big cosign from the site’s founder ?uestlove. This wasn’t Southern rap the way we were used to hearing it: Between 9th’s airy, soul-sampling beats and the rappers’ complex flows, Little Brother drew comparisons to East Coast stalwarts like De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, and EPMD. Two years after the critically lauded debut The Listening, Little Brother signed to Atlantic Records and released its second—and maybe its best—studio album, The Minstrel Show, a conceptual LP that spoofed the WB Television Network and the cartoonish black images it promoted. Then the seams started showing: Little Brother’s deal with Atlantic fell apart, and 9th Wonder—who was in and out of the crew due to his rising fame—left the group. Little Brother’s subsequent albums, 2007’s Getback and 2010’s LeftBack, simply didn’t have the same verve. Phonte and Pooh had been rapping together since college; now they were grown men with separate interests. They were limping to the finish line and needed a break from each other. So there was genuine shock this past May when Phonte announced on Instagram that he and Big Pooh had reunited Little Brother and that new music was on the way. In interviews, Phonte had been cool on the notion of the group getting back together. “I understand people will always ask for it,” he told Billboard in March 2018. “Personally, it’s not something that I have interest in doing, because I enjoy the peace that’s in my life right now.” His tone changed by September, when he was asked to perform a last-minute set at the annual Art of Cool Festival in Durham. He turned the gig into a Little Brother reunion show, and following it, Phonte and Big Pooh agreed to record a new LB album. Phonte and Big Pooh sound rejuvenated, and while 9th Wonder isn’t on this record (or part of the group), the beats compiled by Khrysis, Nottz, Zo!, Black Milk, and Devin Morrison have a sophisticated bounce, making this feel like an old Little Brother album without dwelling too much in the past. Thematically, May the Lord Watch picks up where The Minstrel Show left off: Radio host Peter Rosenberg shows up as president of the make-believe UBN Network to announce the death of Percy Miracles (Phonte’s singing alter-ego on LB records), and ?uestlove appears on “Inside the Producer’s Studio” as a fictional James Lipton to interview Roy Lee (Phonte’s beat-making alter-ego who can’t really make beats). On “Niggas Hollering,” sports commentator Jemele Hill debates the all-time greatness of Michael Jordan in a fake First Take. In this way, May the Lord Watch feels like deluxe fan service for the 30 and 40-somethings who remember LB’s early projects. Like Tribe’s 2016 comeback LP, We got it from Here... Thank You 4 Your service, May the Lord Watch captures Phonte and Pooh where they are now without sacrificing what made them popular. Beneath the light moments, they reflect on the dark times that brought them here. On “Right on Time,” Big Pooh raps: “Took some odd jobs to put salmon on the plate, contemplating moving dope just to get my pockets straight … doing Uber pickups, they don’t recognize the face.” Meanwhile, Phonte acknowledges his struggles to stay above water as an indie artist: “Yeah I got success and the stress to match, ’cause peace of mind rarely comes with a check attached.” “Sittin Alone” delves into life post-30, when Netflix is more fun than clubhopping, and your scented candles are more exciting than overpriced VIP lounge liquor. There’s no way to know if Little Brother is back back, or if May the Lord Watch was the group’s way of bringing this chapter to a rightful close. But if it’s truly the end, Phonte and Big Pooh have gone out on a high note. May the Lord Watch is the result of clear-eyed reflection, of getting older and wiser and realizing that petty differences shouldn’t dissolve a true brotherhood.","The North Carolina rap group (minus producer 9th Wonder) reunite for a warm, breezy LP that recalls the best of their original work.

Field Whispers (Into the Crystal Palace),Fire-Toolz,by: Miles Bowe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d488fe3749a660008744525/1:1/w_160/firetoolz_crystalpalace.jpg,2019-08-30 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fire-toolz-field-whispers-into-the-crystal-palace/,Orange Milk,"Angel Marcloid is no stranger to chaos: Her labels Swamp Circle and Rainbow Bridge brim with glitchy noise and scrambled vaporwave. But the music the Chicago multi-instrumentalist makes as Fire-Toolz has always been too meticulous to simply coast on entertaining randomness. Slapping MIDI basslines, screamed metal vocals, video-game synths, riffing guitars, and proggy drum fills might all collide in any given song, but Marcloid’s instrumentally and mathematically virtuosic constructions never feel simply thrown together. The highwire balancing act of all these wildly moving parts has always been Fire-Toolz’s calling card, and on the brilliant new Field Whispers (Into the Crystal Palace) it reaches a whole new level of thrilling intensity. Marcloid’s compositional approach has often felt clearer when she narrows her stylistic parameters slightly. Projects like the sample-based Mindspring Memories or the jazz-fusion Nonlocal Forecast, beautifully captured on Bubble Universe! for Hausu Mountain earlier this year, show how well Marcloid can hone in on a specific musical idea and reveal an entire world. On the other hand, Fire-Toolz has always been an opportunity for Marcloid to spin every plate in her cupboard at once. Until now, the alias has felt especially influenced by metal, due to the perfectly honed black-metal hiss she unleashes over many tracks. Here she drastically reins those vocals in, but by pulling back on the most striking element of Fire-Toolz, she lifts everything else in her arsenal. It makes Field Whispers feel like an evolution of the project as a whole. Field Whispers opens with what might be the best vocal song Marcloid has ever written. Despite its long, unwieldy name, “mailto:spasm@swamp.god?subject=Mind-BodyParallels” distills Fire-Toolz’s sonic obsessions into a strange approximation of pop music. Its web of bouncing drum-machine beats and bright keyboard melodies sparkles alongside throat-shredding screams. Even through this web of smooth guitar lines and funky synths, Marcloid’s bile-dripping roar locks right in without ever sounding out of place, charting a path from easy listening Muzak to a cathartic finale that surges as fiercely as Agalloch. “Mailto:” is followed by its opposite, the sprawling seven-minute sound collage “Clear Light,” but each of that track’s carefully sculpted left turns, from harsh noise to ambient to surging synths and a twisting guitar solo, shows that Marcloid’s experimental flourishes are as carefully considered and exciting as her pop songs. It sounds like Oneohtrix Point Never’s last three albums played simultaneously. Prior to the album’s release, the two songs were combined into a single nine-minute single, which seems unwieldy until you realize it makes complete sense. Nothing has captured this nearly indescribable project better than jumping on these two sonic roller-coasters back to back. Those songs recalibrate Fire-Toolz’s framework, creating a playing field where Field Whispers’ leaps into pop and dives into abstraction are equally rewarding. The hallucinatory sound design of “The Warm-Body (A Blessing & Removal)” unpredictably shifts into a tender melodic coda; “Hologram of a Composite” feels like a momentary return to Nonlocal Forecast’s proggy, euphoric Bubble Universe!; and “✓ BEiNG” begins with birdsong and forest ambience before igniting with stadium-sized drums, a soaring guitar solo, and another surprising swoop of the ground-razing vocals that opened “mailto.” It’s a welcome return to Marcloid’s voice, which gets a third and final showcase on the ecstatic closer, “Smiling at Sunbears Grooming in Sunbeams” (along with Marcloid’s late cat, Breakfast, to whom the album is dedicated). It all makes Field Whispers Marcloid’s strongest statement under any moniker, a reaffirmation of her work as a wild playground where anything can happen—and usually does.","Balancing vaporwave’s glossy kitsch with throat-shredding metal vocals and labyrinthine sound collage, Angel Marcloid’s music is a perfect fusion of pop and pure abstraction.

Master,Mariah the Scientist,by: Cat Zhang,Executive Editorial Assistant,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d643c582dcbbc00099496c1/1:1/w_160/Album%20Artwork.jpeg,2019-08-30 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mariah-the-scientist-master/,RCA,"Mariah the Scientist’s boyfriend was tripping on drugs at 7 a.m. when she realized she loved him, maybe. On her major-label debut, Master, the Atlanta R&B singer staggers away from something equally as reckless, struggling not to be re-hypnotized by nostalgia. “The idea of love and who I was with—they’ve become my master of some sort,” she explained, “when I should have just been myself.” As she writhes against the vice-grip of a toxic relationship, she paints an image of modern romance that’s impressively refined, vivid, and unblinkingly honest. The album is a powerful presentation of her attempt to reclaim control over herself. Mariah may only be 21, but Master is imbued with the wearied maturity of someone much older: a veteran of love dragged five miles past hell and back, robbed of everything but her own dignity and defiance. While most of the album renders her misery vibrantly, it falters slightly at the start: In “Note to Self,” Mariah tediously spells out her worst tendency: “S-E-L-F-D-E-S-T-R-U-C-T-I-V-E, I need help,” she sings flatly, as if reciting self-help mantras in her bedroom. But as the album progresses, it plunges forcefully into the messiness of desire. The shards of her past love assemble, offering glints of clarity. “You left me for a bitch in a city full of palm trees,” she announces on “Note to You,” “I never knew that it would haunt me.” Veering from sneering to sad, indignant to wistful, as if negotiating emotions in real-time, Mariah is unflinching about the after-effects of letting go. In the tortured “Thanks 4 Nothing,” she reveals that she left her boyfriend on her birthday, and yet she stayed up, hurting. “Why you never call me?” she cries out on more than one song. Like SZA before her, Mariah sings in a colloquial style that hovers somewhere in between plain speech and melody, her gravelly voice foregrounded over sparse instrumentals. With the exception of “Hotel,” a gorgeous vocoder interlude, the strongest tracks are backed only by guitar and light drums. This stark arrangement heightens the urgency of her deeply personal accounts: On “Beetlejuice,” a slick, withering remembrance of her lover’s deception, Mariah recalls how she was lied to, guilted into forgiveness, then seduced to Frank Ocean’s Blonde. It’s a scathing drag of a “sensitive” man who is only sensitive to the needs of himself. But it also implicates Mariah as a woman who’s been played before: Master grapples with its heroine’s self-delusion and insecurity as much as the misconduct of the person who wronged her. It’s haunted by the persistent reminder that she should have known. This indictment, the constant seesawing between self-reprobation and longing, weaves much-needed complexity into a story of heartbreak that could easily feel one-dimensional. Combined with the unvarnished quality of her voice, the cumulative effect is mesmerizing.","The major-label debut from the Atlanta R&B singer offers a layered, mesmerizing portrait of modern romance.

nikolai reptile,Shadowax,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d6554f726e2b40009eed787/1:1/w_160/shadowax_nikolai.jpg,2019-08-30 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shadowax-nikolai-reptile/,Trip,"If the shady Russian spies from “Stranger Things”’ telekinetic netherworld made electronic pop, it might sound a little like nikolai reptile, Shadowax’s debut EP for Nina Kraviz’s Trip: mysterious, disorienting, and faintly ridiculous. This is a record that dares you to understand it, safe in the knowledge you will never quite get the measure of its shifting sands. For some, initial confusion may be shaded by the Russian-language vocals, the work of Mirabella Karyanova, whose recordings as Ishome mix ambience, techno, and IDM. But there is something in nikolai reptile’s wonderful whirl of disorientation that goes beyond language into the very timbre of the voice. The chorus of the brilliantly topsy-turvy title track uses the call and response between a somber, apparently male voice and a clipped female tone as its understated but powerfully sticky hook. “What About Me” wrings maximum discomfort out of a ghostly whistle and stuttering vocal effect; “Ochen” is an exercise in the rhythmic potential of the larynx, with vocal samples clipped, layered, and shifted until they spray like hits from a drum. This vocal manipulation is reminiscent of Shadowax’s previous excursion on Trip, “I Want to Be a Stewardess,” a sulphurous, coiled highlight of the 2018 compilation Don’t Mess With Cupid, ’Cause Cupid Ain’t Stupid. But where that track built to a frenzy of boiling breakbeats, the first three songs on nikolai reptile are marked by an economy that is comparable to the best minimal techno—yet here that precision is compressed into four-minute pop songs rather than stretched paper-thin over k-hole epics. These three tracks consist of little more than vocals, bass, and drum machine, each element there because it has to be, rather than for unnecessary effect. Such restraint allows the listener to revel in the brilliance of the individual ingredients Karyanova has assembled: the undulating bass tone on “nikolai reptile” that swarms like a cloud of hungry locusts; the shuffling drum pattern and percussive bass echo on “What About Me”; the gulping kick drum on “Ochen.” Each creates its own sublime, if unlikely, hook; each is just the slightest bit silly, like the best pop music should be. Just as you think you’re getting to grips with nikolai reptile, though, it changes gear abruptly. Closing track “Mortal Talking” sounds like a mischievous clone of 1990s acid trance: all galloping kick drums, clattering snare rushes, sinus-clearing hi-hats, and spiraling TB-303 lines. Dusted with an inkling of Karyanova’s vocal trickery and rhythmic invention, it’s sufficient to suggest the song belongs on the EP even without a clean connection with the other tracks. Such a radical left turn may come at the expense of the EP’s overall listenability—my fingers tend to hover over the skip button as “Mortal Talking” comes into view—but after “I Want to Be a Stewardess” and 2018’s A & B EP, where Karyanova covered old-school Russian hip-hop in a skeletal tech style, it only enhances the producer’s burgeoning reputation as a mastermind of beautifully erratic moves. Much like “Stranger Things” itself, nikolai reptile is a brew of unlikely individual ingredients, but its heart bleeds pure pop.","Mirabella Karyanova’s debut EP for Nina Kraviz’s Trip label pairs playful Russian-language vocal manipulation with woozy electronic pop modeled after minimal techno’s trippy specifications.

Chasing Summer,SiR,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d66d5acff912900082415f5/1:1/w_160/CHASING%20SUMMER%20album.jpg,2019-08-29 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sir-chasing-summer/,Top DawgRCA,"SiR’s debut album began with a computerized female voice who answered to “K” telling the singer his plane was ready. “K” guided the album, chirping at SiR between creamy ballads and serving as a sort of tour guide and road map. You can hear faint traces of this narrative device on SiR’s latest album, Chasing Summer, which is book-ended by a pilot’s voiceover and the faint sputter of plane engines. It’s an odd framing for an album that never leaves home: The Inglewood singer drifts around the city with his hair down, flirting with girls who grew up on Queen Street. Even metaphorically, there’s not a lot of movement: SiR’s songs tend to find one mood and simmer in it. SiR makes hazy, gliding neo-soul songs about love. He has been married for a decade, most interviews with him are quick to point out, and therefore much of his music is assumed to be autobiographical. His last album swerved towards ego and pettiness in a way that felt out of place and unconvincing. “All her little friends can’t stand me/Because they know I would trade her love for a Grammy,” he spat, before slipping back into his familiar jazzy, tender singsong. On Chasing Summer, SiR stops making excuses and plunges into cruelty. “Did I stutter when I told her ass/ None of this was ever meant to last?” he spits over surging synthesizers. On the ironically titled “That’s Why I Love You,” he gets even more direct: “I never wondered what this could be/I just fuck you and leave.” SiR has stressed that much of this album is fictional; the second track is titled “John Redcorn,” supposedly from the perspective of the cartoon King of the Hill character. “Sometimes, I’m not telling my exact truth because I like to keep some of my privacy,” he told DJ Booth earlier this month. Safely shrouded in make-believe, he’s free to lash out. The effect is an album that bristles with paranoia. SiR creates conditions in which actual relationships are impossible: He’s always in the wrong place at the wrong time; he replays conversations that never happened; he waits for calls he won’t take. “We both know this house could never be a home,” he sings. “But ain’t you sick of spending all your nights alone?” The kindest words in the record are about weed—“Isn’t she the best?” he crows about a sativa hybrid. But at 14 songs, the album feels bloated. Its swirl of features are hit or miss. Smino and Kendrick Lamar inject life into the spaces SiR hollows out. Zacari, who should be a natural complement, arrives on the soulless “Mood” for the generic hook: “I ain’t in the mood/If I ain’t in my bag/Do anything for the cash.” Lil Wayne’s presence seems more like a signifier of SiR’s stardom than an addition to the music; “What’s a girl without a booty?” he yawns through Auto-Tune.  SiR’s at his best when he’s swimming through his loneliness. The obvious comparison point for Chasing Summer is SZA’s CTRL: another Kendrick Lamar-featuring RCA and TDE collaboration, another gauzy and sad love record with an unfortunate line about pussy (“Pussy tastes like diamonds”, SiR croons, which is only marginally less awful than CTRL’s “Pussy can be so facetious.”) The records are stylistically similar, but for SZA, deconstructing romance felt like a revolution. With SiR, it’s a way to tread in place.","The TDE soul singer takes a darker turn on his second record, a sad and gauzy R&B collection full of bitterness and missed connections.

To Myself,Baby Rose,by: Michelle Kim,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d643df2ff9129000824131f/1:1/w_160/babyrose_tomyself.jpg,2019-08-29 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/baby-rose-to-myself/,Human Re Sources ,"Since the days of Ma Rainey and Bessie Smith, rejecting domesticity has been part of the blues lady agenda. In her 1998 book Blues Legacies and Black Feminism, Angela Davis wrote that leading blueswomen “challenged the notion that women’s ‘place’ was in the domestic sphere” by making very few allusions to marriage, domesticity, or motherhood. Instead, counter to social expectations for women then and even now, they presented themselves as independent. Atlanta soul singer Baby Rose, whose cavernous voice evokes that of Nina Simone, references domesticity just once on her debut album, To Myself. The mention arrives early on opening track “Sold Out,” when she sings of a past lover with whom she’d considered settling down. “When we was together/I was like spouse/Right beside you/Playing house,” she sings in a velvety, bittersweet contralto, recalling the relationship before it turned “upside down.” Unlike her foremothers, Baby Rose doesn’t hesitate to admit that she once bought into the domestic fantasy. But throughout To Myself, her voice bears the emotional weight and range of the blues, exploring post-breakup intimacies of pain and desire as she works to shatter the glowing facade of her previous life. For much of the album, Baby Rose wrestles with her polarized feelings towards her ex. On the yearning ballad “Borderline,” she dramatizes her indecisiveness about whether to go back to her man or leave him for good. Though it’s a well-worn metaphor, already used by Madonna and the Black Eyed Peas, Rose’s masterful and commanding voice paints shades of nuance, pooling and pouring out her vowels like thick molasses. Other songs encode more subtle emotional tensions: The Daniel Caesar-esque “Mortal,” which compares her ex-lover’s magnetism to a strong undertow, squares up against the vengeful blues ballad “Ragrets,” where Rose’s brooding mind can only remember him as an evil heartbreaker full of “poison.” To Myself’s richness lies in how the intricate, multi-layered production accentuates her warm and expressive voice. The hook of “Pressure” is five words long (“Pressure/Keeps holding me back”), but like Alabama Shakes’ Brittany Howard, Baby Rose can extrapolate mournful meaning from just a few syllables, her voice hesitant and stumbling as she reaches the end of the phrase. A fidgety electric guitar and a drum backbeat that seems to stop and reverse every couple of bars only contribute to the feeling of uncertainty. On the album’s centerpiece “All to Myself,” Rose is paired with just sparse piano and organ as she recalls the feeling of being alone at 3 a.m., debating whether to drunkenly call her ex. To record the song, she downed mimosas and tequila in the studio, a method-acting approach that results in a moving and raw performance suffused with moans and labored breaths. Even small noises, like her whine at the end of the word “complicated,” become little universes of desperation and sorrow. “I had all bets in being a housewife with this guy and not even thinking about music as my first go to, even though I knew this was my purpose,” Rose told Pigeons & Planes, hinting at how the expectations of domesticity can sidetrack women’s careers. The conflict at the heart of To Myself is not just about one choosing to leave one person, but about making the decision to change your trajectory, to rewrite part of your identity. Like the blueswomen before her, Baby Rose forges her own path.","With a voice that evokes Nina Simone’s, the 24-year-old Atlanta soul singer uses her debut album to explore post-breakup intimacies of pain and desire.

Trying to Find My Next Thrill,Cousin Stizz,by: Mehan Jayasuriya,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d5ed52d1ce1350009a5d653/1:1/w_160/tryingtofindmynextthrill.jpeg,2019-08-29 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cousin-stizz-trying-to-find-my-next-thrill/,RCA,"Boston rapper Cousin Stizz has spent his career fighting to break into the mainstream. Since signing a major-label deal, he’s worked with big-name producers including Vinylz and WondaGurl, secured guest verses from established rappers like Offset and G-Eazy, and courted the zeitgeist with a variety of on-trend styles: flute-rap, Migos-style repetition, codeine rap. But despite these efforts, Stizz has yet to score a hit after four years in the public eye. The rapper retreats to his comfort zone on Trying to Find My Next Thrill, doubling down on the slow, hypnotic trap on which he made his name. This retrenchment turns out to be a smart move: The end result is Stizz’s most consistent release since his haunting debut, Suffolk County. Cousin Stizz has always had excellent taste in beats, and for Trying to Find My Next Thrill, he’s tapped fellow Massachusetts native Lil Rich—with whom he’s worked since the start—to executive produce. The pair have sourced a head-turning set of instrumentals: Lil Rich’s beat on “Perfect” sounds like heavy machinery echoing through a wet basement; Take A Daytrip turns in a fizzy club banger on “STP”; and on “Anonymous,” ascendant celebrity producer Kenny Beats punctuates a kaleidoscope of chirpy tones with pillowy drum hits. Stizz anchors everything with his deliberate, subtly melodic flows. If Trying to Find My Next Thrill has fewer obvious standouts than One Night Only, that’s only because it’s stronger throughout. “Toast 2 That” is a dazzling trap anthem, built atop a twinkling, minor-key instrumental laced with melodica. Stizz’s motivational speeches are well-documented but here, he opens with an outright pep talk (“All my niggas in the jail, man, we always think about you, bruh/Keep your head up high, for real, for real”) before Freddie Gibbs drops a show-stopping guest verse, modulating his speed as he approaches the beat from all sides. On “Off With Ya Head!” Stizz stabilizes a wobbly beat with his unshakable delivery. But here, he allows himself to break character, yelping, “You ain’t stick to the script, now it’s off with ya head!” with the theatrical flair of a deranged monarch. “Perfect” feels a bit rote, but Stizz allows the subject of his desire a response, in the form of a playfully assured verse from City Girls’ Yung Miami (“Top of the Ritz getting ate like a steak,” “Yes, I’m a fool for the carats/Spirit animal is a rabbit”). In hindsight, One Night Only was an album shaped by growing pains: not only was it full of stylistic experiments, it also found Stizz reveling in his newfound wealth and status in the most generic terms. With Trying to Find My Next Thrill, he’s figured out that it’s not the lifestyle that he leads but rather, the distance between where he came from and where he now sits that makes for his best writing. On “Meds,” he confides that his weed habit is a coping mechanism for PTSD, and on “Soso,” he reminds himself not to get too comfortable. “The Message” finds Stizz in full storytelling mode, narrating the mistakes of his youth with the hindsight of a man who made it out, while on “Traumatized,” he asks a detractor, “How could I stop now? I'm selling hope.” At its best, Trying to Find My Next Thrill reveals Cousin Stizz to be a reflective and self-aware writer, an everyman behind the jewelry and designer clothes.","On his second album, the Boston rapper embraces his strengths, grows into his voice as a writer and draws lessons from his come-up.

Anak Ko,Jay Som,by: Vrinda Jagota,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d5b0be2ff91290008240e7b/1:1/w_160/jaysom_anakko.jpg,2019-08-28 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jay-som-anak-ko/,Polyvinyl,"Melina Duterte’s process has always been entirely self-contained. On her first two releases as Jay Som, she recorded, produced, and engineered everything herself. This “recorded alone in her room” quality has often resulted in her music being described as bedroom pop. The label is inevitable given that she works in a home studio, but it flattens the complexity of her work. Her excellent debut album, 2017’s Everybody Works, mashed together electronica, indie rock, and pop while retaining a gauziness that felt immediate and personal. Huge guitar hooks gave some songs the bright thrill of ’90s pop, while echoing, repeated vocals created moments of hypnotic drowsiness. While Anak Ko—which means “my child” in Tagalog—is still very much a self-made release as Duterte recorded and produced the record herself, it also finds her opening up her process. She invited people including Vagabon’s Laetitia Tamko, Chastity Belt’s Annie Truscott, and Boy Scouts’ Taylor Vick to play and record many instruments on the record. The arrangements sound exploratory and playful, like a jam session among friends that’s just hit its stride. From the first few notes of opener “If You Want It” to the meandering guitar solo on “Crown,” the compact and punchy choruses found in Jay Som’s earlier work are replaced with inky, moody bass and guitar. Many of the songs on Anak Ko are longer than those on Everybody Works, as if unravelled and filled with instrumental passages. It’s these interludes that bring Anak Ko to life. “If You Want It” begins with droning bass that builds and spirals into dizzying psychedelia, giving the song a sense of narrative progression. Similarly, the tension on “Nighttime Drive” comes from the way the guitars transform to a braided wash of violin, maracas, and drums at the end. The soaring arrangement evokes the thrill of whizzing through deserted streets with the windows down. Album highlight “Superbike” sounds most like a song from Everybody Works. Its introductory chords are inspired by Third Eye Blind’s “Semi-Charmed Life,” a reference that might sound jarring in the hands of a musician less skilled at seamlessly threading saccharine pop melodies through a haze of warped guitar and drums. The guitar work on Anak Ko is especially mature, warping over and around words and adding embellishment as tactile as embroidery on a linen dress. But with such a heavy instrumental focus paired with distorted vocals, you’re sometimes left grasping for something more concrete. Most of the songs obliquely address heartache, repeating meditative phrases like “if you want it” and “somebody tell me” to gesture at grandiose feelings. Sometimes this repetition works to establish a nebulous confusion and longing, where the meaning and order of words is less important than the delivery. On “Tenderness,” Jay Som’s crooned, slinky repetition of the phrase “tenderness is all I’ve got” feels soothing and vulnerable. A line about “shoplifting at the Whole Foods” sticks out as one of the few moments of specific imagery. The album could benefit from a few more details to ground the otherwise indirect songwriting. The lyrics’ pastiche of observations and fleeting memories isn’t always clear enough to be emotionally resonant, to cause you to ponder their meaning after the song stops playing. Instead, the appeal is in the temporary pleasure of listening. There is an unhurried joy in these arrangements; it’s clear that Duterte, an immensely skilled musician, gets a thrill from the mere act of playing each instrument on Anak Ko. She’s making this music for herself first; she’s showing us her world, not sharing it.

85 to Africa,Jidenna,by: Rawiya Kameir,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d63f4ba2dcbbc0009949616/1:1/w_160/jidenna_85toAfrica.jpeg,2019-08-28 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jidenna-85-to-africa/,WondalandEpic,"On a recent episode of The Breakfast Club, Jidenna shared a physics-lesson-cum-aphorism his late father often repeated: “You can’t inflate a balloon from inside the balloon. You must inflate it from outside,” he said, in what can be presumed to be an impression of his father’s Nigerian accent. “So the diaspora must take money from outside and put it in. And the continent must take money from inside and put it out.” It’s a sentiment likely familiar to the children of many African immigrants, an optimistic, globally minded philosophy with clear goals but no obvious plan of action. Jidenna’s 85 to Africa, named for the interstate highway that runs through the southeastern U.S., is an attempt to make good on that philosophy. The promise of a metaphorical highway to Africa, solidifying the connections of centuries of sprawling diaspora, is a useful framework for an album; it’s the highway Drake cruised for much of More Life, as did GoldLink on Diaspora, Beyoncé on the Lion King bonus album The Gift, and Burna Boy throughout his career-spanning blend of afropop, dancehall, and hip-hop. You can imagine Jidenna’s highway system including stops in Jamaica and Trinidad, where dancehall and soca mingle with the U.S. and West Africa. Jidenna’s own diasporic project was evident on 2017’s The Chief, the dense debut album that followed hit singles “Classic Man” and “Yoga,” and which sprinkled in references to his Nigerian heritage. As he’s pared down his style—the bespoke, Antebellum-recalling suits have been replaced with a crisp uniform of a T-shirt tucked into a structured high-waisted trouser, and his box-dyed finger curl grown out and braided—so has his musical style been hemmed in, stripped to the modes in which he’s most effective. The first half of the album, presumably the domain of the I-85, features Jidenna’s take on contemporary hip-hop. “Worth the Weight,” which closes with an evocative vocal sample from Seun Kuti, son of Fela and musician in his own right, expresses a vision of a united black people. The production by DJ Dahi and Nana Kwabena, the Wondaland affiliate who handles most of the sounds on the album, is cinematic and expansive, with horns, manipulated vocals, and booming drums. Unfortunately, here and elsewhere, Jidenna’s hardy, awkward rapping—“Po-po spun the wheel on misfortune, but I ain’t play that/They come round and pat-pat-pat us down but I ain’t Sajak”—doesn't quite live up to the bigness of his ideas. Among 85 to Africa’s most endearing qualities is its cultural references, unexplained and presented as universally understood. “Babouche,” featuring GoldLink, is a jaunty ode to the swaggy slipper common in West Africa. (The song, inexplicably, has some #MeToo commentary thrown in. “You can tell a lot from appearance/You can really spot what you fearin’/I heard Morgan Freeman got a hearing/See, I never trusted that earring,” he raps.) “Sou Sou,” maybe the album’s horniest song, uses a small-group lending mechanism common in the Caribbean and throughout Africa as a conceptual starting point. Things improve on the second half of the album, when, to follow his metaphor, Jidenna arrives in Africa. The melodies and breezy rhythms of songs like “Zodi” and “Vaporiza” are a welcome shift from his barrel-chested rapping. On “Zodi,” featuring Mr. Eazi, he simultaneously charms and razzes an astrology-minded woman, who is the type to “text the stars and crystal ball emojis.” The subject of “Sufi Woman” might be that same person, except this time she’s reading him 13th-century poetry as he luxuriates; a surprising beat, constructed out of Spanish guitar and afropop rhythms by Nana Kwabena, hovers above like a cloudless sky. “Vaporiza” might be the album’s high point, an easy, tender love song with high-life rhythms and Ethiopian horns: “Vaporiza/I’m breathin’ easy when I’m with you,” goes the affectionate hook. In spirit, it shares a lot with one of the summer’s most ubiquitous, and unlikeliest, hits: “Fall,” a velvety love song recorded in 2017 by the Nigerian pop star Davido, suddenly broke through this year and became inescapable. The same happened with “Drogba (Joanna),” a jaunty afrowave track originally released by the Ivorian-British artist Afro B in early 2018. It feels necessary to celebrate the visibility of these songs, propelled into the mainstream without the rubric of any A-list affiliation. It would be unwise to extrapolate too much from such anomalies, but it’s hard not to feel that Jidenna’s right about something.","On his latest, Jidenna invokes a metaphorical highway to Africa, uniting the sounds of the sprawling diaspora. The music ranges from booming contemporary hip-hop to feather-light afropop and highlife.

Face Stabber,Oh Sees,by: Linnie Greene,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d5ea294c7e6ee0009d81d2a/1:1/w_160/facestabber_ohsees.jpg,2019-08-28 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/oh-sees-face-stabber/,Castle Face,"At their best, Oh Sees songs evoke matter in flux. Their music hints at lurking violence, a lazy simmer always threatening to boil over. They’ve honed this sound for about 15 years under a series of similar monikers—as OCS, The Ohsees, and Thee Oh Sees, among others—with about an album a year since 2006’s Grave Blockers. Despite dabbling in krautrock, psychedelia, and punk, they’ve remained remarkably consistent. This is to say: They sound unfailingly like themselves, and Face Stabber further solidifies their identity—raucous, driving, and atmospheric, a heady brew of weeded-out insouciance and wah pedals. Songs like “Gholü” and album opener “The Daily Heavy” capture their molten, nervous fury. “Psy-Ops Dispatch” is somehow manic and low-key, an explosion trapped in slo-mo. The cheery mocking vocals recall earlier hits like 2013’s “Toe Cutter - Thumb Buster” and 2011’s “Contraption/Soul Desert,” a pair of righteous anthems that coupled Iron Maiden-style shredding with the sun-bleached ethos of four dudes taking mushrooms in a California garage. Some tracks sound as if they could’ve been grafted on or Frankensteined together from any Oh Sees record of the past 10 years: see “The Experimenter,” a paint-by-numbers pastiche of riffs and noodly tangents—it feels much longer than its 5:22—and “Henchlock,” the record’s dawdling 21-minute closer. This is one of the first times the band has seemed self-indulgent; Face Stabber runs 20-40 minutes longer than the last three records they released, and this expansion sometimes diminishes its fervor. Whereas Floating Coffin was a clenched fist, Face Stabber can feel like someone flexing in front of a mirror. The record’s bright spots are dazzling, though. “Scutum & Scorpius,” despite its length, is a cryogenic chamber of spooky synth that rivals a Yes song in its ability to run the tonal and emotional gamut. “Poisoned Stones” dispatches with any throat-clearing and launches immediately into a dystopian, post-apocalyptic banger. The lyrics’ pervasive sense of doom give the album a cohesive, sci-fi appeal, all the creepier for its plausibility. “Baking in the wasteland every night/It really suits you in my eyes,” John Dwyer yelps on “Poisoned Stones.” The imagery—wastelands, surveillance, beasts—cements the tone set by the album art, a ghoulish air-brushed hulk that’s part Dungeons & Dragons, part Disney on too many tabs of acid. Face Stabber’s menace varies in its conviction. That’s part of its charm—how seriously can a record take itself when its opening track sounds like a choir of rubber ducks? Spontaneity is a live band’s great asset, and that’s hard to convey in a recording studio, but the record is endearing and absorbing even when it stumbles. How do you bottle energy, commit it to a vinyl groove? (Thee) Oh Sees haven’t perfected the art, but they’re never going to stop trying.

Back in the Tall Grass,Shikoswe,by: Margaret Farrell,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d5ea11f8aeb9e0008ccf1c9/1:1/w_160/backinthetallgrass.jpg,2019-08-28 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shikoswe-back-in-the-tall-grass/,self-released,"The coldest moment of Nora Shikoswe Hougsnæs’ debut album Back in the Tall Grass illuminates a breakup in pale blue light. When face-to-face closure doesn’t satisfy her, she sifts through her ex-partner’s online profile, scavenging for connection. A ghostly organ accompanies her on “Two Heads in a Room” as she succinctly captures the moment: “There’s a war between my tenderness for you and the fact that I don’t love you anymore.” She’s sad, not because of the breakup, but because she’s seeking comfort in virtual stalking. Her matter-of-factness drills in the brutality. As Shikoswe, Hougsnæs brews frothy dream-pop that tucks epiphanies in striking vignettes. The 25-year-old Norwegian musician has been releasing whimsical, surreal music for three years now; 2016’s The Hour of the Body EP indulged morbid curiosity and drew inspiration from René Magritte. On Back in the Tall Grass, she trades her more eccentric interests for an equally uncomfortable exploration of heartbreak. Her prickly vocals are smoothed over and veiled in echo, without the breathtaking intimacy of “This Here,” or the playfulness of “Marie.” Instead, Back in the Tall Grass is haunting and sedate. At her best, Shikoswe elevates her pensiveness into a cosmic, existential query. With just over a dozen tracks to her name, Shikoswe is already a chameleonic vocal force whose high, clear tone resembles Annie Clark or Kate Bush. Back in the Tall Grass strips away the raw piano and nature sounds of her earlier work, using shadowy, serpentine melodies and shoegaze guitars to cushion the blows of lost romance. Balmy synths and angelic vocals wash over these songs like swirling auras; the echoey reverb and seductive, Cocteau Twins-esque dream-pop produces a warm, psychedelic glow reminiscent of Tame Impala. Withdrawn in the mesh of hazy effects, her voice at times sounds apathetic or consumed by memory. On the title track, she drags herself alongside a weepy keyboard melody, singing, “I was so sure you were gonna let me go for a moment.” A melancholic vortex of synths enshrouds her as she hovers like a phantom, unwilling to accept that it’s over. Shikoswe doesn’t reveal where her relationship went wrong, or what could have salvaged it. Instead, the album is a mirage of melancholy and grief. Sometimes her understanding of love feels aloof: On “From the Start,” she compares her relationship to flunking out of school. It’s a strange comparison—connecting with another person shouldn’t feel like passing a test. But maybe this is shame and self-indifference rising to the surface. Though she takes all the blame, at times she seems strikingly detached. Sometimes the magnetic haze surrounding Shikoswe’s music overwhelms her writing and prevents the emotional strife from resonating. The hypnotic current of “Good Intentions” overshadows the significance of the lyrics, and the aching ruminations about death on “Some Days” feel awkward amid choir-like synths. Still, Back in the Tall Grass is a reminder that breakups breed both agony and personal understanding, and Shikoswe finds peace in the end. “Don’t weigh yourself down,” she sings on the closing “Swimming,” absolving herself of guilt by recognizing her own insignificance: “Take a minute and consider that/We are all so small.” At first it’s jarring, then it’s comforting.","The 25-year-old Norwegian musician is a chameleonic vocal force.

Eve,Rapsody,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d5ecbb98aeb9e0008ccf298/1:1/w_160/rapsody.jpeg,2019-08-27 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rapsody-eve/,Roc Nation,"It was Nina Simone who said that “there’s no excuse for the young people not knowing who the heroes and heroines are or were.” North Carolina MC and budding star Rapsody has taken that lesson to heart. Her astounding third album, Eve, is a “love letter to all black women,” with 16 songs named specifically for her heroes, from Simone and Oprah Winfrey to Sojourner Truth and Afeni Shakur. As Rapsody asserts her black womanhood and places it within a broader historical context, she unlocks her full skillset and brings her creativity and ingenuity to the fore. This is the record where her top-tier status becomes undeniable. Rapsody crashed through rap’s glass ceiling when her second album, 2017’s Laila’s Wisdom, was nominated for Best Rap Album at the Grammys. She lost to her friend Kendrick Lamar, but she helped kick open a door that had been closed to women since 1997. (Cardi B’s Invasion of Privacy won the following year.) The case could be made that Laila, Rapsody’s grandmother, was simply the first woman in the rapper’s exhibition of strong women role models, one that also hinges on Ms. Lauryn Hill. “I didn’t know who Nina Simone was until I got into Lauryn Hill,” she told NPR. “In that sense, there would be no Lauryn Hill without Nina Simone, and without Lauryn there would be no me.” Rapsody carefully traces this heritage while making a clear-cut case for her place in it. From Beyoncé’s Homecoming, which couched its ideas in conversation with Nina Simone, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the Clark Sisters, Big Freedia, Maya Angelou, and Toni Morrison, to Jamila Woods’ LEGACY! LEGACY!, which honored forebears like Betty Davis, Zora Neal Hurston, Nikki Giovanni, Eartha Kitt, and Octavia Butler, to recent exhibitions like “Black Women: Power and Grace” and “Posing Modernity,” which consider the erasure of black women from art canon, it’s clear there is an uprising occurring: Black women have been demanding ownership of their outsized impact on culture. When holding these works on top of each other you can see the overlaps; a formative syllabus comes into shape. Eve name-checks Simone and Angelou in its tracklist. A song for Eartha Kitt simply didn’t make the cut. It expands the model to include athletes Serena Williams and Ibtihaj Muhammad, Michelle Obama and civil rights activist Myrlie Evers-Williams, models Tyra and Iman. Spoken-word homages from poet Reyna Biddy pull these icons into orbit around Rapsody, as she delivers the loosest, most captivating performances of her career. Across Eve, she sounds more relaxed, surer of herself. On songs like “Whoopi” and “Iman,” she loosens her flow without losing her sharpness. A self-professed rapper’s rapper, Rapsody has been taut and inflexible in the past, almost as if having to force her immense talent to overcome a deck stacked against her. It sounds like she’s in a home-run trot on Eve. “Y’all banked on the wrong ones, wasted your energy/Lost more interest, got me laughin’ at my enemies/Every door you close, every back you turn/Can’t keep me away from the life I earned,” she snaps on “Cleo.” She sounds unstoppable and liberated, like no one can deny her what’s hers anymore. Rapsody wields the namesakes on Eve not as reference materials but as stepping off points for considerations on colorist beauty standards, black capitalism, activism, and drive. She raps about being counted out, singled out, and fed up. “This ain’t E.T. news, I done went sci-fi/I’m closer to God, I done went sky high/Been alienated so much that I must be fly,” she gloats on “Aaliyah.” She’s locked in, he wordplay as clever as ever, but she also doesn’t feel beholden to past versions of herself. The updated model is multifaceted with catchier hooks, nimbler rhyme schemes, and a willingness to ad-lib. They say you can’t teach an old super-producer new tricks, that a sample head will always remain stuck in the dusty soul loops he conjures, but 9th Wonder evolves with Rapsody here, perhaps out of necessity, as her raps continue to expand in force and scope. Alongside Eric G, Nottz, and Khrysis, the other in-house producers at his label, Wonder assists her in reaching new places. There is nothing faded about these beats, which are modern, rich in tone and texture. As an Uncle Luke sample ushers Rapsody forward on “Serena,” she uncorks syncopated cadences and brings out the work ethic she speaks of. “Nina” reclaims “Strange Fruit” from Kanye and “Afeni” channels Tupac’s “Keep Your Head Up,” as if unifying the Shakur family in its admiration of black women’s strength. Throughout the hour, Rapsody is striking this perfect balance between paying tribute and spreading her wings. She is as comfortable trading bars with Leikeli47 on “Oprah” as she is Queen Latifah on “Hatshepsut,” both of whom make formidable sparring partners. But the message is one of inclusivity, of banding together to receive the respect that is long overdue. And it isn’t just about being acknowledged; it’s about taking a rightful place in the hierarchy. For Rapsody, specifically, that means being as respected as her male peers often spoken of as successors. She proves to be as much an inheritor of the Roc Nation legacy as J. Cole on “Sojourner,” as much of a student of Shakur doctrine as Kendrick on “Afeni.” As Rapsody salutes the heroes that are and were on Eve, her own reputation grows.","Rapsody’s third record is a triumph. The North Carolina MC unlocks her full skillset and brings her creativity and ingenuity to the fore.

Free Cell,Lina Tullgren,by: Emma Madden,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d485f5004c06a00092f65a3/1:1/w_160/LinaTullgren_FreeCell.jpg,2019-08-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lina-tullgren-free-cell/,Captured Tracks,"It’s virtually impossible to lose a game of FreeCell. Unlike other forms of solitaire, 99 percent of the deals are solvable. It’s a game of choice and organization. You put down one card, then another, until—like writing a sentence or a song—you’re left with a larger sequence. The Queens musician Lina Tullgren developed a FreeCell habit while on tour, using the game to compartmentalize time while experiencing the swimmy delirium that comes with waking up in a new city every day and having to connect with a new room of strangers in a different time zone. With elements of 1990s slowcore, quaggy indie-rock, and experimental composition, Free Cell successfully captures a dissociative feeling that lies somewhere between boredom and nausea, like sitting in a sauna. It does so with deliberate calculation. While their 2017 debut, Won, felt loose and irregular, with melodies that changed like moods, Free Cell is an exercise in construction and pattern-based songwriting rather than improvisation. Tullgren was encouraged to play music from a young age by their mother, a classical flautist; after splitting their adolescence between the fiddle and guitar, Tullgren has finally permitted the two to meet on Free Cell. They’re assisted by Brooklyn-based composer Simon Hanes, whose Italian romantic influences—Rossini comes quickest to mind—seep into the music. The album begins slowly, as Tullgren sings the opening line one syllable per second: “Staring into my golden dreams.” Their guitar picks out a slacker’s riff as strings begin to wince. “Picking up a game to make me proud,” they intone (presumably having won another game of FreeCell). As Tullgren ever so slightly increases speed with each lyric, Hanes’ arrangement takes on strings, horns, brass, and distortion. Free Cell sounds as though it’s hooked onto a pendulum, swinging feverishly between beauty and distortion, vigour and lethargy. Any breakouts of prettiness are either followed by unlovely noise or gibbering riffs going nowhere. Any instance of vitality is tempered by disaffection. It’s a continual frustration that presumably puts the listener within Tullgren’s state of mind—persistently waiting for a moment of relief and clarity that never fully arrives. Tullgren’s songs are fraught with tension, like elastic bands threatening to snap—but they fall slack just as you expect to get hit in the eye. “Something is slowly, slowly, slowly,” they sing with quickening fervor on “Soft Glove 1” and “Soft Glove 2,” but instead of bursting, the rhythm relaxes back to its starting place. “Golden Babyland,” is the only song on Free Cell that doesn’t unfurl gradually, but rather coils itself into a tight spring.  Over a taut, irresistible guitar riff, Tullgren turns boredom into destruction: “In the kitchen melting Legos,” they sing, mimicking the liquefied sound of their guitar. It’s a well-wound pop song that seems to be the album’s outlier, until two minutes in, when the song unreels itself into aimless ugliness. Instead of capping off a neat tune with a satisfying ending, they forgo beauty—something they clearly distrust—for the sake of conveying their mercurial state. Tullgren taps at their guitar in a kind of frantic inertia, undoing the twists of the song’s first half. While it’s split almost perfectly into two-minute segments, the second half feels noticeably longer. Free Cell has a way of drawing out the minutes. The album plays at the same rate as a long afternoon, when boredom turns to drowsiness.  The result isn’t so much an exercise in the ability to withstand tedium, but a study of the nuances of torpor, which often grips with a captivating haze. “Guess I gotta blend some time,” they sing on “Saiddone,” collapsing the concept until it’s nonsensical: “Sometime it’s right now, sometimes it’s next week, sometime October.” Tullgren suspends meaning, shaping vowel sounds so ambiguous that it’s almost impossible to comprehend the words until the end of each sentence. The effect puts the listener in a soupy headspace. Listening to Free Cell feels like standing up too quickly—when all the world feels like it’s on playback half a second too slow.","Titled after a game of computer solitaire, the Queens musician’s second album uses avant-pop songwriting to capture the nuances of tedium, to strangely captivating effect.

August,Shannon Lay ,by: Erin Osmon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d388dbdc0574f00088cc797/1:1/w_160/shannonlay_august.jpg,2019-08-27 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shannon-lay-august/,Sub Pop,"August marks a series of milestones for Shannon Lay. It’s her debut for the Sub Pop label, and her first solo album recorded with fellow Angeleno Ty Segall. Its release arrives in tandem with the two-year anniversary of Lay quitting her day job, a coveted turning point not every musician reaches, and one she’s immortalized in the album’s title. Outside of making gorgeous folk music, Lay also plays in the punk quartet Feels and in Segall’s Freedom Band, and the ease between her and Segall is palpable. Lay demonstrates the comfort and command that only comes from finding your people. The album has a telepathic quality to it, like Sandy Denny working with Richard Thompson and John Wood on The North Star Grassman and the Raven, or Elliott Smith mind-melding with Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock for Either/Or. Lay’s lyrics find depth and meaning in everyday moments: “Gone with the day again/I’ve seen so much and there’s more yet,” she sings on opener “Death Up Close,” an album highlight that features garage-pop musician Mikal Cronin blowing rays of light through a saxophone. “I love it/I love you,” Lay concludes, a plain confession whose boldness mirrors the confidence in her full-throated delivery. The arrangements seem to bloom directly out of her voice, mirroring her mental state. “Nowhere soon/Soon we’ll get to nowhere/And we’ll talk to no one/And not meet them,” she intones on “Nowhere,” and the loping percussion echoes her romantic aimlessness. “I can decide my own way/I can decide which way to go,” she declares on the title track, over a nervous repeated pattern on electric guitar and locomotive drumming. The album’s most tender moments are heard when Lay honors her idols. “November” considers Nick Drake’s serene and unparalleled voice: “Molly did you feel the sting/Of November songs gone quiet,” Lay wonders, imagining the devastation felt by Molly Drake when her son passed away. “I think of him often/I wonder if he’s listening/I wonder if a voice so quiet could ever really die,” she muses. Her take on “Something On Your Mind” transports the tune from Karen Dalton’s lonely backroads to a sun-drenched front porch, her fingerpicking folding into a barrage of percussion. The cover is a brave and well-meaning gesture, if not an entirely necessary one: Lay’s obvious love of Dalton is heard more subtly and perhaps more successfully through the album’s earthen textures. The fiddle on “August” and “Sea Came to Shore” is straight out of “Katie Cruel.” At any rate, Lay is able to cover Dalton without losing her own voice. Her vision is clear-eyed, poetic, and for all the ways she channels the greats—Dalton and Drake, yes, but also Vashti Bunyan and current-day figures like Jessica Pratt and Adrianne Lenker—she also chisels her own name in the canon, painting a pastoral Los Angeles where the blazing concrete and wondrous shores and discarded sofas and blooming canyons form a peculiar everyday worth interrogating.

Just spectacular, this thing. The beard conveys wisdom, mystery; it derails interviews, inspires Wikipedia edit wars. Amidst the coterie of oddballs known to the world as Elephant 6, Spillane has always stood out, even to those who might not know his name. It’s hardly just the facial hair: Spillane is the horn player for Neutral Milk Hotel, and really, for all of Elephant 6, lending his time-distending, stately-yet-sloppy touch and fondness for atypical instrumentation—euphonium, flugelhorn, that sort of thing—to any E6 record that would have him. Like Jeff Mangum’s heart-stopping bleat or Julian Koster’s swooning saw, it’s impossible to imagine the sound of Elephant 6 without him. But this truncated version of the Spillane story—horn guy, has beard, knows Jeff—leaves out one crucial bullet point: Spillane not only played with some of the best of Elephant 6, for a brief time, he helmed one of the collective’s finest bands. Spillane came up in Ruston, Louisiana, alongside Mangum, Apples in Stereo pixie-stickler Robert Schneider, and merry Olivia Tremor Control prankster Will Cullen Hart. And right at the peak of E6’s powers, Spillane, his NMH compatriot Jeremy Barnes, late guitarist Will Westbrook, and fellow E6 mainstay John D’Azzo released Are You Sleepy?, the first of two LPs as the Gerbils. Where 2001’s The Battle of Electricity is pleasantly anodyne, 1998’s Are You Sleepy? is anything but: It’s a roughed-up, fuzzed-out, in-the-red power-pop album with proggy ambitions and some deep-fried weirdness just beneath the surface. While not a full-bore classic, it stands among the best of the second-tier E6 offerings, a longtime fan favorite recently reissued on vinyl for the first time in 20 years. The first thing anybody notices about Are You Sleepy? is Spillane’s voice—he may look like a backwoods dope farmer, but he sings like a cartoon bumblebee. Warm and warbly in the Daniel Johnston mold, his falsetto cuts straight through all the gnarled lo-fi static around him. While most Elephant 6 records attempted to transcend their home-taped origins, Are You Sleepy? is a lo-fi record in every sense, every level screaming hot, every seam undisguised. Compared with the world-building wonder of classics like Aeroplane, Sleepy? can feel a little one-note: catchy but a tad on the sweet side. Listen closer, and you’ll hear Spillane’s not afraid to mix in a little sour: “Sunshine Soul” likens a budding romance to a cup full of spiders, and “Crayon Box” turns a missed ride to a nearby Portastatic gig into a full-on existential crisis. There’s a semi-surreal, Southern gothic vibe to many lyrics, and much of Are You Sleepy? is written on the body: a lot of knees and lips, teeth and tongues. Quite a few songs trace a kind of fly-on-the-wall longing: the feeling of going unnoticed, of fraying connections with your small circle, of departures both temporary and permanent. Smack in the middle of Sleepy is “Wet Host,” a five-and-a-half-minute ambient noise collage that separates the record into two distinct halves.The second takes a midnight-dark turn on “Walnuts,” where Spillane recalls a sudden reemergence of “childhood dreams and violent screams” as his syrupy voice overruns with bile. You’d be hard pressed to call Sleepy? an angry record, but it’s got more than a few moments like these, where Spillane’s good-natured facade betrays a kind of uncontrolled bitterness. Sleepy is best when it lets these stranger impulses seep into the songs, and at its worst when self-indulgence starts to crowd out the songs themselves. The choppy “Ted Doesn’t Mind” devolves into a horny street preacher/”Convoy” routine that’s funny approximately once, and as intermissions go, “Wet Host” would be just as effective at half its length. But these flickers of excess are short-lived. Twenty years on, Are You Sleepy? still feels like the razor blade in the apple.","This surreal, distortion-heavy power-pop album, reissued on vinyl, stands among the best of the late-’90s Elephant 6 output.

Lover,Taylor Swift,by: Anna Gaca,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d2e3806e1d34500083e3d58/1:1/w_160/TaylorSwift_Lover.jpg,2019-08-26 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/taylor-swift-lover/,Republic,"The theme of Taylor Swift’s Lover is right there in the title. These 18 songs are odes to the things she loves most and knows best: her boyfriend and her mom, the West Village and the West End, and, always and forever on a Taylor Swift album, being in love. It’s an exuberant celebration of the challenges of maintaining a relationship through seasons and across continents, of telling the truth and saying sorry. Swift has always mined her personal life for opaque fables of love and retribution; she memorializes a romance’s fleeting details, wraps them in bows, and ferries them to an audience eager to receive her gifts. She writes about a life that’s strengthened, not broken, by heartbreak. Lover is the suggestion that the right person, the right song, might lift heartbreak from your life, too. The concept is, as she claims early on, both “overdramatic and true.” Lover nods to 2017’s reputation, but in spirit, it’s the sequel to the synth-pop glitter of 1989. Produced mostly with ubiquitous pop whisperer Jack Antonoff, it’s full of low-lying synthesizer pulses and reverbed beats that can feel more like scaffolding than full songs. Sometimes it attempts to honor Swift’s entire artistic journey at once: The waltzing “Lover,” full of fiddle and fairytale weddings, harks back to the Old Taylor; “I Think He Knows” is a thumping electro-pop shout-out to Nashville’s Music Row. She uses the word “shade” twice, up from once on reputation. She’s 29, but she still writes metaphors about prom dresses and homecoming queens. It’s bright and fun and occasionally cloying. Lover’s emotional peaks and valleys are higher and deeper than reputation, where romance played out under a long shadow of doubt. Opener “I Forgot That You Existed” is a hopscotch rhythm set to a rhyme like you’d leave in your nemesis’ yearbook if you were really being honest—which is to say, it doesn’t sound like she forgot for one second. It comes off as throat-clearing, but it opens a stretch of drama-free delights, like the magnetic pink glow of “Cruel Summer” (“I don’t want to keep secrets just to keep you!”) and the crystal-ball clarity of “The Archer,” with its elegant, Chromatics-esque synthesizer build and self-aware regret: “I cut off my nose just to spite my face/And I hate my reflection for years and years.” The exception is undercooked gender-equality anthem “The Man,” a song that hilariously, unironically points to Leonardo DiCaprio’s playboy image as the height of masculine privilege, and proves that other people shouldn’t write Kesha songs. Is it the prickly cotton-candy production or the lyrical detail or the vocal echo or just the event album-ness of it all that keeps Lover in the foreground, song after song? With the possible exception of the steel drums on music-box oddball “It’s Nice to Have a Friend,” the album never claims any new ground; some of its best moments are unavoidably familiar. Rihanna or Robyn might intend their new music to sound entirely fresh; Swift, our most conventional pop star, builds atop what has worked already. And with Antonoff behind so much of the sound of pop music in the latter half of the decade, the bold, ’80s-inspired style isn’t inherently more interesting or varied than any other. “I Think He Knows” sounds like Carly Rae Jepsen; “The Archer” sounds like Lorde’s “Supercut”; “Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince,” actually a Joel Little joint, sounds like Lana Del Rey’s Born to Die. Swift and her collaborators try some real doozies: Pop-punk marriage proposal “Paper Rings” has a key change borrowed from the Shangri-Las and more than a little acoustic guitar in the mix. It’s cute, and then exhausting. The perky, England-themed “London Boy” begins sweetly—“I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent”—but devolves into a parade of rugby and high tea and “I fancy you”s, a love song as predictable as one of Mary-Kate and Ashley’s direct-to-video European adventures. She samples Idris Elba joking about taking James Corden on a scooter ride, apropos of nothing except that he says “London.” I can only imagine what it sounds like to a Brit. “London Boy” is relentlessly upbeat, but the next mood swing will knock you sideways: It’s “Soon You’ll Get Better,” a heartrending ballad about Swift’s mother’s ongoing cancer battle, with background harmonies by the Dixie Chicks. Three minutes later, her tender testimony of new faith is outshined by the terrific “False God,” a moody sophistipop meditation on transatlantic romance where worship (“Religion’s in your lips… the altar is my hips”) sounds more like a metaphor for…. oral sex? On a Taylor Swift album? Am I losing my mind? Then “You Need to Calm Down” crashes in to remind us that she also considers making nice with Katy Perry to be a form of activism. Because Swift is better when she’s learning than when she’s trying to teach us a lesson, Lover’s garish lead singles contribute to the strain. I’ve thought about “ME!” every day for four months; it still sounds like a musical number taken out of context, just unearned celebratory fanfare without plot or character development, so dead-eyed it’s spooky. But she’s better when she gives herself real space to think, as on “Cornelia Street,” a lovely, understated tribute to memory and nostalgia with the power to make one rarefied block of Manhattan feel universal. Like Red or Speak Now, Lover is a sprawling scrapbook of invisible personal bookmarks, an escapist fantasy about a real-life celebrity boyfriend, a shrewd self-mythology disguised as a benevolent offering. It’s probably five bad songs away from being better than 1989. It’s also a little wiser and more emotionally honest. “I once believed love would be black and white… I once believed love would be burning red/But it’s golden,” she sings on dreamy pastel closer “Daylight,” replacing the fiery passion of Red with a gentler, more mature understanding of true love as a good idea you don’t want to stop having. Heartbreak can strengthen you; love sustains you. If only all of Lover had the same heart.

Though uneven, Lover is a bright, fun album with great emotional honesty.

Release the Dogs,Joyero,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d239746332ba40008a6ee4a/1:1/w_160/joyero_releasethedogs.jpg,2019-08-26 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/joyero-release-the-dogs/,Merge,"You would expect a solo record by Andy Stack to sound good—making records sound good is what he’s all about. Even in his own band, the Baltimore-bred duo Wye Oak, he is an elusive presence. His chattering drumming and engineering finesse, though integral to the uncanny sound, can seem almost incidental, backlighting the larger-than-life silhouette of singer-guitarist Jenn Wasner. Stack has been even more secret-saucy in other projects, from his studio and tour work with Helado Negro and Lambchop to the structures he helped build under the visionary pop-classical song cycle Spiritual America, with Wasner and composer William Brittelle. He is a maestro of marginalia, a technician who minimizes himself to maximize the song. So of course, Release the Dogs, Stack’s first solo record as Joyero, sounds good. Threading kinetic dream-pop with latent strands of electronic music, it has something of the rubbery minimalism of Arthur Russell’s early disco and the pointillism of Animal Collective, the tangled understory of Caribou and the skyscraping canopy of M83. The production is lush yet astringent, all lemony glares and purpley shadows. The arrangements are usually restrained to a few limber strands, so that every decision stands to account. But there’s a difference between sounding good and being good. Stack lands on the right side of that difference, filling in his margins with a presence, a small but warm and agile voice, and a knack for melody. “Alight” is an invigorating start, weaving propulsive bass and fingertip percussion into a net that keeps hauling up great, shining organ chords. The vocal melody on “Dogs” burrows through a dreamy, locomotive arrangement for guitar and electronic pads and slips into your ear, where it lodges fast. He places words as carefully as filters and fills, nestling in syllables so they add a layer of rhythmic definition. The overall impression is of gentle vigilance, soft tension, a certain insomniac energy. Outside of its most nocturnal passages, Release the Dogs feels optimistic. It takes a little while to notice that it’s actually a breakup record. Recorded in Marfa, Texas between Wye Oak records, fixed addresses, and relationships, the record uses a central canine metaphor to outline a flickering state of transition, somewhere between tame and feral. It develops through second-person address and elliptical vignettes, such as the domestic scenes softly humming and crackling in “Starts.” On “After You,” Stack sends his lamentation traveling farther than ever, laddering from his lowest vocal register to his airiest and back again, as if he’s trying to get away from himself. As is always the case with records cast for a me and a you, the listener sometimes wonders, then where am I? But look, it’s a breakup record. Everybody gets one, and it’s the only embryonic thing about this markedly long-steeped debut.","The solo debut from Wye Oak member Andy Stack threads kinetic dream-pop and electronic textures into a hypnotic break-up record.

How to Live,Modern Nature,by: Jesse Jarnow,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d488ac1331bd7000859d71e/1:1/w_160/ModernNature_HowToLive.jpg,2019-08-26 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/modern-nature-how-to-live/,Bella Union,"British songwriter Jack Cooper’s former group Ultimate Painting paid tribute to the southern Colorado countercultural artists’ community Drop City, which formed in 1965 and was abandoned to biker gangs by the early 1970s. When Ultimate Painting imploded last year, and Cooper’s new group Modern Nature debuted with an 11-minute piece of cosmic minimalism, one might’ve expected them to dive further into the swirl. But the band’s full-length debut, How To Live, anchored by Cooper and BEAK>’s Will Young, offers a more grounded escape route, blurring ideas of city and country in search of transcendence. If Ultimate Painting’s soft-edged psych-pop teased at the sounds of the ’60s, Modern Nature evokes the psychedelic era’s ambitions through open-ended song structures. With a mix of quietly pulsing beats, hushed guitars, and whispered vocals, the songs recast Cooper’s music as coming from someplace above the fray. There are too many pulsing Neu!-influenced drums, wild saxophone solos (by Jeff Tobias of New York jazz-noise outfit Sunwatchers), and organ drones for an algorithm to tag the forward-pushing How to Live as “folk.” But the music shares some of the ache and inscrutability of Fairport Convention and Incredible String Band. Everything—from the swirling cello of “Criminals” to the pulsing motorik throbs of “Footsteps” and “Seance”—is held together by Cooper’s quiet voice and his sweet yearning for a different plane. The loud/quiet/loud eclecticism might feel forced if it weren’t in service of such a coherent mood, a series of scenes viewed through the same rain-spotted train window. Cooper sounds most at home when his voice seems like it’s about to dissolve into the vining parts and the woody paths behind him. “Turbulence” is the album’s most fragile moment, a lilting melody not unlike John Lennon’s “Julia,” Cooper’s voice rising over a guitar pattern and organ. At their best, Modern Nature offer glimpses into the same enlightened place they accessed on their debut EP, where introspective folk songwriting and churning classical minimalism are one and the same. On dystopian laments like “Criminals,” How To Live might be heard as a break-up album, though with society as a whole instead of any individual partner. A handwritten liner-note zine accompanying the album underscores how the band’s name does double duty, calling on both the countryside and our current blighted sense of humanity. Modern Nature’s songs might be heard as reminders that true escape isn’t about splitting town, ghosting everybody you know, and throwing your phone in the ocean. How To Live uncovers an internal landscape just as wide open, much easier to get to, and even harder to escape from.

WAHALA,YATTA,by: Phillip Mlynar,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d5ecca1ff9129000824104a/1:1/w_160/wahala_yatta.jpg,2019-08-26 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/yatta-wahala/,PTP,"At one point on “Francis,"" a song on the Brooklyn-based vocalist and poet YATTA’s second album WAHALA, a loop of the ubiquitous ice cream truck jingle pops up. Depending on your mood, it will either stir idyllic childhood memories or set your teeth on edge. YATTA excels at inspiring these kinds of polarizing emotions on WAHALA, whose title translates from Krio into “a state of worry, trouble, a terrible mess."" Short lines of improvised poetry and fragmented phrases are manipulated with a loop pedal and sent swimming across the ambient backing tracks. Over all of this, YATTA grapples with depression, anxiety, and identity, and ultimately tries to convince themselves of the near-impossible—to just buck up and be happy. When the album ends after 30 minutes, it’s like you’ve been listening to the therapy session going on inside someone else’s head. The experience is both harrowing and strangely cleansing. WAHALA is dominated by YATTA’s voice—or, rather, YATTA’s voices. Armed with a toy box of digital tricks, their vocals are pitched up or down to represent various parts of their personality competing for space in the same psyche. Deeper, distorted tones represent the dark side; a child-like lilt hints at optimism. Loops and glitches applied to these words become part of the project’s metronome: On opener “A Lie”—which begins with the advice “Hey, don't let yourself ruin/Run the show!”—the latter part of the word “survive” is repeatedly triggered to conjure a sense of rhythm. This experimental production gives WAHALA an undulating texture that’s complemented by YATTA’s own fluid voice. On “Cowboys,” which adds wavering guitar to the hazy mix, YATTA sings “Cowboys are black/And techno is too,” and layers the sentiment with a demonic, guttural voice proclaiming “Artsy black girls are like Pokemon/Gotta catch ‘em all.” These juxtaposed fragments land like slogans from an unearthed Basquiat painting—they’re a cue for your mind to wander off into the imagery. A quote from YATTA accompanying WAHALA explains that the album is inspired by “being black, being trans, and being African on foreign land,” along with psychosis and depression, rage and pain, tension and confusion, and the cyclical nature of these intermingling factors. But the music and the message don’t play out in a tidy linear unpacking; these facets cannot be dealt with one at a time under the auspice of the increasingly commercialized concept of self-care. The soul of WAHALA is about accepting that all these different feelings can be felt at once. YATTA inches towards this realization on the album’s concluding song, “Underwater, Now.” Set to a soothing, submerged choral backdrop, YATTA throws off the processing effects and speaks in their natural voice, expressing something we can all relate to: “All I know is that it all fucking hurts.”","On their harrowing and strangely cleansing second album, the Brooklyn-based vocalist and poet grapples with depression, anxiety, and identity.

Dutty Rock,Sean Paul,by: Anupa Mistry,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d6005aac7e6ee0009d81e86/1:1/w_160/SeanPeal_DuttyRock.jpg,2019-08-25 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sean-paul-dutty-rock/,Atlantic,"Showbiz always comes for the teeth. Early in Sean Paul’s career, at the start of the millennium—nearly two decades before Cardi B rapped about aspirational dental surgery on “Bodak Yellow”—the Jamaican musician embarked on a global debut with cornrows in his hair and braces on his teeth. The intended effect of the makeover? To align Paul with the big-budget hip-hop and R&B stars of American urban radio in the early aughts. In order to cross over and become successful beyond the confines of dancehall, a genre then in the shadow of Bob Marley posters plastered on college dorm walls, Sean Paul would first have to go pop. Dutty Rock fits the template of how global pop breaks today: take an indigenous sound, affix it to a pop template, and attach a legible ambassador to the project (orthodontics may be required). This is the price of access to a monolithic industry. But now, after dancehall has once again gone mainstream, the stakes of crossing over are higher. Audiences are more open to genre, but they also have shifting and conflicting values and are more vocal about equity issues within pop culture, such as representation and cultural appropriation. But before all of this, in the late ’90s, Paul was a bald-shaved, baby-faced loverboy proselytizing the hollowed-out cadence and bark of dancehall OGs like Super Cat and Shabba Ranks. Me and my friends drove around listening to flea market-sourced riddim mixtapes and hitting repeat on tracks like “Baby Girl,” “Infiltrate,” and “Deport Them.” The bass made our bodies vibrate and Paul’s boy-ish chat felt less intimidating than the grown-up raunchiness of other artists we loved, like Mr. Vegas and Elephant Man. Before he conquered the world, Paul’s club-ready dancehall was a kind of guide to our suburban adolescent mating rituals. His first album, Stage One, barely hit the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop 100 in 2000. A majority of the music on Stage One, including now-classic tunes like “Deport Dem,” and “Hot Gal Today,” had been floating around on riddim tracks for a couple of years before the release. But its lackluster commercial performance might also be indicative of incompatible listening cultures, or: conversational, informally distributed riddims versus the individualist, heavily categorized and marketed nature of modern LP making. “Riddims were an economic thing,” Sean Paul told me in 2016. “The tape could hold a certain amount of tracks, so there’s one producer and he has many artists on [the riddim]. That struck such a vibe in Jamaica because it was cool to hear different perspectives. You could have one guy singing about a girl with a fat ass, and another person singing something more conscious—and it’s on the same riddim.” Thematically, dancehall is seeded in the thorny social morass left behind by colonialism. From its origins in the late 1970s to the present day, the music has often chronicled, “the gritty realities of Kingston’s ghettos...sharing crude truths about the conditions of Kingston’s poor, their connections to Jah (Rastafari for “God”), the medicinal and recreational benefits of smoking weed.” Paul was an uptown kid with an artist mom and an incarcerated father, who grew up playing competitive water polo. “A lot of my first songs were really conscious,” Paul said. “A couple of songs I wrote for my demo were talking about the ghetto story—I was drawing comparisons between uptown, where I’m from, and downtown.” But it was the gyalis tunes about chasing, watching, and dancing with women, that would become his niche. In 2002, Sean Paul’s second album, Dutty Rock, hit big. By then he’d “gone international” after guesting on “Money Jane,” a posse cut by Toronto’s Baby Blue Soundcrew, which became an unexpected success on Canadian commercial radio. By the time Dutty Rock dropped, its first single “Gimme The Light” had already warmed up the clubs and streets via the Buzz riddim, a crackling, suspenseful loop that sounds like a tiny string section trapped in the digital chaos of a video game. It peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard Top 100—and then “Get Busy” leap-frogged it to reach No. 1 with a raucous music video in tow. Filmed in an unfinished basement in the suburbs of Toronto, the video by Director X prominently featured kinetic dance crews performing the latest dancehall moves and captured the innovative energy of a culture in diasporic translation. The videos from Dutty Rock immortalized trends originating in Kingston dance halls, with help from Director X and perceptive choreography by Tanisha Scott. The visuals were also in conversation with what was happening on BET and MTV. In the video for “Like Glue,” Paul’s brother gets on the mic, calling out dance moves as a crew performs on stage: “row the boat,“ “signal the plane,” “parachute.” Just the year before, in 2001, everyone—from Diddy to a bunch of kid dancers—was doing the Harlem Shake in G. Dep’s videos for “Let’s Get It” and “Special Delivery,” and the decade would go on to birth the Dougie, Stanky Leg, Crank Dat, and more. Dutty Rock also gave mainstream audiences a glimpse at the emotional complexity of dancehall. Scott’s choreography is precise, dramatic, and intimate, (her Kate Bush-meets-Patra work for Drake’s “Hotline Bling” captures this dynamic!). In the video for Dutty Rock’s third single, a cover of Alton Ellis’ twinkling 1967 track “I’m Still In Love With You” featuring Sasha, the waist-to-waist ballet reveals the promise of affection that keeps people on the floor until late. It’s tenderness between friends and (heterosexual) lovers: girlfriends, getting ready to go out and circling their hips to the beat in a bedroom mirror, and the charged delight of two strangers finding a rhythm within the competitive silo of the club. Some dancehall fans consider the ’90s and early aughts a kind of golden era when production was precocious, raw, and experimental. Dutty Rock was a success because Paul’s tectonic hooks and uncanny pop melodies brought out new undertones to the gritty and ingenious riddims that are a staple of Jamaican production. The harpsichord intro to “Can You Do The Work,” on Jeremy Harding’s Liquid riddim conjures the odd pageantry of monarchical period dramas, but it’s Lenky’s clappy Diwali riddim, on which Sean Paul recorded “Get Busy,” that is totemic. It is peak creativity, a deceptively simple loop that conjures movement like a snake charmer’s horn. There’s a sample of the folksy syncopated handclaps that power the traditional Punjabi giddha dance, a hollow and steady bass drum to keep pace with a racing heart, gasping vox synth patches, and a sensual otherworldly whining noise, among others whimsical effects. It fit right in with the mass appeal, shiny suited, post-9/11 Orientalist hip-hop of the time, of which Timbaland and Missy Elliott were chief architects. Although Paul has noted that tracks like “Get Busy” and “Gimme The Light” were polished “by foreign mixers from America so that it could sound as big as whatever Justin Timberlake song was playing on the radio in the States.” Lenky said that around 2001, ""No one wanted [Diwali Riddim] because no one knew what it was. I was trying to give it to [vocalists] and they say it was too ‘noisy-sounding,’ so I put it back in my drawer."" By 2002 it took off, and a collaboration with Paul was sorted. “Get Busy” went on to become their first U.S. No. 1 song, and that win paved the way for arguably the best song on the riddim:  Wayne Wonder’s “No Letting Go.” That track was also a Billboard smash, as was Lumidee’s take, the charmingly off-key teen anthem “Never You Leave (Uh Oooh, Uh Oooh).” Lenky’s ingenious production spent multiple years on the globals charts, and Paul’s place as the world’s translator of Jamaican pop music was secured. And then came “Baby Boy,” the Scott Storch-produced Beyoncé duet that was included in the international re-release of Dutty Rock. It’s probably Sean Paul’s most profitable single: 17 years after release, Beyoncé still performs it as part of her live show. For the singer’s Homecoming performances at Coachella 2018, she played “Baby Boy” as a medley, cut with interpolations of Tony Matterhorn’s frenetic “Dutty Wine,” the staccato dembow of the Fever Pitch riddim, and Dawn Penn’s blissfully lovelorn “You Don’t Love Me (No, No, No).” Years before Beyoncé became an arbiter of Black diasporic pop, she was looking to the Caribbean, and Paul was the gateway. There has always been a bit of pushback to Paul from some dancehall fans because he’s a light-skinned, racially ambiguous artist from the relatively affluent “uptown” Kingston. Moving conversations about equity and appropriation forward requires consideration about the kinds of artists often received as innovators within genres, like dancehall, that long functioned independently of the commercial industry. A globalized music industry churns on the fracking of flourishing Black musical and aesthetic traditions, for consumption (and interpretation) by outsiders: from Snow to Apache Indian to Paul Simon to Justin Timberlake... to the entire K-Pop industry. Artists like Diplo, Bad Gyal, Ramriddlz, and Drake populate the current iteration of this debate as it pertains to dancehall. Given that he was born and raised in Jamaica, Paul’s worldwide success might seem more comparably equitable. But the price of international stardom, or crossover success, remains legibility. Does crossover success empower anyone other than the artist in question? What could counter “appropriation” in a way that doesn’t rely on a neocolonial institution like the music industry? An AllMusic.com review from the time described Dutty Rock as “almost revolutionary.” If we were to revisit that statement today, it might be important to ask: revolutionary for who?","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

A Distant Call,Sheer Mag,by: Dayna Evans,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d386a8bd260ed0008f5a157/1:1/w_160/sheermag_adistantcall.jpg,2019-08-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sheer-mag-a-distant-call/,Wilsuns RC,"At this point in Sheer Mag’s five-year career, the Philadelphia four-piece has delivered more power-pop and heavy metal riffs than a Thin Lizzy cover band expo. Their face-slapping, fist-pumping anthems have sounded countless working-class and socialist rallying cries. By now, are we hoping for more of the same? Or are we ready for growth, their “weird” album, the kind that would shuttle the group from one vintage era to another, maybe a record with some ’80s-influenced keytar and 808s, alongside a ’90s grungy self-seriousness? When a band is so deeply rooted in and influenced by an era long since past, progress can be hard to track. If you were to get no further than the first couple songs on their second full-length album, A Distant Call, you wouldn’t be blamed for believing that Sheer Mag was ready to give us more of that old school rock‘n’roll, rather than something riskier. “Steel Sharpens Steel” opens with lead vocalist Tina Halladay’s signature manic howl, kicking off a stomp-and-chant anthem about fighting the system that comes down like a sledgehammer. “Blood From A Stone” covers the injustice of living check to check in the land of milk and honey. They are perfectly serviceable and easily accessible follow-ups to 2017’s Need to Feel Your Love and Compilation LP (a collection of Sheer Mag’s first three EPs). Eleven or 12 songs like this would be good enough—after all, we could always use more thrashing workers’ rights anthems. But A Distant Call is a slow, slow burn. It’s not until halfway through “Unfound Manifest”—an open-hearted reflection on the guilt and shame of feeling depressed while so many others have it worse off than you—that the band unleashes new depths. “I’m in my head and I’m feeling false,” Halladay sings over a bridge of warbly, undistorted guitar. That vulnerability, combined with the unfamiliar, looser, almost jazzier sound—more Fleetwood Mac or the Eagles rather than, say, Kiss—signals that something new has broken through. These songs are equally as ripe with earworm melodies as their others, but with components that are less obvious or easy to reach for. Sheer Mag has infused their typically punchy hooks with texture. On “Silver Line,” a 12-string acoustic is complemented by a lap steel guitar and keyboard (a sentence I never thought I’d use to describe a Sheer Mag song) but it’s capped off with a monster electric guitar solo from Kyle Seely that shoots off into space. This is what progress sounds like. It doesn’t have to mean abandoning what defines you as a band. It’s the buffing of a rough diamond until it shines. Less lo-fi fuzz and more layered, compelling instrumentation underlay lyrics co-written by Halladay and Matt Palmer that touch on more personal themes like domestic abuse and depression. “The Right Stuff” is Halladay’s righteous message to anyone who might have critiques about her body size: “I don’t care what they see/I think of beauty differently/If you’re worried about my health/Shut your mouth and keep it to yourself.” A Distant Call is an album with depth of production, more deliberate songwriting, and a commitment to style. The most notable change comes in Halladay’s raspy growl. This record was written after she was laid off from her job, out of a relationship, and mourning the death of a father with whom she had a complicated relationship. On previous albums, Halladay screeched as if her life depended on it, nearly cracking when hitting the high notes. Here, she is no less restrained, but the true tone in her singing voice comes through (helping matters, she recorded her vocals in a studio with producer Arthur Rizk rather than on her usual 8-track recorder). This change doesn’t weaken the band’s  DIY spirit—they still self-release all their records and rail about communist uprisings and our corrupt government—but this upgrade to Halladay’s vocals allows those lyrics to shine brighter. On “The Killer,” she sings repeatedly, straight into an epic key change, “The Cold War never ends/It starts all over again/He’s got you right between the eyes/Waving the flag for human rights.” The better we can hear her, the more potent the message becomes. If the scrappy early single “Fan the Flames” was the song to metaphorically grab the major label’s attention, A Distant Call sounds like the result of one of those lucrative multi-album record deals with unlimited studio time by comparison. Even the design of the Sheer Mag logo on this go-round has slightly morphed. On previous albums, the text was flat and black, in the style of any classic power-pop band of the hair-metal era. On this record, that logo has been given 3D depth and is finished in shiny chrome, with a twinkle glinting off the surface. Same band, same logo, same spirit—polished.

"Blue Days, Black Nights",De La Noche,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d56d042ce21490008e1c097/1:1/w_160/DeLaNoche_BlueDaysBlackNights.jpg,2019-08-24 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/de-la-noche-blue-days-black-nights/,Get Loud,"Now and then, a record comes along that cuts to the quick of our political and spiritual moment. Blue Days, Black Nights has zero pretenses about being one of those records. The debut by De La Noche, which is fronted by Rosebuds and Gayngs member Ivan Howard, is a frivolous soufflé of soft-rock baby-makers and disco deliria that could have been crafted any time in the last 50 years. The song titles are basically just search terms for moods and sounds: “Dreams,” “Blue,” “Lush,” “Stars,” “Spooky,” and “Champagne.” It’s music for lotion-y late nights and cocktails with activated charcoal, like if Rhye dropped his falsetto and made a ’70s Italian film score. It doesn’t cut to the quick of anything, but it’s a lot of silky fun. If Blue Days, Black Nights is not thematically rich, it compensates with sonic decadence. The songs are drizzled with just enough truffle oil to elevate their essential sturdiness without obscuring it. As you might expect, based on Gayngs and The Rosebuds’ whole-album cover of Sade, the vibe is redolent of ’80s easy-listening and synth-funk from Peter Gabriel to Tears for Fears, but modernized with the refined pulses of contemporary electronic music. After “Avenues” sets the scene—city at night, lights smeared in the rain—De La Noche gets down to it with “Dreams,” building fluorescent dream-pop over sinister bass lines and topping it with a memorable, heart-tugging chorus, kissed with one perfect pitched-up vocal sample that reminds you that Howard worked with Kanye West—speaking of which, “Blue” is a great “Flashing Lights” pastiche. The record is so consistent with Howard’s other work that it’s surprising to learn that he came on board after it was written and recorded by his old college friends Robert Rogan and Brian Weeks. Rogan and Weeks recorded the De La Noche songs with scratch vocals and sent them to Howard in Portland to see what he thought. Apparently, everyone was so happy with the results that they wound up Postal Servicing the whole thing. With all the tracks already in place, down to Matt Douglas’s blue-steel sax, it’s surprising how organic and integrated it feels. The long friendship and prior collaboration (Weeks was a Rosebud) surely helped breathe life from afar into De La Noche’s sound, and its particular featherlight heft.","The debut project from the former member of Gayngs and Rosebuds is a frivolous soufflé of soft-rock baby-makers and disco deliria that could have been crafted any time in the last 50 years.

Total Solidarity,Various Artists,by: Jesse Dorris,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d5d995d8aeb9e0008ccf123/1:1/w_160/totalsolidarity.jpg,2019-08-24 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-total-solidarity/,Oramics,"On July 27, a month after World Pride brought some five million queer revelers to the streets of New York City, the city of Bialystok, in northeast Poland, held its very first Pride march. It ended in a terrifying display of vitriol and violence, spearheaded in large part by the Catholic Church. Women and children and men held an armed “family picnic” near the march, according to reports in The Guardian, then proceeded to kick the shit out of their fellow citizens. In an irony almost unbearably ridiculous, the brutes wore shirts reading “Fags Out” and chanted the slogan to the melody of the Village People’s (via Pet Shop Boys) “Go West.” Appropriating gay culture to terrorize queer communities feels very 2019. But so does Total Solidarity, a marathon release compiled by Oramics, who work in Poland and throughout Europe “to empower women, non-binary and queer people in the electronic scene,” and Vincent Koreman of the crucial Dutch experimental house label New York Haunted. Its 121 tracks, spanning more than 10 hours, present a state of the union for global electronic music, an alphabetical assortment of the major figures (Catz ‘n Dogz, Danny L Harle, Ekoplekz, Rrose, Varg2™) and dozens of artists who, by evidence of their exemplary contributions, shouldn’t be unknown for long. Proceeds of Solidarity will go to grassroots LGBTQIA+ organizations throughout Poland, who surely need actual funding and not just the social-media currency of “awareness.” Good intentions don’t always make good albums; luckily, as a whole, Solidarity astonishes with its consistency of quality, if not genre, offering versions of virtually every kind of big room, side room, chillout area, bedroom, backroom, and interzone soundtrack. How to approach such a bounty? Put it on shuffle while hosting a sign-painting party for the next demonstration? Listen while you work your desk job or shift at the food co-op or animal shelter? Feed it through Bluetooth speakers to drown out the Proud Boys stans across America? Many of the inclusions are dancefloor dreams come true: Violet takes two trends seemingly past their prime, broken-beat breaks and dubstep’s wobble, and fashions an irresistible charmer called “Self-Inspection” that couldn’t sound fresher. Kai van Dongen’s “Dancing in the Dark,” with its plush toms and pads, is exactly what you’d want to hear while doing just that, unless the minimalist sleaze of Dale Cornish’s “Raise Your Voice” or the hardcore/Cabaret Voltaire mixup “Accepted” by Graham Dunning get you off quicker. Others eschew beats altogether. Kamil Szuszkiewicz’s “Power Ballad” is a slow fanfare of what sound like clusters of horns, bursts of static, and held resonance. Peder Mannerfelt’s “A Drone Against Homophobia” is pretty and aptly titled. Best of all, Object Blue’s “Pure” is an ominous swoon that dissolves into a quick snatch of field recording, as if a dream becoming a nightmare reality. Some artists look back, like Le Chocolate Noir, whose “Act” is woozy proof that trying to sound like Chris & Cosey is an excellent start; Mirt summons the goopy dub of Pole or vintage Orb for “Remake the Past,” which does in a lovely kind of way. Lee Gamble’s “89” is as catchy as anything he’s put out in ages, with a submerged electro beat, loosey-goosey bassline, and industrial accents that tease Depeche Mode’s wan plea for tolerance, “People Are People,” without kitsch. Drzewna’s “There’s a Man” and Baasch’s “Sneaker Fairytale” are perfectly queer New Wave gems. Others look ahead: “Geneva Drive” by drmcnt is house like a Zaha Hadid building, all slick and swoopy curves. Liar’s “Americana” builds a screaming diva epic out of screeching eagles and gunshots and should be the intro music for next year’s presidential debates. In 21st century queer diasporic fashion, I listened to Total Solidarity almost entirely in one sitting, on a flight from Sao Paulo to New York, sunk into my chair beneath a couple Spanish Valium and four or five fingers of Kentucky bourbon. I was moving from a country with a new fascist dictator who, several people told me with a kind of shell-shocked quizzical sigh, hadn’t (yet) quite followed through on his promises to literally disappear Brazil’s queer communities. I was entering a country whose white supremacist president is gleefully installing institutions of terror against LGBTQIA+ Americans, particularly those who are trans and of color, that will last for generations to come. In my climate change-accelerating flying tube, I had a panic attack: I lucid dreamed about an installation I saw by the artist Vulcânica PokaRopa in which video testimonies of trans Brazilians played in a half-moon between blood-spattered floors and rabble-rousing banners and flying mannequins; I stood in the bathroom and let Felicita’s “oooh heavy” melt my brain. How you hear Total Solidarity, like how you hear “Go West,” depends on how free you really are. Meanwhile, since Bialystok, things have only gotten worse in Poland, with right-wing forces joining up with Catholics to establish “LGBT-free” zones throughout the country. These PR stunts proceed on the assumption that the existence of queer people is somehow optional. Fuck that. We are everywhere: Just listen.","A fundraiser for Polish LGBTQIA+ organizations presents a bounty of progressive electronic music, compiling 10 hours of material from Rrose, Violet, Peder Mannerfelt, and more.

GINGER,BROCKHAMPTON,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d5d998dff91290008240fd3/1:1/w_160/brockhampton_ginger.jpg,2019-08-23 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/brockhampton-ginger/,Question EverythingRCA,"The BROCKHAMPTON boys are looking for a way forward. After releasing four albums in quick succession and forcing out  their best rapper, Ameer Vann, when he was accused of sexual misconduct, the group experienced severe burnout and anxiety. So, they took a six-month hiatus to both regroup and disperse. Abstract put out a solo record and the band’s $15 million RCA deal ushered them out of their communal North Hollywood house and scattered them across Los Angeles; they now meet up at a central home studio, called the Creative House, to record. The album that came of all this upheaval is GINGER, a compelling but disjointed record loosely about self-fulfillment. Even the prettiest BROCKHAMPTON songs can feel cramped, but many of these songs, though each endowed with their little moments, are disorganized or inefficient. GINGER was, somewhat oddly, born out of a burgeoning relationship between members of BROCKHAMPTON and the actor/performance artist/fledgling rapper Shia LaBeouf, who now leads a weekly group therapy session at Abstract’s place. As Abstract tells it, LaBeouf became something of a guiding light. “We want to make a summer album,” Abstract told GQ in June, a sentiment that has been confirmed by his group mates in recent days. He specified: “Feel-good. Not too sad and like, ‘Oh, our life sucks,’ just more like, ‘Just enjoy what’s in front of you.’” It’s unclear whether that was a troll or a misunderstanding, but GINGER is not a feel-good summer album. There is little on this record that suggests enjoyment of anything. The mood can be boiled down to a dejected Joba verse on opener “No Halo”: “Been goin’ through it again/Been talkin’ to myself, wonderin’ who I am/Been thinkin’, I am better than him/In times like these, I just need to believe it’s all part of a plan/Lost a part of me, but I am still here.” Being here—present and accounted for, momentarily clear of the debilitating fog that is dysthymia, and usually in between traumas—is what classifies as a win on GINGER. The album is murky and often lovelorn. Pry open any verse and you’re likely to find a lyric about being neglected or counted out or abandoned at its center. It isn’t as pessimistic, jittery, or moody as iridescence but it’s still rather cheerless. That cheerlessness isn’t a problem, in and of itself, but the writing gets bogged down by the narrow perspective. At the root, BROCKHAMPTON is a group of misfits explaining all the different ways they don’t fit in. That’s at least part of the appeal: they speak to many brands of loneliness. But they’d benefit a lot from, instead, figuring out what they have in common. This unwillingness to find some semblance of comfort in the bond they’ve made, to reconvene as an oddball in-group, feels like a huge source of their dysfunction as a unit. They are constantly trying to piece together broken personal histories amid massive success, like decorated detectives obsessing over an unsolvable cold case. Romil, Jabari, and the rest of the BROCKHAMPTON production team keep the crew laced with weird and ear-bending beats that shift, split, or branch out enough to accommodate the myriad of performing styles. In the early stages of GINGER, things all click into place: the trilogy of haymakers at the outset—“No Halo,” “Sugar,” and “Boy Bye”—makes it seem like the crew has unlocked its full potential. The bristling cameo from UK rapper slowthai is a nice touch, too. But as the album wears on, things come undone and songs splinter into pieces. When it comes to the BROCKHAMPTON creative process, the group has always had too many cooks in service of eclecticism. But there are moments on GINGER where it seems like each artist on a given track has their own song in mind. The title track is a broken array of vocal performances that nearly becomes grating. On “I Been Born Again,” a hookless parade of verses, the writing is cluttered and confused. Kevin used to be their star, his gravity pulling everyone into rotation around him. Even on the worst of the Saturation trilogy, there was a sense of alignment, if not continuity. Just about everyone delivers a standout performance that’s striking at one point or another, and many members seem to sense that they’re growing (“My attention to detail is in scale with classic impressionists,” Dom McLennon raps on “If You Pray Right”). It’s just that they’re growing apart, at least musically. There is little here that suggests holism. They like to call themselves a boy band, but boy bands are, at the very least, in sync.","After a brief hiatus, the restlessly creative group returns with a compelling but disjointed record about self-fulfillment.

A Healthy Earth,Peaer,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d2cc0f198713d00083bb975/1:1/w_160/peaer_ahealthyearth.jpg,2019-08-23 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/peaer-a-healthy-earth/,Tiny Engines,"On “Commercial,” the centerpiece of Peaer’s third LP, a man has a nervous breakdown while waiting in line. Lead singer Peter Katz’s voice is barely audible, but the simmering tension should be familiar to anyone at the mercy of bureaucracy,  stuck in a queue and waiting for someone to recognize their plight. “I saw your commercial in the lobby,” Katz murmurs before his voice rises to a dramatic quaver that wouldn’t sound out of place on OK Computer—“Why does everything want to kill me in a million different tiny ways?” It’s not a rhetorical question. On A Healthy Earth, he devotes himself to unpacking what makes daily life so unnecessarily difficult. Katz recognizes that “everything” trying to kill him is a man-made problem in some way—the rising seas, the blazing sun, even his shampoo: “I saw your commercial and now I’m scared/I use that product every day in my hair/I just didn’t know what it would do to me/I even gave it to my family.” But mostly, he wrestles with the everyday suffering we subject ourselves to while trying to connect with other humans. On “In My Belly,” he wonders whether love is just another quantifiable metric that can be life-hacked, and whether it can be intellectualized at all. On “I.K.W.Y.T.,” he examines all the tortuous ways we hold back on our instincts (“Clenching my fist so I don’t cum too quick in my undies/Holding my tongue to ensure I don’t do any speaking”) and by the closing “Have Fun!,”  he’s virtually given up on the idea of healthy and fulfilling monogamous relationships. It’s no wonder that the most convincing love songs on A Healthy Earth fall outside the realm of reality. One man writes a love song to his car; another body-swaps with his dog so he can write a love song to himself. On “Multiverse,” Katz assumes a humanoid vocal to imagine Mother Earth on a self-care kick. These imaginative flights offer welcome moments of respite, but Katz quickly brings them back down to Earth; the alternate reality he envisions on “Multiverse” is simply one where he never becomes a musician and can afford to buy a new car. Every song on A Healthy Earth could function as an essay prompt, and like a good issue of The New Yorker or The Baffler, these divergent intellectual exercises are bound by a general thematic and philosophical coherence: If Katz ever decided to go deeper, A Healthy Earth would probably make a great podcast series. That said, it’s still a rock record, one that works within subgenres of indie rock that frequently deny themselves visceral pleasures—slowcore, math-y DC post-punk. Peaer are now a tour-tested three-piece that have somehow gotten tighter and looser, the way bands do when it’s clear that they enjoy each other’s company. Katz’s guitar figures and vocals take counterintuitive steps towards dissonant note clusters before righting themselves into delightful sing-song melodies, replicating the effect of those bizarre ice creams that have sriracha or mustard in them. Two members of Peaer make their living as recording engineers, and if A Healthy Earth is any indication, they’ve been studying Steve Albini’s every mic placement with monastic intensity. Earth has such an extreme dynamic range that it sounds almost wrong compared to others in its realm. During the times when the album is quiet, it’s as unnerving and tense as anything on the Midsommar soundtrack. When it eventually gets loud—and Peaer rock more convincingly and nastily than just about any band lumped into slowcore—its lean arrangements hit with more unexpected force than any post-rock or metal crescendo. This is the kind of visceral wish fulfillment Peaer specialize in on A Healthy Earth—it acknowledges how much of our lives are spent waiting in line to manage our agony when just giving it a voice might be the only way to get relief.","The slowcore band’s knotty and fascinating third LP delves into the question of what makes daily life so unnecessarily difficult.

River Without Banks,Leo Svirsky,by: Joshua Minsoo Kim,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3743941852280008e542ca/1:1/w_160/leosvirsky_riverwithoutbanks.jpg,2019-08-23 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/leo-svirsky-river-without-banks/,Unseen Worlds,"In Russian musicologist Henry Orlov’s book Tree of Music, a chapter titled “A River Without Banks” details a throughline between several types of sacred music, including Gregorian chants, Indian ragas, African drumming, and Indonesian gamelan. Orlov argues that art allows people to become participants in a “higher reality” and experience  “symbolically significant change.” Leo Svirsky first learned about music’s transcendent qualities from his childhood piano teacher Irena Orlov, Henry Orlov’s wife. Following her death last year, Svirsky affectionately wrote that she taught him “how music is alive, how when we play music we tell someone’s story.” Dedicated to Irena and borrowing its title from Henry’s writing, River Without Banks is a minimalistic piano record that’s informed by the Orlovs’ grand musical philosophy—Svirsky’s monument to the importance of their teachings. River Without Banks establishes its overarching mood within the first few seconds. Stately piano notes reverberate, their fluid melodies creating a hypnotic rhythm amplified by simple delay effects. The atmosphere is simultaneously dreamy and homey; the opening track’s title, “Field of Reeds,” refers to the paradisiacal location that ancient Egyptians believed they would travel to in the afterlife. Periodically, sounds that draw attention to Svirsky’s presence (most notably, the thump of the pedals) contribute to the arresting intimacy of the composition and its performance; these quotidian noises ground the sublime piece with a needed sense of humanness, bridging the gap between the earthly and celestial. Svirsky’s River Without Banks is far more melodic than his previous output. His duo with Katt Hernandez relished in exuberant atonality and a brash style of playing. Heights in Depths, on the other hand, explored static drones and their associated psychoacoustic phenomena. River Without Banks most recalls a mixture of other artists’ works: the relentless piano minimalism of Charlemagne Palestine or Lubomyr Melnyk, the tenderness of Erik Satie’s compositions, the resplendence of new age. It’s all shrouded in a telestic aura, contemplative and heartening and unpretentious. In “Trembling Instants,” cascading piano melodies are enveloped in a cloud of ambience, their continual playing less like rigid latticework than impressionistic filigrees. Equally soothing is the more modest “Fanfare (after Jeromos Kamphuis),” where sparse, delicate chords evoke a sense of serenity. Like Svirsky, the titular Kamphuis also lives in the Hague and has studied under composer Antoine Beuger; the track feels like a small but heartfelt celebration of their friendship. The majority of the album is characterized by Svirsky’s piano, with other instruments—many of which are played by other musicians—rounding out each track. On “Rain, Rivers, Forest, Corn, Wind, Sand,” the interwoven sounds of double bass, wind gong, and trumpet create layered but cohesive drones. Their unobtrusiveness allows for the piano to freely traverse different rhythms and moods. From expressive tone clusters to a whimsical frolic to a more percussive staccato style, Svirsky’s piano conjures a picturesque view of nature’s wondrous breadth. On the title track, the wavering rhythm mirrors the winding path of a river, while the countless notes feel like the bevy of different microorganisms that thrive therein. The song becomes more robust in its final third when double bass and a Tibetan singing bowl transform the piece into a lush musical tapestry fit for spiritual meditation. It’s not always easy to tell when River Without Banks’ songs begin and end: The album’s six tracks aren’t considerably different from each other, neither musically nor emotionally. But this uniformity is what makes the album so immersive; it’s easy to become lost in its ruminative tone. In The Tree of Music, Henry Orlov noted that for people who are attuned to a particular type of sacred music—“to whom the music is his breath and movement”—their experience is heightened. They become “one with its flow,” and River Without Banks grants opportunities for just that. Svirsky’s album evokes a mystical sensation Orlov described as an “ever-lasting and therefore timeless now.”","The Hague-based composer and pianist explores music’s transcendent qualities on an album of minimalist piano with subtle new-age overtones.

Bunny,Ghost Orchard,by: Abby Jones,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d35ec8611f40000081efee9/1:1/w_160/bunny_ghostorchard.jpg,2019-08-23 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ghost-orchard-bunny/,Orchid Tapes,"As its Gen Z affiliates funnel into the mainstream, the definition of “bedroom pop” is murkier than it used to be. But in 2014, before Cuco penned a celebration of his modest Honda, before Gus Dapperton sold Urban Outfitters-exclusive vinyl, and before Clairo sighed at the shallow demands of being a “pretty girl,” New York City-based label Orchid Tapes had a more intimate vision in mind. They presented their blueprint on a compilation released that year, Boring Ecstasy: The Bedroom Pop of Orchid Tapes, featuring early cuts from low-key songwriters like (pre-Sandy) Alex G, Yohuna, and the multiple aliases of Sam Ray. Sam Hall, a more recent addition to the Orchid Tapes roster, performs lo-fi keyboard-trap as Ghost Orchard; he created his third album, Bunny, by himself at his Michigan home. Hall, 21, wrote more than 300 songs for Bunny after moving in with his partner of only a few months. This is an album of goopy love songs, each doused in the same ecstasy produced by fleeting interactions with your middle-school crush. It’s naive and a little cheesy, but Hall’s rosy optimism feels fresh in a genre overrun by “sad boy” tropes. “Station,” one of the album’s brightest moments, is an amalgamation of acoustic strums, stuttering beats, and budding romance. Tracing the map from his hometown to Chicago, Hall details a new relationship in a world where his biggest obstacle is public transportation: “At the station/Ticket in my palms, I can feel my hands shaking… Take the 9 back just to feel your hands in mine.” It’s a sweet reminder of how vast the world feels at 18, though it reads like a page from a John Green novel. Bunny’s title track is one of the few times Hall begins to consider that love might require some effort after all. “Maybe we’re moving too fast/But we’re having so much fun,” he sings. “Lord knows we both have our differences.” Still, his devotion permeates the song: “I’m in this,” he promises, sounding committed—at least for now. These and other guitar-driven tracks (“Carousel,” “Balloon,” “First Time”) feel most natural for Hall, whose past projects spotlighted grainy, lilting riffs. Bunny uses more electronic instruments than he’s put to tape before, but his experimentation doesn’t always equate to originality: “Guess” sounds like a rejected Hot Chip song, while opener “Witness” could suit Joji’s warbly SoundCloud verses, and closer “Honeymoon” feels like a Xerox copy of Rex Orange County’s sunkissed R&B. On paper, Bunny’s hip-hop-meets-six-string aesthetic could easily lump Ghost Orchard with the type of tacky pop-rap crooner dying to convince you that he’s a bad boy with a sensitive side. But Hall’s earnestness feels genuine. He still has some maturing to do: His simple lyrics about young love and summertime outings recall the salad days of school vacation. But Bunny is lighthearted, inoffensive, textbook bedroom pop, and it doesn’t try to be more. It’s nice to imagine that love and coming-of-age could be so painless.","On his third album, Sam Hall performs lo-fi keyboard-trap doused in the same ecstasy produced by fleeting interactions with your middle-school crush.

Animated Violence Mild,Blanck Mass,by: Patric Fallon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3b61f47943ca0008c14f27/1:1/w_160/blanckmass_animatedviolencemild.jpg,2019-08-22 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/blanck-mass-animated-violence-mild/,Sacred Bones,"The title of Scottish producer Benjamin John Power’s fourth album as Blanck Mass, Animated Violence Mild, isn’t merely poetic word salad. If you’ve visited an arcade since the early 1990s, the phrase might be familiar from the American Amusement Machine Association’s rating system. The classification is meant to cover games that feature “violent elements that do not result in bloodshed, serious injury and/or death.” The notion of man-made, non-lethal violence finds new meaning on Powers’ most ambitious album yet. “I believe that many of us have willfully allowed our survival instinct to become engulfed by the snake [of consumerism] we birthed,” he writes in a statement accompanying his new record, identifying a kind of virtual violence against our collective interests, one which has been normalized in part by our own compliance. This sinister current that flows beneath even our lives’ most routine interactions is thrust to the surface and cast in serrated chrome on Animated Violence Mild. The album’s title could double as a tongue-in-cheek rating for the contents therein: These are easily the most aggressive, full-throated songs Power has yet written in his nine-year solo career. Gone are the languid ambient pieces of his self-titled debut album and the overt pop inclinations of Dumb Flesh. Even the teeth bared on his previous full-length, 2017’s striking World Eater, now seem tame by comparison. Nearly every one of these eight tracks channels head-banging abandon in one form or another, with any lingering melodic sentimentality transformed into blinding chemiluminescence. From the beginning, it’s obvious Power has no qualms prominently displaying his influences, which serves to highlight his omnivorous appetite. Tuneful industrial music of the 1980s and ’90s courses through the churning onslaught of opener “Death Drop” and rarely fades until monumental closer “Wings of Hate.” With its punchy groove and catchy synth lines, “No Dice” evokes the cadence of Nine Inch Nails’ “Terrible Lie” while entirely circumventing the classic with its opulent, sensuous arrangement. And no doubt Trent Reznor would be both proud and envious to hear how “Love Is a Parasite” repurposes The Downward Spiral’s seething energy and earworm riffs for its own apocalyptic design. Power also taps into black metal through scorched screams and electronic blast beats, nods to trap in his slower grooves, borrows the rapidfire samples of footwork, and wraps it all in ecstatic trance synths. But his stylistic combinations are so distinct and well executed that they effortlessly transcend any recognizable source material. Two of Animated Violence Mild’s biggest standouts, “Death Drop” and “House vs. House,” kick off the record with the kind of instant momentum often reserved for punk records and hard techno DJs. It’s an overwhelming 15-minute stretch that showcases in brilliant detail all of what Blanck Mass has come to embody: bold experimentation, rhythmic intensity, explosive melody, and artful ferocity. “Hush Money” continues the thread with slightly less satisfying results. Perhaps because the halogen-bright dance tune follows two of Power’s best productions, or because it relies on a more linear and familiar structure, it’s the album’s sole dip in ingenuity. That actually says a lot about the quality of Animated Violence Mild: A track that might seem strong in another context can’t quite reach the high water mark set by everything around it. Animated Violence Mild’s greatest success goes beyond how it manifests the intangibles of humanity’s self-automated undoing, or how it casts a melting pot of influences into singular shapes. Since Power debuted his Blanck Mass moniker in 2011, each record has been held in contrast to Fuck Buttons, his longtime duo with Andrew Hung, and rightly so. The wide scope and stratospheric heights of that group’s best work leave an indelible impression, and Power’s solo work has by turns subverted or indulged the same tendencies.

You Made It This Far,Esther Rose,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d13926d32624700087d5802/1:1/w_160/EstherRose_YouMadeItThisFar.jpg,2019-08-22 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/esther-rose-you-made-it-this-far/,Father/Daughter,"A few songs into her sophomore album You Made It This Far, country singer Esther Rose flashes back to her high school days in Columbiaville, Michigan. In her memory, she hears her mother’s coffee machine, wakes her sister, and scrapes the ice off the car. When they finally get out the door, she proudly lists the artists on the mixtape soundtracking the drive: “Against Me!, Julie Ruin, Minor Threat,” Rose sings. “I light up my last cigarette.” You can picture the scene—the angsty teens, the snowy road, the humdrum day ahead. All the while, a lazy pedal steel yawns and a shuffling beat pushes them forward, in no particular hurry. The listless young characters in “Five Minute Drive” aren’t far from the ones Rose sings about on the rest of the album, emotionally speaking. But a lot has changed. For one thing, much of the present-tense action takes place in New Orleans, the city Rose has called home for the last 10 years. She addresses it most directly in “Lower 9 Valentine,” a simple love song named after the working-class neighborhood where she recorded the album with her small band. You get the sense that Rose’s setting is as important to her as the company she keeps: “Every day’s a holiday when we’re walking on the levee,” she sings. With a hopeful pull in her voice, she makes you want to join in on the celebration. As a writer, Rose draws inspiration from the classic country songbook, artists like Hank Williams and Patsy Cline. Her preferred delivery is a sing-songy cadence that can package punchlines and hard truths with a cozy, cosmic wink. She’s also noted the influence of traditional blues music—as much the songwriting as the recordings themselves, with their crackle and sonic imperfections. In subtler ways than her 2017 debut This Time Last Night—a stark, stirring album recorded directly to two-track tape—this music incorporates the atmosphere around her. Peaceful, with ample room to breathe, these are songs that could change with each performance, on any night, in different weather. You can also hear the influence of those old punk mixtapes from high school. For as traditional as her songs come across, you wouldn’t mistake them for throwbacks, and her lyrics can hit with an urgency embedded in the mind of anyone who’s shouted back lyrics in a sweaty, crowded basement at a formative age. (“I hope you change your mind,” goes a particularly cathartic chorus, “Oooh/Try!”). She’s often accompanied by lap steel and fiddle—two instruments that closely approximate the twang of her voice—and the arrangements fill the blanks between her words. In the exquisite “Only Loving You,” her band switches abruptly between its moody refrain and upbeat chorus. It’s an aural jump-cut that makes the music feel darker than her lovesick words would suggest. Rose focuses her songwriting on self-discovery and how the passing of time shifts her understanding of people. In “Always Changing,” she notices a couple kissing in the park and wonders what their lives are like once they get back home and it’s just the two of them. She puts her own relationships under the microscope in “Sex and Magic,” noting the similarities between the performances in the title, how cheap and fake and desperate each can seem once it turns into routine. The sloppy pedal steel solo adds a kind of slapstick comedy, but Rose’s writing is earnest and direct; when she holds eye contact, it’s like there’s no one else in the room. The album’s best song is also its sparest. The solo acoustic “Don’t Blame It on the Moon” was written just before the album was finished, and it’s the closest Rose has come to writing her own standard. Outside a bar in the late hours of the night, she lets us in on a series of climactic exchanges between two people in love, at the end of their ropes. Each verse is more hopeless than the last, and both parties sound exhausted and hardened to their own bad habits. “Don’t blame it on the moon/It’ll all be over soon,” Rose sings softly, then ends the song on a resounding major chord. Because soon the sun will be up, and it will be time to get moving again.","On her sophomore album, the country singer name-checks Minor Threat and Against Me! while drawing inspiration from classic Hank Williams and Patsy Cline.

Envejeciendo,Maria Usbeck,by: Stefanie Fernández,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d407ae587626200084cdc25/1:1/w_160/usbeck_envejeciendo.jpg,2019-08-22 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/maria-usbeck-envejeciendo/,Cascine,"Maria Usbeck wrote her second album in response to finding her first grey hairs. If her 2016 debut Amparo was a study in place, Envejeciendo is a study in time, examining aging as a continuum of death and regeneration with a light, whimsical touch. On Amparo, the former Selebrities singer returned to her native Ecuador (and a number of other places over three years of travel) to sing in Spanish and indigenous languages including Quichua, Rapa Nui, and Bribri. She pieced together ambient recordings from three years of travel, new-wave production, and instruments like the Andean quena flute, harp, and tumba drum to recover a native language. On Envejeciendo, Usbeck uses these same tools to cultivate a richer emotional terrain. She treats the concept of aging as if it had no endpoint, observing the process in real time. Each sound bleeds into the next. On “Obscuro Obituario,” it’s a layering of human sighs that gives way to a haunting refrain in the voice of one losing their memory: “Recuerda que yo te puedo ver” (“Remember that I can see you”). The examinations of aging on Envejeciendo run the spectrum from heartbreaking to ascetic. On “Amor Anciano,” a forest of synths breaks into an interlude of wind instruments and crickets as Usbeck’s grandmother recalls a bygone romance: “Le queda a una el recuerdo, el recuerdo lindo, de esos años preciosos de la ilusión….” she trails off. (“One is left with the memory, the beautiful memory, of those precious years of infatuation.”) “Retirement Home” imagines the fun retirement homes of the future, and “Secret in Japan” ponders the traditional laundry list of a healthy life: eating well, exercising, getting enough rest. “I think the secret to our longevity is….” Usbeck begins, naming several of these items before finally admitting: “I actually don’t know.” Most of the album is similarly detached, with a lyrical economy that allows for a variety of readings. It opens with “Adios a Mi Memoria,” a goodbye to memory as blithe as a wave from a passing ship. The five-line song moves from Spanish to simple English, the voice of a bilingual brain no longer policing the language of its thought. Usbeck also uses the mundane—like the dissociation that comes with learning a new technology—to encapsulate more existential displacement. On “The Machine,” she speaks as an elder learning to use a computer, the voice chopped and stretched as if downloaded over a bad connection. Pulsing synths and heavy reverb recall the aesthetics of the primitive internet, juxtaposed with the disembodied voice of a virtual assistant explaining artificial intelligence—the past and the future meeting in a conflicted present. Usbeck’s quiet can inspire moods that range from casual observation to painful flashback. The album seems meant as exactly that: a slip in self-consciousness brought on, as Usbeck explains on the final track, by the active and passive mind: “Será que es nostalgia/Talvez es la vejez” (“Maybe it is nostalgia/Perhaps it is old age”). Both states cause memories to embalm and deteriorate without our permission. Yet Envejeciendo provides the distance necessary to think of aging as an old map navigated with intention. With eight concise tracks, Usbeck invites the listener into the kind of brief, dissociative fugue that lets you see all these selves at once.","The Ecuador-born songwriter’s second album is a study in time, examining aging as a continuum of death and regeneration with a light, whimsical touch.

Death Drive EP,Debby Friday,by: Michelle Kim,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d407739f1c63b0008a3cde4/1:1/w_160/deathdrive_debbyfriday.jpg,2019-08-22 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/debby-friday-death-drive-ep/,Deathbomb Arc,"In his seminal 1920 text Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Sigmund Freud proposed the concepts of the sex drive and the death drive. Building off the Russian psychoanalyst Sabrina Spielrein’s concept of the “death instinct,” Freud asserted that alongside our need for survival and sexual reproduction, humans also harbor an innate desire to find the shortest path to decomposition and destruction. Practically, it was an attempt to explain why humans hold aggressive tendencies towards themselves and others, sometimes to the point that they are compelled to kill. These twin forces consume the music of Debby Friday, a Vancouver-based producer/vocalist who continues in Deathbomb Arc’s tradition of merciless industrial-rap experimentalists like Death Grips, clipping., and JPEGMAFIA. The source of this outward aggression, as she’s suggested in interviews, stems from the oppression and trauma she endures as a queer black woman and Nigerian-Canadian immigrant. Similar to the work of political activist Moor Mother or the diasporic electronic collective NON, she wields the sound of violence as a tool for resistance and empowerment, conveying it in her ferocious “bitchpunk” tracks through screeching demands for sexual satisfaction. On her new terrifyingly seductive Death Drive EP, Friday continues to entangle polar Freudian concepts, underscoring the similarities between brutality and desire, love and carnality. Friday’s ideas comes through clearest on “Fatal,” an industrial-pop banger about a partner so good in bed they might be deadly. The song grinds along with the same depraved energy as Nine Inch Nails’ “Closer:” “I am your poison and remedy/Why don’t get you come and get some,” Friday sings, positioning herself as both her lover’s source of life and cause of death. It also works the other way around; on “Tear the Veil,” she sings: “I love everything that seeks to destroy me.” Death Drive also captures the grotesqueness of human bodies, both alive and dead. The beat of “Good and Evil” is built off the sound of a man panting for breath, highlighting the animalistic noises humans make at the height of desire or terror. Meanwhile, “Neight Fictive,” an eerie blues song where Friday sings of killing her own infant, features an instrumental made up of horrifying sounds like the squelch of wet meat, buzzing flies, and the clanking of chains. They serve to illustrate the truly terrifying nature of the narrative, which Friday outlines with a disturbingly sweet coo. As this homicidal mother figure, she continues to present femininity through the most cutthroat and ruthless lens possible. After all, it was a woman, not a man, who thought of the “death instinct” in the first place.","The Vancouver-based producer/vocalist is a merciless industrial-rap experimentalist obsessed with the point where sex and death intertwine.

So Much Fun,Young Thug,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d56cd92ffa2be0009947456/1:1/w_160/YoungThug_SoMuchFun.jpg,2019-08-21 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/young-thug-so-much-fun/,300Atlantic,"Before he turned 25, Young Thug had already reshaped the way we looked at rappers and birthed an entire subgenre in his wake. Between 2014 and 2016, the Atlanta-born space alien released the premier collaborative album of the 2010s, the rare trilogy that wasn’t a disappointment, and his opus, Barter 6. So what would come after his first quarter-century? Young Thug didn’t know. First, he tried to get weirder—a nearly impossible feat after he slipped into the mainstream with 2013’s deranged and innovative 1017 Thug—flipping himself into a country singer on 2017’s Beautiful Thugger Girls. Then, he successfully parlayed his talents into the pop world by laying down vocals for Camila Cabello and Post Malone. BTG set the acoustic-tinged blueprint for his apprentices Lil Baby and Gunna, and the pop songs broadened his visibility. But still, Thug never needed to throw on a cowboy hat or aim his music at the masses—his coos and ad-libs over the trap snare and 808-heavy sound of Atlanta were more than enough. Thug just needed to be himself, and that’s exactly what we got with his latest project, So Much Fun. Young Thug rarely leaves his comfort zone, but he’s able to add a melody, a flashy ad-lib, or a new flow that keeps the sound fresh and pushing toward new ground. He develops a natural connection with Pi’erre Bourne throughout the project, as the super-producer gifts Thug four beats that sound like he locked himself away in a submarine specifically to lace Thug with something futuristic and beachy to talk his shit over. “Surf” immediately jumps out: We get Thug screeches, sass, and some of his best ad-libs in recent memory (“Totally dude”). “I’m Scared” is just as good, with Thug and 21 Savage bonding over their mutual love of terror. “Lethal weapon, let it rip from out the top of the drop to his scalp,” says Thug, in the same tone as he talks about his favorite pair of custom Nikes. On the album, Thug takes some time to pat himself on the back, aware of his own widespread influence. With guests on most songs, each of his Atlanta rap sons get some swings in, but Thug makes sure to show them they’ve still got a ways to go. On “Hot,” he educates Gunna on how to expertly flex one’s jewelry over triumphant Wheezy-produced horns. His most accomplished pupil, Lil Baby, makes him proud on “Bad Bad Bad,” as his unrelatable boasts about real estate and foreign whips are on par with Thug. Lil Keed is still in the midst of being groomed, but the two share a connection in their vocal similarities, trading helium-pitched deliveries on “Big Tipper.” Even when Thug dips outside of his immediate circle of influence, he’s just as comfortable, clearing the runway for Nav to list off his favorite pairs of Gucci tube socks and getting caught in a battle with Lil Uzi Vert about who wears the tightest pair of jeans. (It ends in a draw.) But despite all the collaborations on So Much Fun, the album is about Young Thug. He might not mystify as he did in the early stages of his career, when he was stumbling into new flows and deliveries at an inhuman pace, but now he’s able to wield the madness with ease, satisfying in many modes. He’s got the single aimed for the Billboard charts with the J. Cole and Travis Scott assisted “The London,” as well as the hard-nosed Southside-produced Atlanta street hit, “Pussy.” And then, there’s a song like “Light It Up” that has the bizarre ad-libs and sudden melodic outbursts. At the core, he’s rapping as good as anyone, like he always has. After years of rappers trying to be the next Young Thug, there’s still only one.","Featuring several of his acolytes, So Much Fun remains a triumphant showcase for the iconoclastic Young Thug and one of his best albums to date.

Thrashing Thru the Passion,The Hold Steady,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d4878c804c06a00092f65e1/1:1/w_160/HoldSteady_ThrashingThruThePassion.jpg,2019-08-21 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-hold-steady-thrashing-thru-the-passion/,Frenchkiss,"At this point, new Hold Steady albums can no longer be taken for granted. After a proud run of six albums in 10 years, the one-time Brooklyn workhorses have settled into a more leisurely, part-time rhythm. Age has cut down their time on the road; they now prefer weekend residencies to touring (“More of our time together is spent playing and performing music than setting up and taking down gear, driving it to the next place, setting it up again,” they wrote in a Bandcamp post, sounding like parents newly aware of how precious their time is.) And as either a symptom or a cause of the band’s reduced availability, frontman Craig Finn has been dedicating more time than ever to his solo career. His latest effort, I Need a New War, dropped just this spring. So Thrashing Thru the Passion is the first Hold Steady album in more than five years, which would have been cause for more ceremony if the band hadn’t deflated expectations by releasing most of it in advance. Half the songs on the album were released as digital singles over the last few years; a couple of others were shared after the LP was announced. The result is a new Hold Steady album that, at least for the band’s most dedicated fans, won’t feel very new. And yet, despite coming from a band that seems to be winding down in many ways, Thrashing Thru The Passion is so alive and elated that, if not for Hold Steady’s well-documented track record, it could be mistaken for the work of a band just hitting its peak. It’s as joyous and rousing as the band’s best efforts, but also looser and utterly unforced. Unceasingly uplifting, it makes almost no effort to shake up the group’s usual triumph rock, yet short of a completely unexpected reinvention or some left-field new muse, it’s a best-case scenario for what a seventh Hold Steady record could have sounded like. Passion is the band’s first LP with keyboardist Franz Nicolay since 2008’s Stay Positive, which could account for some of the renewed pep. But a just as likely explanation is the band’s relative absence. The Hold Steady’s act demands too much commitment and perspiration for them to keep cranking out full-length shots of it every 18 months without diminishing returns. And especially after the time away, it’s a treat being submerged in Finn’s snapshots of rock’n’roll’s underachieving outsiders once again. “Denver Haircut” introduces a guy who, even at new restaurants, always orders the usual just to see what they’ll bring him. On “Star 18,” it’s a dude who claims he used to play with Peter Tosh, but never mentions it again once Finn says, “Man, I don't believe you.” That track also includes one of Finn’s great state-of-the-band nuggets: “Hold Steady at the Comfort Inn/Mick Jagger’s at The Mandarin.” Rest assured there are gems among the few unreleased tracks, too. “Blackout Sam,” with its Memphis horns, is the band’s take on Pleased to Meet Me-era Replacements, or the song equivalent of Lou Reed reassuringly drawing out the word “alright.” Those same horns drive “Traditional Village” to Blues Brothers revue-levels of razzle while Finn spitballs low-brow music theory: “Down at the rock’n’roll station they’re exhuming the bones/Maybe death’s just when you hang up the telephone? And the reason these people still listen to Zeppelin is it sounds really cool when you’re stoned.” As always, Finn’s vision of rock’n’roll is at once an utterly unglamorous and completely romantic. The Hold Steady treat rock the way Penn & Teller treat magic: They deconstruct it, demystify it and expose it warts and all, but do so out of love and a belief that its behind-the-scenes machinations are every bit as beautiful and intriguing as the polished final product. Fifteen years after their debut, the Hold Steady are still passionately making the case that, while there may not be much dignity in rock’n’roll, that doesn’t make it any less noble of a pursuit.

"Control the Streets, Volume 2",Various Artists,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d485fb37ed29000096e4642/1:1/w_160/qualitycontrol_va.jpg,2019-08-21 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-control-the-streets-volume-2/,Quality Control,"Quality Control, the label that brought us Migos, Lil Yachty, City Girls, and Lil Baby, is looking to reassert its authority. A lot has happened since they dropped the first Control the Streets in 2017. That was the year Culture swept America and Yachty became a brand. On Vol. 1, the title seemed like a commandment: The label was planting its flag and asserting its dominance. With Vol. 2, it sounds more like an attempt at crowd control, like trying to wrangle a disinterested mob. It doesn’t help that Quality Control’s once-promising roster has mostly scattered to the winds. After following up their biggest-ever album with a bloated, underwritten snoozer, Migos split for three bad-to-mediocre solo albums between October of last year and February of this one. Lil Yachty was brainwashed by the Funk Flexes of the world into abandoning melody and joining the cypher. The wave that City Girls were riding in the aftermath of Drake’s massive hit “In My Feelings” died down; one member is currently serving a two-year sentence for credit card fraud and the other has come under fire for homophobia. The label’s brightest remaining prospect, Lil Baby, is still trying to prove he doesn’t sound like a one-dimensional Young Thug clone. As a result, the sequel has the reek of desperation. Migos are trapped in a loop: They keep doing and saying the same things, recycling their flows, winding up in the same situations. “Everybody know that I’m trappin’/Everybody know that I’m gettin’ it,” Quavo raps on “Stripper Bowl,” and that’s the problem. Yachty raps exclusively about getting blowjobs and how broke his haters are. Which is fine, but does he have to sound so lifeless? Everyone on the roster suffers the same problem; their raps are completely unimaginative. The Migos party trick of constantly rearranging their flows is no longer an effective diversion. The most colorful performances are delivered by outsiders: Megan Thee Stallion takes City Girls’ finesse rap to the next level on “Pastor,” comparing the money she squeezes out of her suitors to paying tithes. Tee Grizzley, with the home court advantage (on a Helluva beat that sounds absolutely Detroit), dunks on Yachty again in a rematch. On the “Intro,” Gucci Mane outshines the four QC stars, claiming he signed Hoodrich Pablo Juan just because he had designer drugs. DaBaby and Gunna take turns showing Offset up; Young Thug is like a peacock amid pigeons. But of course, on an all-star project spanning 36 tracks, something or other is bound to work. It’s largely well-produced, thanks to an assemblance of elite talent, including Metro Boomin, Southside, Pi’erre Bourne. Murda Beatz, Wheezy, Mustard, Tay Keith, and many others. There are a couple of good performances here and there, but no choice cuts, just songs left on the cutting room floor during sessions for recent solo albums and filler tracks from lower-ranking artists on the QC roster. The longer the comp goes on, the more obvious it becomes that nothing is happening.","The Atlanta label home to Migos and Lil Yachty overstuffs their new compilation with lackluster raps from stars who seem to be stuck in a loop.

Love’s Last Chance,Taylor McFerrin,by: Phillip Mlynar,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d56cf16652fbc0009b08104/1:1/w_160/TaylorMcFerrin_LovesLastChance.jpg,2019-08-21 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/taylor-mcferrin-loves-last-chance/,AWAL,"Taylor McFerrin released his 2014 debut, Early Riser, on Flying Lotus’ Brainfeeder label. Channeling McFerrin’s jazz chops through a spacey, synth-heavy lens, Early Riser fit snugly into the forward-thinking Brainfeeder vault. But its reliance on guest singers—including McFerrin’s father, the gifted improv vocalist Bobby McFerrin—made the album feel more like a collage of influences than the arrival of a sharply defined new voice. Five years on, McFerrin’s second album redresses that issue: The Los Angeles-based producer and composer adds singing to his repertoire, and emotes nostalgic feelings over self-produced backdrops with the detectable  influence of late-’80s UK soul. Love’s Last Chance intends to establish McFerrin’s talents as a lyricist, rather than simply a production foil for other vocalists. The album’s vintage synthesizers bring a warm quality to the songs, complimenting McFerrin’s romantic lyrics. Lush string samples on instrumental opener “Her Entrance,” played by composer Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, roll into the wistful “All I See Is You,” where McFerrin’s steady but funky drum programming brings to mind the sultry snap of ’80s British R&B troupe Loose Ends. The song retells a familiar scene: Two people in separate relationships catch one another’s desirous eye. The glance prompts McFerrin to muse, “Either you’ll be love or trouble.” McFerrin frames songs around such tiny moments, restraining his language to avoid overcomplicating his sentiments. Like a dusty box of photos or an abandoned social media account, Love’s Last Chance collects snapshots of past romances. On “Memory Digital,” a stuttering bass-powered track shot through with slivers of Fender Rhodes, McFerrin marks the end of a tryst in thoroughly modern fashion: “All that I have left of you are pictures on my phone.” The vintage sound of the production beds his words in fuzzy texture, at times conveying the same moodiness as Dev Hynes’ Blood Orange. The sumptuous production peaks in the album’s first half, where gently pulsing bass lines and mid-tempo drum patterns create a seamless groove. But the sepia tint begins to fade in the home stretch. With flute by Elena Pinderhughes and a samba-inspired rhythm, the perky instrumental “As You Are” abruptly breaks the seductive atmosphere. It’s followed by “I Can’t Give Your Time Back,” a melodramatic ballad infused with sullen electric bass and guitar. But when McFerrin trills, “You should leave me, baby, before I leave you,” the threat sounds toothless and whiny. After that, the would-be redemption of closer “So Cold in the Summer” feels hard to believe. The uneven second half of Love’s Last Chance fails to match the charms of the first. But by trimming the guest list and writing lyrics inspired by personal experience, McFerrin has found a clearer sense of purpose. Having the confidence to vocalize his own feelings suits him well. It isn’t quite a complete realization of his songwriting voice—McFerrin is more convincing when he’s introducing standalone scenarios than attempting to draw fulfilling conclusions—but on Love’s Last Chance, he sounds comfortable as the main attraction.","The Los Angeles-based producer and composer adds singing to his repertoire, setting snapshots of past romances against warm, nostalgic production.

The Center Won’t Hold,Sleater-Kinney,by: Caryn Rose,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d406e2387626200084cdbe7/1:1/w_160/sleaterkinney_thecenter.jpg,2019-08-20 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sleater-kinney-the-center-wont-hold/,Mom + Pop,"The Center Won’t Hold, Sleater-Kinney’s ninth album, is about ambition, desire, and fear. Their alliance with St. Vincent has resulted in sleek, streamlined, capital-P Production that stands out from the unadorned directness of the rest of their catalog. But it is bold and loud in the same way we expect from Sleater-Kinney; the tight economies of their previous work are still present, just manifesting themselves differently. The lyrics, too, remain direct and immediate, yet elegant and precise. None of these are new descriptors for Sleater-Kinney. The three women who recorded this album are products of modern society, and they know the rules: Women aren’t allowed to age in public. They’re supposed to camouflage their bodies; they aren’t supposed to still want anything, whether intellectual, artistic, or carnal. All of those hungers are present on The Center Won’t Hold. The title track opens the record, a statement of intent that segues from distorted industrial to electrical mayhem. The songs on The Center Won’t Hold are about the here and now and how Sleater-Kinney see themselves within it, so it is sad and sardonic, but not mournful. The daily conditions that torment us are described and shared, without conclusion: “Sell our rage, buy and trade/But we still cry for free every day,” sings Corin Tucker in “Can I Go On?” The quasi-robotic dirge “The Future Is Here” opens with, “I start my day on a tiny screen,” before keening: “Never have I felt so goddamned lost and alone.” It isn’t inspiring, but there is something intensely comforting in these public admissions. The album is political the way the band’s very existence is political, with references both direct and oblique. “She stood up for us/When she testified,” from closer “Broken,” is a reference to Christine Blasey Ford. But it’s an earlier lyric that’s closer to bone: “I really can’t fall apart right now/I really can’t touch that place.” The high tension from the first note of “Bad Dance” feels like the danse macabre portrayed in the lyrics: “If the world is ending now/Then let’s dance,” Carrie Brownstein purrs, ending the hoedown with the line that best sums up the record’s pulsing undercurrent: “And if we’re all going down in flames/Then let’s scream the bloody scream/We’ve been rehearsing our whole lives.” Women who say these words share a solidarity. There are also bonafide hits on this record, melodies that Velcro themselves to your brain. The aforementioned “The Future Is Here” bubbles seductively, na na na na na choruses and all. “Hurry on Home,” the first single, finds Brownstein channeling the vocal tone and affirmative attitude of the B-52’s’ Kate Pierson. With a silky chorus to smooth everything out, it’s a deliberately sexy foil to the opening track. “LOVE,” a breathless celebration of the band’s history—“Call the doctor, dig me out of this mess”—falls into the grand tradition of songs about being in a band, alongside the Who’s “Long Live Rock,” Creedence Clearwater Revival’s “Travelin’ Band,” or the Ramones’ “Danny Says.” You can imagine the anarchist cheerleaders from the “Smells Like Teen Spirit” video chanting, “We can be young/We can be old/As long as we have/Each other to hold.” Even if tracks like “Can I Go On” or “RUINS” don’t manifest themselves as solidly as some of the others, they’re still interesting, well-constructed, complete thoughts. The Center Won’t Hold is a Sleater-Kinney record not only because their name is on the cover, but because all of the elements you first fell in love with are still here: brutal and unyielding lyrics, Tucker’s superhuman vocals, the solar flares that emit from Brownstein’s guitar, the way Janet Weiss’ authority shapes both the beats and the space between them. Weiss’ statement that she was leaving the band came just days after this album was formally announced; her departure is unfortunate, not just because it is the end of a chapter, but because we won’t get the chance to see the musicians who recorded these songs work them out in public. The challenge of contextualizing The Center Won’t Hold is that there isn’t much to compare it to. There are no other all-women musical groups of Sleater-Kinney’s longevity, stature, and influence. It matters that there are women in their 40s and 50s singing about the radical topic of… being women in their 40s and 50s, because they have few peers in their realm. It’s impossible to talk about this album without invoking the enormous line that ends “LOVE”: “There’s nothing more frightening and nothin’ more obscene/Than a well-worn body demanding to be seen/Fuck!” It’s no accident that Sleater-Kinney deliver this message within a song that will make you want to pogo around the living room, or that Brownstein’s bare butt adorns the cover of the first single. The personal is political, always.

Black Moses EP,Channel Tres,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d5192bd8bbc27000a66bf3e/1:1/w_160/channeltres_blackmoses.jpg,2019-08-20 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/channel-tres-black-moses-ep/,Godmode,"Channel Tres emerged in 2017 with the single “Controller,” an effortless slice of hip-house that sounded like Dâm-Funk mixed with Todd Terje and infused with the swaggering bodaciousness of West Coast rap. The five songs on his self-titled EP extolled the virtues of life’s simplest pleasures—driving with the top down, drinking Hennessey, and stealing your girl—with ounces of bounce to spare. Lyrically, Channel Tres often shares less with the G-funk of his native South Central, a regular sonic reference point in his instrumentals, and more with the gleefully vulgar, verging-on-pornographic tracks of Detroit ghettotech producers like DJ Assault. Channel Tres’ second EP adopts an almost identical structure to his first. Both are five tracks in length, and each opens with dreamy, warbly intros just over a minute long. As on his debut, the order of the day here is the scintillating blend of hip-house that Godmode, also home to Yaeji, has come to specialize in. Though Channel Tres’ most obvious reference points are Moodymann and Galcher Lustwerk, the twinkling flutes, rumbling congas, and clean bass guitar on a song like “Brilliant Nigga” echo house classics like Larry Heard’s “And So I Dance” or Deep Aural Penetration’s “Into the Kick With Tito,” while the whining synths and regional roll call on “Sexy Black Timberlake” recall Channel Tres’ roots in California funk. Channel Tres comes from the Lil B school of songwriting; comparisons to various celebrities abound. “Sexy Black Timberlake” assumes the mantle of Justin Timberlake; on “Raw Power,” a bit of performative shirtlessness makes him feel like Iggy Pop on the cover of (you guessed it) Raw Power. The EP’s title inevitably invokes the soulful aura of Isaac Hayes. Even when he insists it “ain’t about me,” Channel Tres’ subject is pretty much always himself. Like his production style, Channel Tres’ voice is heavy on the low end, clinging to the gruffer side of his register.  His strength is timbre, not technical flow, and he’s much more adept as a tour guide to a dubby soundscape than eyewitness to events. On Channel Tres, that quality oozed charisma; here, it just sounds like a little too much cough syrup. The limits of his languid flow are most apparent on “Black Moses,” which features a welcome interruption from JPEGMAFIA. Hostile and high-pitched, JPEG’s delivery has a dangerous energy that can’t be captured in a bottle. Channel Tres sounds over-the-counter by comparison. Black Moses isn’t a tremendous step forward for Channel Tres, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing for an artist who emerged almost out of nowhere two years ago and still hasn’t released a full-length album. But it’s beginning to look like he is being underserved by his chosen format. Though part of the appeal of Channel Tres’ music is his ability to distill the feeling of a deep groove into a pop-sized package, some of his rhythms demand more than just a few minites on the dancefloor. These songs all yearn for an extended remix by Kerri Chandler or Masters at Work—maybe it’s time to stop echoing Moodymann and start cutting him a check.","Pairing Midwestern hip-house with Los Angeles G-funk, the South Central native emphasizes subtly bumping grooves and gruff, hypnotic rhymes.

UFO,Nick Catchdubs,by: Phillip Mlynar,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d56c07cce21490008e1c092/1:1/w_160/catchdubs_UFO.jpg,2019-08-20 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nick-catchdubs-ufo/,Fool’s Gold,"Fool’s Gold Records has forged its reputation on an ability to connect distant corners of the hip-hop and dance worlds. The brainchild of A-Trak and Nick Catchdubs, the Brooklyn-based indie boasts a discography that gleefully places New York City house icon Todd Terry next to Danny Brown’s charismatically caterwauled rap theatrics, and successfully follows Kid Sister’s spunky hip-house revival moves with Kid Cudi’s lilting sing-song delivery. It’s a DJ-focused mentality that spotlights common ground between artists rather than segregating sounds. Catchdubs’ latest addition to the Fool’s Gold vault runs with a space-age theme that promises interplanetary genre-hopping kicks and nods to the usual mix of influences associated with his label. But beyond a smattering of standout cuts, there’s a frustrating feeling that half the passenger list didn’t make it on board before takeoff. Early on, MC Nasty Nigel from New York City rap troupe World’s Fair blesses “Ecstasy Hot Line.” The pairing smartly captures the Fool’s Gold ethos: Though the group originally broke through with an update of indie rap icons Company Flow’s “8 Steps to Perfection,” World’s Fair’s last album featured a drum’n’bass-infused track (“Elvis’ Flowers”) that paid homage to DJ nights they hosted at now-shuttered venue Elvis Guesthouse. Catchdubs serves up nuanced production for Nigel, who floats over lush waves of woozy synths and casts himself as both “the third Chemical Brother” and “a baby from the ’90s—I still blame it all on Rudy, bro.” The production teases that it’s about to erupt at various points, but Catchdubs keeps the sonic backdrop low key, allowing Nigel’s voice and punchlines to provide the thrills. “Pick Up Yaself” conveys similar synergy by virtue of an amped-up vocal hook by Metric Man from dancehall duo Fire Alarm. The song triggers energetic rave synths reminiscent of a ’90s Dreamscape party, but it’s always the arrival of the gruff vocal refrain that provides the intense highs. Elsewhere on UFO, outings featuring FATHERDUDE and former Rapture singer Mattie Safer, plus Mr. Muthafuckin’ eXquire, provide an equally heady buzz. But navigating to these highlights involves traversing through a gamut of instrumental tracks that sap the album’s momentum, making for a stony journey. There’s a hollowness about these instrumentals, which comprise the majority of the project, that makes them feel more like interludes or beat sketches than fully formed songs. They seem not so much stripped down as missing something; it’s a feeling magnified when sequenced after songs starring the compelling guest voices. Tellingly, when the rare use of a vocal sample kicks in on “UFO Style,” the spark returns. The phrase “I’m higher than a UFO” is cut up over production that’s an evocative mix of futuristic and eerie. It brings to mind ’80s electro workouts from the Knights of the Turntables and the Willesden Dodgers; the addition of vocals adds just the right amount of texture, giving the listener something to latch on to. But then it’s gone, and the album ambles back into more ambient drift with final tracks “Eyeball” and “Arp Flex.” UFO starts out promising bright cosmic thrills, but a fuller supporting crew might have helped to commandeer the vessel to more exciting outposts.","In accordance with his label’s ethos, the Fool’s Gold co-founder connects the dots between the hip-hop and dance worlds on a space-themed record that bounces from rap to rave to electro.

Inflorescent,Friendly Fires,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d40a9204d79750009bdf2b5/1:1/w_160/friendlyfires_inflorescent.jpg,2019-08-20 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/friendly-fires-inflorescent/,CasablancaPolydor,"Friendly Fires debuted in 2008, in the long shadow of Bloc Party’s Silent Alarm and the shorter shade of the “Gossip Girl” soundtrack. They went on hiatus just three years later, exiting at precisely the moment when the band’s hazy blend of disco and effervescent funk was primed for a mainstream takeover (Walk the Moon, Mike Posner). They’ve spent the years since 2011’s Pala collaborating with a litany of pop producers who lean into the band’s more electronic tendencies—Disclosure, FaltyDL, Dusky. Inflorescent, then, is a bit of an inversion for the band: Rather than live-sounding danceable post-punk, they’ve found a new home in the smooth digital surfaces of house music. The shift towards synths and strings doesn’t exactly come as a surprise—their last album was filled with drum machines and reverb-washed pianos to counterbalance every gritty bassline. And though frontman Ed Macfarlane has also tossed out the idea of a Friendly Fires piano house album, Inflorescent feels more indebted to French filter disco, from the syncopated loops that kick off the Disclosure-assisted “Heaven Let Me In” to the oscillating Bowie-esque guitars that open “Can’t Wait Forever.” Perhaps because so much time has passed, it feels like a seamless progression; they sound lighter and more fleet-footed, and no less diverse than before. “Silhouettes,” with its “ba-ba-ba” refrain to its laser-like synths, recalls the ebullient jazz of Todd Terje, while “Lack of Love” evokes the chill of Balearic house. Nothing sounds unnatural, or too far from the band’s previous work, but the pretense of “rock” is out of the picture. It can sometimes seem as though Friendly Fires are playing catch up for a post-EDM scene that largely sprung up in their absence. The cooing vocals and build-up/drop patterns grow a little tiring across the album despite their careful production, because they’re working in well-trodden territory in a post-Flume landscape. But there is a winning warmth to their music. Perhaps this is due to their dismal environs—“We need to have a miserable view to feel like we want to transport ourselves somewhere else,” Macfarlane recently said, contrasting the airiness of their music with their rainy hometown of St. Albans. Only someone who desperately wants to escape can make a fantasy sound this alluring, after all. And in the dog days of August, a cool jet of European house offers a welcome respite.","The UK trio’s first album since 2011 finds new life in the smooth surfaces of house music.

Red,Taylor Swift,by: Brad Nelson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3735caa82ddc000869a630/1:1/w_160/TaylorSwift_Red.jpg,2019-08-19 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/taylor-swift-red/,Big Machine,"In early 2012, Taylor Swift turned in 20 songs to her label for what would become her fourth album, Red. They were all further outgrowths of the pop-country sound she had mastered in her early years, as a teenager finding her voice in the Nashville scene, trying on songs like “Tim McGraw” to reflect the starlight over Georgia and the allure and disappointment of romantic love through a lens that was unmistakably hers. As she amassed a body of work for Red, she was still writing songs about love and its fugitive presence, songs about relationships that swelled like an obsessive thought, songs that picked up and enhanced the smallest pixels of intimate detail as if they were scanning security footage in a crime procedural. When she strummed a chord, it shimmered and just hung there. It sounded like Swift, an organic progression from her previous records. Looking at the albums that followed Red, it’s obvious Swift longed for the inorganic, to send her songs through the distortions of modern pop and see what kind of genetically-scrambled horror would come back. You can hear it immediately in the first song she wrote in collaboration with pop gurus Max Martin and Shellback, “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together”—a mutation is happening. A chord thrums from an acoustic guitar which then turns inside out as it plays, as if caught in the neck of a vacuum. It didn’t sound like the old Taylor Swift, the one who wrote 20 new Taylor Swift songs for a new Taylor Swift album. It sounded like a new version of her, being fitfully born. Swift was trying to push her music outside of its traditional boundaries, to stray into the interzone between pop and country. Pop was just beginning to mingle its DNA with EDM; dubstep, a once varied and relatively new branch of dance music, had been reduced to the stomach-flip of the drop just as its popularity in America crested. Martin and Shellback were aware of these shifts in pop’s geography; they incorporated many of them into Femme Fatale, the Britney Spears album from the previous year. One of the other Swift/Martin/Shellback collaborations on Red, “I Knew You Were Trouble,” starts as a pop-rock song but its edges mimic the queasy wobble of dubstep. Synths scream behind Swift’s voice like mechanical saws. It was as if she had finally found a musical backdrop sharp as her lyrics—the lakes and backroads of Tennessee and Georgia disappear, replaced with formations of jagged crystal, a perfect environment for a song about falling in love with someone you know will hurt you and leave you feeling empty as a canyon. Red is an album of disappearances, of things that have gone or are just about to go missing—lost relationships, old sounds, previous Taylor Swifts, each photographed just as they’re receding out of frame. Even on the album cover, Swift is partially disappeared, her downcast eyes swallowed by a lip of shadow falling from a wide-brimmed hat. It’s her somewhat obvious way of referencing the front cover of Joni Mitchell’s 1971 album Blue, where a photograph of Mitchell’s face is submerged a blue-black lake of shadow. Red is also the first record where Swift directly echoes Mitchell’s writing, a once potential and hazy inspiration now coming into view. In a counterpoint to the musical wanderlust on display, there’s a newfound patience to Swift’s observations, a knowledge that narratives form out of brokenness and frustrated communication more often than they do out of ease or any emotional clarity. Many of Swift’s earlier, fantasy-driven songs, like “Love Story” and “Mine,” end neatly; both resolved with marriage. But real stories have a way of ending in places uneasy and uncertain, and what seemed to be the most enduring relationships splinter off into loose ends and glass shards. Swift knew this; she described Red in Billboard as being about “all the different ways that you have to say goodbye to someone... Every different kind of missing someone, every kind of loss—it all sounds different to me.” So she sought out different producers and collaborators to give shape to these kinds of missing. She wanted the drum sounds that Jeff Bhasker brought to fun.’s 2012 pop album Some Nights, hushed, cottony throbs that sound cobwebbed over. They bloom beneath the skin of “Holy Ground,” a song where Swift discovers a brief connection so glowing and true that she skips over the end of the relationship because it’s not important: “And I guess we fell apart in the usual way/And the story’s got dust on every page.” “Treacherous,” which she co-wrote with Semisonic’s Dan Wilson, initially sounds like an old Taylor Swift song, but it deepens over time like none of her songs before or since, a masterclass in dynamics from arrangement to lyric. It starts off relatively motionless, frozen in time by all the tension in Swift’s voice, as if by keeping absolutely still she might not fall for the song’s subject. Then the guitars and drums melt into dark, wet echoes like pelting raindrops, as Swift’s focus narrows toward a driveway in the distance: “Two headlights shine through the sleepless night/And I will get you alone.” Even the songs she recorded with Nathan Chapman, the producer of her first three records and the initial 20 songs she turned in for Red, are expanding, sometimes sounding like a bloom of sound from an empty arena. On opener “State of Grace,” guitars chime like sonar, as if trying to measure the diameter of Swift’s feelings: the early blushes of a relationship, when you seem to recognize something in someone else that you’re not certain anyone else has seen. “We are alone/Just you and me/Up in your room and our slates are clean,” she sings, wiring images into a lattice of memory, “Just twin fire signs/Four blue eyes.” If Red holds together at all as it rockets through hybrid genres, it’s in the attentive way Swift dwells on memory and loss and the effect of time on both. In the liner notes, Swift borrows a quote from a Pablo Neruda poem—“Love is so short, forgetting is so long”—and accordingly, the songs on Red stretch to the length of their forgetting. “Sad Beautiful Tragic” sways like a slowcore desert mirage, a Taylor Swift song on the verge of signing to 4AD. “Time is taking its sweet time erasing you,” she sings, while the music simulates that stuttered crawl of days after a breakup, a soft melt of chords that make seconds feel like hours. “Time won’t fly/It’s like I’m paralyzed by it,” Swift sings in “All Too Well,” the centerpiece of Red and potentially her entire career. It might be her own “Tangled Up in Blue”; like Bob Dylan, she sweeps up drifts of time into loosely-chronological piles of images. “There we are again in the middle of the night,” Swift sings, “We dance around the kitchen in the refrigerator light.” The tenderness with which she observes this moment of intimacy makes it come to life; she reanimates a feeling instead of reacting to it, exploring all the howling negative space a person leaves behind when their shadow recedes—the things you talked about, the kinds of attention you gave each other, the arguments you had, the rooms where you held onto each other desperately. A kind of Chekhov’s Scarf that Swift sheds in the first verse reappears in the final verse (“But you keep my old scarf from that very first week/’Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me”) as a metaphor for the continuity of their connection, how feelings persist long after they’ve lost their use. Nothing dies without leaving some trace of itself, she seems to say throughout the length of Red, and in “All Too Well” she becomes one of those traces—“I was there,” she sings in the chorus. “I remember it all too well.” Swift, like anyone, is a hostage to her own experience, but she’s also capable of being a witness to it, able to see a relationship—even as it shrinks further and further away in her vision—for what it was rather than what it couldn’t be.

Speak Now,Taylor Swift,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d373218beb5b10009a980bb/1:1/w_160/TaylorSwift_SpeakNow.jpg,2019-08-19 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/taylor-swift-speak-now/,Big Machine,"After two hit records, Taylor Swift decided that her third would be longer and more personal, and she would write it entirely by herself, no co-writers. The songs would concern major events in her life, many of which occurred in the public eye. The lyrics would take the form of letters, direct addresses, one-on-one conversations where she always got the last word. She wanted to use her newfound wisdom to reflect on her parents, her dreams, and how it felt to stand on stage and notice a bigger crowd every night, shouting the words back at her. The working title was Enchanted, though she didn’t always feel that way. After 2008’s massively successful Fearless, Swift wrestled with her outsider persona and sudden celebrity, and the dissonance weighed heavily on her relationships. But she was learning fast. Swift was 20 when the album, eventually titled Speak Now, came out and sold over a million copies in its first week—a record high in 2010. She had, and would continue to have, bigger hits, but these songs were breakthroughs in their own right. Co-produced by Nathan Chapman, the album is patiently sequenced; the average song length is just under five minutes, giving Swift enough time to pace her hooks—which had never been bigger—and her lyrics, which had never sounded more careful or wise. It’s an album focused on growing up, something she was learning would often be confusing, sad, and uncomfortable. It’s her most unabashedly transitional work: between adolescence and adulthood, innocence and understanding, country and pop. She was at a crossroads, and she was feeling lucky. Swift had already become known for her intimate and intense relationship with fans. On these songs, she took a more authoritative role. There’s “Sparks Fly,” an early song that developed a big reputation after a live acoustic version circulated online. It appears here with all its fireworks and rain-soaked drama, a call to arms for people who’d been following since the beginning. There’s also “Never Grow Up,” a quiet acoustic ballad that draws the clearest line to her old material. Only now, Swift is wistful and sentimental, sounding far older than her years as she urges girls younger than her to savor every moment: “I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone,” she sings softly. It’s a heavy thought for a young songwriter, and the key word is just. As in, this is all happening right now, and if I don’t document it, it may disappear. Here is where Taylor Swift found a lasting source of inspiration: the inevitable rise and fall of life and love, recast as emotional emergency. In the past, she had written sweet, airtight story-songs by turning the characters in her life into archetypes—nice guys, popular girls. Now she was dealing with a more complicated set of characters, so she adjusted her scale accordingly. “Dear John” and “The Story of Us” are likely about the same older musician. One is a crushing six-minute ballad about a famous guitarist emotionally manipulating a teenage songwriter. The other is a comic send-up of the night they ran into each other backstage at an awards show after the romance ended. The magic is how she wrings their hyperspecificity for universal truths—the older musician could be the sophomore jerk from the football team; the CMA Awards could be an after-school assembly. The message was clear: Swift was moving on, but she wasn’t leaving you behind. And while it’s no great revelation that the mechanics of high school don’t end after graduation, Swift was not content to simply reapply old morals to new stories. So many of these songs rely on the tension of hindsight—a perspective she always longed for but never wielded quite so artfully. Hear how regretful and apologetic she sounds in “Back to December,” the increasing desperation in each chorus of “Last Kiss.” Even “Innocent,” her much-anticipated response to Kanye West stealing her mic at the 2009 VMAs, takes a nurturing approach as she guides her tormentor through his old ambitions and career highs, asking how close he is to the man he dreamed of becoming. (After all, she acknowledges, public adoration can be a fickle thing, and one day, it might be her wondering what went wrong.) She affirms in the chorus, “You’re still an innocent.” It’s a strange, writerly phrase that she must realize sounds phonetically identical to “You’re stealing innocence”—a particularly Swiftian way to accuse and forgive in the same breath. On Speak Now, the way things sounded became just as important as what they meant. Swift was honing her skills as a pop songwriter, imagining a future where “country” was a biographical detail as opposed to an accurate descriptor of her music. Her arrangements were louder—an anxious string section tugging its collar through “Haunted,” a harmony-layered coda unfolding at the end of “Enchanted.” “Better Than Revenge” is a pop-punk bloodletting that owes its existence to Paramore, and it foreshadows the work to come: “I Knew You Were Trouble,” “Bad Blood.” Taking aim at a budding actress now dating her ex, it’s fascinating for how wildly Swift changes her perspective while maintaining focus: burning holes in her enemy’s eyes during the verses, pleading to her ex that “she’s not what you think” during each chorus, acknowledging the power and futility of her own response (“She thinks I’m psycho ’cuz I like to rhyme her name with things”). You imagine her singing it, barging into a crowded room while everyone covers their mouth and avoids eye contact. It’s the cathartic freakout during an otherwise elegant party, full of personal revelation. She has a moment of ecstasy in “Mine,” where she and a new love vow to “never make my parents’ mistakes,” which is precisely what you do at your first hint of independence and stability. In “Mean,” she puts her personal life on the backburner to deal with the people antagonizing her professionally. Its lyrics are proud and snappy, as banjos pluck around her like sarcastic bluebirds on her shoulders. “One day I’ll be living in a big ol’ city,” she promises a man who tore her down in reviews. Does it actually hurt a critic to know that the artist will always be more powerful and rich? Probably not, but it’s not really for him anyway—Swift already got what she wanted. In “Ours,” a bonus track as good as any song she’s ever written, she sums it up with a smile that you can hear in her voice: “Don’t you worry your pretty little mind/People throw rocks at things that shine.” She knew she was approaching her supernova phase. The ensuing tour was a blockbuster moment she had been preparing for. The intricate, explosive set design involved a full band, dancers, actors portraying the characters in her songs. There were fireworks, a massive bell she hurled herself at during “Haunted,” and a Shakespearean veranda that soared over the audience during “Love Story.” It was a little ridiculous. But for all the fans in attendance, this was how they always saw her: a superhero borne from their subconscious, someone larger than life and unafraid to look absurd. For the rest of the world, it was Swift’s reintroduction: Drop everything now—I have arrived. It’s the character she’d play for the rest of her career. The concerts would begin with a recitation over the loudspeakers, a piece that also appears in the album’s liner notes. “Real life is a funny thing, you know,” it began. “There is a time for silence. There is a time for waiting your turn. But if you know how you feel, and you so clearly know what you need to say, you’ll know it.” It reads as inspirational but, in retrospect, it was also a warning: Things won’t stay the same forever. Life can be jarring, full of little interruptions. You won’t be prepared for everything. Near the end of the show, Swift introduced a heartland anthem called “Long Live,” tearfully confiding that it was written for all her fans, her whole band, and the team behind her. “It was the end of a decade,” she sings, “But the start of an age.” The young crowd roars, as if in anticipation. This was all ahead of Swift as the album was nearing completion. Late in the process, she was out to lunch with mentor Scott Borchetta—among the first industry people to take notice of her in Nashville, offering a deal with his fledgling label Big Machine. By the end of the decade, he’d be just another on her long list of friends-turned-enemies. But for now, he was a confidant. She played him songs from the new record and discussed her plans for the rollout. She was excited. Borchetta was, too. But the working title didn’t seem right. Enchanted? He thought of princesses, fairytales, childhood. The old Taylor. This seemed different. Maybe she felt miffed by someone second-guessing her vision; maybe she was grateful to be challenged. After all, this music was precisely about these moments when your fantasies no longer apply to reality, when you have to grow up and make a choice and live with it on your own. She excused herself for a moment, and when she returned, she had a better idea.","Today on Pitchfork, we are taking a critical look at the rise of Taylor Swift—from country underdog to pop superstar—with new reviews of her first five records.

Fearless,Taylor Swift,by: Hazel Cills,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d372f8da82ddc000869a62d/1:1/w_160/TaylorSwift_Fearless.jpg,2019-08-19 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/taylor-swift-fearless/,Big Machine,"When Taylor Swift moved to Nashville as a teenager with hopes of becoming a country star, she faced an uphill battle. “Basically, all the record companies went, ‘Ah, how cute. She’s just a little kid,’” Swift said in 2008. “They also said, ‘Give up your dreams. Go home and come back when you're 18.’” “I would feel like they were deleting me from their Blackberrys as I was telling them,” Scott Borchetta, president of her label Big Machine, told The New York Times of the Nashville industry’s reaction to signing Swift. She never wanted her age to be “the headline,” or a number that screamed to writers and producers that she was just a starry-eyed hobbyist making music in her bedroom. On her self-titled debut, Swift established herself as a precocious storyteller who could write love songs vague and ageless enough that anyone might find herself in them, perhaps to prove to Nashville that a teen could do it. Her second album, Fearless, is a rebuke to that approach, with Swift bringing listeners straight to the dreaded football-game bleachers and mean-girl maze of high school. She took her teen self seriously and demanded others do the same, navigating the cloying innocence of a girl who simultaneously experiences relationships like a dog-eared Nicholas Sparks novel and also has the wisdom to know that not all kisses end in a rainstorm. Fearless straddles the line between country and pop, clinging really only to Swift’s faint, faux-country accent which magically materialized at some point between her hometown of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania and Nashville, and a few bits of fiddle and banjo that flicker in and out of the record. “I write as life happens to me,” Swift told Rolling Stone in 2010 and on Fearless it’s clear she’s dead serious; a day before she had to turn the album in, she begged Borchetta to add the track “Forever & Always,” a break-up song inspired by the pop singer Joe Jonas. The songs are diaristic not just in their images of fairytale romance and frustrated heartbreak, but in how Swift writes her lyrics like mini-stories with wordy, narrative structures. On “Love Story,” she rips from the play I’d assume is burned into every average American high-schooler’s brain, Romeo and Juliet, for a tongue-twister of a chorus (“And I said, Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone…”) She sounds almost breathless by its end. She likes to give a play-by-play, stacking minute summaries of a moment on top of each other like she’s story-boarding the perfect montage out of an indelible memory. “And I stare at the phone, he still hasn’t called/And then you feel so low/You can’t feel nothing at all,” she rattles off on “Forever & Always.” Prior to and after Fearless, there was a conversation in the press about whether Swift could actually sing, especially as she was still considered an underdog in a genre where her peers were vocal powerhouses like Carrie Underwood and Miranda Lambert. On “Change,” the album’s blow-out finale, her voice loud and guttural in the mix, she proves the skeptics (or as she would say, haters) wrong. But Swift’s talky-delivery and conversational songwriting style—a mixture of personal intimacy and outright fantasy—sounds original and deliberate. With their dramatic arcs and plot twists, these songs often sound like Swift is quite literally speaking as she would to her subject, high off the adrenaline rush of a blindsiding breakup or meeting her new Prince Charming. “When I sit down and write a song, the only person that I'm thinking about in that room is the person that I'm writing the song about,” Swift told Marie Claire in 2009. “And what I want them to know and what I wish I could tell them to their face, but I'm going to say it in a song instead.” She serves straight Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul with “Fifteen,” half guardian angel and half alarming guidance counselor to high school freshmen everywhere, reminding them there’s so much they don’t know yet, and name-checking her real-life best friend Abigail. At times, the extreme specificity can feel like a misstep, with the album suddenly taking on the dated air of a copy of Swift’s yearbook we’re somehow privy to. Such is the case with “Hey Stephen,” a twee, passed-in-class love note of a song that could be a brother to Plain White T’s “Hey There Delilah.” What’s remarkable here is Swift’s earnest sweetness. In the years following, she would become a master at biting songs about exes, from “Dear John” to “We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.” There’s little to none of that vengefully confessional sentiment on Fearless. The closest she gets is when she calls Jonas a “scared little boy,” on “Forever & Always,” but even that insult, so wholesome, is still understandably tepid for a young woman wading through the minefield that is her first series of serious relationships. The best songs come when her writing is wielded with knife-like precision, revealing feelings with each cut rather than glamorizing the teen tropes of hanging by the telephone or yearning for crushes. It’s the fantasies that truly define Fearless; dancing in a storm in your “best dress,” a love that feels like a roller-coaster. While the teen pop stars of the early-aughts like Christina Aguilera or Britney Spears had their highly erotic, sensational hits written by Swedish pop masterminds, there was something novel about Swift being a teenager and writing about her reality in her own terms coming into that same mainstream space, redefining what “teen pop” could sound like in the process. But despite the fact that Swift was drawing from her real life on Fearless, the album speaks less to the actual reality of a teen girl than to a teen girl’s imaginative desires, desires which, for Swift, are remarkably pure. In 2008, teen pop culture was bending to influences of chastity. Swift’s Disney peers like Miley Cyrus and the Jonas Brothers helped popularize purity rings and one of the biggest YA series and its movie adaptation, Twilight, implicitly preached the virginal values of its Mormon creator. “Love Story,” which culminates in being told to pick out a “white dress” for a wedding, or “Fifteen,” which mourns the fact that her friend Abigail gave “everything she had to a boy,” hit hard with this same audience. Their clean, plucky country-lite production cut through the colorful pop of artists like Lady Gaga and Beyoncé on the radio. As much as Swift was hailed for her ownership over her own image and voice, what she was serving to teen girls was still squeaky clean and parent-approved. On Fearless, Swift also cultivated an underdog, misunderstood voice with songs like “You Belong With Me” and “The Best Day” that would, surprisingly, continue to haunt her music well into adulthood. “They don't like what I stand for,” Swift said of her classmates in 2008. “They don't like somebody who stands for being sober, who stands for anything happy.” Even the clunky refrain of “You Belong With Me” (“She wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts/She’s cheer captain, and I’m on the bleachers”) became ripe for parody in later years, a testament to how meaningless any of those signifiers are now. Yet the simplicity of that refrain was the clearest window into Swift’s potential as a mainstream pop songwriter. The explicit modesty of these songs may be fixed in 2008, but the songs nonetheless stick with you; Swift’s great remake of “Love Story” in slick 1989-era production is proof of its timelessness. Fearless remains not only Swift’s best-selling album, but her breakthrough into the pop charts, a world which would soon become her permanent home (or a permanent cage, depending on how you respond to her recent material). It was also the last time Swift was simply seen as an artist restless with promise and lived-in inspiration who was deemed a “savant” and a “prodigy” by critics before being saddled with the mark of a tabloid celebrity as well. No moment solidified this more than when Swift was called to the 2009 VMAs stage to accept the “Best Female Video” award for “You Belong With Me,” beating Beyoncé and prompting Kanye West to storm the stage and proclaim Beyoncé’s video better. “I like the lyrics about being a cheerleader and she’s in the bleachers!” West wrote later in an apology. In Fearless, Swift captures and bottles a girlish sense of romantic excitement and suburban anguish that is all too fleeting, before real adulthood and the depths of the world’s cruelty actually hit her. For the rest of her career, she would uncork this nostalgia like champagne and pour it over her pop mega-hits. “This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town,” she sings, as if to remind herself that she’s still just the teen girl next door, a country singer with dreams of a bigger stage. In that all too brief moment, she was right.","Today on Pitchfork, we are taking a critical look at the rise of Taylor Swift—from country underdog to pop superstar—with new reviews of her first five records.

1989,Taylor Swift,by: Vrinda Jagota,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d37398bc4d4cb0009c58e8e/1:1/w_160/TaylorSwift_1989.jpg,2019-08-19 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/taylor-swift-1989/,Big Machine,"If there’s one thing Taylor Swift wants you to know about her, it is that she once felt deeply uncool. Even as a superstar with best-selling albums, stadium tours, and high-profile friends, she said in 2014 that she had never felt “edgy, cool, or sexy.” Her first four albums hinge on that feeling, full of vivid, sprawling documents of failed romances that left her gasping for air, wondering how to be someone her lovers would miss. She was almost always the one who was in pain, the outsider, the underdog. That changed with 1989. Its predecessor, Red, was the pinnacle of diaristic specificity, an album that blew up the tiny intimate details of her romances into public eulogies. The media surrounding that album critiqued Swift as clingy, boy-obsessed, and vindictive. 1989 is in part Swift’s response to the negative, often sexist, press she’d received. On the album, Swift loses her naïveté, dons a sense of unfazed nonchalance, and learns to navigate a world that underappreciated her lyricism and shamed her for dating too many men. She has said that she would work in marketing if she didn’t work in music but, really, she has already been doing both simultaneously and spectacularly. For those who might openly cry while listening to Red, the first listen of 1989 stings of indifference. The album, named after the year she was born, treats heartbreak as if observing a painting on a wall, rather than a feeling she desperately needs to articulate. Grandiose memories of 2 a.m. fights and dancing in refrigerator light are replaced with glossy odes to big cities and weekend flings. Where liner notes of previous albums offered hyper-specific hints about each song’s subject, these tell the story of a generic on-again off-again romance. At the time, Swift temporarily disavowed dating to instead celebrate the power of female friendship and flaunt her celebrity “girl squad” with extravagant 4th of July parties and a different guest appearance every night of her tour. Yet 1989 is the album that feels least like spending quality time with your best friends. Still, there’s an allure to 1989’s escapism. Now the dramas of Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet (Fearless’ “Love Story”) or 1945 Americana (Red’s “Starlight”) come with lower stakes; her new fantasy world allows for broken hearts to be stored away safely in a drawer. The polished, propulsive synth-pop of album highlight “Style” showcases it best, with lyrics that celebrate a lustful relationship between people whose most revealing traits are that they would look good together on a movie poster. Is it about a real experience, or is it fiction? “Blank Space” weaponizes Swift’s newfound romantic skepticism: In the accompanying music video, an aristocratic romance deteriorates catastrophically, poisoned by her jealousy and need to control her partner. On Speak Now’s “Dear John,” she’d lamented being added to a lover’s “long list of traitors who don’t understand.” Here, she proudly flaunts her own “long list of ex-lovers” who think she’s crazy, adding the sound of a clicking pen to heighten the gleeful melodrama. She looks at the camera almost as much as she does her lover, warning us that she knows what we think of her and she doesn’t care. Though Swift’s interest in pop was evident on songs like Red’s “I Knew You Were Trouble” and Speak Now’s “Better Than Revenge,” 1989 was the first time an entire Swift album could exist as party music without slow-burning heartache. These were still love songs, so Swift’s familiar themes peak through—dismissal of doubters, pleas to remember a romance favorably after it ends, and heavy use of one of her favorite words, “forever.” Still, the glitzy sound and ethos provided an entry point for new listeners and a chance for old ones to come up for air, to recognize that everything doesn’t always have to be so serious. It can be just as freeing to shrug in the face of heartache as it is to spell out exactly why and how you were hurt. “New Romantics,” a surging, euphoric song from the deluxe version of the album that was released as a final single, does this particularly well. Swift’s voice is processed and couched in thrilling yelps and sighs, crunchy synth, and galloping drums. After a certain amount of pain, sometimes your best defense is to channel the burning energy of your big hopes and desires into a night of uninhibited hedonism. On Speak Now’s “Mean,” Swift told a critic that one day she would be “living in a big ol’ city,” while he’d never be anything but a washed-up hater. On 1989’s opener “Welcome to New York,” she makes good on that promise. She was already famous when she wrote “Mean,” of course, but now she sounded like she was “big enough so you can’t hit me.” The big ol’ city was imaginary; but on 1989, Swift writes and inhabits a fully-realized fantasy of self-reliance, confidence, and ensuing pleasure. Her music was no longer just a diary entry. You can almost hear her winking on every track.

Taylor Swift,Taylor Swift,by: Maura Johnston,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d372e789e99e60008b9e717/1:1/w_160/TaylorSwift_TaylorSwift.jpg,2019-08-19 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/taylor-swift-taylor-swift/,Big Machine,"Taylor Swift’s self-titled 2006 debut arrived at a fortuitous moment for young women in country music, particularly those with crossover ambitions. The beers-and-trucks bro-country grip of Florida Georgia Line and their ilk was a few years away from fully tightening; Carrie Underwood had won the 2005 season of American Idol; and the Dixie Chicks’ defiant “Not Ready to Make Nice” and Sugarland member Jennifer Nettles’ syrupy Bon Jovi duet “Who Says You Can’t Go Home” were making inroads into Top 40 radio (the Chicks’ anti-George W. Bush stance had gotten them kicked out of country rotation). The 16-year-old Swift crash-landed into this landscape with “Tim McGraw,” a saudade-drenched mid-tempo ballad that’s as much a love letter to music’s power as it is to a soon-to-be-ex-boyfriend leaving for college. Swift’s quivering low soprano made the lyrical details—her “little black dress,” the stalled-out Chevy truck, “the moon like a spotlight on the lake”—hit harder, and showcased her ability to make diaristic songs universally relatable. You can track the song’s quiet hope (“When you think Tim McGraw/I hope you think my favorite song”) all the way to Reputation closer “New Year’s Day,” while its clear-eyed view of time’s passage is reflected in 1989’s “Clean.” “I love writing songs because I love preserving memories, like putting a picture frame around a feeling you once had,” she wrote in Elle earlier this year, and “McGraw” shows how essential that ideal has been to her work since the beginning. Two years earlier, her family had left Wyomissing, Pennsylvania and moved to Nashville in support of their firstborn child's teenage country-star dreams. Taylor Swift showed someone who had been honing her craft since her preteen years, meticulously turning her experiences with boys and with her girlfriends into country songs that reflected the lives of her peers, whom she connected with via MySpace. (“Every single one of the guys that I’ve written songs about has been tracked down on MySpace by my fans,” she told The New York Times in 2008.) MySpace would morph into Tumblr and Instagram Live, but the impulse would remain the same. The album turned out to be a solid, spunky-yet-reflective country record told squarely from the teenage perspective, as opposed to the “can you believe someone so young sounds like that” packaging that weighed down former teen sensations like LeAnn Rimes. While Taylor Swift’s chief genre signifiers, like fiddles and vocal twang, are rooted in ’00s Nashville tropes, the influence of millennial teen pop bubbles up in the bouncy music and in ripped-from-the-LiveJournal lyrics like the cheerily insouciant chorus of “Our Song” (“Our song is the slamming screen door/Sneakin’ out late, tapping on your window”). “Picture to Burn” is a descendant of JoJo’s “Leave (Get Out),” given a Southern-fried twist by Swift’s drawled asides (“alla yer best freeends”), her mockery of the dude’s “stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive,” and the plunking banjo. (“Picture to Burn” also showed that she was learning to hone her poison pen: In the original version’s first verse, she threatened to tell her friends the guy who’d wronged her was gay, a line she dropped from live performances shortly after Taylor Swift’s release. The album version followed suit.) “Teardrops on My Guitar,” a longing ballad about an out-of-reach crush, presaged Swift’s eventual embrace of pop; in early 2008, her now-former label Big Machine released a “pop version” that added echo to her voice and a mid-tempo beat, dropping the weepy slide guitar that doubled as a realization of the song’s title. While Swift was hardly alone in reworking country songs for the “hits you can play at work” crowd, the ease with which “Teardrops” translated to straight pop showed that her deft melodic touch and conversational way with deeply felt emotions could scale to the widest possible audience.  Today, her production takes its cue from current trends, and her subjects don’t need to be identified via online fishing expeditions, but her detailed lyrics and canny worldview were there from the start. Back then, though, she had doubters. An Associated Press report on her early success opened with sneering from a Nashville bigwig: “Tell her to get back in school and come back and see me when she’s 18, and bring her parents,” manager and promoter Jerry Bentley scoffed. That his biggest client was Lee Greenwood, the man behind the hoary “God Bless the USA,” is almost too delicious; that the piece quoting him found his dismissals worthy of the story’s opening lines is depressing. But Swift showed—and her songs’ subjects learned over and over again—that she’d always get the last word.","Today on Pitchfork, we are taking a critical look at the rise of Taylor Swift—from country underdog to pop superstar—with new reviews of her first five records.

Heart Like a Wheel,Linda Ronstadt,by: John Lingan,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d40744a7943ca0008c15148/1:1/w_160/ronstadt_heart.jpg,2019-08-18 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/linda-ronstadt-heart-like-a-wheel/,Capitol,"As their taxi rode uptown in the Manhattan predawn, the singer-songwriter Jerry Jeff Walker leaned over to Linda Ronstadt and told her about a song. This should not have been a memorable occurrence; among their early-’70s country-rock circle of musicians and writers, songs were one of the only things worth talking about—creating them, selling them, matching them to the right singer. But something about a lyric struck Ronstadt. Writing in her memoir, Simple Dreams, more than 40 years later, she recalls the memory like it just happened: “Jerry Jeff’s face was barely visible in the gray light… He bent his head low, closed his eyes, and softly sang for me all he could remember of the song.” By this point, Ronstadt had already recorded a handful of albums with her original mid-’60s folk trio the Stone Poneys and as a solo artist. She’d covered old standards and worked with contemporaries like Michael Nesmith, who had written her biggest hit to date, “Different Drum.” Still barely in her mid-20s, Ronstadt had already recorded dozens of other people’s songs, the vast majority of them by men. Perhaps that’s why the opening verse of Anna McGarrigle’s unrecorded ballad “Heart Like a Wheel” hit her like it did: Some say the heart is just like a wheel
When you bend it you can’t mend it
And my love for you is like a sinking ship
And my heart is on that ship out in mid-ocean Just a couple basic metaphors, but look how they build. A bent wheel becomes a maritime catastrophe, and a vague “some say” becomes a tragic “my love… my heart.” In four short lines with barely any words longer than one syllable, we see a person try to connect their personal pain to a universal experience, only to acknowledge that real-life heartbreak is more awful than any folksy adage can convey. “I felt like a bomb had exploded in my head,” Ronstadt writes. “It rearranged my entire musical landscape.” She carried “Heart Like a Wheel” around for years, obtaining a reel-to-reel copy of McGarrigle’s demo and begging various managers and producers to allow her to record it. On an endless series of tours and jam sessions, in the studio recording background vocals for Neil Young’s “Heart of Gold” and “Old Man,” in front of The Johnny Cash Show’s cameras, Ronstadt grew into a respected, if commercially undistinguished, representative of the new California sound. But she kept this one spare tune close, envisioning it as a string-laden ballad. Eventually, she begged Capitol to let her leave so she could join Asylum, a more artist-focused label recently founded by another friend, David Geffen. They agreed, but asked for one more album. Ronstadt entered the Sound Factory in Hollywood to record her final Capitol sessions in the spring of 1974. Since Geffen was now invested in her success, she effectively had two labels working to make her new record a hit. Thanks to constant touring and collaborations with seemingly every rock musician under 30 at the time, she had acquired mesmerizing control of a voice that was growing more powerful and evocative all the time. With Ronstadt’s help, producer Peter Asher assembled an unbelievable cast of studio ringers, including members of the Eagles, who started as Ronstadt’s touring band just a few years earlier; Andrew Gold, her ace guitar player and multi-instrumentalist; and background singers including Cissy Houston, Clydie King, and Emmylou Harris. Most importantly, she finally had the clout and support to record “Heart Like a Wheel,” which Asher layered in strings just as she imagined. Heart Like a Wheel, as the record was inevitably titled, represented a huge creative leap for Ronstadt in every conceivable way. The title track was the least country- or even contemporary-sounding song she’d ever made, while her cover of the Everly Brothers’ immortal “When Will I Be Loved,” was the hardest she’d ever rocked. She sang Hank Williams with her friend Emmylou, then turned two songs by other friends into career-defining statements: her version of J.D. Souther’s “Faithless Love” drifts on banjo and soft percussion that underline its aching, rueful lyrics, while she completely transforms Lowell George’s druggy-trucker paean “Willin’” into a swaying power ballad. The latter song is possibly the greatest example of Ronstadt’s artistic talent in those halcyon days. The Little Feat version of “Willin’” sounds like a sloppy celebration, but Ronstadt found the yearning in it, the loneliness of a job built on back roads and amphetamines. For George’s great chorus, “If you give me weed, whites, and wine/And you show me a sign/I’ll be willin’ to be movin’,” she slows each syllable down and enlists Gold and Herb Peterson for stunning three-part harmonies that only became longer and more affecting in concert. “Willin’,” with its romantic visions of “Dallas Alice” and its pro-drug message, was the farthest that straightlaced Ronstadt ever drifted from her actual emotional life. And yet she found its heart, and sang it with as much personal conviction as she sang McGarrigle’s wounded hymn. Heart Like a Wheel sounds—and looks—like it was made to turn Ronstadt into a superstar. More than anything, it resembles the wildly popular records that Richard Perry was producing at the time for Harry Nilsson, Barbara Streisand, and Ringo Starr: a powerhouse voice backed by top-flight studio musicians and a tracklist that drew from 1950s classics and young songwriters alike. It cannily walks the listener through all aspects of Ronstadt’s vocal talent, from the bluesy opener “You’re No Good” to her plaintive voicing on the ballads and her arena-trained capacity for belting on “When Will I Be Loved.” Even the record design seemed like a fresh start: on the cover, her face is afloat in a sea of black and her name is spelled out in sleek, art deco lettering. Especially compared to the country-gal imagery of her earlier work, this is clearly Ronstadt Mach II. The reinvention worked. Heart Like a Wheel spent nearly a year on the Billboard album charts including a week at No. 1. “You’re No Good” became a No. 1 single while “When Will I Be Loved” and “I Can’t Help It (If I’m Still In Love With You)” reached the Top 10 as well. The album was nominated for two 1976 Grammys including Record of the Year. Decades later, this kind of popular domination seems almost unbelievable, since the record feels a little slight. It flies by in less than 32 minutes, and despite all the consummate talent involved, no one’s contributions stand out. The songs exist purely to serve that soaring alto, and a number of them would be improved on the road. On Live in Hollywood, recorded in 1980 but only released this spring, Ronstadt sings three Heart Like a Wheel tracks and the difference is striking. The band genuinely jams on “You’re No Good,” even including a bass solo, and the tempos of “Faithless Love” and “Willin’” are slowed just enough for Ronstadt to wring maximum emotion from each line. Nevertheless, Heart Like a Wheel made Live in Hollywood possible. In the second half of the ’70s, Linda Ronstadt became more than just a pop star. She sold-out arenas and brought mainstream attention to cult songwriters like Warren Zevon and Elvis Costello, appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone and Time, and was deemed the Queen of Rock. There had never been a female artist like her in American history, and few male rock acts were so fluent in classic songs and new ones alike, so capable and respected as a bandleader, or possessed of such a stunning, technically masterful voice. No, Ronstadt never played an instrument in concert or on record. She never wrote her own songs, either. She had one power, but it was a superpower. Viewed from one angle, Linda Ronstadt’s career is the story of a woman gradually recognizing the power of her own voice. She had the tone early, but you can hear her control improve in each successive album. Her breaths sound more natural, her vibrato becomes more pronounced. By Heart Like a Wheel, she’d mastered it. In the ensuing years she was equally at home singing Pirates of Penzance on Broadway, making albums with big-band legend Nelson Riddle or the top Mariachi bands in Mexico, and harmonizing with Dolly Parton, Aaron Neville, or Kermit the Frog. She seemed to grasp that her voice was some supernatural gift that she had a responsibility to cultivate and share, and every time she went looking for bigger audiences, she found them eager to listen. So what made her feel so connected to Anna McGarrigle’s little poem of lost love? As a young woman fighting her way out of a male-dominated music scene, she must have related to the deep ungendered sorrow in the song’s lyrics, but she must also have been looking for a tune that could be fully hers. She needed a lyric that she could feel more deeply than anyone else, and a melody she could bless with her unwavering tone. There was a world of music in her mind, and this one whispered verse turned out to be the key that opened it.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

Infest the Rats’ Nest,King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d4060b8579b970008b0e62d/1:1/w_160/kinggizzard_infest.jpeg,2019-08-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/king-gizzard-and-the-lizard-wizard-infest-the-rats-nest/,FlightlessATO,"Heavy metal demands true devotion. It disdains the hipster tourist; it maintains purity through its own antifa(lse metal) movement; it requires that at least 85 percent of your wardrobe be given over to black band t-shirts. King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, on the other hand, are non-commital by nature—the ever-mutating Aussie psych-rock outfit are synonymous with impulsive aesthetic shifts, resulting in a deep, frequently updated discography in which no two albums sound alike. But even by the Gizzard’s scatterbrained standards, 2019 has yielded two albums so diametrically opposed, you’d think one of them was mislabeled. Following the whimsical electro-glam boogie of April’s Fishing for Fishes, the Gizzard return with Infest the Rats’ Nest, an album that embraces the contentious stance that metal isn’t necessarily a way of life, but a passing mood we all feel from time to time. Infest the Rats’ Nest’s throwback thrash isn’t just a matter of Gizzard king Stu Mackenzie upgrading his favorite Lemmy band from Hawkwind to Motörhead; it’s a raging response to a world where even the most despairing UN climate reports barely make a blip. King Gizzard are no strangers to getting heavy, but Infest the Rats’ Nest is their most succinct and single-minded statement to date, presenting a vision of modernity where fleeing Earth to begin civilization anew in outer space looks less like sci-fi and more like docudrama. And when devising a soundtrack to imminent eco-pocalypse, drug-resistant disease, and furious contempt for the planet-killing powers that be, only the most merciless metal will do. With a handful of members tending to other musical and familial obligations, Infest the Rats’ Nest finds the Gizzard in a rare power-trio formation: Mackenzie is backed by fellow guitarist Joey Walker and drummer Michael Cavanagh. As a result, the album forsakes thrash’s technical precision and more grandiose, prog-inspired qualities for a gritty immediacy redolent of the genre’s early days. While jackhammer beats and gratuitous shredding abound, the album also shrewdly connects the dots between thrash and its ’70s-metal forebears: The murderous charge of “Planet B” (as in: “there is no”) peels down the asphalt laid by Deep Purple’s “Highway Star,” while “Mars for the Rich” mimics the bloozy, brontosaurus chug of Black Sabbath’s “Hole in the Sky.” But if King Gizzard’s take on thrash still bears their stoner-rock stamp—particularly on the sludgy “Superbug”—Mackenzie treats the occasion like heavy-metal Halloween, abandoning his natural singing voice for a Venomous bark that favors hook-free howls and minimalist rhymes (“Counterfeit! Hypocrite!”; “Auto-cremate! Self-immolate!”) to hammer home his doomsday prophecies. (Only lines like “shoot the dingo while the shit goes out the window!” remind you that you’re still listening to Australia’s most proudly absurd rock group.) Coming from a band that was singing wistfully about birdies just a few months ago, Infest the Rats’ Nest is a convincing display of metal muscle. But as heavy as the album is, it feels slight in the context of the band’s catalog, lacking both the unpredictable detours of their biggest rock-outs and the insidious melodies of their more pop-focused work. At their best, King Gizzard absorb an array of seemingly incompatible influences into a sound uniquely their own, with a careening momentum that ensures you’re never really sure where they’re taking you. Infest the Rats’ Nest, on the other hand, is a rock’n’roll spin class—intense and relentless, to be sure, but ultimately fixed in the same spot. Even when the album’s second side introduces a conceptual narrative about a group of people who escape Earth to live on Venus (spoiler: things do not end well), it doesn’t venture anywhere—musically or thematically—it hasn’t already been. As the Gizzard’s two releases this year respectively prove, they’re not afraid to push their sound to its most playful and punishing extremes. But it’s always been more thrilling to hear them excavate the uncharted territory in between.

STUMM433,Various Artists,by: Daniel Martin-McCormick,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d5afa76ff91290008240e77/1:1/w_160/STUMM433_CoverArt_hires.jpg,2019-08-17 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-stumm433/,Mute,"It’s been almost 70 years since John Cage debuted 4:33, his infamous silent piece, to a baffled crowd in Woodstock, New York. A lot of people left the concert pissed off. His friend and colleague Christian Woolf was mortified to have brought his mother, who dismissed it as “a schoolboy’s prank,” while Lou Harrison, another peer, said Cage’s work was “quite boring.” But in 2019, the hubbub having long since died down, the feeling is that someone had to do it. However grating it might have seemed, 4:33 remains arguably the 20th century’s most elegant artistic thought experiment. It’s a moon-landing-level gesture of the avant garde’s triumph over history. In a century obsessed with liberation, Cage deftly penned the ultimate musical permission slip. Brazen and deceptively simple, 4:33 was a hit. Its premise can be explained in a single sentence and demands a reaction, which means it moved like wildfire through the public consciousness. While much of the century’s early modernism required an educated audience capable of following the unnerving destabilizations of dodecaphony and its attendant tone rows, hexachords, and aggregates, Cage’s silence hits you right between the eyes. 4:33 is a koan, a question without an answer. As Cage put it, “Silence is not acoustic. It is a change of mind.” Of course, the thing about 4:33 is that it’s not really silent. In the absence of composed sounds, the world rushes in. Not only are the idyllic rustling leaves or the soft hiss of the wind part of the piece, but also the scoffing of peeved concertgoers and the slamming of doors as they storm out. 4:33 opens its borders to any sound or absence thereof and in this way it embodies a set of twin legacies: on the one hand, meditative submission to the world, and on the other, jarring provocation of its audience’s perception of music’s place within it. Mute Records remains one of the great disciples of this second legacy. In the 1980s, label boss Daniel Miller cultivated a space where some of the most popular sounds of the era swam freely with the bleeding edge of punk and industrial music. Yazoo and Erasure found their footing as global superstars alongside Boyd Rice’s “Mode of Infection” and Throbbing Gristle’s “Maggot Death.” Echoing Cage’s embrace of the unknown, Miller said of electronic music, “You didn't have to learn any chords, just press down on the keyboard and an interesting sound would come out.” He described the Birthday Party as “not so much a band as an incendiary device.” A similar assessment could have been made about much of Cage’s work throughout the 1950s. So it makes sense that Mute is releasing STUM433, a collection of “covers” of 4:33, as part of its MUTE 4.0 (1978 > Tomorrow) retrospective. As the label celebrates four decades of visionary work, a plan was formed to have every Mute artist record their own version of the piece. They were able to round up 58 of them, ranging from synth-pop icons New Order to dub-techno pioneer Pole. This is a testament to Miller’s acumen as a label boss. You might not think the musicians behind “Porcelain” or “People Are People” would be interested in a composer who spent time playing a cactus with a feather, but Moby and Depeche Mode both make an appearance. Plus, you know, it fits the label’s name. It takes almost four and a half hours (though not quite four hours and 33 minutes) to get through STUM433, which means practically no one will hear it in full. And even if you make it to the end, will you ever truly hear it? Try focusing your full attention on 265 minutes of microphone hiss, light urban din, and intermittent nature sounds. It’s not easy. The album hovers, misty to the point of near-invisibility, with a number of interchangeable outdoor takes, some vacant rooms, and an odd cavernous reverberation. Occasionally someone gets clever, like when Michael Gira counts his way through the piece, but few dare to seriously run with Cage’s prompt. STUM433 is a mammoth coffee-table book of a record, telegraphing astute cultural values and cool points without offering much actual art. But staging a team-building exercise for the label roster isn’t a crime, and the only people who will purchase the lavishly packaged set are those with a yen for sexy, rather pointless lifestyle accessories. So what the hell, go for it, right? Maybe, maybe not. 4:33 gestated in Cage’s mind for at least 12 years before he wrote it. “I didn’t wish it to appear, even to me, as something easy to do or as a joke,” he once said, while pianist David Tudor, who premiered 4:33, described it as “one of the most intense listening experiences you can have.” So what exactly, for example, does Chris Liebing bring to the conversation? The techno producer is known for slamming it out on huge festival stages, presenting loopy synth lines and 909 snare rolls on an IMAX scale. His contribution to the compilation is a muffled roar, perhaps of a dancefloor heard through a dressing room wall. You may enjoy it, but the recording absolutely seems “easy to do.” The same applies for Goldfrapp, Nitzer Ebb, ADULT. and others across the collection. Regardless of your opinion of these artists, an interest in the avant garde doesn’t guarantee an intriguing point of view on its most iconic and vexing works. STUMM433 is a diversion, a far cry from Cage’s measured conviction. “I probably worked longer on my silent piece than I worked on any other,” he said. “I wanted to mean it utterly and be able to live with it.” Cage never released a recording of 4:33, but its spirit haunts the halls. The last 70 years have been filled with music that deploys field recordings and nature sounds to transportive effect. A generation of composers embraced Cage’s fundamental ideas of letting go, ceding authority to process and space. More recently, YouTube has been populated with quasi-silences: extended videos that recreate the ambient hum of sci-fi environments as well as ASMR’s hushed, reverential banalities. As the years went on, Cage and his direct contemporaries often composed on the edge of silence, as if 4:33 had expanded into an ocean of emptiness, their sparse arrangements the dinghies keeping them afloat. Maybe you just have to be there, and any attempt to capture the piece on tape will falter. Going through the set, I was reminded of a subway ride I once took. I had a handheld recorder and a set of headphones with me, and I decided to capture the sounds of the train. As I put on the headphones, I was enveloped in an astonishing world. All the sounds were the same, but the depth of field had changed—conversations seemed closer, the rattle of the ride more vibrant. I walked out on the street entranced by the tingling psychedelia of this same-but-different reality. It’s an experience anyone can try. But don’t expect it to last. When I got home and listened back, there was nothing particularly distinctive there. It just sounded like any other subway ride.","John Cage’s notorious “silent” piece 4:33 is an exercise in listening. But a compilation of covers—from New Order, Depeche Mode, and others—proves that interpreting it is not as easy as it might seem.

I Spent the Winter Writing Songs About Getting Better,Proper.,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d483bdf5cb984000a8d94f5/1:1/w_160/proper_ispentthewinter.jpg,2019-08-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/proper-i-spent-the-winter-writing-songs-about-getting-better/,Big Scary Monsters,"When Erik Garlington changed his band’s name from Great Wight to Proper., his fans immediately assumed the stylization was an Into It. Over It. homage. Considering his rich history of playing emo inside baseball, they could be forgiven. After all, Great Wight included a song about a life-changing Tiny Moving Parts basement show on 2017’s The Suburbs Have Ruined My Life, and while that album title could pass for a Wonder Years lyric, I Spent the Winter Writing Songs About Getting Better comes from an actual Wonder Years lyric. The reality is that “Proper.” is a reference to the one topic that always takes priority in Garlington’s lyrics: “We got it from white people telling us, 'You talk white. You talk, like, real proper. One of your parents must be white!'” The subject matter hasn’t changed much from The Suburbs Have Ruined My Life—Garlington is still venting righteous frustration over the ways his band’s intersectional identities function in predominantly white spaces, but his view has expanded far beyond their local emo scene or Kansas City to encompass the near-entirety of American society. Garlington has said he envisions Proper. as the realization of the extremely weird-but-apparently-real Max Bemis and Kanye West collaboration that occurred sometime during The Life of Pablo. Truth be told, there’s far more Say Anything than Kanye in Proper.’s explosively verbal, shapeshifting, and snarky emo-pop, which has earned apt comparisons to Modern Baseball and respect from Los Campesinos! As far as Kanye, Proper. share his tendency to, well, say anything and an insatiable grudge against higher education. As it did on The College Dropout, this tends to result in the rare moments where I Spent the Winter doesn’t quite land right. On “Toby,” Garlington takes the perspective of a self-conscious high school senior who has no idea what they’re doing in college (“I was just a kid last year, now I’m planning my life out at 18”). He actually manages empathy for the kind of suburban Bible Belters who tormented him throughout his life, those that follow the path of least resistance into their 50s and lack the conviction to follow any ambitions that deviate from the norm—“I start a creative writing class next week/Maybe I’ll finish that novel I started at 20/God, I hope they like me,” he sings. Conversely, “IDFWA (Art School)” vents bile at his peers while also having the greatest number of lyrical clunkers (“You’re just not into politics/Unless it’s about weed/Then you’re a proletariat/Armed with sickle and bong”). Yet “IDFWA” performs a necessary function as I Spent the Winter’s release valve, given the lifetime of interconnected indignities Garlington can recall at a moment’s notice. “I hope you don’t mind if I tell a few stories about my life,” he meekly asks on “Curtain’s Down! Throw In the Towel,” and every single slight comes under the microscope for reexamination, whether the humiliations are relatively minor (“Joined the band to play drums, they put me on fucking trombone”) or traumatic. “I just want other black kids to like me someday,” he sings as his sixth-grade self on “Lime Green Jheri Curl.” But he’s into Rocky Horror Picture Show and Dragonriders of Pern, which means “my white friends say the n-word more than me and that it’s okay because they’re blacker than me.” Then none of them show up to his birthday. Trying to take in I Spent the Winter in one sitting, as the man once said, is way too much. In all likelihood, Garlington is trying to make the act of listening to Proper. as overwhelming as experiencing his life firsthand. As with Bemis’ most potent work, I Spent the Winter’s words writhe on the page, emitting the kind of radioactive energy that circulates when someone says something they know can never be taken back. “When you hear this you’ll call me ungrateful, but mom, it’s true,” he spits on “White Sheep,” a song that hinges on the chorus “I hate my family/Fucking hate my name.” As with “Lime Green Jheri Curl” (“Am I broken/Am I an alien/I don’t think there’s anywhere I belong”), the cracked melodies and universal feelings of alienation in these hooks could be extracted from the most lily-white suburban Drive Thru Records CD, even if they’re attached to the extremely specific experience of Erik Garlington. It’s one of the many ways Garlington validates his choice to forgo college and/or “the military industrial complex” to cast his lot with an all-black emo band in Brooklyn, because this is the kind of music that created a real community for him—“There could be someone who looks just like me that needs to hear they’re not alone/Or at least they don’t have to be.” With the exception of the last Great Wight record, I can’t say I’ve heard anything quite like I Spent the Winter, and Proper. has made it their life’s work to make sure that’s no longer the case.","The Brooklyn band's explosively verbal, shapeshifting, and snarky emo-pop explores how intersectional identities move within predominantly white spaces.

Basking in the Glow,Oso Oso,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf01671c13a457f74e837d9/1:1/w_160/OsoOso_BaskingInTheGlow.png,2019-08-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/oso-oso-basking-in-the-glow/,Triple Crown,"Any cynic can make a resolution to be more positive. It’s another thing to suppress the eye-rolls triggered by all the clichés that come with it—“first things first,” “focus on the good.” This is the challenge Oso Oso frontman Jade Lilitri has taken on—“radically committed to letting the light in”—for his third album, Basking in the Glow. Accordingly, the music is relentless, almost ruthless in its melodic radiance, both a testament to the power of positive thinking and a poignant reminder of its limitations. “Sometimes you do what you feel/Well most times I feel like shit,” he sings on Basking in the Glow’s penultimate track, one that vividly names Lilitri’s white-knuckle grasp on serenity—it’s called “Impossible Game.” You’ve been told “fake it til you make it,” but what if you’ve made it and it still feels fake? Or, think of Basking in the Glow as Lilitri considering his newfound success and adulation, acting out the anime butterfly meme: “Is this happiness?” Lilitri achieved minor notoriety with the short-lived Long Island emo band State Lines, after which he released his first album as Oso Oso in 2015 to a handful of positive blog reviews and filled in as a second guitarist for the Hotelier in 2016. In order to keep that small-time hustle going, he envisioned a future very similar to his present: living with his parents and saving just enough money to finance his recordings and maybe break even on tour. His breakout album, 2017’s The Yunahon Mixtape, was only called a mixtape because Lilitri couldn’t find a label to release it, so he dropped it on Bandcamp for free. But it achieved the same desired result for any mixtape from an unheralded artist: it created enough buzz to get people to actually pay him to make and play music. Basking in the Glow appears to follow the M.O. of pop-punk scions Jimmy Eat World on Bleed American, making a “disgustingly catchy and straight-ahead” album as revenge against an industry that was content to ignore them only two years prior. Lilitri has said he’s not fond of the whole dog and pony show of putting out records, but Basking in the Glow has enough potential pop singles to sustain a year-long album roll-out campaign. The melodies were always there for Oso Oso, but here Lilitri achieves the rare feat of making a more maximalist, cinematic album without piling on overdubs, string sections, or convoluted song structures. On the only song that wouldn’t qualify as a radio single, “Intro,” Lilitri reminisces about running his hands through blades of grass and staring at clouds, his words made almost redundant by the kind of dreamy, swelling guitar tones found on early Death Cab for Cutie songs. Otherwise, Lilitri honors the heightened expectations and trust of his new label, Triple Crown, by embracing his showmanship; “pop” is more of a verb than a genre. The chorus of “Impossible Game” flowers up from a thicket of thorny, minimal guitar lines; the last chorus of “The View” sprints forward from its restrained bridge like a revved-up toy race car; “A Morning Song” and “Wake Up Next to God” have hooks that are both preceded by a split-second break where the guitars drop out. When Lilitri lands on the other side and speeds on, it’s like a little jolt to the chest. Lilitri’s dedication to concision and coherence doesn’t come at the expense of subtle, sharp songwriting. On the delirious chorus of “The View,” there are certain phrases that he pronounces more clearly and naturally than others. Maybe your ears only catch the words “My eyes lit up when I saw it” or “...everything I wanted” or “...in love with it.” Ostensibly, it’s a song about a crush guided by impulsive infatuation. But dig into the chorus further, and “The View” is Lilitri’s love song to another person’s apathy—looking for “a way out from everything I wanted,” nihilism disguised as Buddhist philosophy. But as “The View” kneels over for a slight breather during its bridge, Lilitri starts to feel those old wants again, the pull of playing tiny house shows, the songs that only come on at 4 a.m.: “I’m falling into old habits/I’m stepping over the cracks again.” A few minutes later on the title track, he yells, “I hate these songs I sing, this empty drink, do I even give a fuck?” over a glam-rock strut. Otherwise, he’s “making progress in microscopic strides,” “watching optimists drink half-empty cups,” hating how much he misses the one he loves, weighed down by warm memories, dipping only one foot into the lake, each a carefully balanced binary proving either side can only get a temporary upper hand in a never-ending battle. Similar to Sparklehorse’s Good Morning Spider, Liltiri makes a commitment to becoming a happier man only after emerging from a sea of static on “One Sick Plan.” It’s a complete outlier on a record produced to a glimmering, late-summer brilliance by Mike Sapone, sounding like a demo cassette fished out of a flooded basement. The lyrics read like a directive he wrote to himself at a much younger age, anticipating the self-doubt and cynicism that can creep in when outside validation is scarce. “I see my demise/I feel it coming/I got one sick plan to save me from it,” he sings over harshly strummed, no-fi acoustics, most likely sick in the Long Island skate-kid sense of the word. It’s also the most vulnerable and dewy-eyed love song he’s written under the Oso Oso name: “Don’t stop chasing what you want...I need heaven, I need you/I need your perfect point of you.” Lilitri repeatedly circles back to the metaphor of a “narrowing road” on Basking in the Glow, one frequently used in 12-step recovery to describe the way people are less likely to swerve towards temptation with time. “So long, hollowed, narrowing road/I think I’m turning back, it’s the only way I know,” is a frightening thing for Lilitri to admit, but “The View” musters every fiber of its being to propel itself towards “Impossible Game”’s brief and beautiful moment of zen -  “I got a glimpse of this feeling, I’m trying to stay in that lane,” Lilitri shouts, teeth gritted, clutching the steering wheel, but committed to moving ever forward towards the light, even if it’s one microscopic stride at a time.","The excellent album from the Long Island singer-songwriter Jade Lilitri is sharp and radiant, a massively catchy guitar record about trying to walk the straight and narrow.

Other Girls,Lillie Mae,by: Maggie Lange,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d487d843a40180008ff3bbb/1:1/w_160/LillieMae_OtherGirls.jpg,2019-08-16 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lillie-mae-other-girls/,Third Man,"On her second album, Nashville spitfire Lillie Mae keeps tabs on everyone who’s spurned her, and her tightly wound voice convinces you to join in. She can calibrate her disappointment to multiple settings: damning and plaintive on “You’ve Got Other Girls For That,” deliciously scorning on “At Least Three In This Room.” She can sound coolly independent and wounded at once, evoking Dolly Parton in one breath and Ariana Grande in the next. She’s played the fiddle since she was three, touring with her family band to fairs and RV parks, and by now she can turn the country on or off as needed. Mae’s Jack White-produced 2017 album Forever and Then Some had a hard-rocking veneer, but Other Girls (still under White’s label Third Man Records, this time produced by Dave Cobb) invites more natural light into the mix. She plays acoustic guitar and fiddle throughout, but keeps her voice front and center, floating effortlessly between bluegrass, country, and rock. She plays tag with the guitars or spars with a fiddle, singing with but not over them. At the end of “Didn’t I,” she vaults into exalted trills and yeah yeah yeahs over finger-picked guitars that seem to be goading her to go even wilder. Like some fellow retro-minded musicians Molly Tuttle and Courtney Marie Andrews, Mae is unafraid of swampy instrumentation. Sometimes the tug of tradition can pull a little too hard. The word “dames,” when it pops up on “At Least Three,” is tough not to cringe at. But the awkward moments are outnumbered by the Dorothy Parker bullseyes: “I ain’t your only, maybe the only one who think that’s so,” she sings on “You’ve Got Other Girls For That.” It would be funny if it weren’t so forlorn and self-aware, a self-defeating joke at her own expense. To record Other Girls, Mae paused touring for the first time in her adult memory. She told Rolling Stone, “This has been the slowest year of my life,” and the effects of this slowdown can be heard everywhere in this album. Regrets and disappointments linger in the music the way they do in life, casting long shadows. On her last album, she was at her finest when near-breathless, but here she soars in the pauses.  At the end of “Crisp and Cold,” she lets the line “Don’t be scared, be more” float into silence with no symmetrical Nashville instinct to rhyme or tie it up.

Equivalents,Loscil,by: Jonathan Williger,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d51940c97e3c8000869ef4e/1:1/w_160/loscil_equivalents.jpg,2019-08-16 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/loscil-equivalents/,Kranky,"Many of the dozen albums that Scott Morgan has produced over the past two decades utilize two volumes: quiet and quieter. Morgan’s music as Loscil is defined by subtlety and understatement: His records tend to recede from the foreground, enmeshing themselves in their surroundings without demanding much attention. He has a rich compositional style that is intricate and deliberate, as well as an ability to conjure immersive atmospheres whose surprising depth is hidden by the music’s supine, almost narcotic, qualities. Equivalents, Loscil’s first album in three years, is remarkably monochromatic music, full of wispy high pitches that swirl around waves of pink noise and slowly moving tone clusters. Almost all of the sounds were created by heavily processing and layering samples of piano that were originally intended for a Glenn Gould tribute curated by Japanese ambient legend Ryuichi Sakamoto. By focusing so intently on one source, Morgan has made one of the most homogenous albums of his career. It’s easy to regard Equivalents as one long composition that moves through several distinct but related movements. It has a lulling effect that allows space for the mind to wander. Yet what Morgan can do with that limited palette can be stunning. There are elusive melodic lines spread throughout the album, often so slow that they unfurl over the course of an entire track. “Equivalent 5” creates an effect similar to a Shepard tone, the buried melody, cloaked in hiss, rising but never quite reaching a climax before dissolving into nothingness. Each element seems purposefully placed, and sounds often ping between the left and right channels, such as the delicately pulsating static on the closer “Equivalent 4.” Morgan frequently juxtaposes blocks of sound shrouded in reverb with crisp, light tones that dance around the swirling mass. Loscil’s albums typically draw inspiration from the environment (rain on Endless Falls, pollution and degradation of the natural world on Monument Builders), and Equivalents uses clouds as a conceptual nexus. The album takes its name from a series of the same title created by Alfred Stieglitz in the early 1920s, in which the photographer attempted to locate musical qualities in abstract forms found in nature. Stieglitz captured images of clouds mid-swirl, printing them in stark black and white, connecting their strange contours to his own “emotional and philosophical” states. Like clouds, the music on Equivalents is in constant motion but appears to be caught in stasis. Unique and beautiful contours appear and disappear without fanfare, smeared into other sounds or pure silence. What seems simple on the surface is detailed and textured under close attention. Like Stieglitz’s photographs, the music evokes a calm melancholy and surprising emotional resonance. Because of its indistinct nature, Equivalents feels infinitely deep, with details left undiscovered even after repeat listens. It is easy to get lost in its doldrums, and can sometimes feel inconspicuous to a fault. Brian Eno famously said that ambient music “must be as ignorable as it is interesting.” On Equivalents, Morgan’s careful attention to both those extremes continues to yield fresh ideas.

Sweet Princess EP,Dry Cleaning,by: Brodie Lancaster,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d4865597ed29000096e4644/1:1/w_160/sweetprincess_drycleaning.jpg,2019-08-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dry-cleaning-sweet-princess-ep/,self-released,"On “Goodnight,” the opening track of South London post-punk quartet Dry Cleaning’s debut EP Sweet Princess, vocalist Florence Shaw performs the role of digital archaeologist, pasting together a series of absurd comments mined from YouTube videos. The words link into a demented chain of paper dolls, muttering lines like, “During what was probably the longest two and a half months of my life after a near-death experience... the only thing that kept me going was Saw 2.” Dry Cleaning brings together longtime friends bassist Lewis Maynard, drummer Nick Buxton, and guitarist Tom Dowse. In late 2017, they recruited Shaw, an artist, university lecturer, and photo researcher, as the group’s singer. Though never a performer, she’d always kept lists—neuroses, daily annoyances, advertising copy—with the idea to one day use them in her drawings. Her excavations became the starting point for Sweet Princess, six cerebral, spiky songs that extract something touching and tragic from the mundanity of social media and social anxiety. “Followed by another porn account on Instagram,” Shaw notes dryly on “Conversation,” a song about dating and the painful task of interacting with a person you resent yourself for wanting to impress. On “New Job,” a sing-song tribute to a couple called Jimmy and Olga—the kind you might imagine scratched into a bathroom stall or a school desk—transforms into a spoken list of anxieties: conversational missed connections, overstepped boundaries, desperate attempts to grasp something in common. Stripped of context, collected fragments like, “Who’s the Pride of Britain?/Michelle blasts Mark/I was shot in the head by my kid,” mean little. But the things that strike Shaw’s fancy, that prove silly or strange enough to warrant pulling out a pen, betray what she values. Spliced together and set to tight, unpolished guitars, “Traditional Fish”’s recollections of signage and newsstands offer a grimy reflection of mundane British life as written in tabloid headlines. Enter Meghan Markle. From the Sex Pistols to the Specials, British punks have long rallied against their heads of state. But over spirals of guitar that conjure memories of the Raincoats or the B-52’s, first single “Magic of Meghan” offers a staccato accounting of Markle’s graces. The Duchess of Sussex is illustrated as if she’s a young guidance counsellor who lets Shaw call her by her first name, or a friend from school she admires from afar. On the day of Markle’s engagement, we learn, Shaw was moving out after a breakup. The way she writes about Markle is almost like fan fiction: a morsel of celebrity bent and manipulated until it forms a new narrative specific to its author. It’s so endearing that it could almost stand to be a touch more critical of, you know, the monarchy. Like empty bottles melted down and repurposed as stained glass, Dry Cleaning’s assembled observations capture the distortion of life on and off the internet, of spewing our deepest emotions into an anonymous void but biting our tongue when we encounter a real person. Type what you really feel, then close the tab and delete your history—maybe Florence Shaw will find it.","These six cerebral, spiky songs extract something touching and tragic from the mundanity of social media and social anxiety.

This Is Not a Safe Place,Ride,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d2de881ea98e20008674a73/1:1/w_160/ride_thisisnot.jpg,2019-08-15 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ride-this-is-not-a-safe-place/,Wichita,"If you listen closely to This Is Not a Safe Place, Ride’s second post-reunion album, you can hear the exact moment when they stop caring what people think. It happens 16 seconds into the first track “R.I.D.E.”: the shuffling drums pause, the swirling guitar effect abates, and a voice solemnly intones the band’s name into the silence, like a hip-hop producer testing a calling card on their first BeatStars upload. It’s strange, funny, and unexpected, an out-of-the-blue, well-actually-why-not experiment that suggests a band entirely at peace with their place in the world. This same happily adventurous spirit runs through the best of This Is Not a Safe Place. The band has variously described it as a guitar album and a work inspired by Jean-Michel Basquiat. Behind both of these not-particularly-illuminating descriptions lies an emboldened album by an emboldened band, one that seems to  realize that people genuinely like them after all these years, giving them license to merrily tinker with their legacy. London producer and DJ Erol Alkan, who produced 2017’s Weather Diaries, is back on board, but This Is Not a Safe Place feels considerably more natural than its predecessor, which felt like the work of a band that felt like it had to change, rather than one that really wanted to. This Is Not a Safe Place easily encapsulates everything from juddering guitar assaults (the very Swervedriver “Kill Switch”) to Byrds-ian jangle pop (“Future Love”) and acoustic laments about the internet (“Dial Up”). Strangest of all is “Repetition,” which sounds uncannily like the work of the Human League, made all the better by lyrics that seemingly thumb noses at fans who want Ride to knock out “Drive Blind”-style guitar fuzz until they keel over on their own amps. “Repetition” sounds—in the very best way—like a song knocked together in five minutes of spare studio time with inspiration flowing and the pressure off. “Dial Up,” meanwhile, cleverly intertwines a synth line among its acoustic guitars, the undulating electronic tones adding to the song’s overall effect rather than tearing the listener’s attention away. This Is Not a Safe Place may not quite have the consistency of Slowdive’s self-titled fourth album—still the benchmark for reformed shoegaze acts—but it gives Ride the start of a very listenable post-reformation playlist. You wonder, though, what might have been had the album maintained its early zip. “Kill Switch,” for all its noise, lacks a notable melody, while “Clouds of Saint Marie” and “Eternal Recurrence” feel a little wan. “In This Room,” meanwhile, is almost a great song, its wistful melody stretched thin over eight and a half minutes.  This Is Not a Safe Place is not, in the end, the classic Ride Mark 2 release that its first three songs so casually tease. But it has enough joy, verve and invention to suggest that Ride could get there one day.

forevher,Shura,by: Aimee Cliff,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d4078d8e82cca0008d4d593/1:1/w_160/shura_forevher.jpeg,2019-08-15 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shura-forevher/,Secretly Canadian,"Shura emerged in 2014 as a pop star with a contradiction at her core. “Touch,” her lo-fi disco debut single, was a sort of “Dancing On My Own” for a new generation: an eminently danceable song about watching somebody else dance, about wanting to touch one another but being unable to because you’re paralysed by your own thoughts. Her 2016 LP Nothing’s Real was full of pop songs about unfulfilled promise and missed connections. With track titles like “2Shy” and “Tongue Tied,” she channelled the feathery soul of Janet Jackson and early Madonna while singing about being so engulfed in her own mind that she came apart from her body (the title track described the near-death pangs of a panic attack). If Nothing’s Real was all thought, the Manchester-born singer-songwriter’s follow-up forevher is all feeling. Shura (real name Aleksandra Denton) spent the three years between her first and second records falling in love. The relationship that inspired forevher is a long-distance one, played out between New York and London via Skype and iMessage, and so the album tells a very modern story of intimacy (switching off Airplane Mode as soon as you land to see what your lover sent you while you were flying; being preoccupied with thoughts of the latest nude they sent you). In tandem, her sound has grown into something more corporeal: While her voice on forevher largely comes through the filter of Auto-Tune, the instruments are looser and more live than they were on Nothing’s Real, with string flutters mimicking skipped heartbeats, and basslines settling into deep, well-worn grooves. If Shura used to hover awkwardly on the edges of dancefloors, now, she gives herself over to them. The psychedelic electronic soul of “religion (u can lay your hands on me)” or “skyline be mine”—all co-produced, once again, with her regular collaborator Joel Pott—could sit comfortably alongside Steve Lacy or Connan Mockasin, with digital flourishes bringing a layer of surreal newness to earthy rhythms. The hooks of this record, at its most sensual, are less pop choruses than they are ecstatic moans. The swaggering sci-fi funk of “side effects” melts into a refrain that feels ancient and instinctive: “What it is, what it is, what it is, it’s so good.” On “religion,” the sparse, direct hook is simply, “Ooh girl, don’t stop, please/ You can lay your hands on me.” The record’s repeated urge, between clipped scratches of funk guitar and distorted saxophone, is simply to keep on going, keep on dancing, keep on feeling. Of course, Shura still grapples with light insecurities in the album’s slower mid-section, in particular “flyin’” and “princess leia,” both of which deal with anxious thoughts during long-distance travel. It’s a necessary contrast for a record that mostly revels in new-relationship bliss, but—obviously—less fun. Likewise “tommy,” a voice memo and short ditty depicting an old man finding new love, rings more hollow than the richer funk songs that surround it. Shura is at her most convincing, and her most alive, when she’s fully embodying her own experience rather than narrating someone else’s. The album’s slightly saccharine title is an indication of its general embrace of romantic cliché—on “forever,” she rhymes ""forever"" with “together” and coos: “You make me feel like sunshine, feel so good.” It might be clichéd, but as with her neo-soul sound, it’s also an enthusiastic, earnest reclamation: You’ve heard people sing “forever together” on a pop song before, but have you heard a woman sing it to another woman? Throughout forevher, Shura places herself lyrically inside religious imagery (she promises to baptise her love like Jesus on “BKLYNLDN” and makes herself into God on “religion”) and inside romantic tropes, as if asking, why not us? On the cover of the record, she places two women inside the familiar image of Rodin’s The Kiss, washed in blue light reminiscent of a Hockney swimming pool. The pop canon has, for so long, been totally devoid of women expressing uncomplicated desire for other women, but 2019 might be the first year where queer women are spoilt for choice. LA band MUNA are preaching self-love, Marika Hackman is writing rock anthems about women going down on one another, and Charli XCX and Christine and the Queens stop just shy of making out in the video for “Gone.” This record is, first and foremost, about queer women. It is also about anyone who has experienced this kind of love: as blinding as religion, as cheesy as a Hallmark card, as familiar as a pop song.

Jambú e Os Míticos Sons Da Amazônia,Various Artists,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d4873e0050ddf0008c3d396/1:1/w_160/jambu_va.jpg,2019-08-15 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-jambu-e-os-miticos-sons-da-amazonia/,Analog Africa,"Joaquim Maria Dias de Castro—better known as Mestre Cupijó—was already an accomplished bandleader in his hometown of Cametá, a small city in the northern Brazilian state of Pará, when he ventured upriver to live in an Amazonian quilombola community among the descendants of escaped slaves. There he absorbed siriá, the traditional sound of those mixed-race communities, where African, indigenous, and mestiço cultures commingled for generations, and he returned to Cametá determined to modernize that sound, blending it with elements of the Colombian cumbia, Dominican merengue, and Cuban mambo that had spread across northern Brazil in the 1960s, carried across the jungle by distant radio signals. “Despedida,” captured live in a Cametá nightclub in 1973, represents the first recording of modern siriá. An invigoratingly raw blend of bashed drum kit and bittersweet horns, it is the closing song on Jambú e os Míticos Sons da Amazonia, Analog Africa’s fascinating new survey of the bygone sounds of Belém, the capital of Pará and the gateway between the Atlantic and the Amazon. But in many ways, Cupijó’s story serves as a prelude to this compilation. Analog Africa first turned its eye to Brazil in 2014 with Siriá, an anthology of Cupijó’s music, and Jambú, the result of label co-founder Samy Ben Redjeb’s digging expeditions in Belém, widens the lens to focus on carimbó and lambada, sister sounds to siriá that also incorporate a mixture of indigenous, Afro-Brazilian, and Portuguese influences. With the exception of giants like Pinduca, a legendary figure who first modernized and electrified carimbó, many of these artists will be unfamiliar to all but the most dedicated students of Brazilian music (for several, it is their first time appearing on streaming services), and the music is uniformly thrilling, blending the syncopated shuffle of carimbó—a beat, originally played on hollowed-out tree trunks, that’s part galloping horse, part drunken stumble—with trance-like woodwind melodies, throaty sing-alongs, flickering rhythm guitar, and the overdriven sonics you might expect from a genre whose pioneers ran their electric guitars through church PAs powered by car batteries. It’s hard to put your finger on exactly what is so gripping about this music, what gives it a quality at once alien and familiar. “Jambú” refers to a medicinal Amazonian herb frequently mixed with cachaça, to reportedly powerful effect, and that stimulated/sloshed dichotomy plays out in a kind of rowdy melancholy: The beats surge like floodwaters, the percussion clatters like a thumped table covered with empties, the singers’ voices have the ragged edge of sun-up on no sleep. The slippery trills and eerie, modal sax melodies of songs like Messias Holanda’s “Carimbó de Pimienta” and Verequete e o Conjunto Uirapurú’s “Da Garrafa uma Pinga” remind me, in their mercurial moods, of Ethiopian jazz. The compilation’s excellent liner notes detail the clubs and bars where this music took shape in the 1970s and 1980s, and quite a few of these songs make no bones about their mission as straight-up party music. Pinduca’s “Vamos Farrear” is a rousing toast with a sly twist (“Let’s drink cachaça, everyone/Let’s party/The cachaça is tasty/No one will get drunk”); the irresistible “Coco de Bahia” is a tribute to the coconuts of Bahia, Brazil that’s loaded with winking double entendres. Such wordplay runs through many of these songs, as do snapshots of rural life in remote farming communities: Vieira e Seu Conjunto’s lilting “Melô do Bode,” which hinges on the double meaning of “bode” (“goat”/“problem”) is about a troublesome animal he can’t wait to unload. Throughout, a captivating mix of the profane and the sacred holds sway, particularly in the acoustic “pau e corda” (“stick and chord”) style of Verequete e o Conjunto Uirapurú. Verequete, the “King of Carimbó,” was a devotee of Candomblé, a regional religion with African roots; he took his name from a vodun, or divinity, in the jejes-nagós cults of Mina. Relying on traditional instruments like curimbó drum, saxophone, banjo, sticks, triangle, ganza, and afoxé, Verequete’s band offers not just a testament to carimbó’s pre-electric roots but also its roof-raising qualities. And Janjão’s “Meu Barquinho” is a song about the orishas Zango and Yemanja, while his album Carimbó e Outras Mirongas was meant as a call to preserve the cultural heritage of Brazilian Candmoblé and other folk-religious forms. To the uninitiated, Jambú may sound at first nearly as incomprehensible as it is exciting. The first dozen times through, I had trouble making sense of the overloaded midrange and upper register: the horns, guitars, call-and-response vocals, and insistent shakers and maracas. But eventually, it all settles into place, yielding both a rich diversity of complementary styles—just compare the rollicking, jazz-band madness of Os Muiraquitãns with the spindly elegance of Mestre Vieira’s brand of lambada and guitarrada—and a riveting glimpse at styles and cultures long ignored by the official history of Brazilian popular music. Jambú is the next best thing to a seat in Mestre Cupijó’s dugout canoe. Decades after he ventured upriver, he takes the rest of us with him.

Black Love & War,Georgia Anne MuldrowDudley Perkins,by: Shannon J. Effinger,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d405abae82cca0008d4d559/1:1/w_160/gd_blacklove.jpg,2019-08-15 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/georgia-anne-muldrow-dudley-perkins-black-love-and-war/,SomeOthaShip ConnecteOne,"To be black in America is to live a divided existence, straddling a glorious yet fractured past, the unfulfilled promise of the future, and a present that has never truly belonged to us. But the philosophy of Afrofuturism has given countless black artists and thinkers the ability to “time travel,” exploring the intersectionality of race, politics, science, and technology across genres in as yet impossible ways. Coined by writer Mark Dery in a 1993 essay, Afrofuturism empowered black artists not only to reimagine the world in which they lived—one predicated on racism—but to reclaim identity by controlling our narrative. In Afrofuturist tradition, Georgia Anne Muldrow and Dudley Perkins use their third collaboration, Black Love & War (released under the moniker “G&D”), to collide past and future in an alternate universe. Equal parts manifesto and critique, Black Love & War implores listeners to rage against the machine—namely, an administration that brands a predominantly black city as “rat infested.” From the echoing refrain of retribution that seeks “death to all oppressors” on “187” to the proclamation of love in the face of a dystopian society on “P.A.L,” Muldrow and Perkins root their work in the present by paying homage to the sound and radical spirit of their West Coast home. As parents themselves, Muldrow and Perkins have no hesitation about serving as mentors for younger generations. Certain tracks feel as though they were created especially for their children: “Hold on tight to your dreams and don’t you ever let them go,” Muldrow counsels on “The Power of Your Brain.” On “Peace Peace,” Perkins delivers a prophetic freestyle, warning his newborn son of rampant police brutality. He exploits the entendre—“peace” and “piece”—from the very first lines: “Welcome to the world son, now run/Police gotta a gun.” Like their forebears in the ’70s funk group Parliament Funkadelic, Muldrow and Perkins relish the absurd, using sketches like “English Breakfast” to fuse music and theatrical narrative to cast a surreal light on injustice. On “Slave Revolt Soundtrack,” the slave characters murder the plantation owner and return “home,” speaking once again in their native African tongues. Inversely, lead single “Where I’m From” allow Muldrow and Perkins to proclaim their Africanness while living in modern-day America. Taking their cue from the Mothership Connection, they look to the past with reverence, navigating an uncertain future while remaining unapologetically themselves. The album’s second half shifts from strife to affection, a jump so immense that, on first listen, one might almost overlook the “love” side of Black Love & War. Highlights include “Fruitful” and “Big Mel,” where Muldrow’s sublimely minimalist production allow her powerful words to rise above the mix. Closing with these two songs instills hope that love is real—and more importantly, that in spite of our past struggles, black people are entitled to experience the full gamut of their humanity, right here in the actual present.","Equal parts manifesto and critique, the pair’s third musical collaboration pays homage to the sound and radical spirit of their West Coast home.

Port of Miami 2,Rick Ross,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3b5ea5e82cca0008d4d335/1:1/w_160/rickross_portofmiami2.jpg,2019-08-14 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rick-ross-port-of-miami-2/,Maybach Music GroupEpic,"Rick Ross’s 2006 debut Port of Miami was almost humble compared with what followed it. He indulged in plenty of Scarface fan fiction, yes, but the florid touches that would make Ross a superstar were a few years away. In retrospect, the gap between Port of Miami and “B.M.F.” is the difference between the first Fast & Furious, which was mostly a bunch of street races, and the newer ones, where they’re dropping cars out of helicopters and wrestling nuclear warheads away from international cyberterrorists. Perhaps the time was right for a sequel to Port of Miami, because over the last half decade, Ross has begun to return to Earth. Age has mellowed the rapper, taming the audacity that fueled his brush with greatness. He’s grown out of action-movie theatrics and toned down the chest-beating bluster of his early ’00s peak as he’s retreated ever-further into gilded luxury rap. He was once one of rap’s all-time great fabulists, but he no longer seems to have the energy to sustain any fantasy that requires him to change out of his velvet slippers and smoking robe. On Port of Miami 2, Ross no longer raps with an air of invincibility, either. When he suffered a pair of seizures on a plane in 2011, he brushed them off on 2012’s God Forgives, I Don’t as a product of an in-flight blowjob. To the extent that Ross even allowed himself to consider the afterlife back then, it was only to imagine it as another opportunity to show off his finest ride (“On the highway to heaven, can I let my top down?” he rapped). Compare that to Port of Miami 2’s emotional centerpiece “I Still Pray,” which opens with the image of Ross waking from a coma, tubes lodged in his throat. “You could have the biggest clique, but you gon’ die a loner,” he chastises himself. “What good is all the wealth, shitting on yourself?” On the album cover he clutches a photo of his manager Black Bo, who died of cardiovascular disease in 2017. Ross remains a sharp writer. On “Vegas Residency” he castigates Kanye’s MAGA moment (“Went from battle raps to now we wearin’ MAGA hats/Dade  County, nigga, mansions up in Tamarac/Never golfing with the Trumps and I give you my word”). And Port of Miami 2 offers a bounty of other pleasures, too, including fiery guest spots from Jeezy, Meek Mill, and the late Nipsey Hussle, who cuts down Tekashi 6ix9ine from beyond the grave on “Rich Nigga Lifestyle.” Even Wale, who’s sounded absolutely lost for much of the decade, locks in on “Act a Fool.” And then there’s “BIG TYME,” which lives up to its all-caps title, granting listeners the pleasure of hearing Swizz Beatz hype-man over a Just Blaze beat. Ross records are always great for moments like that. Other rappers give their fans red meat; Ross serves his Kobe. And yet there’s no getting around it: His presence is dulled. Ross used to put his back into his grunts, stringing together verses from contemptuous snarls. But too often on Port of Miami 2, he locks into the flow of least resistance and simply lets it ride, hiding behind his production instead of asserting his dominion over it. And while his music remains sumptuous as always, that luster alone is no longer enough to wow. You can only hear Ross turn the studio into a Cigar Aficionado cover shoot so many times before it loses its thrill.","Age has mellowed rap’s most audacious fabulist, and on the sequel to his breakout debut, he settles into his luxe sound like a pair of velvet slippers.

We Are Not Your Kind,Slipknot,by: Andy O'Connor,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d483a7c5cb984000a8d94f2/1:1/w_160/Slipknot_WeAreNotYourKind.jpg,2019-08-14 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/slipknot-we-are-not-your-kind/,Roadrunner,"Slipknot have no shortage of rallying cries, but nothing defines them quite like when lead singer Corey Taylor yells, “I’m all fucked up and I make it look good” on their sixth album, We Are Not Your Kind. They’ve made anguish look appealing throughout their two-decade career, finding worldwide success channeling unwieldy, messy anger. Though this is the first record without long-time percussionist Chris Fehn, it’s not as dramatic of  a shift in personnel as 2014’s .5: The Gray Chapter, which was marked by the death of bassist and founding member Paul Gray and the departure of powerhouse drummer Joey Jordison. For better or for worse, Kind is a Slipknot record, one that has more to offer than expected and is still sometimes frustratingly short-sighted. “Unsainted” is their signature angst-pop-rock in the vein of their hits “Wait and Bleed” and “Duality,” centered around Taylor’s melodic choruses. He’s aided by a choir, turning it into a reboot of the Rolling Stones’ “You Can’t Always Get What You Want” fueled by Midwest desolation. Its richness, part of Kind’s more detailed production, doesn’t dilute the angst Slipknot traffic in. “Birth of the Cruel” draws upon tension from industrial drum banging and tense guitar; the song’s explosion proves that they haven’t lost their unifying malaise. Though hampered by Taylor’s awkward spoken-word intro, “Solway Firth” takes that energy even further on perhaps the most intense track of their career. It’s part of the secret of their success from early on: Longtime guitarists Mick Thomson and Jim Root distilled underground death and black metal for suburban kids sacrificing their allowances to Sam Goody and too young for tape trading and MTV’s“Headbangers’ Ball,” forgoing intricacy for gut-bashing immediacy. (Listen to their self-titled record again if it’s been a while: You’ll pick up bits and pieces of Obituary, Morbid Angel, even a little Cradle of Filth.) They’re not the heretics that underground metal dudes (or even the band themselves) claim to be, they just made the underground more palatable. “Orphan”’s speed, fueled in part by drummer Jay Weinberg’s (son of Bruce Springsteen drummer Max) relentless bashing, alone should nip any metal G checks in the bud—they’re capable of totally unloading. Besides, Thomson has an Immolation tattoo, are you really gonna call him a poser? Slipknot know what works for them and they exploit it to a fault, but they’re also more wide-eyed than they’re given credit for. “My Pain” and “Not Long for This World” are both hazy and cavernous, the former’s dreamy electronics moving into the latter’s breathiness, like Portishead performing at the Iowa State Fair. Slipknot also try out some post-metal with “A Liar’s Funeral,” which focuses more on panned guitars, volume swells, and moodier drums. “Spiders” is the only flop in their experimentation, with its cabaret piano too hokey for a band that is essentially a macabre traveling carnival. It’s a painful reminder that they used to try a little too hard to be the zany heavy metal equivalent of Mr. Bungle in their early days. For arena-sized metal acts, even fewer and far between now, you could do much, much worse. The most curious mainstay are those turntable scratches, and while they flow nicely on the record, they do cast a harsh light on Slipknot’s missed opportunity to take advantage of metal and rap’s stronger alliance in 2019. Take for instance Ho99o9, an intense act who can square up against the hardest of any genre; Richmond’s Lil Ugly Mane is a gifted rapper who mainly plays to hardcore audiences because he grew up a hardcore kid. New York duo City Morgue play “Wait and Bleed” at their shows, which Taylor is aware of, and their aggression signals that they wore out a couple of copies of Slipknot’s landmark 2001 album Iowa at minimum. For all their experimentation, it’s disappointing Slipknot ignored hip-hop’s fruitful coexistence with heavy guitar music. It’s not as though Slipknot haven’t kept up with their audience. They’re pushing their own brand of whiskey, with full knowledge that “getting really into craft booze” is a typical path for aging metalheads. And their anger may not always rise above entry-level, but even that is hardly out of fashion. There’s something to be said for keeping that base rage with you, and it’s not an impediment on maturity: Taylor is a thoughtful frontman who recognizes his fanbases as a mish-mash of misfits, and he’s always appealed to their shared disenfranchisement. Even as masters of fan-service, they don’t condescend to their audience. For as much as they give, there’s an underlying feeling that they could be giving more, that the synthesis that made them ultimately limits where they go next.

Bumps & Bruises,Ugly God,by: Taylor Crumpton,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d4446f9b7933300085f826c/1:1/w_160/uglygod_bumps.jpeg,2019-08-14 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ugly-god-bumps-and-bruises/,Asylum,"Prior to TikTok, viral rap stars took off through SoundCloud and Vine. Lil Yachty, Lil Pump, and OG Maco—this first generation of meme rappers paved the way for the success of Lil Nas X while handing corporations a ready supply of appropriation-ready rap lyrics to keep pace with millennial consumption habits at the same time. Now that the first batch is getting older, we are learning which of them can actually rap without resorting to gimmicks. Ugly God belongs to this first wave. In 2015, the Houston rapper racked up more than 33 million hits on SoundCloud for the iPhone ringtone-sampling “I Beat My Meat,” spawning a mini-dance craze in the process. He hit the Billboard charts with his follow-up single “Water” and was inducted into the the 2017 edition of XXL’s Freshman Class. He appeared on singles alongside fellow XXL classmate PnB Rock as well as with rappers like Famous Dex, Lil Yachty, and Lil Pump. It was a good run, but two years is a long time in viral rap years, and Ugly God’s debut album Bumps & Bruises confirms everyone’s suspicions about the relationship between viral hip-hop fame and rapping abilities. Ugly God raps over his own production for the project’s 14 tracks, which makes the whole thing feel a lot longer than it is. The music is tinny and piecemeal and the raps are dull and repetitive in the worst possible way: “Went to college for the hoes, blew up then I dropped out,” he mumbles on “Jaguar.” He shows his money off for “bitches” and “hoes” in the most tired patriarchal way imaginable: On “For Real,” he follows “My diamonds on fleek/I’m on her neck like a leash” with the chorus “My old bitch cold like ice/My new bitch hot for real.” (Shoutout to the apparent hordes of women getting their bills paid, hair and nails done, and overall expenses handled by Ugly God.) Worst of all, he isn’t even funny, and humor was one of his only strengths. “I might make some Cajun/I fuck with Caucasians/My dick game amazing/Get served like a patient,” goes one numbing stretch from “Back to the Basics.” Not even the song called “HAHAHA!” gets a laugh: “Hahaha when you kiss your bitch right after she ate this semen, huh/Hahaha when you send me your music and I’m knowing I ain’t never gon’ stream it, huh.” Other than a guest feature from Migos’ Takeoff, the album’s only saving grace is “Bumps & Bruises (Interlude),” an under-two-minute track in which Ugly God raps about being one of meme rap’s pioneers and calls out the new generation for copying his playbook for success. Otherwise, it’s pretty clear that his social-media reign is over, and while it’s surreal to classify someone a has-been at the age of 22, Bumps & Bruises is a time capsule from the mid-2010s that should have stayed buried.","The meme rapper’s debut album confirms everyone’s suspicions about the relationship between viral hip-hop fame and rapping abilities.

So Divine,Horse Jumper of Love,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d44450104c06a00092f641d/1:1/w_160/horsejumper_sodivine.jpg,2019-08-14 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/horse-jumper-of-love-so-divine/,Run for Cover,"Minutes into Horse Jumper of Love’s second record, So Divine, it’s obvious why the Boston trio opened for slowcore legends Duster on their 2018 reunion tour. Both bands have an affinity for allowing the space between thoughts to germinate, until a molehill-sized musing becomes an impenetrable, towering glacier. But Horse Jumper of Love are not copying their predecessors as much as making similar ideas their own. Three years after their self-titled debut, the band’s pensive, downtempo rock has grown tighter, clearer, and at times—dare I say—brighter. Opening tracks “Airport” and “Volcano” begin where Horse Jumper of Love left off, crawling forward with unhurried momentum and quietly seething until their layers of heavy rhythms become unbearable. “Everything is freaking me out,” Dimitri Giannopoulos grouses on “Volcano” with an almost humorous nonchalance. Giannopoulos’ lyrics are impressionistic and threadbare fragments: plants splattered with yogurt, Dixie cups of rainwater, fingers stained by cherry pulp. Like another musician who found inspiration in gallery visitors, the standout “Poison” compiles observations from Giannopoulos’ time as a museum security guard into a surreal domestic drama (“I opened my legs so you can crawl through,” he sings, channeling a very patient father). Giannopoulos maintains that there’s no single objective meaning behind his lyrics, which makes the unambiguous couplet that comprises the subsequent “Cops” somewhat startling: “All the cops burst into tears of joy/When it’s announced we’re in a police state.” It’s an unexpected moment of candor from a band more comfortable with opacity, and as the song’s heavy instrumental outro gives way to the otherworldly wooziness of “Aliens,” its bluntness feels out of place. These songs rely on sedate, hypnotic repetition, and to succeed they require a tether, something to keep them from dissolving completely. While “Airport” and “Volcano” sustain themselves with incremental progression, songs like “Aliens” and “John Song” never fully emerge from the lo-fi haze. So Divine is at its strongest when moving forward, as on the standout “Ur Real Life,” which seesaws between distortion and restraint. “I feel OK/Under your real life,” Giannopoulos bashfully profeses, before the trio surge once more. “Nature,” the penultimate track, is a welcome departure from So Divine’s slow burn. Lush, twangy, and a tad bluesy, the song detonates into a sudden fray of noise and concludes with an understated profundity: “It was too visceral/I don’t know/If you’ll ever see it clearly.” Many slowcore bands’ minimalist lyrics walk a fine line between the heavy-handed and the abstract. Though Horse Jumper of Love occasionally brush against both extremes, they trudge on in search of balance.

!,Trippie Redd,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d405cfa87626200084cdbe3/1:1/w_160/trippieredd_cover.png,2019-08-13 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/trippie-redd-exclamation-point/,10K ProjectsCaroline,"To illustrate his chameleonic talents, the young Ohio rapper Trippie Redd has scheduled a slate of new albums: a rock record with Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker, and an as-yet-to-be-explained project that proposes to show off an “unknown” side of him. But first comes !, which he’s specifically described as “versatile music.” The plan is to prove there isn’t anything he can’t do. In his quest to be master of all, he falls woefully short. Redd says ! is an abbreviation for “immortal” and an homage to his late frenemy XXXTentacion’s album ?. Where X aimed for lo-fi emo-rap turned pop, Trippie is wholly without a target. He shoots from the hip in all directions with several misfires. EDM-smeared pop, woozy R&B, soul-rap, and melodic trap are touched on with nothing to tie these disparate threads together. The face-tatted howler leans heavily into his menacing TR666 alter ego, flipping back and forth between his signature lovesick persona and playing the nihilistic gangster. Between these poles, songs touch on being true to oneself at all costs, but these half-baked lessons land flat since Redd himself doesn’t really have an identity, musical or otherwise. Like many in his class of SoundCloud stars, Trippie defines himself by his melodies. He cites KISS and Nirvana as influences, and his songs are predicated on him finding a tune and then freestyling the lyrics. Most of what happens here couldn’t even realistically be considered rapping, which he might argue is further proof of his flexibility, but it diminishes the impact of his songs. His ! verses are dull and unimaginative on top of being restrictive in form. Tune in at any point and you’ll likely get a fumbled string of nonsense bars. “Tryna sink my damn thoughts with these trees/Like a bible open when I spread her legs like the seas,” he raps on a song called “Lil Wayne.” (There is no mention of the rapper and it isn’t indebted to him, stylistically or otherwise.) Redd gets out-barred by a seemingly non-committal Playboi Carti name-dropping a half-dozen brands in his baby voice. Redd wants the listener to believe him virtuosic, but he barely comes off as capable. ! was advertised to his fans as the more profound of two upcoming projects, which isn’t hard when the other one is called Mobile Suit Pussy. “I just have random spurts of wanting to record but I always want it to mean something; I always want it to be deep,” he told MIC/LINE. “I don’t want to just be doing shit blindly.” But listening to this album, you’d think the exact opposite were true. No Trippie Redd song could ever actually be described as “deep”—the most thoughtful ones are less philosophical than any one of Lil B’s Based Freestyles—but these, in particular, are jumbled and digressive and witless. He has claimed “Snake Skin” is about suicide prevention, and maybe it really is in some hyper-surreal dadaist way, but then, on the very next song, he raps, “Y’all all need to change, man y’all need some help/And if you can’t, on God, nigga kill yourself.” He is constantly contradicting himself. Nothing means anything. If nothing else, the exclamation of the title is in line with how Trippie Redd often performs; a cry of anger or pain that feels like an interjection. At his most effective, on “Mac 10” and “Immortal,” he harnesses that power. The most enjoyable moments feel like controlled chaos. Redd’s songs used to be looser and more free-flowing. He does at least sound more composed. That’s to his credit as a person but it’s not to his advantage as an artist.","Trippie Redd’s sprawling album is designed to show his versatility, but it’s not nearly wild enough to distract from its lack of coherent ideas.

Melt Away,Jadu Heart,by: Michelle Kim,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d406feb7943ca0008c15144/1:1/w_160/jaduheart_meltaway.jpg,2019-08-13 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jadu-heart-melt-away/,VLF,"From spiritual jazz legend Sun Ra to self-styled rap villain MF DOOM to the chrome-helmeted robots of Daft Punk, musicians seeking to cultivate mystery and intrigue have donned masks. Jadu Heart—the London duo of Alex Headford and Diva Jeffery—place themselves in this lineage, and they’re rarely seen without their masks, which resemble a more whimsical Donnie Darko bunny. The costuming is part of an elaborate backstory, equal parts “Legend of Zelda,” Indiana Jones, and the fever dream of a J Dilla disciple. As Jadu Heart tell it, their alter-egos Dina and Faro were cursed after they unwittingly touched a magic MPC in an abandoned temple. Their early EPs recalled the otherworldly beat music of Brainfeeder producer Teebs, incorporating aqueous warbles and clicks into glittering electronic pop. On their debut album Melt Away, the duo attempt to meet their self-mythology with immersive soundscapes that leave little impression. In the tradition of Gorillaz or Jai Paul, Jadu Heart’s borderless electronica eagerly welcomes hip-hop, R&B, chillwave, and psych-funk into the fold. Ukulele twangs, handclaps, and found-sound samples turn “The Cure” into a Maggie Rogers-esque blend of folk and dance, except with African drumming and a hip-hop breakdown. Producer Mura Masa (the duo’s label head) joins for the jazzy “U Never Call Me,” where elements like kalimba and a clave drum pattern point towards Afro-Cuban inspiration. Then there’s “Heroin Song,” which sounds like Oasis gone shoegaze. But just because Jadu Heart pull from multiple genres doesn’t mean their tracks are innovative. Most of their choices serve to create a wash of sound that all blends together. Jadu Heart have an ear for an intricate melody, but their vague lyrics never get a chance to be memorable. On “Forgotten Ghosts,” a disaffected Headford emotes sadness in melodramatic metaphors like, “We’ll go and feel the rain/Falling like an angel in the sea.” “Harry Brompton’s Ice Tea” refers to a brand of fruity beverage, though the song might also double as a metaphor for a psychedelic trip. “I’m drifting now, down through the river that’s made/Can you feel it,” the two sing over a smooth funk beat. But there are no clear narratives, no concrete imagery, no sense of the universe they’re attempting to reveal. After nearly an hour of reverbed guitar and synth, Melt Away ends with a breath of fresh air: a faithful cover of Vashti Bunyan’s 1970 song “Diamond Day,” sparingly accentuated by the flutter of violin strings and the childlike lilt of a recorder. But Jadu Heart’s remake betrays their weaknesses. As Headford and Jeffery reproduce Bunyan’s elegant quatrains, their own songs appear amateurish by comparison. Granted, there are a lot more instruments and production effects in a Jadu Heart song. But Bunyan found a timeless magic in the mundane that no amount of cosmic sound-design conjuring can match.

Blinded by the Light (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),Various Artists,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d42f6e15e721a00090fea6f/1:1/w_160/blindedbythelight.jpg,2019-08-13 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-blinded-by-the-light-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/,ColumbiaLegacy,"In the new movie Blinded By the Light, the lead character Javed is saved by rock’n’roll, delivered into salvation by two scuffed Bruce Springsteen cassette tapes. Born in the U.S.A. and Darkness on the Edge of Town transport Javed away from his dreary English hometown of Luton, suggesting all the directions his life could lead if he only followed the gospel of Springsteen. Generations of listeners have seen their own dreams reflected in the songs of Springsteen. For Javed, Springsteen is a lodestar, guiding him as he figures out how to develop a personality separate from his family. Teenage rebellion may be a cliché, but Javed isn’t merely interested in breaking curfew. He’s the son of Pakistani immigrants, whose father is determined to follow tradition in a new homeland—a country also populated with far-right skinheads who spit on Javed as he’s walking home. These scenes of racial discord anchor Blinded By the Light, offering a reminder that the movie isn’t entirely fiction. It’s a cinematic adaptation of Greetings From Bury Park, the 2007 memoir from Sarfraz Manzoor, a British journalist and documentarian, and its best moments are grounded in how Javed, the fictionalized version of Manzoor, squares his familial obligations with his own burgeoning dreams. The film has a less secure grasp on music—the catalyst for his emotional evolution—a problem accentuated on its accompanying soundtrack. Given the Springsteen’s centrality to the plot, the Blinded By the Light soundtrack taps into the deep reservoir of Boss classics written and recorded between 1975 and 1984. As part of his participation in the project, Springsteen gifted the producers “I’ll Stand By You,” a song he originally composed for the 2001 adaptation of Harry Potter & The Sorcerer’s Stone. The fact that “I’ll Stand By You” could be so easily swapped from a fantasy film to a coming-of-age comedy hints at how the song is a pro forma ballad in the vein of “Secret Garden,” Bruce’s smash from the Jerry Maguire soundtrack. “I’ll Stand By You” provides a sedate contemporary coda to the bustle of the film, murmuring reassuringly over the film’s credits and slotted toward the end of the soundtrack, after all the rousing, restless anthems have been aired. These are the songs you know by heart even if you’re not much of a fan, the songs that form the backbone of any Bruce greatest hits collection: “Dancing in the Dark,” “Badlands,” “Hungry Heart” and “Born to Run,” augmented by relative rarities of live versions of “Thunder Road” and “The River” from the 1970s. Tellingly, this list of Springsteen songs lacks anything from Tunnel of Love, the melancholy masterpiece released in 1987, which is when Blinded By the Light happens to be set. Its absence is deliberate. Tunnel of Love is steeped in middle-aged disappointment, not adolescent yearning, so its songs don’t quite suit Javed’s journey, but the deeper reason they’re missing is that it suits the film’s thematic purposes to have Springsteen portrayed as he was in his glory days of the late ’70s and early ’80s. That generous, working-class rebel stands in direct contrast to Javed’s world, whether it’s the Pakistani heritage at his home or the big-haired New Pop evangelicals on his campus. Neither camp understands Bruce. The father’s complaints are predictable, but the college DJ dismisses Springsteen as “history,” even though Born in the U.S.A. went triple platinum in the UK just three years prior. They may be on opposite sides of the cultural spectrum, but these naysayers are united in their belief that Springsteen says nothing about British life. All this helps paint Springsteen as a conduit to liberation, a theme the film handles with heavy hands by plastering lyrics on the screen and mocking anybody who believes synthesizers are the sound of the future. This didacticism trickles down to the soundtrack, where the Pet Shop Boys’ “It’s a Sin” and A-Ha’s “The Sun Always Shines on TV” help paint the steely, cold landscape of Thatcher’s Britain, while Heera’s pounding Mideastern disco cut “Maar Chadapa” and Amer Chadha-Patel’s stiff New Wave protest “Get Out of My Way Fascist (Pigs)” are no more than period accents. Bits of dialogue are scattered throughout the record to help make the case that Springsteen is not merely Javed’s savior, but protector: At one point, Javed and a friend chant the lyrics to “Badlands” as a way of warding off a bunch of racist louts. It’s a moment that’s crucial in the film but on record, it’s corny and clunky, as are all the dialogue snippets and the pair of drippy original songs from composer A.R. Rahman, for that matter. Both are contextually necessary, though, because without them, Blinded By the Light is a pretty rote Springsteen best-of collection, diligently hitting the expected beats but carrying none of the urgency, spectacle or grandeur of Bruce’s original albums. As they’re presented here, none of Springsteen’s songs have the power to change a life. Instead, they can merely soundtrack it.","The coming-of-age film reveals the life-changing power of some of Bruce Springsteen’s most famous songs, but its soundtrack doesn’t measure up.

Perfumed Earth,Purple Pilgrims,by: Madison Bloom,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d484bc8f01d89000931aeaf/1:1/w_160/PurplePilgrims_PerfumedEarth.jpg,2019-08-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/purple-pilgrims-perfumed-earth/,Flying Nun,"Purple Pilgrims evoke familiarity with a distant world—specifically, the woods of Tapu, the scenic coastal locality on the North Island of New Zealand where siblings Clementine and Valentine Nixon record their music. On Perfumed Earth, the pair spin their songs into myth, offering a self-contained suite of dream pop, folk, and cosmic jazz that’s far more evocative than the few words they sing. The album’s real triumph is in its lush melodies, strands that wind and splay like a carpet of vines. What the Nixon sisters sing is secondary to their rich harmonic brocade. As on their 2016 debut, Eternal Delight, Purple Pilgrims’ music conveys the region’s misty, fantastical appearance: fluorescent green sulfur pools, spouting waterfalls, and mossy cliffs. Though electric guitars and synthesizers appear throughout, many of these songs elicit an almost mystic appeal. The Nixons seem to inhabit another era; both women wear their hair long, with wardrobes worthy of Stevie Nicks. As they glide between a breathy middle range and unblemished soprano on “How Long Is Too Long,” their voices gently braid with filaments of synthesizer and pillowy bass. It’s hard not to dream up lofty, folkloric imagery to accompany titles like “Ancestors Watching,” a simple dirge that finds the sisters swapping lines of verse. Purple Pilgrims’ vocals provide more texture than context, but perhaps unintelligible lyrics are to their advantage. On “Sensing Me,” they sing of a man “as smooth as avocado” and ask him: “Where are you from and what’s your sign?/And do you think you could guess mine?”—the type of pick-up line likely to break the spell of even the most pristine beach. One of Perfumed Earth’s best songs has no words at all: On the five-minute astral jazz interlude “Delphiniums in Harmony/Two Worlds Away,” spare guitar frames a lean saxophone, and they trail off together like ripples across a pond. The drifting “Ruinous Splendour” allows experimental composer Roy Montgomery’s de-tuned guitar plucks to balance the Nixons’ coos with a necessary tartness. This modest collection of songs allows ample time to wander a strange and beautiful place, if only in the imagination. Purple Pilgrims may have no particular destination in mind, but their incantatory voices have the power to transport.

Live 1969,Elvis Presley,by: Allison Hussey,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d48595d93a6c9000801503a/1:1/w_160/Elvis_Live1969.jpg,2019-08-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/elvis-presley-live-1969/,RCALegacy,"In the summer of 1972, Elvis Presley released “Burning Love,” a soaring number written by Dennis Linde. Despite the song’s frisky sensibility, the supposed King of Rock and Roll sounds exhausted as he strains to hit the notes. The song was his last Top 10 single in the United States. Nearly five years to the day from its release, Presley was expiring alone on a bathroom floor. But before “Burning Love” lit up the charts for the King one last time, Presley re-launched his music career with 29 shows at the Las Vegas International Hotel in the swelter of August 1969. Recordings of 11 consecutive performances from the tail end of that run are stitched together in a new 50th anniversary box set, Live 1969. With Woodstock, the Beatles, the Kinks, the Doors, and David Bowie also receiving the golden-anniversary treatment this year, the 11-disc Presley collection only adds to the nostalgic bloat. But it also offers a peculiar opportunity to put one of pop music’s all-time megastars under the microscope. As Presley explains every night, the Vegas appearances were his first live shows in nearly nine years, having occupied the previous decade with his film career and Army draft obligation. Throughout the run, he was backed by a massive ensemble that included his core five-piece band, a full orchestra, and two groups of backup vocalists: the Imperials and the Sweet Inspirations. In a brief August 1969 essay about the spectacle, rock critic Ellen Willis described Presley as “a grown man in black bell-bottoms, tunic, and neckerchief, devoid of pout and baby fat, skinny, sexy, totally alert, nervous, but smiling easily.” He was ready to reign again, and 2,000 people a night were ready to receive him. Listening to all 13 hours of Live 1969 is ridiculous thing to do, but the time investment exposes the collection’s biggest shortcoming. The most magical live recordings highlight moment-to-moment chemistry between a band’s players, with each new arrangement shaped by circumstances of space and time—not to mention the sobriety and moods of the personnel and their audiences. Spontaneity can unspool hidden nuances in a deep cut or inject fresh energy into an old favorite. But the strategic nature of a nothing-but-hits Vegas show leaves little room for any of the non-Presley performers to show off their own impressive chops. Still, the band consistently rallies for the then-unreleased “Suspicious Minds,” which Willis reported as a late-set highlight. The kinds of delights that stand out on most bootlegs are buried on Live 1969. They’re there: the haunting operatic filigrees a backup singer adds to each edition of “Are You Lonesome Tonight,” an especially hard-boogieing dinner-show iteration of “Suspicious Minds,” the way the drummer pummels the floor toms on every “Mystery Train/Tiger Man” medley, some fine honky-tonk piano in a midnight kickoff of “Blue Suede Shoes.” Though he’d issued plenty of hit records by 1969, Presley sticks to near-identical set lists of guaranteed crowd-pleasers, plus a nightly nod to the Beatles with a medley of “Yesterday” and the coda from “Hey Jude.” Listening to every performance in order feels like a game of Spot the Difference for dedicated Elvis obsessives. While his band may have been seasoned professionals, Presley’s moods range from lovable scamp to frazzled kook, making for a colorful display of the singer’s profoundly weird character. One need not go far to get an idea of Presley’s eccentricities, but it’s still surprising to hear them fall from his curled lips. Like most busy performers, he repeats his yarns from one show to the next. He marvels at the Showroom’s “li’l funky angels” and “weirdo dolls on the walls” and makes liberal use of the phrase “woolly booger” to describe everything from his bandmates to actual boogers. All the while, Presley snorts and sniffles an alarming amount of phlegm, peppering in urgent hisses of “Back! Back!” and “Whassat?” amid clicking noises and requests for “wawa.” Some of Presley’s ad-libbed asides, however, can be laugh-out-loud funny. Noting Las Vegas’ desert conditions, Presley remarks that he’s so parched it feels like “Bob Dylan slep’ in ya mouth”; at another show, he informs the audience of “a little bitty dead lizard” sharing his stage. He distributes innumerable cartoonish wet smacks to ecstatic women demanding kisses. He tweaks the memorable refrain of “Heartbreak Hotel” into an even more memorable, “I get so horny I could die.” Whether these outbursts are a result of drugs or just Presley’s natural state is indiscernible. Aside from the extemporaneous musings, Live 1969’s sprawl offers little new insight about Presley’s life, mind, or music. According to the fine print in the liner notes, most of this material has already been issued piecemeal in some form already, some as recently as 2013. Presley’s Vegas residency was designed to propel his career into a new era, but the show-by-show repetition of the Live 1969 recordings stalls their momentum. Presley had no way of knowing that his comeback would fail within a decade; with a half-century of hindsight, listening to Live 1969 feels both bittersweet and anticlimactic. Despite their length, the interchangeable sets of Live 1969 merely skim the surface of Presley’s odd inner life and taxing career, the twin engines that would hurtle him toward disaster. In 2019, Presley has been dead for 42 years—the same number he spent alive—and his shadow still looms over the world’s models of pop stardom. What remains to learn from Elvis? What’s left to parse in the ten thousandth recording of “Don’t Be Cruel,” in his career-long marriage of lust and loneliness, in the way he pontificates on li’l funky angels and woolly boogers? In a way, consuming Live 1969 in its entirety feels like a hint of what it might’ve been like to be Elvis Presley: intemperate, self-indulgent, and more than a little surreal.

Superbloom,Ra Ra Riot,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cdf5a91f2bde61783aad2c1/1:1/w_160/Superbloom.jpg,2019-08-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ra-ra-riot-superbloom/,CarolineRob the Rich,"Ra Ra Riot are perhaps doomed to permanent association with a certain crop of verbose, precocious pop-rock acts, dating to around the time of their unofficial debut at the 2006 CMJ festival. But few of their peers have had Ra Ra Riot’s longevity—last year, the band toured in honor of the 10th anniversary of their debut LP—and over the past decade, they’ve explored electronic sounds and more ambitious production techniques, to mixed results. On 2016’s Need Your Light, they seemed to finally strike a balance between Beta Love’s outlandish synth pop and The Orchard’s overwrought orchestration. The band enlisted a litany of producers and writing collaborators for their latest album, Superbloom, but amid the layered arrangements and slick songwriting, Ra Ra Riot seem to once again have lost their sense of identity. Named for a botanical phenomenon that produces an abundance of wildflowers, Superbloom is awash in bright excess. Heavily reverbed backing vocals and larger-than-life synth lines provide enough flourishes to drown out any attempt at restraint. “Belladonna” begins innocently enough, with Rebecca Zeller’s staccato strings and a buzz of handclaps and kick drums. But the chorus drops any pretense of subtlety, introducing a rollicking bassline, a stack of backing synths, and a chorale of “ohs” befitting of a “We Are the World” cover. It feels unwarranted, even before the Japanese spoken-word interlude. “Bitter Conversation,” the first side’s other biggest attraction, opens with a faux radio-dial effect and crashes into a chorus of DayGlo synths. In a song already crammed with ornamentation, even a little extra Auto-Tune is enough to be exhausting. But Ra Ra Riot can’t commit to their dance-pop tendencies, either. The band recorded Superbloom in multiple sessions on opposite coasts, and the record struggles to bridge the differences. Songs recorded in Los Angeles with frequent collaborator Rostam Batmanglij tend towards a kind of weightless decadence. But tracks recorded in frontman Wes Miles’ childhood home in New Jersey take on an almost self-consciously gritty streak. “Endless Pain/Endless Joy,” a claustrophobic punk number that morbidly puts Miles “at the Sandman’s door,” is full of crunchy riffs and screams. After three tracks that rival the Cinematic Orchestra in their instrumental overload, it feels like whiplash. According to Miles, Superbloom represents an East Coast band’s vision of California. Its lyrics, crafted with a legion of co-writers boasting impressive pop CVs, are starry-eyed Hollywood clichés: beautiful women on Italian motorcycles, working-class love affairs, dramatic scenes of lovers driving off into the night. They aim for the life-or-death melodrama of Lana Del Rey (Superbloom co-writer Dean Reid worked on several songs on Lust for Life), then collapse into platitudes (“love is blind”) or pleas to “make love.” Even Miles’ lithe falsetto cannot conjure the necessary theatrics. Despite—or perhaps because of—its tightly wound riffs and booming drumline, closer “A Check for Daniel” finally finds a comfortable fit. Driven by distorted guitar and a frantic vocal, it recalls the eagerness and excitement that distinguished Ra Ra Riot when they first appeared. It’s a welcome jolt of anxious energy, evidence that the band need not sacrifice authenticity for enthusiasm.

Mushrooms & Coloring Books,Nef the Pharaoh,by: Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d4059242d5df30009bbaa88/1:1/w_160/nefthepharaoh_coloringbook.jpeg,2019-08-12 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nef-the-pharaoh-mushrooms-and-coloring-books/,Sick Wid ItEMPIRE,"Nef The Pharaoh is a rapper in the finest Vallejo tradition, making music that simultaneously pays tribute to and transcends his regional ancestors. History doesn’t weigh Neffy down, it drives him: “I’m the closest thing you’re going to get to Mac Dre,” he boldly announces on the intro to “Drought,” from new tape Mushrooms & Coloring Books. Line up their music on the same playlist, and it’s easy to make an argument that Nef is the heir apparent, but he also seems primed for stardom beyond his home base. Regrettably, the latest tape shows growing pains, mostly due to the potential blockbuster tracks flat-lining. Take the single “High Voltage”: Guest rapper Tyga’s voice scrapes off producer DTB’s creeping beat like sandpaper. Worse still, Tyga’s cretinism seems to have infected Nef, who makes transgender people a punch line and drops dumb lyrics like, “Even when I’m at the house I’m paranoid/I don’t trust you if you don't fuck my boy.” “Rockstar” finds Nef envisioning big-time living—dodging paparazzi, clashing with label executives, and that’s before you get to the sex and drugs—but the fantasy deflates over a soft music-box beat. He sounds like he’s trying to force a breakthrough hit, and it dims his usually strong instincts. But when you block out the misjudged moments, Mushrooms & Coloring Books features some Nef’s most exhilarating songs yet. Nef shouts out his favorite liquor store and calls out the local cops over DJ Fresh’s Cali funk on “South Vallejo.” And the star quality he has been searching for is all over “Love Got Us Beefin,” with Nef shuffling through vocal styles to decry a collapsing relationship with his high-school sweetheart over a glittering beat that recalls Prince’s “Diamonds and Pearls.” You can just feel how eager he is to break out nationally, and you can’t help but want it for him. Maybe next time he will dial down the impatience and keep his heart at home.","On his new mixtape, the Vallejo upstart sounds a little too eager to break out of his home base.

11 Items,Pontiac StreatorUlla Straus,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d4870eaf01d89000931aeb9/1:1/w_160/11items_ulla.jpg,2019-08-12 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pontiac-streator-ulla-straus-11-items/,West Mineral Ltd.,"Ambient labels are generally contemplative, serious endeavors, from Brian Eno’s Obscure and Haruomi Hosono’s Monad to early chill-out imprints like em:t, each intently mapping out soundworlds and then fully immersing themselves in them. So when Brian Leeds set up the West Mineral Ltd. imprint last year, it seemed on the surface to further the ambient tracks he makes as Huerco S. and Pendant. But each new entry on the label seems to question the very nature of ambient music. Can it only be calming and relaxing? Is it only chill? Can’t it also be a little funny? And might ambient also embrace those decidedly non-chill feelings of anxiousness, alienation, and nausea? Leeds and friends plumb that dread zone with every new release. The music crafted by the mysterious duo of Pontiac Streator and Ulla Straus has mostly been relegated to limited cassettes, until last year’s tantalizing yet too brief Chat EP, which showcased their penchant for goopy, 4th-world excursions. Now, given a full-length album, they craft something with classic ambient earmarks as well as off-kilter addenda—vocals clipped so as to render everyday language strikingly alien and hand drums that melt like spilled mercury with every hit—so that 11 Items sounds disquietly immersive and uneasy. That sort of intangible quality gives 11 Items an unsettling feel, a world wholly inside a funhouse mirror. The fraught, reedy male voice bubbling up on “Item 7” could get mistaken for a Thom Yorke track, especially with the metallic thrums and fidgety circuitry churning in the background. But what to make of the applauding studio audience that keeps surfacing? The heavy bass, digital squelches, and ritualistic drums of “Item 3” bring to mind something like Miles Davis’ “Black Satin,” but Streator and Straus neither let the track gather velocity nor density, letting its elements instead slither away. “Item 3” strikes a perfect balance between hand percussion, stretched out electronics, and the distant sound of birds in the trees. The latter part of the album most closely adheres to the template of Selected Ambient Works Volume II, full of foggy lullaby melodies, submerged voices, and unsourced noises that border on the nightmarish, as on “Item 10.” And “Item 1” features shimmering, floating keyboard chords that on their own would be relaxing, only to have the duo ladle atop it slippery drums and a slurred mechanical voice. Add to it some bird chirps and a mechanical whirring not unlike a rotating sprinkler head working overtime, it imparts a leaden feel like getting drunk too fast on a hot summer day. In the interplay of voices on “Item 8,” it brings to mind the push-pull of ‘90s R&B tracks like this one: chirpy female coos and bassy masculine tones (think Timbaland’s uh-huh elongated into a lecherous groan), all cooked down to a viscous substance. But there’s another sample saying “No fucking way!” that continually knocks the mood off balance. Elsewhere, a hiccuping voice—after three minutes of just spitting out “OK”—finally spits out “OK, I just downloaded it.” Which is funny in its own peculiar way, even if you don’t choose to download it. Rather than simply use their loops and effects to cast a mesmerizing spell, Streator and Straus are just as happy to rupture it.

Buckingham Nicks,Buckingham Nicks,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3b5b85f1c63b0008a3cb23/1:1/w_160/buckinghamnicks_buckinghamnicks.jpg,2019-08-11 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/buckingham-nicks-buckingham-nicks/,Polydor,"There they are on the cover, in a black-and-white photograph: young and naked and impossibly beautiful, two people whose early work, in the popular imagination, was viewed almost exclusively through the prism of their mutual desire. We came to know Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks through music that, we were told, cataloged their conflict and heartbreak; here, on this sleeve, they are one, practically a single being. By the time that Buckingham Nicks came out in September 1973, Lindsey and Stevie had been making music in bands and as a duo for five years, and had known each other for longer. They first sang together in 1966, when they both attended Menlo-Atherton High School in Palo Alto, at a church function for aspiring musicians. He banged out the chords to “California Dreaming” on piano, a current hit by the Mamas and the Papas, and she joined him on harmony. Two years later, Lindsey invited Stevie to join a band called Fritz with two of his boyhood friends. She was fronting the group by the summer of 1968. Nicks was 19, and her heroes included Janis Joplin and Grace Slick; Buckingham was 18, a Beatles nut who also had an ear for folk music, particularly the Kingston Trio. Fritz was a catch-all of the various styles in the Bay Area at the time—some organ-backed garage rock, a bit of psychedelia that bled into cosmic blues. You can listen to some of their music online, including a cover of “Born to Be Wild” and a studio session of one of the group’s original songs, “Take Advantage of Me.” Even this early, Nicks has one of the most immediately identifiable voices in rock, low and deep, like it’s bubbling up from her unconscious. She can sound vulnerable but rarely fragile, and when she’s singing something upbeat, as she does here, she sounds commanding. Fritz scored some big opening gigs—Joplin, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Santana—and they had enough buzz by 1971 that Keith Olsen, a young record producer from Los Angeles who worked out of a dumpy studio called Sound City, flew up to see them. Olsen wasn’t particularly impressed with the band, but he liked Lindsey and Stevie and offered to work with them as a duo. That was the end of Fritz, and the start of Buckingham Nicks. The pair spent the first few months working on their own, making demos on a four-track reel-to-reel in a spare room at the coffee plant in Daly City owned by Buckingham’s father. Every night, after the workers left, the two would gather with their instruments to write and record. Buckingham became obsessed with the possibilities of recording, experimenting with how sounds were layered and mixed. Nicks had a feel for the shape of melodies and an ear for words that drew from her interest in mysticism but also seemed applicable to everyday life. By the time they made their way down to Los Angeles to work with Olsen in 1972, they had a seven-song demo. Olsen dubbed the tape and circulated it, but there were no takers, so they continued to hone their material, often at Sound City, where Olsen gave them free studio time. Nicks was the breadwinner—she cleaned Olsen’s house, waited tables at the Copper Penny, and hostessed at Big Boy while Buckingham smoked enormous amounts of hash in their apartment, working through musical ideas. They fought, and Lindsey could be verbally abusive, but they stayed focused. After about a year of this, Olsen finally secured them a deal, and Buckingham Nicks made its way into the world. James Taylor and Carole King were stars, Joni Mitchell was a critic’s favorite, and Buckingham adored Cat Stevens: This was the context in which Buckingham Nicks operated. Loosely, it was folk-rock, but they brought a primal energy to it that would inform their later work. Listening now, you get the uncanny feeling you’re hearing vintage Fleetwood Mac hits that you just somehow forgot about. Nicks’ “Crying in the Night,” about a woman in a relationship who has a wandering eye, stands alongside her best Fleetwood Mac contributions. Her “Long Distance Winner” is also Mac-like, while Buckingham renders finger-picked guitar as if it were three-chord garage rock. Buckingham’s finest songs point to his later triumphs. His voice strains in its higher register on the chorus of “Without a Leg to Stand On,” while the tune itself feels effortless, as if built by machine. This tension between methodical craft and drunk-on-music abandon would become his signature. To that end, “Don’t Let Me Down Again” sounds like a dry run of Rumours’ opener “Second Hand News.” This pair was famous for writing angry music about each other, but Lindsey titled “Stephanie” after Stevie’s birth name, and said everything he wanted to say through his guitar. The delicate piece glimmers like a rose window and offers a microcosm of Buckingham’s painstaking approach to composition. In the last decade, Buckingham has taken to playing it in concert. The gentle ballad “Crystal,” written by Stevie but sung by Lindsey, would get another life when it was carried over to Fleetwood Mac, and remains a moving example of how their voices blended together. Their harmonies embodied multiplicity: one voice conveying acceptance, the other wondering about what else might be out there. Each could play either role. Lindsey is the steadying force on “Crystal,” outlining the shape of Nicks’ song as she colors outside of it. Christine McVie’s keyboards would give it an extra twist of feeling on the more famous version, but everything the song needs is found here. There was a lot of competition in the singer-songwriter field in 1973, and Buckingham Nicks wasn’t the best of the lot, but it’s excellent, and it’s still puzzling how swiftly it vanished. It’s packed with top-flight session musicians—Waddy Wachtel on guitar, Jim Keltner on drums—and was recorded by Olsen, a producer with dozens of gold and platinum records ahead of him, but it was a complete failure. Promotion was light, the few reviews were mostly bad, and Polydor dropped the duo a few months after the album came out. After a five-year build-up, the moment was over as quickly as it started. But Stevie and Lindsey were writing for their next album even before this one was finished. Lindsey had penned “Monday Morning,” and Nicks, inspired by a passage in a book about a Welsh witch, had a stunning new song called “Rhiannon.” There was another ballad called “Landslide.” They weren’t ready to give up on Buckingham Nicks, which made the next decision difficult. In December 1974, Mick Fleetwood of Fleetwood Mac received news that his guitarist, Bob Welch, was quitting the band. Line-up changes were nothing new—in their seven-year history, they’d already been through several—but Fleetwood’s band was due back in the studio soon. He’d heard Lindsey play once, and Keith Olsen, with whom he was friendly, mentioned his name. It didn’t take long before he offered Buckingham the job. Lindsey was reticent, afraid of giving up what he and Stevie had built together. He said that Nicks would have to be part of the deal. After having dinner with the members of Fleetwood Mac in January 1975, they both agreed to join. After this, things would get both easier and harder. Everything about Fleetwood Mac would be soap operatic—grand pianos carted into luxury suites while on tour, a road manager with onstage cocaine at the ready, intra-band couplings and breakups that kept the group on the edge of dissolution, even while they were selling millions of records. But here it was just the two of them, years deep into their dream of a life in music, writing songs that mattered to them and that they dared to hope might matter to someone else.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

The Search,NF,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d4864ac04c06a00092f65da/1:1/w_160/NF_TheSearch.jpg,2019-08-10 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nf-the-search/,NFREALMUSICCaroline,"While most of the hip-hop universe spent last week breathlessly debating Chance the Rapper’s event album The Big Day, that record was quietly outsold by an act almost completely off the radar of the general public: Michigan rapper NF, whose The Search became his second consecutive No. 1 album. NF has cemented himself as the biggest Christian rap star since Lecrae, and yet even with a No. 1 pop song under his belt—his sentimental 2017 crossover hit “Let You Down”—he’s a ghost to most of the secular world. Rap radio doesn’t play him. The music press barely acknowledges him. It’s no mystery where NF’s following comes from. He’s a lyrical, white, and Christian rapper in an industry where all three identities can provide a fast track to a devoted audience. It doesn’t hurt that he models himself after perhaps the most successful white rapper of all time: Eminem, whose brooding persona and twisty delivery NF copies with the reverence of a 16th-century Japanese painter replicating the masters. Like Eminem, NF draws from his traumatic childhood, never shying from ugly thoughts or inner demons. And like Eminem, he’s from the technical school of rap, where the height of artistry is cramming as many syllables and as much internal rhyme into each bar as possible, nuance be damned. The only real daylight between the two is that NF doesn’t swear. NF also shares Eminem’s shrillness and distorted sense of volume, rapping like he’s putting on the world’s loudest Punch and Judy show. He spends much of The Search darting in and out of an overbearing rappity-rap snarl-yell that can cut right through you if you don’t relate to his roiling anger. “Last year I felt suicidal, this year I might do something different like talking to God more,” he roars on “Change,” as the track unleashes sheets of Imagine Dragons-esque thunder, swelling like a gospel song. Later, “I Miss the Days” makes the gospel connection explicit with an actual choir. The Search is a dark record. NF may be a Christian rapper, but his primary muse is misery, not faith, and although he uses too many words, he doesn’t mince them: His struggles with mental illness are life-threatening. On “Hate Myself,” he pictures himself in hell, where he belittles his own corpse: “You ain’t nothin’ but poor and weak.” On “Leave Me Alone,” he’s undone by obsessive-compulsive thoughts, like a character in an Edgar Allen Poe story. And on “Like This,” “Trauma,” and a few other somber tracks where he isn’t scream-rapping, NF begins to sound less like Eminem and more like Mac Miller circa Swimming, maybe the last major rap record that was this blunt about its creator’s longing to escape his suffering. And like Swimming, listening to The Search induces a feeling of powerlessness: How are we supposed to respond to an album that often reads like a suicide note? At least some listeners are finding comfort in this music. On a Reddit forum dedicated to the rapper, a small community of fans post about how seen and comforted NF makes them feel, sharing hopeful memes and heartfelt testimonials. If nothing else, it’s a relief to see that something constructive has come from his pain. But the considerable chunk of the listening public that remains unaware of NF’s music may want to stay that way. The Search is an unpleasant ride.

The Soft Cavalry,The Soft Cavalry,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d41ab33d1464a00080dde42/1:1/w_160/thesoftcavalry_thesoftcavalry.jpg,2019-08-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-soft-cavalry-the-soft-cavalry/,Bella Union,"The old “this isn’t a side project” cliché applies a bit differently to the Soft Cavalry, a UK band centered around the married duo Rachel Goswell and Steve Clarke. Already revered as the sighing singer-guitarist of reunited ’90s dream-pop trailblazers Slowdive and their country-folk successor, Mojave 3, Goswell has built on that legacy in recent years with a low-key supergroup, Minor Victories, and as a guest on new albums from American Football and Mercury Rev. Her ethereal presence is unmistakable on the Soft Cavalry’s self-titled debut. But the dominant voice here belongs to Clarke, who played in various lesser-known acts before meeting Goswell while tour-managing for Slowdive in 2014. The Soft Cavalry arrives less as a Slowdive extracurricular activity than as a new outlet for Clarke, whose brother and former bandmate Michael Clarke produces. Along with Midlake/Mercury Rev keyboardist Jesse Chandler, the lineup also includes a drummer who has collaborated with the Clarke siblings on other projects (including backing Ricky Gervais in a 2016 mockumentary film). The resulting collection of cavernous electro-rock, elaborately adorned psych-pop, and winsome ambient-folk is polished and professional-sounding, but it’s also as tedious and unmemorable as the group’s name. There are glimmers of promise. Lead singles “Dive” and “Bulletproof,” also the album’s opening one-two punch, set Steve Clarke’s wispy, overly processed lead vocals and Goswell’s glassy harmonies amid click-tracked gloom that’s passably reminiscent of Radiohead’s early-’00s followers like Doves. Slowdive fans should welcome Goswell’s lead vocal on the pastoral lullaby “Passerby,” though the song is also an example of how the type of nature metaphors often used to describe her other band are something of a tic in Clarke’s lyrics, as “mountains peak,” “rivers flow,” and “waters break.” Within this lane of poe-faced, British-style, aughts-throwback indie rock, the album doesn’t lack for variety. “Never Be Without You” is a jangling love song that reaches for the Cure but falls short. “Only in Dreams” is drumless and meditative, with fluttering woodwinds. “Mountains” is a painfully cheesy neo-psych power ballad. The biggest departure is “Careless Sun,” which drapes Clarke’s and Goswell’s vocals in vocoder-like effects, though with its orchestral bombast and portentous lyrics about “ancient prophecies,” it’s also the album’s worst clunker. Most songs are brooding and midtempo, underpinned by one-finger piano lines and bland drum programming, repeating undistinguished metaphors longer than concision might demand. The title of romantic duet “The Velvet Fog” happens to be American crooner Mel Tormé’s nickname, but the song’s trudging pomp-rock recalls any number of early-millennium UK hype bands that most people have rightly forgotten. Finale “The Ever Turning Wheel” is an arena-scale, seven-minute enactment of a commonplace lyrical concept about a wheel that’s “not slowing down.” On the same song, Clarke also urges, awkwardly, “Keep your head above the water that is rising.” The most intriguing non-single on The Soft Cavalry is “Spiders.” Although still a little ponderous, and at least a minute too long, the song works because the ideas behind it are as remarkable as the album’s always-lavish production. The bass line is so bare and jagged that it’s almost a hook, and the lyrics, which I hear as comparing a new love to two spiders building a fresh web together, are genuinely unusual. “Leave our webs,” Goswell and Clarke’s voices intone, “Begin again/Like spiders.” It’s a shame their first album as an artistic unit isn’t as compelling, but with luck and a little inspiration, there will be more silk to spin.","Though the ethereal presence of Slowdive’s Rachel Goswell is unmistakable, the UK band’s self-titled debut is often tedious.

Any Human Friend,Marika Hackman,by: Sophie Kemp ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cfeb75b39bb0c575bdf5252/1:1/w_160/AnyHumanFriend_MarikaHackman.jpg,2019-08-10 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/marika-hackman-any-human-friend/,Sub PopAMF,"In Marika Hackman’s telling, life as a twenty-something in a major city means nights where you kiss strangers, consume substances, and stay up until it becomes light again. It also means nights where you stay inside of your apartment and talk to no one. This polarity is the basis of the British singer-songwriter’s third album, Any Human Friend, which is a singular, extraordinarily horny, and occasionally bleak pop record largely about the complexities of queer desire. Hackman is not interested in being coy or mincing words. As a result, there is much sex to be had within the album’s 40 minutes. On “All Night,” she coos “Kissing (eating)/Fucking (moaning)” in multi-tracked harmonies while a guitar screeches atop languid synths. The snarkily titled “Hand Solo” is about, well, sex for one: “It’s all right/I’m jerking!” goes one extremely emblematic line. Jokes aside, “Hand Solo” is also about feeling lovelorn: “It’s hard to be alone,” she sings at the start, adding “I love this” moments later. You can feel the anomie creeping in as the song rides out its disaffected groove, sounding like pop rock by way of a chilled-out Annie Clark or Hélöise Letissier. As far as straight-up pop goes, “Blow” is the closest Hackman has come. She has dipped her toe into writing big hooks before, but “Blow” is her most committed and fully realized effort, with thumping drums, a Strokesean guitar snarl, and a very Italians Do It Better synth part. It’s relatively new territory for her, and it suits her coolly unimpressed alto. There are a few dull moments, like “Conventional Ride,” which explores how it feels to be the object of other people’s sexual curiosity. The lyrics are less cutting and sly than Hackman is capable of, especially considering how adept she can be at tackling the difficulties of being a queer woman under the straight gaze. The broad sloganeering of “The One” draws laughs and eyerolls: Hearing Hackman refer to her audience as “fuckers [that] want my dick” is a little much, and a joke about BDE being a venereal disease feels more like a tweet from the summer of 2018 than it does a line in a song, but it gets a laugh nonetheless. Any Human Friend reaches its high point with the quietest song. “Send My Love” is not a love song, but it is about love, and what it means to be betrayed by someone you trusted. Hackman sounds totally at peace as she asks, “Did you love me tonight/Or any night of our lives?” This is the continuum that Hackman’s record lives inside: those quiet moments of reckoning with what it means to be alive, young, and cautiously enamored of it all.

"i,i",Bon Iver,by: Matthew Strauss,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d387a4d0ad9a70009255904/1:1/w_160/BonIver_ii.jpg,2019-08-09 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bon-iver-ii/,Jagjaguwar,"Bon Iver has always been Justin Vernon’s escape route. After retreating to the woods of Wisconsin to record For Emma, Forever Ago, he drew a surrealist roadmap of the United States on Bon Iver, depicting a fantastical world where the lived, the dreamed, and desired coexisted. When this invented land felt oppressive and the anxiety of facing it too overwhelming, Vernon retreated again and burrowed within himself, pulverizing his voice with machines to create 22, A Million, a record that dramatized the fracturing of the self. There’s no more hiding on i,i. Justin Vernon takes the Bon Iver sound and reassembles it like a cubist collage, with his voice right out front. All the familiar elements are here—impressionist swells of sound, impenetrable-yet-tender lyrics, mesmerizing studio tricks—and they are buoyed by Vernon’s supple baritone, the instrument he knows how to manipulate best. Acoustic guitar, horns, and piano return to prominence alongside the jittery electronics and synths that Vernon has lately favored. But the mood he conjures with these elements feels new. These songs don’t swallow you whole with grandeur; they look outward, leaving some room for the rest of the world. The lyrics find Vernon locating peace within the ordinary and everyday. “I like you/And that ain’t nothing new,” he sings simply on “iMi.” Later, on “RABi,” he observes, “Well, it’s all just scared of dying.” These things don’t always merit saying out loud, but Vernon seems to be singing them to rediscover their meaning, and the music feels equally straightforward and searching. Songs like “Marion” and “Holyfields,” are uncharacteristically unadorned, even compared to the For Emma and Blood Bank era, when Vernon was at least joined by his own echoes. Here, he sounds completely exposed. Still, there are plenty of invited guests to provide cover, or at least offer their company. James Blake, Moses Sumney, and Wye Oak’s Jenn Wasner, among others, pop up throughout. Even Young Thug collaborator Wheezy has composing and production credits. Vernon sampled the voices of others on 22, A Million, but in that context they felt more like dolls he’d animated than human beings. The guests on i,i, meanwhile, are allowed to breathe. Bruce Hornsby might sing only one line on the single “U (Man Like),” but his presence is enlivening. It’s less lonely to have friends nearby. Vernon himself sings with more texture and conviction than ever before. He’s shifted fully from vessel to commander, steering the music instead of seeping into it. A song like “Naeem” is filled with production flourishes—a soft backing choir, faint samples, the sort of military drums favored on Bon Iver’s “Perth”—yet it all serves to highlight the booming sound of Vernon’s voice, bellowing in his natural range. The lyrics to “Naeem” are dizzying and, at points, indecipherable (“I fall off a bass boat/And the concrete’s very slow”), but he isn’t hiding behind them. It’s more like Vernon is suggesting that only feeling can offer truth. On “Naeem,” he sings, “Tell them I’ll be passing on/Tell them we’re young mastodons,” dragging his words in the second line until you can almost hear him choking up. Like all the best moments in his catalog, it is inexplicably touching. i,i is often about trying to reconnect with some idea of a true self, even as you move forward. Vernon writes of scars and things lost: “You were young when you were gave it,” he sings on “We,” a line that speaks to his ability to summon powerful elegiac feelings with a few simple words. “Hey, Ma,” immediately one of the best songs in the Bon Iver catalog, is rousing and explicitly sentimental. “Full time you talk your money up/While it’s living in a coal mine,” Vernon belts, but his voice is too earthy to sound hateful. Instead, it’s like he’s offering absolution, promising that something as simple as a call to your mom is enough to make up for avarice or bluster. At first glance, the tracklist for i,i is as bewildering as the symbol-laden 22, A Million. Upon listening, though, you realize that many of these are probably mondegreens and homonyms, cheeky nods to how hard it is to understand Bon Iver’s lyrics. “Jelmore,” for instance, is a fragment of what it sounds like when Vernon sings, “Well angel morning sivanna.” And the title for the closing “RABi” comes from the couplet, “I could prophet/I could rob I, however.” There are plenty of interpretive possibilities available in those words, but none of them are as enticing as their sheer sound. The music is also not as mysterious as the songs’ monikers suggest. There’s an overwhelming calmness and pleasantness to i,i, and “RABi” is one of the most easygoing of the bunch. “Sunlight feels good now don’t it,” Vernon sings. There’s no great symbolism in the track, no yearning, no enveloping echoes. What emerges is a solace that has eluded Vernon on past Bon Iver releases. “I don’t have a leaving plan,” he sings, maybe because there’s nowhere else he needs to go.

The result is his most honest and forthright music ever.

Inna Duppy SKRS Soundclash,I Jahbar & Friends,by: Wayne Marshall,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d49b7ee51a3fd0009aad4c6/1:1/w_160/ijahbar_friends.jpg,2019-08-09 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/i-jahbar-and-friends-inna-duppy-skrs-soundclash/,Duppy Gun,"Ruellia tuberosa, known in Jamaica as Duppy Gun, is a flowering plant native to the tropical Americas but now distributed around the world. If you add water to (or just spit on) their mature seed pods, they explode within seconds, flinging stinging seeds outward as if possessed by a trigger-happy ghost. It’s a mysterious and powerful plant used as a health tonic and aphrodisiac, but it can also pop safely in a child’s hand. It’s a wonderful namesake for the Jamaican collective formed in collaboration with Los Angeles producers Cameron Stallones (Sun Araw) and M. Geddes Gengras, one which continues to cultivate a bracing take on modern dancehall as sensitive to the outside world as the titular flower. On Inna Duppy SKRS Soundclash, Duppy Gun showcases Jamaican riddims alongside contributions from the British Columbia-based Seekersinternational (aka SKRS). The album also functions as a debut of sorts for I Jahbar, nephew of “Ashanti” Roy Johnson of the Congos and a vocalist, local party host, and engineer at the Duppy Gun studio in Spanish Town. Building on—and drawing from—the far-flung collaborations on 2018’s Miro Tape (a few tracks from which appear here again), Inna Duppy SKRS Soundclash collects nine songs, one remix, and two “mixtape megamix” sides, each devoted to one of the two production crews involved, soundclash-style. Of the two, the SKRS productions feel more studied and conservative. “DemNoBad,” for example, pushes the needle into the red in a manner reminiscent of time-honored Jamaican recording techniques. But the Canadian crew depart from convention on “DuppyKilla,” a manic track continually interrupted by edits and effects, where the production sometimes wholly submerges Buddy Don’s voice. The Duppy Gun productions by Velkro and Bigflite come across as more unhinged and original, if still rooted in reggae aesthetics. Slow burner “Turn Up” combines detuned chords and sustained, distorted tones that sound like a distorted guitar shacked up with an airhorn. Bizarre little licks and synth smears create a woozy texture, anchored by I Jahbar’s steady flow. The album is a showcase for Jahbar, who projects menace on the whisper-sung “Ipy Ipy” and turns “Weed Patrol” into a captivating saga of spiriting ganja across the island, dodging police road blocks and ducking from sirens, imploring friends across the island to help out. He even slips into a faux-British accent at the end of “Sniper Rifle” to lighten up the proceedings, reminding us that when Jamaican artists invoke murder, they’re often talking about music. The album alternates between Duppy Gun and SKRS productions, while the megamixes allow each production house to be heard on its own. The mixes perhaps offer the most engaging tour through the global crew’s sprawling sound. They are doing something unique: Edgy dancehall has been produced outside of Jamaica for decades, but rarely do such productions involve artists still located in Jamaica and playing to home crowds. (Some of the songs on the album have apparently attained singalong status at Chopdawg Sundays, a regular party and stage show in Portmore.) This sort of collaboration between outside enthusiasts and local artists can be mutually beneficial, bypassing traditional gatekeepers and allowing unorthodox sounds to flourish. The sound of Portmore, aka Gaza, has been so strongly imprinted by Vybz Kartel and Popcaan in recent years that it’s refreshing to hear a different crew ignoring current trends to find common ground with a wider world.","Duppy Gun’s latest, organized around the songs of I Jahbar, finds the international crew boldly charting their own course.

Coastal Erosion,MerzbowVanity Productions,by: Joshua Minsoo Kim,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d40530e7943ca0008c150c5/1:1/w_160/merzbow_coastalerosion.jpg,2019-08-09 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/merzbow-vanity-productions-coastal-erosion/,Ideal,"Masami Akita and Christian Stadsgaard—who create music as Merzbow and Vanity Productions, respectively—each hail from countries highly susceptible to damage from climate change. Akita is from Japan, where beach loss in the near future is projected as high as 79 percent; Stadsgaard is from Denmark, where coastlines are eroding by four meters each year. In both nations, the majority of the population is situated along the coast. On Coastal Erosion, their debut collaborative album, the two artists address the crisis with musical interpretations of land under assault. Merzbow’s haphazard noise is buoyed by Vanity Productions’ spectral synth pads, and the balance of lush ambience and sharp electronics recalls the work of Tim Hecker or Fennesz. One may also be reminded of Merzbow’s 2016 album Kakapo, where discordant noise was more meditative than head-splitting, and profits benefited a critically endangered New Zealand parrot. While Coastal Erosion isn’t linked with a specific conservation program, it’s still a work of environmental activism. By welcoming listeners into a catastrophic sound world, Akita and Stadsgaard invite us to experience the destruction occurring in their home countries in a way that reading statistics may not always accomplish. “Erosion Japan,” the first of the album’s two extended tracks, begins with dreamy synth pads that lull listeners into a turbulent sea of noise. Though it’s never quiet, one grows accustomed to the onslaught, a process that serves as a damning reflection of climate apathy. A sudden and dramatic obliteration of a country’s coastline would turn heads; a more gradual and consistent process is easier to ignore. But like waves crashing against shorelines and barriers, the song’s rhythmic noise batters the defenses without interruption. The second track, “Erosion Denmark,” follows the same formula but is noticeably tamer. Though its constituent components are similar, the sound is less unwieldy, and the mood is consequently more grim. If the previous track instilled an understanding of coastal erosion through a palpable sense of immersion, this one does so by presenting its aftermath. In Denmark, archaeologists have warned that erosion could lead to the disappearance of cultural heritage and legally protected sites situated along coastlines. Even if people start to move inland, swaths of human history will be lost. Listening to the cold synth pads and bleak atmosphere of “Erosion Denmark” feels like gazing across that rubble-strewn wasteland. In an era of climate anxiety, Coastal Erosion stands out as one of the year’s most relevant experimental albums. By crafting music that attempts to illustrate the severity of the situation at hand, Akita and Stadsgaard offer a space to reckon with fear and panic. Their cross-continental collaboration is indicative of what the problem requires—that people from around the world see eye-to-eye. But by engaging with these songs, one is forced to recognize that such extended periods of reflection are a temporary luxury. Coastal Erosion’s greatest success is in showing how we have failed.","Balancing lush ambience and sharp electronics, this cross-continental collaboration addresses the climate crisis with musical interpretations of land under assault.

Even their Bandcamp tags, including “bipolar” and “happy sad,” are direct—if somewhat crass—indications of their intent to present contrasts as compliments. For the most part, floral print’s self-titled second EP—which follows 2017’s full-length debut, mirror stages—satisfies their capriciousness. Frontman Nathan Springer, keyboardist/drummer Paul DeMerritt, and bassist Joshua Pittman swirl post-punk, drone, and math rock into self-described “deconstructionist pop” that grants them the flexibility to shapeshift through a collaborative songwriting process born primarily from jam sessions. Opener “six pillows” introduces the EP with multiple false starts, repeatedly curling in on itself and revving back up again. Even as a series of tight drum fills takes over, it sounds as though floral print are stumbling over their own feet. But as the song progresses, it begins to invoke the victory of standing up again after each fall. “You’ve been fucking with my head/In a good way,” Springer sings, suggesting floral print might be trying the same trick on you. A sparse slowcore intro gradually gathers speed on lead single “i go down on the breeze,” before crashing into a single-word chorus of noisy guitars: “Carry!” Springer yells to a partner who’s drifting out of reach, “He won’t need you the way I do.” As the track fluctuates in tempo and time signature, the lyrics are equally disjointed: “I can't stand when you fall/Keep it all on track, let the reel of film recall/Break my hands, yes I do/It's not a lie if I can see right through.” Alone, each line feels like the beginning of a separate thought; strung together, they make even less sense. Though there are fascinating rhythmic intricacies in floral print’s songwriting, the EP rarely accomplishes the profundity it seems to aim for. “Pardon my ailment/I can’t love you… I wanted to show you all the things that we could be/If you were patient with the cutting parts of me,” Springer sings on closer “viridian,” stifling some of floral print’s most vibrant instrumentals with a self-incriminating admission of undateability. Promising when not obscured by artificial depth, floral print presents the case for an ardent young band in pursuit of something greater than themselves. They’ve yet to clue us in to what that might be; maybe they don’t know, either.","On their second EP, the Atlanta trio swirls post-punk, drone, and math rock into self-described “deconstructionist pop.”

Wide Prairie,Linda McCartney,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3b3f042d5df30009bba920/1:1/w_160/LindaMcCartney_WidePrairie.jpg,2019-08-08 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/linda-mccartney-wide-prairie/,MPLCapitolUME,"Linda Eastman met her second husband Paul McCartney in 1967 at a club in London called Bag O’Nails. The Beatles were busy launching their new album Sgt. Peppers’ Lonely Hearts Club Band, and Linda was photographing the event. Divorced and supporting her young daughter Heather, Linda had begun making a name for herself in photography. She was noted for her ability to freeze-frame rock stars in moments of quicksilver humanity—see this perfect picture of Jimi Hendrix yawning, or Jimmy Page making room for an older lady to pass him on the sidewalk. Decades later, Paul said he “just saw her across the room and fancied her like mad.” They were married two years later. As with Yoko and John, Linda’s interests bent the course of Paul’s own career—if Paul was ever associated with animal rights activism or vegetarianism, it was because those were Linda’s concerns, and she devoted her life to them, as well as to her family and photography. And as with Yoko, Linda became an instant magnet for misogynist hostility—she was an interloper, a non-talent leading her genius husband astray. When Paul put Linda’s name beside his for his second post-Beatles album, Ram, the result was the most roundly belittled release of Paul’s career, the one that Rolling Stone called “the nadir in the decomposition of Sixties rock thus far.” When she started a new band with him called Wings—well, they were Wings. Not even Paul and Linda liked Wings: “We just picked the wrong people,” Linda later said. “Paul is such a good musician, and none of the Wings were good enough to play with him…including me, for sure.” Over the next several decades, Linda and Paul remained inseparable. Linda would become a force in vegetarian cooking, releasing several cookbooks and developing a line of meatless frozen foods. She stepped away from the spotlight, more or less—she still popped up in Paul’s videos from time to time, but the era in which she played keyboards next to her husband, decorating the stage with lava lamps and scarves, was over. Yet her music career never strictly ended. Over the years, she released a trickle of songs as one-off singles and EPs, where they would not attract undue (and presumably unkind) attention. One of those songs, “Seaside Woman” (under the pseudonym Suzy and the Red Stripes), became a minor hit, peaking at #59 in the U.S. In 1985, she cowrote and executive-produced the animated children’s special Rupert and the Frog Song, which featured “Seaside Woman” and the surreal “Oriental Nightfish.” But otherwise, Linda McCartney ceased to be known in the public eye for her music. When she died of breast cancer on April 17, 1998, she and Paul were in the process of assembling her first and only studio album. The track listing was composed of odds and ends she had written with Paul over the years, and the result was released to resounding silence shortly after her death. “Let’s just note, as gently as possible, that Wide Prairie is not any good,” wrote the Washington Post. And that—once again—was it. Now that Wide Prairie is being reissued, it’s probably time to look at Linda’s music a little more squarely. Yes, there are painful moments here, particularly her attempts at a “howdy, pardner”-style country accent. But she and Paul shared a musical chemistry as enviable and singular as Yoko and John’s, and as emblematic of their shared interests. The songs here glow with the comfort and warmth of domesticity. “I’m the cook of the house,” Linda boasted on the song called “Cook of the House,” followed by the sound of a sizzling pan. Domesticity was also the wellspring for Ram, and showed just how slyly subversive such celebrations could be (“Eat at Home” is not about cooking.) They also harmonized together in a way that was hard to imitate—Linda’s wild, untrained voice against Paul’s choirboy tenor generated a messy, gratifying wholeness. Linda’s voice is thin, yes, but decades of punk (and a few years of SoundCloud rap) have trained pop listeners to hear differently. There is a peculiar yowling joy to their rumpled reggae-lite cover of “Mister Sandman,” a trifle that nevertheless feels as inviting as a hammock. She made him sound rougher, and he made her sound sweeter. They sounded better together. Away from critical and commercial scrutiny, Linda allowed the antic musical theater touches of Ram to run amuck. Wide Prairie is silly and exuberant, almost relentlessly so, but also deeply strange: Nearly every song is an exhaustive mini-medley of pop-song styles—music-hall oom-pah horns, country fiddles, skiffle keyboards, electric-blues guitar riffing, monster-movie synthesizers on “The White-Coated Man.” Sometimes, when all the horns are tooting, it can feel like you’re being trampled underfoot by an army of first graders. But poke beneath the whimsy and you will find a delirious buffet approach to the American songbook not too far from Van Dyke Parks’ Song Cycle. Her ear for melody was highly unusual, and she made the kinds of harmonic leaps that other songwriters did or would not. The piano ballad “Love’s Full Glory” picks its way across the keys with the kind of wayward, meandering melody that Paul was noted for, but with unpredictable stagger steps in the progression that felt inimitably Linda’s. The best moments are the simplest and most relaxed, with the fewest instruments and the most straightforward words. “When it comes, you will go with quiet dignity/Across the yard, up the ramp,” she sang on “Cow,” a song about exactly that. “Going to meet the final man/With nothing on your face/Except for that familiar beauty/And he will eat you/Because he didn’t look.” The words might provoke giggles on the page, but in the song, they are disarmingly sweet—Linda plays a Casio keyboard as a backing track, its tinny sound a reminder of the childlike innocence of the message. What child, after all, hasn’t come to the horrified realization that the cute animals in the field are the same ones we eat? Though few current artists acknowledge her as a godmother, you can hear echoes of Linda in Girlpool, in Fleet Foxes, in any number of indie pop and freak-folk albums. One might say she got the last laugh, but she didn’t seem the type to need it. “I always thought I could do anything I liked doing,” she told Playboy. She seemed to live her life in accordance with an internal compass, with serene disregard for the opinions of observers. She liked making music, she liked taking pictures, she liked spending time with her husband. When she died, it was in Paul’s arms.

Dum and Dummer,Young DolphKey Glock,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3f02efe82cca0008d4d3b3/1:1/w_160/glockdolph_dumdummer.jpg,2019-08-08 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/young-dolph-key-glock-dum-and-dummer/,Paper Route EMPIRE,"In a rap industry kudzu’d with major-label plants, Memphis native Young Dolph has somehow remained a true independent. The man born Adolph Thornton, Jr. is now more than a dozen mixtapes, studio albums, and EPs deep into his rap career, almost all of it released and distributed by his own Paper Route Empire label. Fellow Memphis rapper Key Glock, meanwhile, has just three mixtapes to his name. He is younger, and his solo work doesn’t announce itself with the same authority as Dolph’s. Nevertheless, he’s a dependable sidekick, and on Dum and Dummer he trades bars with his elder about the weight of their chains and their weed consumption. There’s not much else going on in Dum and Dummer, but there doesn’t need to be: Their shared charisma is enough. All the beats are courtesy of producer BandPlay, who adds new colors to Dolph’s palette. There are stabbing, Psycho-like strings on “If I Ever,” and the looping guitars on “1 Hell of a Life” scream “Lil Peep / XXXTentacion Type Beat.” Dolph’s songwriting range has expanded along with his sound, allowing darkness to creep in at the edges. On “Black Locs,” he raps about wearing the eponymous shades so he “can’t see nobody” and taking drugs to “hide the pain that’s inside.” Key’s six solo tracks are a younger man’s songs, Dolph’s endlessly listenable drawl replaced by rhymes that are clearer in delivery but simpler in construction. Most of Key’s songs are celebrations of himself—“Like Key” is about how “there ain’t another like me”—but his more emotionally inflected songs, like “Monster,” don’t reach Dolph’s depths of self-loathing and despair. Instead, they are classic bootstraps parables: “I came out the slums, I’m the one that made it happen/Now I’m gettin’ back ends, I used to get them bags in.” It’s that same self-sufficiency that built Memphis rap and made it so appealing to outsiders. Because West Tennessee was ignored by the industry for so long, it became—like Houston, New Orleans, and pretty much every other major metropolitan area in the Southeastern United States—its own alternate universe, one that Three 6 Mafia and associates assembled out of Satanic verses, clouds of weed smoke, and horror-movie soundtracks. Dolph and Glock place themselves in the lineage of Southern rap greats—on opening track “III,” they readily compare themselves to UGK and Three 6—but their music is classic, not nostalgic. The duo doesn’t need to plunder samples from rare Kingpin Skinny Pimp songs to evoke the aura of the 901; the city and its iconic sound is in their veins.","Independent rap vet Young Dolph trades bars with fellow Memphis native Key Glock on an album that channels the city’s iconic sound.

Blue 05 / Blue 06,Forest Drive WestPugilist,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d49ba2b3a40180008ff3ca7/1:1/w_160/blue5.jpg,2019-08-08 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/forest-drive-west-pugilist-blue-05-blue-06/,Whities Blue,"When the dance-music site Resident Advisor named Whities one of the best labels of 2016, the London imprint was keeping a pretty low profile: It had put out a scant four records that year, adding to the five it had released since launching in 2014. Since then, the label, founded by Nic Tasker, has dialed up the pace. Its catalog is now three dozen releases deep, but it still prefers the shadows to the limelight. Most Whities artists are known primarily to fans on club music’s fringes, if they’re known at all; the biggest names on the roster (Avalon Emerson, Lanark Artefax) got a significant boost in the wake of their Whities debuts. There are few better places to take the pulse of adventurous UK club music, and that’s especially true of the Whities Blue sublabel, which maintains a slightly more dancefloor-oriented focus than its parent label. Until now, Whities Blue had been dedicated to split singles, but the latest two in the series, from Forest Drive West and Pugilist, respectively, break that mold. Forest Drive West, aka East London’s Joe Baker, active since 2016, is the better known of the two artists. A typical Forest Drive West production is a good reminder of why dance music tends to use the term “track” in place of “song”: His drum programming stretches out in long, steely, unswerving lines, hi-hats flashing like railroad ties. Rhythmically, his two cuts here are as linear as anything he’s done, but the atmosphere around his drums is in constant flux. “Other” is the heavier of the two tunes, built around booming toms and a beefy, syncopated groove; despite the ample force of his low end, there’s a wealth of high-end detail that lends an electrifying dynamism. (Listen closely and you might hear an echo of Plastikman in the triplet figures rippling across the surface of the mix.) “Time” takes a similar approach into vast metallic clouds of reverb, with taut plucked tones glinting dully in the fog. If the Cure’s “A Forest” were reborn as minimal techno, it might sound something like this. Melbourne’s Pugilist, aka Alex Dickson, is a relative newcomer; his early productions, from 2017 and 2018, tended toward classic, half-speed dubstep with a decidedly mid-aughts feel. But lately he’s been quickening his tempos, bringing him more in line with his UK bass contemporaries. “Descendant,” the opening track on his EP, recalls Forest Drive West’s linear shapes while incorporating an almost Latin sense of swing; every so often, rushing breakbeats burst like geysers through the surface. For a bass musician, he knows how to make the high end sing: The treble register is a turbulent field of nonstop motion—metallic shrieks, flayed hi-hats, and alien wibbles. It’s a powerful, peak-time track that plays the long game rather than going for the easy payoff, and so is the more hypnotic “Undulate,” where 808 depth charges plunge through an aquamarine swirl of keys and drum hits. With “Encrypted,” Pugilist tries his hand at a new cadence, toying with the 160-BPM pulse of drum’n’bass while letting dub’s dragging anchor slow the tempo to a crawl. It sounds almost like a contemporary take on Seefeel’s doleful clang. A little-known fact about Whities Blue is that the label began as a response to Brexit. When the British pound dropped precipitously in the face of uncertainty as to how, exactly, the UK was going to extricate itself from the EU, the price of manufacturing and shipping records shot up—especially for a label like Whities, with its lavishly printed full-color record covers. Sporting generic sleeves, the Whities Blue series—the name is a subtle reference to the European Union’s flag—became a means of putting out records more cheaply and quickly. There’s no solution to Brexit in sight, but on these two releases, Whities Blue maintains its resolutely international perspective, drawing together sounds from the U.S., Germany, Latin America, and the Caribbean into a cosmopolitan web of influence and exchange. Like the best dance music, it makes an airtight case that we’re stronger together than alone.","A pair of new singles from London’s Whities label demonstrate that there are few better places to take the pulse of adventurous UK club music.

Live on Ice,tobi lou,by: Colin Lodewick,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3f60257943ca0008c1504f/1:1/w_160/950898.jpg,2019-08-08 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tobi-lou-live-on-ice/,EMPIRE,"Animation offers the freedom to escape the self, to explore one’s contours from the outside. Last year, across three EPs—tobi lou and the Moon, tobi lou and the Loop, and tobi lou and the Juice—the Chicago-raised, LA-based rapper tobi lou strove to inhabit an animated universe. Each release featured a cartoon version of lou on its cover. He wrote songs inspired by the fantasy series Adventure Time and Sailor Moon. Even the glittery plastic stars lou often wears at the corners of his eyes seem like remnants of a cartoon alter-ego transferred into the real world. On his debut album Live on Ice, lou’s suspended reality manifests in songs about feeling caught in the middle: between youth and maturity, playfulness and sincerity, confidence and anxiety. He works from a toolkit of synthetic, ringing tones whose constancy counters the album’s unwieldy length. But across 21 tracks tinged with the diaristic influence of SoundCloud rap, his wavering sometimes devolves into ambivalence. When the occasional string swell or slow guitar strum emerges, the combination suggests pause music, the kind a video game avatar idles to while the player is away. But the ambient instrumentation can work when paired with lou’s stream-of-consciousness flows. On “I Was Sad Last Night I’m OK Now,” he repeats the titular lyric and asks: “You ever been so hungry you just lay down?/You ain’t even eat, you just went to sleep, just so you could dream about some takeout?” Times may be lean now, but lou’s twinkling synths and conversational delivery are a simple lesson in feeling better tomorrow. There are several such moments when he allows listeners to see past the fantasy and into his real world. On “That Old Nu-Nu,” he confides, “I’m told that my mother hates rappers,” before addressing his mother directly: “Mama, I hope this isn’t too rapper-ish.” It’s a playful moment with an aura of real significance: He just wants to make his mom proud. Most of the time, though, lou sounds far more unsure of his abilities. On opener “100 Degrees,” he wonders: “I don’t know if it’s really me talking or if it’s just a ventriloquist.” Later, on “Berlin/Westside,” he promises, “I’m still me, just rearranged.” In spite of his self-awareness, Live on Ice frequently lingers on the wrong side of the line between tongue-in-cheek and cheesy. “Humpty Dumpty” aims for OutKast’s quirky panache and lands on bad egg puns; “Like My Mom” strikes an uncomfortable balance between adoring and overzealous. Narrating a romantic rejection, lou sings: “She tried to call me ugly, but she just sounded dumb/’Cause goddamn, I look good like my mom.” The album is weakest when he fails to laugh at himself. “Orange Reprise” splits the difference between sincerity and corniness. When the track begins, lou is struggling to ward off sadness, rapping about feeling “insubstantial” and changed for the worse (“Why’d I stop rockin’ flannels?”). Framed as a tribute to Frank Ocean’s genre-defying power, “Orange Reprise” has grand aspirations. But then comes a slide whistle solo, and an outro that sounds like a Wii theme music version of “Pure Imagination,” from the Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory soundtrack. When tobi lou manages to make the two styles coalesce, they complement each other well. When he can’t, the fantasy seems out of reach.","Inspired by a love of fantasy and cartoons, the rapper’s debut full-length is simultaneously playful and sincere, confident and anxious.

Live at Troxy,Fever Ray,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d4440b404c06a00092f641a/1:1/w_160/feverray_liveattroxy.jpg,2019-08-07 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fever-ray-live-at-troxy/,MuteRabid,"For their 2014 Shaking the Habitual Tour, Karin Dreijer and their brother Olaf expanded their synthpop duo the Knife from a twosome to a troupe. The siblings wore the same jewel-toned jumpsuits and glittery makeup as the nine other performers they invited into the group, visually diminishing any sense that they were bandleaders. The symbolic collectivism of the stage show accentuated the themes running through the album of the same name: freedom, communalism, and the urgent need to dismantle social hegemony to clear space for a better world. While touring behind their second album as Fever Ray, Dreijer applied a similar conceptual bent to a rather different show. The performers on the Plunge tour each wore distinct costumes—a fur coat and thigh-high boots, an orange polyester muscle suit, facepaint and velvet opera gloves—creating characters from the messy, ad-hoc getups. Hoping to challenge the music industry’s pervasive gender disparity, Dreijer hired as few men as possible for the tour. Five out of the six stage performers were about 40 years old, and four were parents—Dreijer's effort to counteract the ageism and sexism that often freezes mothers and women past their 20s out of performing creative work. Fever Ray’s live album, Live at Troxy, captures a night of the exuberant collaboration Dreijer fostered with the Plunge stage production. While the Shaking the Habitual Tour made extensive use of pre-recorded backing tracks, allowing the performers to dance freely and lip-sync to the music, Dreijer opted on the Plunge tour to have everything played live. Physical percussion bolsters live-triggered drum machines on the record, adding volume and dimensionality to old and new Fever Ray songs. Dreijer’s 2009 self-titled debut as Fever Ray sprung from a place of isolation and deep introspection. A few songs from that album appear on Live at Troxy, but they are newly reinvigorated: They sound like memories of isolation now dispelled by having found community. “When I Grow Up” and “I’m Not Done” were both significantly revamped for the Plunge tour, spiked with higher tempos, gulping vocal samples, and newly colorful percussion. These new incarnations fit right in alongside the playful offerings from Plunge, but even Fever Ray’s iciest cuts fill with new warmth here. The drumbeats tower on “Keep the Streets Empty for Me,” while synthesizer figures twirl irreverently. It’s as though the speaker has finished a long nighttime walk home only to find their apartment filled with friends. And the powerfully chilling “If I Had a Heart” sounds like Dreijer making peace with past selves: They sing live and unaffected over a recording of their pitch-shifted performance from 10 years ago, voice cracking and rasping in ways the processed vocal didn’t allow. Even in their studio versions, most songs from Plunge sound like they were written to be played in a club full of people—it’s an album about fucking your way out of your shell, and it lends itself to joyful, gay celebration. Live, tracks like “To the Moon and Back” and “Wanna Sip” flare with life and color, animated by the urgency and risk of live performance. When the drums crash in at the beginning of “IDK About You,” and the synths peal and squiggle, you can almost see the band members grinning at each other. On Plunge, Dreijer openly celebrated their queerness for the first time, never losing sight of the fact that even romantic relationships don’t transpire in a vacuum. To grow close to another person is to open yourself to the world in which they’re enmeshed, to participate in the broader social fabric. Plunge expertly traces the threads connecting the sexual and the political, the bond between two people in a couple and the bonds that link a community. On Live at Troxy, we get the chance to hear Fever Ray—a band, now—exalt all of that good human love as a collective, a chosen family thrilled to share their music and their play.","The live album captures a night of the exuberant collaboration Karin Dreijer fostered with the Plunge stage production, adding volume and dimensionality to old and new songs alike.

The Sailor,Rich Brian,by: Nathan Reese,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3b3b0e2d5df30009bba91e/1:1/w_160/RichBrian_TheSailor.jpg,2019-08-07 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/rich-brian-the-sailor/,88rising,"Like many viral rap stars, Rich Brian initially treated his music like just another bullet point in a personal-brand sales pitch. The outlines of that pitch are well-known by now: Young Chinese-Indonesian teen Brian Imanuel learns English on YouTube, dubs himself Rich Chigga, goes viral with a song called “Dat $tick” on which he throws around the n-word with startling nonchalance, rhyming about scenarios with which he almost certainly has no firsthand experience (e.g. shooting cops) while wearing a large fanny pack. As a listener, your choices are to write him off as a troll or enjoy his competent, syrupy flow while trying not to dwell on the problematic specifics. If you’re really being honest, unpacking it all gives you a headache. But that was three years ago. In the short time since Brian arrived as a polo-clad edgelord, he’s traded shock value for an actual career. Now 19, Brian is no longer Chigga, no longer courting controversy for clicks. His interviews reveal a hungry young man with a worldly perspective: “My goal is to go mainstream—partially because I really want to pave the way for Asian kids to be themselves,” he has said. His label, 88Rising, has become an undeniable part of the global pop landscape, with Brian as its biggest star and de facto ambassador. On his first album, Amen, he fashioned himself as a bridge between a new Asian underground and mainstream hip-hop, exploring his unusual place in the culture with occasionally deft observations. Mostly, though, he rhymed about the internet and partying. “Catch me chillin’ with Offset in a luau,” he rapped on “Attention,” an oddly plausible scenario. The Sailor, Rich Brian’s second album in two years, is another bid to distance himself from his teenage output. By and large, it is a successful one: The Sailor is often charming, featuring some of the best music of his young career. Brian’s obsessions—life away from home, his search for emotional connection and sex—pop up all over the record, often as absurdist juxtapositions. “Bad energy, man, where my palo santo at?/Told her ‘Don't fuck me,’ ’cause this shit get sentimental fast,” he raps on the title track. (It should probably be noted here, though it may go without saying, that Brian has spent much of the last few years in Los Angeles.) Brian’s flow is remarkably malleable, his production choices doubly so. He pulls off a Migos-indebted staccato on “Confetti.” On the family-and-friends anthem “Kids,” he channels Drake with the memorable boast: “You big in your city, I’m the king of a continent.” On “Yellow,” he references his backstory with a flex made for the times: “I did it all without no citizenship/To show the whole world you just got to imagine.” While he used to gravitate toward trap, he now pulls in boom-bap drums, emo-rap choruses, even Spanish guitar and psych rock. His songs have become more melodic and bittersweet, losing the hard edge he never sounded particularly comfortable with in the first place. On “Drive Safe,” for instance, he invokes Kid Cudi, while “No Worries” glows with Frank Ocean moods like orange paint on a BMW M3. His most heartfelt tracks toe the line between confessional and saccharine. “Shouts out to the ones doin’ things/Everyone was afraid or unable to do, man/The world needs more of you,” he raps on “Curious.” There are two moments on The Sailor that point to where Brian still might go. The first is RZA’s feature on “Rapapapa,” which is more motivational speech than verse: “Rich Brian was born to be rich with talents and balance/And the ability to face life challenges,” the Wu general intones awkwardly. “Represent your artistic intelligence/Your genetic pigment, your culture, your power.” It’s a goofy knighting of sorts, one wrapped up in the Wu-Tang’s complicated and storied relationship with Asian art. The second is the outro of “The Sailor,” in which Brian is confronted by a “mysterious young girl” en route to the corner store for passion fruit iced tea. She asks him a series of “whoa, dude” questions about life and death, the last of which is “What is a life if a moment can end in the blink of an eye?” Like all things Rich Brian, it falls between laugh-out-loud ridiculous and oddly sweet. But his career is getting harder and harder to dismiss.","On his second album, the viral rap star makes some of the most charming music of his still-young career.

AOKOHIO,WHY?,by: Mehan Jayasuriya,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d409335e34bdc0008e73091/1:1/w_160/why_aokohio.jpg,2019-08-07 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/why-aokohio/,Joyful Noise,"For all of the neuroses he’s examined on record over the years, Yoni Wolf has never seemed like one for nostalgia. During his two decades spent fronting cLOUDDEAD, Hymie’s Basement, and WHY?, Wolf could usually be found either over-analyzing the present moment or lost in some dark, near-future reverie. It’s surprising, then, that following a creative dry spell and a relocation to his native Cincinnati, Wolf has turned to his past for inspiration. The album art for AOKOHIO draws from home movies Wolf made with his older brother (and WHY? member) Josiah Wolf, and its lyrics make frequent mention of their family and early life. Given the younger Wolf’s Freudian fixations and how incisive he can be when voicing his internal monologue, you’d think all this rooting around in his childhood would turn up something interesting. And yet, the verbose rapper and singer has never sounded like he’s had less to say. AOKOHIO, it turns out, is the product of creative malaise. “I wasn't feeling the idea of going back in and making another ten or twelve song album. It felt arduous,” Wolf said. “So I wanted to pare the process down and make it manageable.” Hence, an album with 19 songs spread across 33 minutes and six “movements,” each of which is being released independently and as part of this collection. Only five of these songs break the two-minute mark; the rest sound like fragments, field recordings, or some combination thereof (WHY? records have always included tracks like these, though they’ve usually served as bumpers). There’s also an accompanying visual album, made in partnership with—no joke—a director who randomly DM’d Wolf on Instagram. If all of this sounds like an effort to jump-start a stalled engine, it wouldn’t be the first time. But as with 2013’s fan-service exercise Golden Tickets, it feels like Wolf never commits to his own conceit—nearly all of the songs on AOKOHIO feel underdeveloped, if not unfinished. Album opener “Apogee” is in many ways a typical WHY? song: Over gentle washes of guitar and piano and a dance beat, Wolf fires off a series of curious observations in a resigned sigh (“Standing in the mirror thinking, ‘I wish I was a chocolatier’/Fat but happy at the apogee of life”). But just as the song begins to hit its stride, it’s over. “Peel Free” attempts to locate the source of Wolf’s angst at the time of his birth, but amid the horns, chimes, and weighty piano chords, he comes up empty-handed (“I’ve been shaking off a shadow all my life,” he shrugs on the chorus, backed by a choir). On the surface, “Deleterio Motilis” sounds like it could have been left off of the band’s high-water mark Alopecia; it even opens with a signature Wolf move, a self-deprecating reflection on his treatment of women. But unlike WHY?’s best work, everything feels half-hearted, the punchlines and uncomfortable confessions lacking their usual bite. Originally Yoni Wolf’s solo rap project, WHY? has been a bona fide indie rock band for close to 15 years now, one that’s more than capable of making elegant and affecting music. But even these talents go to waste on AOKOHIO. “Rock Candy” overplays the band’s signature glockenspiels, and the result sounds like a cat-food commercial. With its horns, choir vocals, and stargazing melodies, album closer “Bloom Wither Bloom (for Mom)” overshoots poignancy and lands in schmaltz. WHY? has never been a subtle band, but they’ve also never been this overwrought. About halfway through the album, we hear a bit of something promising in “Mr. Fifths’ Plea.” It has all the hallmarks of a fan favorite: twinkling instrumentation, a title that references one of the band’s best-loved songs, a catchy chorus that doubles as a plea (“Someone would you save me from myself?/Someone would you help me be a healthy human being?”). And yet, we never really get to hear it. The song plays faintly underneath a recording of Wolf and his brother conversing with a taxi driver and cuts off at the 45-second mark. This attempt at self-sabotage might sound interesting on paper. But in practice, it’s emblematic of a larger trend in Wolf’s songwriting over the last decade: lots of experiments, few results.","Yoni Wolf and his band switch up their approach with bite-sized songs, a visual album, and an uncharacteristic focus on the past.

Abraxas EP,Lone,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3b3cda579b970008b0e3f2/1:1/w_160/lone_abraxas.jpg,2019-08-07 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lone-abraxas-ep/,Ancient Astronauts,"Clubland’s recent obsession with breakbeats has thrust the idiosyncratic British producer Lone into an improbably fashionable position, with tracks like “Temples” and “Pulsar” slotting, almost despite themselves, into the trend for gritty drum breaks at a house tempo. But the longtime breakbeat revivalist’s Abraxas EP, inspired by pitched-down drum’n’bass, unwittingly sounds a warning bell for the style’s rapidly diminishing returns. Lone’s interest in breakbeats solidified on Levitate, in 2016—an age ago in electronic music—and continued through the recent Ambivert Tools 12-inch series. To this rave revivalism he brought a gift for mystical melody and dusty atmosphere that elevated his productions above mere novelty. But as his fellow producers pile into the retro wave, these traits are almost entirely absent on Abraxas, an EP that resembles a paint-by-numbers breakbeat kit.  It’s not so much that there is little going on in the three tracks here—some of the best electronic music is made up of very little—as that there is nothing truly noteworthy: no new sounds or rhythmic inflection to put a spring in the step, no intriguing melodies or production trickery to capture the heart. Instead, Abraxas relies heavily on some of the most well-worn tropes in dance music, from the “Funky Drummer” break to choral pads, all rendered in a prosaic manner that does little to redeem them. The Lisbon DJ Violet made the point in a recent Guardian article that breakbeats can be recycled in countless configurations, in a way that “recharges meaning as opposed to exhausting it.” But the breakbeats on Abraxas feel tired to the point of lethargy. Lone digs shallow into the store of classic breaks and just kind of leaves them there, unmolested in the mix, when a more adventurous mind might have chopped them to hell and back. Given that radically altered breakbeats were pretty much the whole point of ’90s drum’n’bass, this lackadaisical attitude is puzzling. Equally dispiriting is Lone’s use of the Roland TB-303—the other most over-used sound in ’90s electronic music—which pops up on the EP doing very little of interest. Dillinja’s “Acid Track” and Josh Wink’s “Higher State of Consciousness” both proved long ago that 303 plus breakbeat can be a chemically potent mix. But the three tracks on Abraxas have none of Dillinja’s sheer acidic filth or Wink’s brutally effective danceability. Instead, with the possible exception of “Young Star Cluster,” the 303s on Abraxas wobble around indolently, like hippos in a mud lake. So what else remains? The title track adds a synth melody that wafts about without ever setting fire to the curtains and the kind of “exotic” instrumental sample misused on ’90s rave records to denote globe-trotting depth. “Young Star Cluster” has a nagging kalimba melody, a halfway decent 303 squelch, and airy melodic flutters. “How Can You Tell” closes the EP with angelic synth washes à la The Orb's Adventures Beyond the Ultraworld and a catchy sub-bass line. And that is that, pretty much, for a hugely underwhelming package. As Octo Octa’s recent work shows, there is still mileage to be gotten out of reviving music’s most modish decade. But Abraxas’ lackluster approach makes you wish Lone had dug into the daredevil spirit of the ’90s rather than aping its sonic trappings. Lone has made far better music and will probably continue to do so. But lesser breakbeat revivalists should consider themselves warned by this wet blanket of a record.","The breakbeat revivalist returns to well-worn rave tropes, yielding diminishing returns.

Care Package,Drake,by: Corban Goble,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d446927b7933300085f827f/1:1/w_160/Drake_CarePackage.jpg,2019-08-06 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/drake-care-package/,OVO SoundRepublic,"During his creative peak, from 2011’s Take Care through 2015’s If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late, Drake processed his memory through his music. He plumbed the depths of his skyrocketing stardom, processing it all with a weary stream-of-consciousness. It was almost as if he was rapping names, places, and scenes as a way to remember them. (Never forget Courtney, from Hooters, on Peachtree.) Some songs included snippets of voicemails from irritated girlfriends. Others felt like rhyming notes to self, including one where he spent four minutes apologizing to his mother. Drake will be 33 in October, and he’s no longer that person. His music has become more of a narrative running alongside his celebrity than the main product. Yes, he still breaks records, but his albums and songs now seem to be in service of the bigger, more lucrative business of being Drake. But when his breakthrough mixtape So Far Gone turned 10 earlier this year, Drake decided it might be time to relive some formative memories. Or at least, to remember—and reap streaming royalties from—them. His OVO imprint celebrated the occasion with a physical release and digital release, and So Far Gone made its debut on the Billboard albums chart, hitting No. 5. In that same spirit comes Care Package, an odds-and-ends set that collects tracks that were originally released between 2010 and 2016. It’s an accessible time capsule, a concise document of his growth as a musician and a primary source for his OVO imprint’s signature sound, which has since anchored multiple careers. For Drake, who has had a relatively quiet year musically, now’s as good a time as ever to reflect on where he’s been. While many of the songs on Care Package had logistics-related reasons for never seeing wider release—for instance, “Dreams Money Can Buy,” “Girls Love Beyoncé,” and “Draft Day” all contain expensive samples—they were all easy to find online, and quickly emerged as fan favorites. (Drake, a seasoned product pitchman at this point, described the release as “Some of our most important moments together available in one place.”) Many of these songs find Drake dredging up his rawest emotions while utilizing R&B textures and moods, speaking to a broad audience while still maintaining a singular perspective. There are tracks here that winningly delve into vulnerability, defeat, fear of failure—subjects his music rarely addresses anymore. Several songs once served as warm-ups for eventual full-lengths, musical mile-markers from a guy overflowing with great ideas. Drake could hardly miss during this period, a fact that Care Package definitively underscores. “Paris Morton Music,” the oldest song on the collection, is a throwback to the time immediately before the entire radio started to sound like Drake featuring Drake, with a blurry-streetlight score that would become a rap radio formula for the first half of the decade. It’s a huge sound, by design—in producer Noah “40” Shebib’s production, Drake could easily find pockets to rap, pockets to sing, or both. Throughout the compilation, from the after-the-afterparty trap of “Days in the East” to the versatile performance and soft-bellied synth twinkle of “The Motion” to the music-blog-friendly “Dreams Money Can Buy,” Drake is also presented not only as a versatile pop vocalist who could impress himself on almost any trending sound, but also as someone who could add a new dimension to that sound. His appeal as a pop musician was growing, and songs like “Club Paradise,” released a few months before Take Care, previewed Drake’s forthcoming leap; candid and funny, the song served as self-indulgent, status-update music way before “mood” was a hashtag. Certainly, there’s a few corny or dated moments—listening through Care Package, you’ll hear hashtag rap (“I got that Courtney Love for you/Crazy shit”), epically cloying vocal runs, and overly cutesy wordplay like, “Brunch with Qatar royals all my cups is oil.” However, the best songs here stand up with Drake’s best music. Take “Trust Issues,” perhaps the most meta moment on an extremely meta release, a song where Drake echoes his own hook from the DJ Khaled hit “I’m on One,” casting a shadow on all of its implied excess. Or 2013’s “Girls Love Beyoncé,” featuring a “Say My Name” sample that Drake and 40 reorient as a lonely plea for connection. “You know how this shit goes,” Drake sings, over soft drum claps and sampled vocal snippets. “This isn’t like four years ago.” The version of Drake that Drake is referencing on that song is the Drake of 2009, a guy with humbler ambitions. A guy that was gone, but not totally forgotten. The Drake of 2019 has moved into the future—he now owns an eSports team. He is likely no longer driving his girlfriend through the snow so she can make the bar exam. He’s far more protected, far wealthier, far more inaccessible. As opportunistic as the release of Care Package is, the reminder of Drake’s work at the margins during his most prolific creative period is a timely one. The compilation layers history upon history, creating a dense nostalgia. We may no longer have the Drake from five or 10 years ago, but we’ll always have the memories.","This odds-and-ends compilation features tracks originally released between 2010 and 2016, and presents a more vulnerable version of the pop colossus we know now.

Good Morning Cruel World,Cold HartYAWNS,by: NM Mashurov,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3f6265579b970008b0e5eb/1:1/w_160/goodmorning_coldhart.jpg,2019-08-06 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cold-hart-good-morning-cruel-world/,GOTHBOICLIQUE,"Cold Hart, born Jerick “Jay” Quilisadio, is a founding member of GothBoiClique, the internet-based emo-rap crew that includes YAWNS, former Tigers Jaw vocalist Wicca Phase Springs Eternal, Lil Tracy, Horse Head, fish narc, and, most famously, the late Lil Peep. Merging pop-punk, trap, and SoundCloud rap, GothboiClique’s infectious, knowingly bratty songs tackle serious topics: depression, drugs, tormented relationships, and self-destruction. As with MySpace-era emo rock, much current emo rap (with the exception of Peep) is as reviled by critics as it is adored by the young, sad, and extremely online. But with live instrumentation and a hard-won sense of optimism, Cold Hart’s official debut Good Morning Cruel World makes a case for itself in the pop-punk lineage. Quilisadio bills the album as a makeover. “It’s more about illustrating emotions instead of wanting to be depressed and numb,” he told i-D. “It’s also about leaving toxic relationships and waking up, even though you know the world is shitty.” On past EPs and one-off singles like “Spyro” or “Thru the Screen,” Coldy (as he’s affectionately known) sounded typically downtempo and downhearted. There’s plenty of that on Cruel World too, especially in the second half, but it’s the open-hearted moments that shine brightest. The sentiment is best captured on “EYES,” with its driving guitar riff, handclap hi-hats, and alive-again chorus: “Eyes wide shut, screaming, ‘I’m not afraid of loving’/Fuck me up ’cause I’m so used to feeling nothing.” The video sends Cold Hart and collaborator Rawksa on a nighttime cruise, alternately hanging out of a sunroof and hanging out on a stairwell. Like so many legendary nights, it’s somehow both kinetic and ordinary. GothBoiClique has long used samples to honor influences: the Microphones on Lil Peep’s “Beamer Boy,” Senses Fail on Lil Lotus’ “Bodybag.” Cold Hart’s new direction finds him transitioning to the live-band sound explored on 2018’s Wish Me Well EP, but his references are no less overt. “You know that I want you in the worst way/Taking Back Sunday on a Thursday,” he sings on the upbeat single “Hot Pink Lighter,” before borrowing a TBS lyric for the hooky, beat-driven “Leo Szn.” Playing live eliminates sample-clearance headaches, and it fleshes out Cold Hart’s sound, allowing him to inhabit his world more fully. In videos for “Nick Cave In” and “Hot Pink Lighter,” you could almost mistake him for a star of MTV2 circa 2003—until a closer look reveals that all members of his backing band are played by YAWNS. If the third-wave emo affect is bitterness—life is a letdown and your ex-lover is to blame—the pop-punk call to mosh comes from a wonder at the heart’s capacity. Cold Hart never participates in the misogyny that an unfortunate amount of emo rap shares with its third-wave predecessors. Instead, like Blink-182 or Simple Plan, his enthusiasm crests in moments of lovestruck weightlessness, buoyed by the easy charm of the Long Beach skater scene he grew up in. He’s fond of heart imagery and, fittingly, Cruel World ends on its own sort of beaming heart-emoji sendoff: a cover of Sarina Paris’ proto-nightcore club banger “Look at Us.” Celebratory, nostalgic, and a little absurd, it’s the sound of an artist ready to embrace joy alongside pain.","With live instrumentation and a hard-won sense of optimism, the GothBoiClique artist’s official debut makes a case for itself in the pop-punk lineage.

Blume,Nérija,by: Matthew Kassel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3b37fd87626200084cd870/1:1/w_160/Blume_Nerija.jpg,2019-08-06 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nerija-blume/,Domino,"The loud and energetic septet Nérija is just the latest formidable voice to emerge from London’s jazz scene. In the last few years, the city has produced some of the most vital players in improvised music, including drummer Moses Boyd, saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings, and tuba player Theon Cross, all of whom draw on influences as disparate as grime and Afrobeat. Now, Nérija has entered the discussion with Blume, a collection of earthy, atmospheric, and danceable tracks. Although it folds in sounds from all over the world, there is a distinct sense of terroir—you get the sense that this music could only have come from London. The group—including tenor saxophonist Nubya Garcia, trumpeter Sheila Maurice-Grey, alto saxophonist Cassie Kinoshi, trombonist Rosie Turton, guitarist Shirley Tetteh, drummer Lizy Exell, and bassist Rio Kai—play all across the city in various configurations. They have released one promising EP, but the 10 original compositions on Blume stand apart. The players have a familiar rapport that still allows room for risk, and the music thrums with tension while never losing the reggae and funk bits that remind you this is club music at heart. The horn lineup puts forth gritty, layered voicings that give the septet the air of a big band. The first track, “Nascence,” feels like it could have emerged from a horn-heavy Blue Note album circa 1965—Wayne Shorter or Herbie Hancock, perhaps. Then the rhythm section enters with a stuttering cadence rather than a swing feel, throwing you off balance. Mid-album tune “EU (Emotionally Unavailable)” begins with just the rhythm section of Tetteh, Exell and Kai; settling into a heavy, rock-ish vamp, deep and satisfying, they sound like they could plausibly produce a fine album of their own. Nérija bill themselves as a collective, not a group, and they leave plenty of room for individual voices to shine. Garcia, whose excellent debut Nubya’s 5ive was released in 2017, blows sultry, fluid lines as well as thick, repeated phrases that bring to mind a jam-band saxophonist crossed with Coltrane. Maurice-Grey and Turton are both loose and smeary players, roughing up the music’s finer edges. Kinoshi is a dexterous improviser, as on “Swift,” but still makes room for long tones that give her solos emotional depth. Exell, a master of funk, makes great use of her drum kit, with a gluey snare, a resonant bass drum, and dark, chunky cymbals. Kai’s lines hold everything loosely in place. Tetteh emerges as the album’s unexpected star. The absence of another chordal instrument like the piano gives the guitarist room to stretch out when it comes to melody, harmony and texture. Her rhythmic accompaniment is tight and in the pocket, but often gets weird and spacey, sounding like a mixture of Nile Rodgers and Mary Halvorson. Her improvisations—particularly on “Riverfest” and “Partner Girlfriend Lover,” which she wrote—are superb, crisply stated, and engaging. Tetteh—who also sings on her solo project, Nardeydey—has one of the most distinct voices on the album, and that’s saying quite a bit. At its best, Blume is a testament to the rich aesthetic diversity of London’s jazz scene.

Parted Plains,Ami Dang,by: Daniel Martin-McCormick,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3a201a7943ca0008c14cfb/1:1/w_160/partedplains_amidang.jpg,2019-08-06 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ami-dang-parted-plains/,Leaving,"Near the end of her life, the great Jungian analyst and folklorist Marie-Louise von Franz declared that civilization requires myth in order to survive. She believed that the Christian myth on which Western civilization is founded had degenerated; in its place, she repped for alchemy, a pet obsession of her former mentor, which has yet to catch on. But her larger point resonates. We need stories to make sense of our lives and to propel us into the future; if the myths we live by have brought us to the brink of global collapse, might a change be in order? Baltimore’s Ami Dang doesn’t attempt anything quite so bold as a global consciousness reset on Parted Plains, her new album for Leaving Records. But she does dive into the shadowy, archetypal waters of the fairy tale, weaving impressions of ancient stories with modern sounds. The album purports to sketch a fresh take on something as old as language, soundtracking “a yet-to-be written folktale that is neither Eastern nor Western, not traditional or contemporary—but somewhere in between.” She does this by blending sitar explorations with thick ambient synth backdrops, often bypassing new age’s cheap fusion cliches for something uneasy and darkly moody. Parted Plains is a mixed bag, but it’s also a grower. The stories Dang uses as a jump-off point can be pored over as coded maps of the psyche, their every detail and twist passed down through the generations precisely because of a deep spiritual resonance. Her compositions feel more like cues for a movie we don’t get to see. Still, they have a vibe. The sound design can be compelling, with synths gurgling and writhing, haunting reverb trailing her sitar, and paranoid sub bass keeping the hippies at bay. “Make Enquiry” uses slurry metallic noises reminiscent of early grime, while “Stockholm Syndrome” recreates the psychological shift observed in victims of its 1973 hostage situation namesake (which has itself ascended to the rank of modern folklore): The first minute basks in clammy subterranean dread before abruptly pivoting to a serenely bucolic chill. But the pieces rarely get off the ground, and then too often wrap up by dispersing into nothing, like a dandelion blown into the summer breeze. “Bopoluchi,” named after a Little Red Riding Hood-type character from India, coasts for a bit, abruptly changes course, and then stops dead in its tracks. The source text tells of a young woman’s journey far from home and deep into the woods, where animals speak a secret language and a battle of the wits must be fought with a bandit and his witch co-conspirator. How the music relates to this tale of danger and redemption is anyone’s guess. Dang spends a lot of the LP soloing, but the best moments are when her instruments gel. On “Sohni,” she layers her sitar in delay to build a shower of plucky cries over a mournful synth harmony. It’s a poignant exhale which skips the noodling that pervades many of her other tracks. The closing “Souterrain” goes the opposite route, opening with an unaccompanied solo which is answered, one minute in, by urgent arpeggiations and spacious groans. In those suspended moments, you feel Dang’s conviction coming through. At its strongest, Parted Plains feels intimate; at its weakest it seems private to the point of opacity. One wishes Dang had committed more to the timelessness of her folklore inspirations, and less to the East-meets-West mashup. After all, something that’s neither Eastern, Western, new, or old might be something just diffuse enough to be nothing much at all.

First Taste,Ty Segall,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d2f43aa8a4fb30009467fa6/1:1/w_160/tysegall_firsttaste.jpg,2019-08-05 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ty-segall-first-taste/,Drag City,"Ty Segall races through ideas as though they’d disappear if he didn’t commit them to wax as soon as possible. The records pile up: In 2018, he expanded his vast discography by four albums, and earlier this year added a noise-drenched live album called Deforming Lobes for good measure. First Taste, his first studio set since last year’s sprawling double-LP Freedom’s Goblin, suggests Segall may be warming to the concept of restrictions. He recorded First Taste without a single guitar, seemingly renouncing his allegiance to garage-psych skronk. Relying entirely on keyboards, percussion, and stringed instruments of different persuasions, the album winds up sounding like… well, like a lot of other Ty Segall records, really. Segall has a catholic definition of psychedelia, opening the door to prog freak-outs, a bit of fractured folk, cascading vocal harmonies, and spooky synths. None of these accents change his basic architecture. He’s still working from a common vernacular—a bit of Led Zeppelin here, a bit of T. Rex there—not intending to recreate the past as much as to give his flights of fancy some context. It’s hard to sound weird without a baseline for normality. The new additions brighten First Taste, giving it a bold and intense sheen. But make no mistake: To a garage rocker, every instrument looks like a guitar. A Greek bouzouki and a Japanese koto can still make a racket if they’re strummed like a Fender Telecaster, and double-tracked drums don’t hurt, either. Consequently, First Taste is sometimes just as frenetic as Deforming Lobes. But as a producer, Segall is intent on leaning into empty spaces and absences—to play with the elements of light and shade that Jimmy Page brought to Zeppelin. Segall, though, remains a patron of low-rent scuzz-rock, so First Taste can sound cheap—intentionally so. He pushes levels into the red on “The Fall” to accentuate its breathless velocity, and he uses schoolyard recorders to bring unruly circus energy to “I Sing Them.” This elevated trash isn’t the only trick in his toolbox. First Taste is sharply paced, sequenced for maximum impact as two separate vinyl sides but also effective as a seamless 41-minute listen. The over-saturated “Taste” serves as a frenzied fanfare for the entire affair, while the malevolent, tarry grind of “I Worship the Dog” is paired with the sweet, steady-rolling “The Arms.” “Lone Cowboys,” an epic suite crammed into four and a half minutes, concludes the album with the suggestion of more music lurking around the corner. Leaving the crowd wanting for more has never exactly been Segall’s style, so the album’s sudden end isn’t merely bracing—it’s a source of perspective. Abandoning the guitar has sharpened his senses as a record maker, making him cognizant of his excesses. By trimming slack and channeling indulgences into bursts of pandemonium, he comes away with an unusually focused album. If the songs don’t linger as long as the sound, chalk that up to Segall being a “first idea, best idea” kind of guy. This time, he concentrated on production. Maybe next time around, he’ll turn his attention to the tunes.

GUV I,Young Guv,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d387646d260ed0008f5a193/1:1/w_160/YoungGuv_GuvI.jpg,2019-08-05 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/young-guv-guv-i/,Run for Cover,"Ben Cook wears dark, chunky sunglasses when he performs as his indie-pop act, Young Guv. Put one way, his thick, plastic rims are shorthand for his musical inspirations—Elvis Costello’s effusive power-pop, the Gallaghers’ psychedelic glam rock. But paired with the hazy tracks on Young Guv’s third LP, GUV I, the frames serve as a disguise: Forget about Ben Cook, guitarist for Toronto hardcore icons Fucked Up. For 23 minutes, Cook transports himself to a simpler time, one that may exist only in indie rom-coms, when watching clouds go by or lying around in bed amounted to romance. But maybe that’s reading too much into it; maybe, on an album bursting with sunshine, the shades are simply a practical choice. Young Guv’s version of nostalgia is less a carbon copy of a particular genre or decade than a drive-by tour of archetypes. Where 2015’s Ripe 4 Luv or last year’s 2 Sad 2 Funk respectively leaned into yacht rock’s theatrics and nu-disco’s syrupy synths, GUV I recalls the grainy, jangly melodicism of college rock. From the opening movie clip about dropping out of society to the tambourine that kicks off “A Boring Story,” it’s easy to imagine these songs spinning on a dusty college-radio turntable, or blasting from the middle of the quad on a bright spring day. Cook isn’t shy with his references. “Every Flower I See” is a love letter delivered with an earnestness to match its ringing cymbals and fuzzy major chords, and the first line of the chorus—“Don’t go now”—brings to mind a similarly gushy refrain from Teenage Fanclub. Though anyone with a passing knowledge of C86 will hear plenty that rings familiar, GUV I still manages to find new shades within power-pop’s broader palette. The somber acoustic guitar and vocal harmony of “Roll With Me” feels like an Elliott Smith cover band, until a metallic guitar halfway through takes the track on a dreamier path. The bluesy harmonica on “A Boring Story” adds a playful detour to an otherwise slow and ambling closer. But such diversions from the formula are the exceptions on a largely homogeneous record. Even at only 23 minutes, the songs start to blend together—ringing guitars and reverb-distorted vocals can only combine in so many ways before they start to resemble the Byrds’ Pandora station. At times GUV I can feel like indie rock cosplay, especially coming from a shapeshifter like Cook. When an artist genre-hops with such agility and totality, with titles and performances as goofy as Young Guv’s can be, it’s harder to lose yourself in the familiar comforts of a fuzz pedal and a charmingly off-key vocal. Even so, there’s an ease to the mimicry; the chiming chords on “High On My Mind” sound like the Bats, and the Bats sound like a laconic Saturday afternoon. Moreover, Cook is a pop poet—his credits as a ghostwriter for artists like Sum 41 and Taylor Swift outshine his heavier origins here—and his sweetly romantic lyrics and “yeah yeahs” are a natural fit for dusty guitars. His lovelorn anxiety can feel nostalgic in itself: “I am rocky waters/And you are crystal clear,” he sings on “Patterns Prevail,” as if matters of the heart could be so black and white. His most memorable lyrics are just quirky enough to stand out, yet general enough to attach to any romance. “Do you ever watch the clouds while remembering me?” he asks, gently hopeful. As a refrain, it’s awkward—a bit wordy, a bit stoned. But for members of the New Sincerity crowd who own too many band tees, that’s not such a bad thing.","Fucked Up guitarist Ben Cook is also a pop poet, and the third album from his nostalgic indie-pop project recalls the grainy, jangly melodicism of college rock.

Data Horde,Leech,by: Fred Thomas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3a166087626200084cd7ac/1:1/w_160/leech_datahorde.jpg,2019-08-05 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/leech-data-horde/,Peak Oil,"For the better part of the last 20 years, Brian Foote has been behind the scenes and at the perimeter of the stage, calmly making sure everything goes smoothly. With work for both the celebrated Kranky label as well as his own Peak Oil imprint, studio credits ranging from production for Zola Jesus to drum programming for a pre-Ableton Stephen Malkmus, or catch-all auxiliary electronics duties in Valet, Fontanelle, and a touring configuration of Atlas Sound, Foote’s roles tend towards the understated but indispensable. A patient, exacting approach guided even the mossiest work from his electro-acoustic collective Nudge, and he applies that same precision to Data Horde, the first full-length from his dancefloor-minded alias Leech. In the liner notes for a Leech cassette release from 2017, Foote shouted out trailblazing early ’90s UK jungle labels Moving Shadow and Good Looking Records, and some of the material feels influenced by jungle’s early, more minimal days. With Data Horde, Foote pays more direct tribute, exfoliating his tracks until the skeletal elements of dissected drum’n’bass are left in a vast, empty field. Within these dubby, wide-open spaces, Foote steadily unravels tightly controlled productions. As the title might imply, Data Horde has a labored-over feel, as if the sessions were refined repeatedly over the course of months or even years. The slowly blooming first few minutes of “Nimble” feel disorienting until accumulating layers of polyrhythms and interlocking synth lines click into place to reveal the purpose of every sound. Clearly a fascinated student of techno history, Foote plays with the boundaries of where one microscopic subgenre of electronic music becomes another. A brief passage of fuzzy bass stumbling drunkenly through choppy drum patterns in “Bit Rot” suggests IDM, but stops short before making any predictable moves. Vaguely familiar jungle breaks slither in and out of focus and acid basslines drool across “Delysid,” rolling in waves of anticipatory tension that never fully break. In every track, the expected turn is sidestepped, and the drop never happens. Most interestingly, even with its nods to rave’s early prime, Data Horde is neither a nostalgic love letter to the golden era of drum’n’bass or an academicized archeological dig of a ’92 warehouse party. Foote aims for a specific sweet spot of jungle’s gilded days, but also explores beyond those constraints. With the same steadfast demeanor that touches all of Foote’s work, his first fully formed collection of Leech material creates a breathing environment where fragments of the past joyously corrode into whatever comes next.","On his first full-length under the Leech alias, Brian Foote dissects his electronic music until it evokes the wide-open spaces of early drum’n’bass.

Country Squire,Tyler Childers,by: Stephen M.

And you know it’s inescapable, seeping into your car or house. So when Tyler Childers sings about being downwind from a paper mill on the first line of the first song on his new album, you know he’s in a woeful spot. Country music thrives on down-and-out characters in tough situations, and Childers, a native Kentuckian who sings with a scuffed-up twang, takes what might sound like a mundane detail and finds a new and wholly unromanticized way to sound hard up. The song, “Country Squire,” is about playing gigs and saving money to refurbish a trailer for himself and his wife, and the introductory detail adds a desperate dimension to his mission: Childers wants his country version of a castle, but also some walls and a roof to try to keep the stench of the world out. He has a remarkable facility with telling details, which pepper Country Squire as vividly they did his 2017 breakout Purgatory. When he remembers getting forcefully rejected by a classmate on “Bus Route,” he ends up lying “face down in the gum on the floor,” and there’s a smirk in his voice, as though he’s relishing the tactile quality of the memory. And who else would start a song about touring and missing home with a line like, “They got my favorite lotion here, something in a hotel I admire.” On the jumpy, jangly “Everlovin’ Hand”—which may be the most bittersweet song about masturbation ever written—Childers takes you right to that Red Roof Inn. Perhaps that’s why he’s become such a prominent figure in roots country in such a short time. Not two years ago, he was another unknown, one of a wave of excellent country artists coming out of the hollers of Kentucky. Born in Lawrence County and raised in Paintsville, he gigged around the area for years, eventually roping Johnny Cash’s engineer David Ferguson and friend/fellow Kentuckian Sturgill Simpson to produce Purgatory. That album found an immediate fanbase, racked up startling streaming numbers, and soon Childers was opening for John Prine on the road and Margo Price at the Ryman. Country Squire doesn’t stray too far from the modified honky-tonk sound (or the butt-ugly cover art) of Purgatory. In fact, he’s been road-testing most of these nine songs for a few years now, sharpening their hooks with each performance. Again he rustles up Ferguson and Simpson to produce, and again he leads a rough-and-tumble band of veteran session players, most of whom are schooled in bluegrass. Rather than going for a high lonesome sound, they sound more like a grizzled house band at a cinderblock bar off some county road. They give “All Your’n” a ramshackle majesty and “Creeker” a wary tension, and Stuart Duncan’s fiddle reinforces the small-town details of “Matthew,” about simply trying to make ends meet while enjoying a little bit of joy in between the trials. That’s a theme common to country and folk music, yet on Country Squire Childers invests it with enough insight and immediacy to make those hardships sound perfectly present tense.

Stevie Wonder’s Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants,Stevie Wonder,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d30c20f11f40000081efd94/1:1/w_160/Wonder_SecretLife.jpg,2019-08-04 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/stevie-wonder-stevie-wonders-journey-through-the-secret-life-of-plants/,Tamla,"A journalist might have found themselves one autumn morning in 1976 eating a luxurious breakfast at Essex House before boarding a private jet to a farmhouse in Worcester, Massachusetts, to have a first-listen to Stevie Wonder’s masterpiece, Songs in the Key of Life. Wonder himself introduced the album, decked out in a cream-colored cowboy suit and hat, with a leather gun belt whose holsters were festooned with the cover art and the message “#1 WITH A BULLET.” Universally beloved, it shipped gold, entered the charts at No. 1, and stayed there until January of 1977. When a journalist could next chat with Wonder, it was nearly three years later. They could just take the 2 train uptown to the New York Botanical Garden, where critics were instead served vegetarian fare as they listened to another double album, the follow-up to his magnum opus. Stevie Wonder’s Journey Through the Secret Life of Plants was years in the making, a soundtrack based on Walon Green’s documentary based on the bestselling book about how plants can be lie-detector tests, how the fern in your house reacts to your emotions, and how mustard seeds can communicate with distant galaxies. October 1979 was a particularly auspicious month for double albums like Fleetwood Mac’s Tusk and the Who’s Quadrophenia soundtrack (Pink Floyd’s The Wall and the Clash’s London Calling would soon follow). Secret Life of Plants entered at No. 4 on the album charts its first week but quickly plummeted. After Wonder collected 12 Grammys in a four-year span, Secret Life of Plants only garnered one measly nomination. An incredibly ambitious tour—boasting over 60 musicians, singers, sound crew, staff, a computer to synchronize his synthesizers, a screen projecting scenes from the film, and a recording truck—hemorrhaged money and was truncated to six dates. Stevie couldn’t even sell out his hometown of Detroit. Motown Record executives and fans alike did not know where to begin this Journey and critics were merciless. “May Be His Worst Yet,” read one headline. “More than being awful pieces of music, [they] reek of automation and transmit no sincerity,” went a review. Rolling Stone likened it to Karo syrup and called it “a strange succession of stunted songs, nattering ballads and wandering instrumentals,” while Robert Christgau equated it to “[an] anonymous Hollywood hack at their worst...ardently schmaltzy instead of depressingly schlocky.” The Village Voice equated it to “the painful awkwardness of a barely literate sidewalk sermon.” It’s a reversal of fortune without equal in pop music. In nearly any appreciation of Stevie Wonder’s profound run of music, Secret Life of Plants serves as a page break, a bookend, the arid valley after the vertiginous peak of the beloved Songs in the Key of Life. In almost every assessment, it marks the end of the greatest run in pop music history. “If Alexander wept when there were no more worlds left to conquer,” critic Jack Hamilton said when Slate ran their “Wonder Week” feature, “Stevie happily composed 90 minutes of largely instrumental music for the soundtrack to a documentary about botany.” Favoring slowness as well as quicksilver mood shifts, spare balladry and additive composition, acoustic guitars and two $40,000 Yamaha GX-1 synthesizers, whimsical experimentation and near invisible incremental movement, an album with six credits for “special programming of synthesizer” and Wonder with almost all other instrumentation, it’s a flummoxing and charming album wherein Wonder sings about seeds, leaves, and ecology as he himself embodies the traits of his botanical muse. The best insight into Plants may lie in the original Times review, where, in the midst of meditating on self-indulgence and Wonder’s sentimental mysticism, John Rockwell notes: “He has also managed to make an album that in its own idiosyncratic way may seem an oasis of peace and calm amid the bustle of the rest of the pop-music business.” When Wonder accepted the challenge of providing a soundtrack for the documentary, even he was surprised: “I’d always figured if I did one it would be for a film that raised society’s consciousness about black people.” Originally, the film was to use a soundtrack made in part from plants with Wonder contributing “Tree” for the end of the picture. It didn’t fit with the rest of the film, but producer Michael Braun asked Wonder to instead score the entire film. So Wonder would go in with a four-track recorder and headphones. In the left channel was Braun explaining what was happening on-screen while engineer Gary Olazbal would count down the number of frames in the sequence in his right, leaving Wonder to sketch out the score. Six studios would ultimately be used. It was only the second album to ever be recorded digitally (Ry Cooder’s Bop Til You Drop beat it by a few months) and the first album to use a sampler in the form of the rudimentary Computer Music Melodian, which perhaps explains the special thanks given to the air traffic controllers at Dallas-Fort Worth airport and the Los Angeles Zoo. Its scope is difficult to convey, not just because a blind musician provided a soundtrack for a film that he himself could not see. Wonder probably saw about as much of the film as the general populace did, as The Secret Life of Plants never got a wide release in theaters and was never put out on VHS, DVD, or made available on streaming services. The opening movement of “Earth’s Creation” is ludicrously bombastic all on its own, full of Phantom of the Opera-style high-frequency shredding and chord-bludgeoning. With the film though, it pairs perfectly with intensely dramatic images of spuming lava, crashing tsunami waves, flapping seaweed, and dancing plankton. The first side of the album remains wildly uneven, but how else to convey the Godlike act of creation without being by turns chaotic, messy, lovely, whimsical, and a little cruel? “The First Garden”—with its lullaby chimes, sampled bird songs and crickets, acoustic bass, and harmonica line (all played by Wonder)—provides the underlying motif of The Secret Life of Plants and it works magically with the time-lapse images of sprouting acorns, spores, and new shoots. And while “Voyage to India” might seem willfully exotic on the album, mixing together themes that appear later into an array of wineglass drones, symphonic strings, and sitar, it works with the film and its introduction of Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose, the Indian polymath and botanist. Later on, Wonder folds in a Japanese children’s choir and a crackling duo of African kora and djembe drum. It’s nearly 15 minutes into the album before Stevie Wonder’s voice appears, telling the story of both Bose and George Washington Carver on the plaintive “Same Old Story.” It scans as the first of many songs overtly about plants, as well as one of Wonder’s most forced biographical efforts. But the stories of Bose and Carver are far more painful than that. Bose was an Indian subject of the Queen, his work discovering the electrical nature of plants largely ignored by the Royal Society in London during his time. Across the ocean, the slave-born botanist Carver struggled most of his life to rise to the descriptor of “Black Leonardo.” But as brown- and black-skinned men—“Born of slaves who died,” as Wonder puts it—their genius was discounted and dismissed outright in white society. There’s a tactile resignation in the chorus: “It’s that same old story again.” In exploring the neglected, ignored, seemingly inhuman aspects that society affixes to the plant kingdom, Wonder finds resonance between his botanical subject matter and the black experience. “A Seed’s a Star” states in its first line: “We’re a people black as is your night/Born to spread Amma’s eternal light.” Reaching back to the Dogon tribe of Africa and their worship of the distant star Sirius B, also referred to as “Po Tolo,” that name in their language signifies at once the immensity of that heavenly body as well as the smallest seed, a paradox that encompasses the interconnectedness of all life. Stevie introduces many voices other than his own. Children’s voices and overheard conversations hover at the periphery of several songs. Wonder deepens the dimensions of the album with these intimate, everyday sounds, drawing correlations to childhood, memories, and the connections between people, not just between plants. It suggests that the album could seemingly arise out of anyone’s daily life. While the book and film could be esoteric, Wonder insisted that the album was in part about down-to-earth black life and love, telling The Washington Post that year that this music “comes just from my life.” Perhaps that’s why he had his ex-wife, Syreeta Wright, come to lend her soft vocals to the indelible piano ballad, “Come Back as a Flower,” wishing to spread the sweetness of love and envisioning “that with everything I was one.” Human as it can be, The Secret Life of Plants is big and wide enough to be decidedly other, too, as when Wonder warps his platinum voice with a wide array of electronics. There’s the Brainfeeder funk of “Venus’ Flytrap and The Bug,” maybe the closest he ever got to the sound of his contemporary, George Clinton. And then there’s the femme falsetto he adopts to sing as Pan for one of Journey’s sweet delights, “Power Flower.” A woozy, low-key gem in the Stevie Wonder songbook (check the stretched taffy of his coos-and-drums solo 3:30 into the song) and one of Janet Jackson’s favorites, Wonder utilizes his synths to make himself sound something other than human. That strange, neutered, warbling, alien voice that arises on the astonishing “Race Babbling” is as visionary a sound as anything Stevie ever created. It’s a techno odyssey that resembles the likes of Carl Craig and Juan Atkins and the hazy, ethereal feel of Solange’s When I Get Home (she explicitly credited this album’s influence on her own approach). In the context of the film’s collage of sped-up urban scenes, it even anticipates Philip Glass’ groundbreaking score for another nature documentary, Koyaanisqatsi. Unfurling, clenching, spiraling, and mutating across its nine minutes, it’s the longest song on the album and approaches the sort of gender destabilization of something like the Knife’s Shaking the Habitual. Wonder’s voice morphs and merges with the timbres of trumpet and saxophone (his manically high-pitched vocal hook is a freakish delight), and later blurs into the harmonies of Josie James until it’s hard to parse who is who. It’s a disorienting effect in more ways than one, a queering of the biggest African-American male pop star of the era that’s still without precedent. Rather than attempt to carry on with Key of Life’s trajectory and his own heritage, Stevie had the rare cache to wander down every path, in effect making Motown his own private press label. No longer rooted to the traditions of soul, gospel or the sound of Motown that he built his legacy upon, Wonder literally branched out, reaching upward towards an undetermined new destination, exploring intuitively and fearlessly in a manner that few artists have ever managed to do in the history of pop music.

Practice Makes Paper,E-40,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d386d8595e03a000834d871/1:1/w_160/E-40_PracticeMakesPaper.jpg,2019-08-03 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/e-40-practice-makes-paper/,Heavy on the Grind,"On record and in conversation, E-40 remains the same—free-flowing, wise, hilarious, and unstoppable. Ever since he emerged from Vallejo, California in the 1980s, he has churned out high-quality albums with ease. And yes, some of the 26 tracks on Practice Makes Paper, his 24th or 26th  solo release, depending on how you keep count, are merely average, or at worst, trite. But nothing this man does is half-baked, and the most surprising thing about the latest multi-volume addition to an already-intimidating discography is that most of the songs are actually pretty good. The sprawling double album is E-40’s follow-up to 2018’s lean, 38-minute The Gift of Gab. While that record kept a laser focus on the funk-influenced sounds 40 does best, Paper is considerably more ambitious, inviting artists from across the map to get hyphy. The guest list is dizzying: There are certified stars like Migos’ Quavo, Wiz Khalifa, Rick Ross, and TDE’s ScHoolboy Q, but also Houston City Council candidate Scarface. The West Coast is well-represented, with G-Eazy, Ty Dolla $ign, Iamsu! from HBK, and the 20-year-old Compton MC Roddy Ricch, but so is Detroit (Tee Grizzley, Payroll Giovanni, and Sada Baby) and New York (Fabolous, Method Man, & A$AP Ferg). Some of these collaborations bear ripe fruit. Payroll Giovanni’s stone-cold verse on “I Come From The Game” evokes E-40 compadre Too $hort. “Chase the Money,” (produced by... ChaseTheMoney) shows 40 flipping a Migos flow harder than his guest Quavo. On “I Don’t Like Em,” 40 recruits Bay area MCs Cousin Fik & Laroo to channel Chief Keef and Silky Johnson’s love for hating over a trapped-out G-funk beat. Despite featuring dozens of different producers, the record is remarkably consistent. The most egregious misstep, “1 Question,” is a saccharine Chris Brown/Rick Ross/Jeremih collaboration that never should have been. “Bet You Didn’t Know” could’ve been a cute moment for E-40 to drop knowledge on youngsters were it not plagued by the only beat on the record that makes him sound old. But it’s 40’s lyrical gifts that make him special. He understands the evolving nature of language and communication like few others, with constantly updated references that connect him with each new generation of rap fans. He fires off hysterical one-liners with aplomb (“Knock his tooth out, make ’em look like a cook at the Waffle House,” from “Another One”) and references his mentions (“Don’t @ Me”) and memes (“Make a hater cry like a Jordan meme,” he raps on “Imma Find Out”) with the same comfort with which he doles out sarcastic financial advice (“Should I buy it off the lot or should I lease and write it off?/Or pay cash like a rapper and watch the value decrease?” he muses on “In the Struggle”). There have been plenty of legendary MCs who never figured out how to maintain relevance through middle age, awkwardly surfing trends or losing touch with reality completely. But 40 has persevered by staying within himself. “I make sure I don’t outdate myself,” he told Ebro on his Beats 1 show. “I stay within my jurisdiction, and whatnot, but I’m also me.” With dozens of albums under his belt, E-40 has had a lot of practice. It’s rarely perfect, but few others can make it sound as joyful.","On his latest double album, the Vallejo vet remains free-flowing, wise, hilarious, and unstoppable.

The Tennessee Fire: 20th Anniversary Edition,My Morning Jacket,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d35e7ce1852280008e54240/1:1/w_160/morningjacket_tennessee.png,2019-08-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/my-morning-jacket-the-tennessee-fire-20th-anniversary-edition/,Darla,"My Morning Jacket recorded parts of The Tennessee Fire at Above the Cadillac, a makeshift studio on a Kentucky farm. Located in a tiny town called Shelbyville, the farm was owned by the grandparents of Johnny Quaid, My Morning Jacket’s original guitarist and cousin of singer Jim James. It’s a decent backstory, but then James laid his vocals down in an abandoned grain silo, and now, that’s the only part people remember. Maybe James could have achieved the same tone in a deserted steel mill a few hours away in Evansville, Indiana, or a meat locker in Frankfort, but that Shelbyville silo helped James—and My Morning Jacket—achieve a sort of supreme rusticity years before Justin Vernon holed up in Wisconsin. For god’s sake, the town of Shelbyville was once the home of the real-life Colonel Sanders. Its misleading title aside, The Tennessee Fire feels modeled after Kentucky itself—Rust Belt, midwestern, and Appalachian, yes, but always country, and misunderstood by the majority of outsiders. “I was born in East Kentucky/Home of where the grass is dyed/Always down and always out/But my morals always seemed just fine,” James sings on The Tennessee Fire’s solo centerpiece “I Will Be There When You Die”—a sentiment and a song that could’ve comforted a Pineville coal miner a century ago. “Take me out of this hell I'm in/Take me out of this dead-end nightmare/And put me back in a world I can live,”  he wails earlier on a “Nashville to Kentucky,” with enough reverb to float him into the same anti-gravity airspace that Sigur Rós occupied that year. The earnest austerity of “Nashville to Kentucky” might’ve slotted Jim James next to Will Oldham. But it’s the rebel-yell shitkickers like “Heartbreakin’ Man,” “The Dark,” and “It’s About Twilight Now” that foreshadow where My Morning Jacket would go next on At Dawn. The band hadn’t yet solidified their lineup or toured enough to have the confidence or awareness to recognize their future in extended guitar jams; only one song tops out over five minutes on The Tennessee Fire, and most are under three. This relative innocence makes The Tennessee Fire the breeziest of My Morning Jacket’s opening trilogy of “harmony and folk shit” records, even if it’s the most uneven. You can hear hints of the restlessness that would eventually lead to 2008’s scatter-brained Evil Urges, which James once compared to a Super Mario Bros. soundtrack. But there’s no overarching theme here, just a band trying on sounds without knowing what they’re doing or expecting anyone to pay attention. If The Tennessee Fire only hints at the festival juggernaut My Morning Jacket would become, it’s because they rarely sound like an actual band on these songs. James has always been the focal point, and here he plays the high-lonesome crooner that could’ve lived at any point in the past century. This is a drinking-alone album, and the lyrics are startlingly bleak when you tune into them: James mostly anaesthetizes himself amongst the lowdown friends and lovers who leave him for dead, dreaming of “casino bars, tight whores, and Tinseltown.” “I think my mother would kill me/If she knew what I was about,” he moans on “I Will Be There When You Die.” This band never deals in outright anger or aggression, but on The Tennessee Fire, the bitter, aluminum aftertaste of that silo reverb says what James can’t bring himself to. The Tennessee Fire remains more suited to revisitation than reassessment—its legacy as “the one before At Dawn” feels secure. This reissue comes stocked with the requisite alternate takes and demos, but the most important song from this era isn’t actually included. Technically speaking, the band’s biggest hit is their cover of Elton John’s “Rocket Man,” included on Chapter 1: The Sandworm Cometh, a collection of odds and ends that preceded their breakthrough At Dawn. It’s easy to see how James related to “Rocket Man” in 1999— one guy trapped inside a metal box, burning up his fuse all alone.","On their debut, My Morning Jacket discovered the heavy reverb that would make them legendary.

Dragonfly,Ajani Jones,by: Stephen Kearse,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3874cb42b8ff0009345fd7/1:1/w_160/AjaniJones_Dragonfly.jpg,2019-08-03 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ajani-jones-dragonfly/,Closed Sessions,"The Bandcamp bio of Chicago rapper Ajani Jones mentions that he dropped out of the University of Iowa to pursue his rap career, and you can feel him yearning to legitimize his choice in every bar of his debut. Unfortunately, that’s the empty core of Dragonfly. He raps about being really committed to rapping. It’s rarely endearing or interesting. Rapping about making it in rap isn’t inherently boring. Rappers as different as A Tribe Called Quest, The Notorious B.I.G., Big Sean, and Open Mike Eagle have found fun ways to use their odd career paths as vehicles for storytelling, observations, and color. Ajani Jones doesn’t really tap into that lineage. Dragonfly is filled with half-baked struggle raps that don’t even aspire to smugness or myth-making. His narratives are so devoid of color and purpose that they make J. Cole’s leftover-lasagna come-up stories sound like Hannibal crossing the Alps. Across the record, his lyrics are so vague they border on nonsensical. There are spells where it is utterly unclear what he is talking about, as on “3D,” where he raps, “It’s fame on the guillotine/And the blood is the love of the industry/Whoa.” It sounds like he’s interpreting a museum painting while stoned. On the song ironically titled “Lucid,” he says, “Feel like Wakandan/I’m just gonna tune in with my niggas/Ain’t got no space for no time limits.” I wish I knew what he meant by that. Jones is clearly a student of the TDE school of introspective chill raps, where rapping relaxes the mind and frees it. The beats on Dragonfly largely have low BPMs and dulled percussion, accented by ribbons of synths that calmly flutter over the beats. Jones is comfortable with this airy template, and songs like “Dutchmasters” and “Quicksilver” play to his strengths. He’s whimsical when he’s at ease, and can stumble upon a decent image when he’s not overthinking. “Quicksilver” has a stretch where Jones begins “I could’ve been anything” and then recalls a drive-by shooting he saw as a kid. It’s a cutting sequence, and it illustrates the life he’s trying to escape through rap. Of course, it doesn’t last. Moments later, he is back to vague musings (“Everybody wanna go some place”). It’s disappointing, but also par for the course. Ajani Jones is a dreamer. Unfortunately, a dream is not a personality.","The Chicago rapper fills his debut with raps about...making it in rap.

Immunity,Clairo,by: Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d2750847953c00009b978cb/1:1/w_160/Clairo_Immunity.jpg,2019-08-02 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/clairo-immunity/,Fader,"Clairo’s breakout single “Pretty Girl” went extremely viral: a lo-fi video shot webcam-style amid dorm-room decor, and a sardonic popular-feminist message (“I could be a pretty girl, shut up when you want me to”) that was an easy in even for those who didn’t normally scour the online lands for bedroom pop. But preceding that chorus was a verse with a precisely observed snapshot of the moment one notices there’s nothing anymore where heartbreak used to be: “Polaroid of you dancing in my room… I think it was about noon/It’s getting hard to understand how you felt in my hands.” It’s a careful bit of writing belied by its hype, and an early indicator that Claire Cottrill’s heart lay in songwriting, not content production. And with a new EP soon after, Cottrill had already moved past it: “I’m hoping [Diary 001] can close off the bedroom-pop era of Clairo, and I can move on to some other things.” On her debut album Immunity, she proves this decisively. Immunity brings in new personnel—produced by Rostam Batmanglij, mixed by Dave Fridmann, assisted on drums by Danielle Haim—for a new direction. Clairo’s often compared to one of her teenage idols Frankie Cosmos, both for making lo-fi pop and for becoming entangled in some exhausting discourse about her father’s bankroll and industry ties. But where Frankie Cosmos’ spiritual precursor is college rock, Clairo’s, at least on Immunity, is soft rock. The uptempo tracks are breezy and chill; the ballads are lush and deeply felt. Reverb’d keyboards abound. Several tracks have children’s choirs, but—if such a thing is possible—subtle ones. The fit is surprisingly natural; she certainly sounds much more at ease here than on the likes of an earlier collaboration like “B.O.M.D.,” where Danny L Harle’s trop-pop fripperies sound in retrospect at odds with Cottrill’s plainspoken voice. Perils do lie this way; much of Immunity approaches the very sad, very posh, and very produced ballads of adult-contemporary drears like London Grammar or Låpsley. (“Feel Something” comes closest to this sound; not coincidentally, it’s the weakest cut.) But, crucially, the album only tiptoes up to the edge of huge production and no further. It’s truly remarkable how many of these tracks, if they were produced even one iota larger, would collapse into mush, and how much restraint it must have taken not to blow them up that big. Opener “Alewife” builds, but modestly: a recorder counterpoint, a little drum fill, some light guitar fuzz, less of a breakdown than a heart skip. “Closer to You” could have been easily overpowered either by the 808s and Heartbreak-style AutoTune on the verses or the power-ballad guitar on the chorus; it isn’t. The children's choirs and vocal processing on “I Wouldn’t Ask You” aren’t there to make the song swell but to dissolve away, leaving a sparse, almost hymn-like arrangement of piano, Cottrill’s un-vocoded melody, and nothing else. “Sofia” is powered by a “Dancing on My Own” synth chug—about the most surefire banger fodder there is—but one that remains in the background beneath crackly, distorted guitar (a late addition). The closest thing to trend-chasing is “Softly,” a Y2K pop-R&B ballad like something TLC or Mya might have recorded as an album track—which is far from bad. The restraint isn’t just there to be tasteful, but to keep the focus on Cottrill’s voice and words, which have become touchstones for what seems like a full generation of listeners. “You can barely hear what I’m saying on all of my demos on Soundcloud. Maybe that was a style thing or an insecurity thing. Maybe it’s both,” she told Vice of her old music. That’s standard interview stuff, the lorem ipsum of the lo-fi artist who’s graduated to hi-fi. But it’s also true: up front and clear, Cottrill’s voice exudes a quiet warmth and intimacy, whether confessing a personal crisis on “Alewife” (named for the Boston T stop) or realizing she’s fallen for a girl friend in “Sofia""—going from “I think we could do it if we tried” to “Oh my god, I think I’m in love with you"" in two verses’ span, as if she’s only just realized it mid-track, in real time. Last year, Clairo came out as bisexual, and she’s said much of Immunity is about the accompanying experience: crushing on friends, looking for unspoken signs, generally dealing with feelings that one’s still grappling with being possible, let alone reciprocated. For every outright love song there’s one, like breakthrough single “Bags,” that dwells in the everyday and the liminal spaces therein. What Clairo sings about is mundane but charged—watching TV, “wasting time on the couch,” but also dropping hints (like a subtle Call Me By Your Name reference in the verse) and tentatively offering that if the song’s subject were to make a move she wouldn’t mind, really. The melody of the chorus is morose, a flattened affect and a resigned shrug: “I guess this could be worse/Walking out the door with your bags” All the feeling is in the instrumental, chiming above, quietly gorgeous. “Can you see me using everything to hold back?” Clairo sings, and though she’s referring to her crush, she could just as well be singing about Immunity. The effort sounds effortless.

Woodstock – Back to the Garden: The Definitive 50th Anniversary Archive,Various Artists,by: Caryn Rose,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d2dde06ea98e20008674a08/1:1/w_160/woodstock_collection.jpg,2019-08-02 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-woodstock-back-to-the-garden-the-definitive-50th-anniversary-archive/,Rhino,"The mythological status of 1969’s Woodstock Music and Arts Festival can sometimes feel overpowering. The festival is the ultimate expression of the 1960s. Moments from the three-day concert have crystallized as symbols of the era, with details like Richie Havens’ acoustic prayer for freedom, Roger Daltrey’s fringed leather vest, or Jimi Hendrix’s “Star Spangled Banner” held up as sacred countercultural relics. Partly to blame are both Michael Wadleigh’s 1970 documentary film and the accompanying triple-LP soundtrack, which multiple generations of fans encountered through older relatives or at midnight showings at revival houses. The truth about what happened on Max Yasgur’s dairy farm in upstate New York is vastly more interesting than the myth, but for years, there was no counter-argument available. With the festival’s 50th anniversary, producers Andy Zax and Brian Kehew made the case that this was the time to set the record straight and get it right. As Zax writes in the liner notes, “If we’re still thinking and arguing and opining about the meaning of Woodstock after half a century, shouldn’t we at least have a set of baseline facts about what happened there?” The result is the limited edition 38-CD set Woodstock - Back to the Garden: The Definitive 50th Anniversary Archive. (Several abridged versions—10xCD, 3xCD and 5xLP sets—were released in June.) Over the course of the set’s 432 tracks, producers Zax and Kehew unveil an exhaustive, end-to-end reconstruction of the festival in precise chronological order, the result of 10 years of careful research, audio reconstruction, and debunked myths, as Zax relates in the 88-page liner notes. But the true revelation of this release is simply how great the newly restored recordings sound. Zax and Kehew approached the mixing by referring to photographic documentation, which allowed them to situate the performers within the mix based on where they were standing onstage. Comparing the original soundtrack to the 2019 product is like switching from black and white to Technicolor: The compression and flatness that choked the life out of the original release is gone. The result is a sonically welcoming experience that is as immersive as you could want; it is a joy to listen to. A glance at the complete lineup drives home the fact that there was an abundance of talent onstage at Woodstock. The stretch from late Saturday night into early Sunday morning stands out in particular, beginning with Creedence Clearwater Revival at 12:30 a.m., then Janis Joplin (who took the stage to an enormous roar at 2 a.m.), Sly and the Family Stone, and the Who, finishing as dawn broke purple behind the stage, with Jefferson Airplane (who were on the orange acid, as opposed to the brown acid featured in the now-infamous warning over the PA), providing what lead singer Grace Slick proclaimed “morning maniac music!” at 8 a.m. The experience of hearing these sets back to back is extraordinary. As ’60s rock chronicler Ellen Sander says in the liner notes, “Just when you thought it couldn’t get any more fabulous, it did. It was like being in the heartbeat of a mythic beast.” Almost all the artists involved allowed their full, actual sets to be included this time around. (The lone exception was Jimi Hendrix: The owners of his catalog held back two songs from his set.) John Fogerty complained for decades about Creedence following the Dead, but their set turns out to have been 50 minutes of high-octane choogle, including three recent Top Ten singles. The Band’s set, originally rejected by the group because “it wasn’t totally up to our standard,” proves to be delicate, gorgeous, and heart-wrenchingly evocative. Crosby Stills & Nash substituted tracks from a later Fillmore East performance on the first Woodstock album, but their set at the festival was better, transmitting an ebullience and energy that feels more like they’re singing together for the first time in Joni Mitchell’s house than onstage in front of half a million people; both “Wooden Ships” and “Long Time Gone” have an electric depth that still resonates 50 years later. And the Dead’s longtime assertion that they were a disaster is greatly exaggerated, even if 40 minutes of “Turn on Your Lovelight” is a little much, even for Deadheads. Also restored and contextualized in this release are all the legendary stage announcements from production team members John Morris and Chip Monck—each one of which, writes Zax, might serve as “the start of a miniature novel”: Louis Price is summoned with a number to call in Washington, D.C.; Wheat Germ is told that the bag containing his medicine is in the possession of Holly; Edward Shea needs to meet Barbara at the car right away. Special mention goes to the idiots who climbed the lighting scaffolding and spent the festival being admonished twice an hour by an increasingly annoyed-sounding Monck. The mundanity and humanity of these details draw you in, and it’s a much more believable scenario than the Wadleigh documentary with its triple-split-screens and jump cuts. Ultimately, the announcements are the mechanism that places the attendees within the story. As the Who’s Roger Daltrey astutely (and affectionately) notes, “The stars of Woodstock were the audience.” The one negative of this project is its inaccessibility. Rhino only manufactured 1,969 box sets; each one retails at $799.98, and there are no plans to make the 38-disc version available on streaming services. For those with smaller budgets, the 10xCD version is still worthwhile, as it’s the first Woodstock compilation to feature every artist that appeared at the festival, and was assembled with the same intent of conveying the experience of the three days. What the 38-disc box set succeeds at is not just righting the record, or presenting a mammoth set of live songs, but in creating an environment that effectively transports the listener to that muddy pasture in upstate New York. In the spirit of the original event, that experience should be extended as widely as Woodstock’s influence.

He writes like someone keeping his head above water, hustling paycheck to paycheck, with dwindling hopes that a career in music will provide all promised riches. Durk Banks knows what it’s like to brush with rap superstardom. A prominent player in the early-2010s Chicago drill surge, he leveraged interest in the scene to cut a deal with Def Jam. But Durk never seemed comfortable breaking bread with the majors, and has since retreated into the cold embrace of his hometown. Last year’s Signed to the Streets 3 was released in partnership with Interscope, representing another—perhaps final—throw of the dice in Durk’s pursuit of mainstream acceptance. But the album just kind of came and went, and so he returns with Love Songs 4 the Streets 2, a follow up to a 2017 tape that offered hymns for the Chicago neighborhoods he’ll forever orbit, and an antidote to some of his label struggles. At its best, Love Songs 4 the Streets 2 evokes similar sentiments. “I thought my life was supposed to change when I got that deal,” Durk sighs on “Rebellious” as he details the need to pay his grandmother’s bills and mourns fallen cousins. Assertions like “even though I’m still rich” feel perfunctory, with Durk’s half-sung, Auto-Tune-doused croons deflating like a punctured basketball. On “Locked Up,” he appears to talk directly to a jailed friend about the thoughtlessness and pain that led the pair to this point in their lives—a song that hits just weeks after it was revealed that a Georgia judge has found probable cause to charge Banks, as well as fellow rapper King Von, with criminal attempt to commit murder. There’s no American Dream success story here. Durk makes being a rapper sound like a hard slog. At a full seven songs longer than its preceding volume, Love Songs 4 the Streets 2 has time to run the full gamut of Durk’s styles. “Green Light” is a hardboiled trap thriller; “Die Slow” slides into guest 21 Savage’s haunted lane. As if to underline Durk’s mainstream struggles, cracks appear on the tracks ostensibly cut for radio appeal. The Durk-Meek Mill team-up “Bougie” lacks chemistry. Sleazy sex jam “Extravagant” comes close, but it’s held back by Nicki Minaj’s ill-suited bombastic verse and a few laughable Durk one-liners. Culling these missteps would have helped the tape’s batting average, but they can’t mask Durk’s undeniable strengths. Looking back on drill, nobody really cashed in on the promised riches. Very young stars had the keys to the kingdom but couldn’t find their way through the gates. But in the case of Lil Durk, something special happened: He kept making great music, evolving out of a hard-boiled subgenre towards something more meditative and essential.","A sequel to his 2017 tape shows the one-time rising star of Chicago drill again offering a sobering depiction of life outside of rap myths.

Safe and Also No Fear,"Slaughter Beach, Dog",by: Abby Jones,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d23876030462100099971b8/1:1/w_160/SlaughterBeachDog_SafeAndAlsoNoFear.jpg,2019-08-02 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/slaughter-beach-dog-safe-and-also-no-fear/,Lame-O,"In late 2017, 12 days after Modern Baseball performed a weekend of farewell shows for hometown fans in Philly, co-frontman Jake Ewald released his second solo album, Birdie. The consecutive events suggested an amicable closure: Ewald was signing off on the emo/punk band he’d formed in college and relocating full-time to Slaughter Beach, a hypothetical destination created to inspire his songwriting. After two LPs performed entirely by himself, the beach must’ve grown lonely; on Safe and Also No Fear, Ewald’s third album as Slaughter Beach, Dog, he’s joined by a full ensemble that includes Modern Baseball bassist Ian Farmer, his first official reunion with a former bandmate since their indefinite hiatus. Together, they dive into the pared-down folk-rock Ewald had just begun to explore on previous solo releases. It’s the furthest from MoBo he’s ever sounded, and maybe as a result, also the least engaging. Although its clunky double phrasing betrays some anxiety, a title like Safe and Also No Fear feels reassuring coming from Ewald, who’s grieved the loss of a close family member and supported bandmates through mental health crises in recent years. But the album rarely reflects a corresponding sense of personal triumph. Opener “One Down” leans on a pedestrian acoustic pattern that plods in one ear and out the other. “I dress up nice/I feel all right/I get loaded/And I come home late at night,” Ewald sings, without enough conviction to absolve the cliché. He falls into a half-spoken drawl on “Dogs,” a tender discourse on human friendships (“I know he always understands me/Even when I am being evasive”), but the stream-of-consciousness melody feels as aimless as another night at the neighborhood bar. “Black Oak” achieves a more affecting result by ditching the vocal melody altogether: “His belly warm with drink/He leaned into the freeway in the night/Investigating exit ramps/Waiting for a sign,” Ewald recounts in an unnerving deadpan. The guitars drop out as the song’s protagonist meets tragedy: “They found him at the black oak/They dug him up last night.” A looping coda evokes the spaced-out lapse of highway hypnosis, as if the band were cruising those darkened roads themselves. The spare electric guitar solos of “Tangerine” recall the charm of Birdie standout “Bad Beer,” or the sweeping arpeggios of 2016’s “Monsters.” But even with a full crew alongside him, it’s hard not to feel a kind of emptiness, a monotony that dampens Ewald’s personality. Throughout Safe and Also No Fear, there are flashes of his sheepish wit and contagious hooks—the same qualities that elevated quotidian anecdotes like “Tears Over Beers” in Modern Baseball’s discography. He sounds most confident on the harder-rocking “Good Ones,” a retrospective laundry list of letdowns, and “Heart Attack,” about the panic of realizing that the person you’re dating (or are you?) won’t return your calls. “My sunlight hurts my skin/I let the wrong one in,” he sings genially, reaching the album’s crowning achievement in wordplay: “Hand in hand grenade, you make me weak.” The blips of charisma are reminders of better music Ewald’s made prior; this time around, it feels as though he’s fighting against his own indifference.

African Giant,Burna Boy,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3871460ad9a700092558ff/1:1/w_160/BurnaBoy_AfricanGiant.jpg,2019-08-01 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/burna-boy-african-giant/,Atlantic,"The music spread across West Africa’s many cultures have been frequently miscategorized, lumped together under the racist “world music” banner, or altogether ignored. There are still mix-ups surrounding Fela Kuti’s Afrobeat and the current umbrella pop genre Afrobeats. Somewhere in between the not-so-ambiguous space of that “s” is Nigerian cross-pollinator Burna Boy. His grandfather was Kuti’s manager, his dad introduced him to the music of deejay Super Cat and dancehall great Buju Banton when he was a kid, and a girl he liked at 10 gave him his first Joe CD, initiating a love of America R&B and subsequently rap. He is a musical omnivore who left Nigeria to live and learn in London but never strayed too far from home. Burna Boy is one of West Africa’s brightest rising stars, and he has long been poised for a crossover moment here in the States, but his position on the Coachella billing earlier this year illustrated a disparity between who he is in Africa and who he is in America. “I am an AFRICAN GIANT and will not be reduced to whatever that tiny writing means,” he wrote on Instagram. The memo was loud and clear: Africa will not be marginalized. When his mother accepted, on his behalf, the award for BET’s Best International Act (an ill-defined category that reinforces just how noncommittal we are as a society about most non-white imported music), she reminded an audience full of black musicians that they are part of a larger whole: “The message from Burna, I believe, would be that every black person should please remember that you were Africans before you became anything else.” This idea of tracing all blackness back to the wellspring is the crux of Burna Boy’s new album, African Giant; his mother’s words, sampled from the BET speech, are the last ones spoken on the album. Burna’s compositions are all based in something he’s dubbed Afro-fusion—blending pop, American hip-hop and R&B, Jamaican dancehall, and hard UK rap with Nigerian music—and he puts Africa at the root of that expanding lineage while also pushing the more traditional sounds forward. The album is a splendid hour of jams, both personal and political, that never sacrifices its bewitching groove even when it’s dressing down corrupt officials. African Giant is more cohesive, more robust in sound, and significantly broader than his previous music. He siphons external sounds to enhance the shape and texture of his homegrown slappers. Last year’s Outside made a play for Western audiences in the wake of Burna’s cameo on Drake’s More Life. There’s still a sense of that here but the hybridist isn’t making any concessions for such audiences. The music reaches across the diaspora because his sound has a unifying power. It starts with Africa first, then extends outward. While he used English frequently before, here he sings primarily in Pidgin, Yoruba, and Igbo and pulls guests from all over into his distinctive polyrhythmic world: Nigeria’s Zlatan and Ghana’s M.anifest, Angélique Kidjo, reggae legend Damian Marley and dancehall singer Serani, Jorja Smith in the UK, across the Atlantic with Jeremih, YG, and Future. He described leading the latter two into Afro-fusion as “bringing my brothers home.” This musical Garveyism produces two of African Giant’s most massive moments. On “Show & Tell,” Burna meets Future halfway, exchanging tough talk as the flavor of his melodies seeps into the rapper’s Auto-Tune. The buoyant sway has all but taken hold when suddenly the song bottoms out into something darker and unpredictable. The Jeremih and Serani-assisted stunner “Secret” melts swaggering Naija pop into an R&B slow burner, the washed-out guitars rolling over Burna as he drifts into a refined falsetto. Elsewhere, Burna is at his best either holding it down at home or tracing African influence beyond its shores. He trades blows with Zlatan on “Killing Dem,” each hyping up the other. He secured a guest appearance from premier African diva Angélique Kidjo on “Different” with Damian Marley, in which they sing about the similarities and disparities of black suffering. Burna and Marley’s verses mirror each other, structurally and melodically, rising and crashing, building to a surging Kidjo coda. In his lyrics, Burna uncovers how rampant corruption inspired personal study. “Differently intelligent … Different studying of my roots and origin/Tell my truth in melodies.” While Burna Boy takes his position within the expansive and nuanced musical legacy of Africa, he probes Nigeria’s turbulent history. He can’t really be an African giant without speaking truth to power, after all, and he spends much of the album breaking down the narratives that have surrounded Nigeria since it gained independence in 1960. No sequence embodies this better than the two-pronged economic evaluation of “Wetin Man Go Do” and “Dangote”; the brutal nature of a life making ends meet is put shoulder-to-shoulder with the unrepentant drive of billionaires (the song is named after the Nigerian business tycoon Aliko Dangote, the richest man in Africa). If the Nigerian elite won’t stop amassing wealth, Burna suggests, then he can’t slow down in his pursuit of money either. He comes off both impressed by their appetites and anxiously aware of an expanding fiscal imbalance. In instances like these, Burna Boy juggles roles as an everyman, local griot, global ambassador, party-starter, and occasional badmon with ease.","The Nigerian singer blends the personal and political into a new benchmark of Afro-fusion music.

Live From the Artists Den,Soundgarden,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d39ca5d30b14d0008980fc2/1:1/w_160/soundgarden_livefromtheartistsden.jpg,2019-08-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/soundgarden-live-from-the-artists-den/,UME,"Soundgarden’s episode of Live From the Artists Den arrived just as the group was bringing the supporting tour for King Animal, their first album in sixteen years, to a close. They were roughly three years into their reunion, trading on ’90s nostalgia with an eye toward a sustainable future. That future never materialized. Chris Cornell took his own life after a gig in Detroit in 2017, writing a sad final chapter to the band he fronted for more than three decades. Live From the Artists Den is the first posthumous Soundgarden release, a multimedia affair available as CD, LP, and BluRay, each presenting the entirety of the February 17, 2013 concert filmed at Los Angeles’ Wiltern Theater. The show was meant to celebrate the end of the King Animal tour, but six years later, its accompanying album serves as an accidental epitaph—a career retrospective given right when the group seemed resurgent. Part of the reason Soundgarden’s comeback seemed secure is that they wore middle age handsomely. Their reunion seemed neither crass nor nostalgic, but a resuscitation of a connection they lost somewhere after Superunknown turned supernova in 1994. King Animal felt assured and confident, with Soundgarden navigating new material with grace, slowing down the tempos slightly while weaving in Cornell’s dextrous rhythm guitar. Listening to Live From the Artists Den, it’s striking how seamlessly the King Animal material fits between hits and deep cuts. The songs play off of each other, the slow churn of “Blood on the Valley Floor” teeing up the coiled menace of “Rusty Cage.” Soundgarden didn’t mess with the arrangement of “Rusty Cage” or any of their other classics, but the distance of years changed their attack. They sound a trace slower here, which makes the music feel weightier and more measured. Some of this deliberation may be a side effect of filming a concert. Guitarist Kim Thayil admitted as much when promoting Live From the Artists Den, saying the group may have “played a little bit more conservatively because of the cameras and the lights.” This might sound like a tame performance, but Live From the Artists Den is focused and forceful. In the four years following this performance, Soundgarden toured regularly, playing Rockfest after Rockfest, selling out amphitheaters named after cellphone companies and headlining places with cumbersome names like Farm Bureau Insurance Lawn at White River State Park. They were riding the circuit afforded to any ’90s rock survivor, toiling away on new material when their individual schedules allowed. Enough demos reportedly exist to form a finished album, but disputes between the band and the Cornell estate may mean that they’ll never be completed, so that leaves Live From the Artists Den as an unintentional swan song. It’s one that suits the band, offering a deep dive into their catalog with no nostalgia. Like all final goodbyes, it’s a bit too sad if you look too closely.

Family Party EP,Knife Wife,by: Margaret Farrell,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d39fcad2d5df30009bba7d4/1:1/w_160/knifewife_familyparty.jpg,2019-08-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/knife-wife-family-party-ep/,Sister Polygon,"Knife Wife’s music is not for the fainthearted. The Washington, D.C. trio make visceral, minimal punk that’s as stripped down as a roadkill carcass. Billed as the “diary of a teenybopper translated and recited by freaks,” their new EP Family Party envisions a teenage brain where boredom and escapism fuel macabre nightmares. Balancing unsettling lyricism and uncomplicated instrumentation, their thrumming basslines and crusty drum hits form the backdrop for ruminations on licking strangers and euthanizing friends. Much like being a teenager, it’s strange and weird and sometimes scary. Across 10 tracks, band members Sami Cola, Nico Castleman, and Ruby Parrish rotate through guitar, bass, drums, and vocals. Though their lyrics are hard to swallow, their compositions are solemn, rudimentary chord progressions that pile each instrument on top of the others. The ominous bass and breathy sighs of “Dogs” recall the seductive rock of LA’s Cherry Glazerr. Sometimes the band’s eerie, crawling guitars resemble a lo-fi version of the xx’s haunted minimalism. “Fruity Void” drops the standard rock band arrangement in favor of a surreal synth wormhole. This is music for rousing the darkest corners of the psyche and embracing abjection. Like the films of Harmony Korine, Family Party goes out of its way to indulge its creators’ peculiar desires and demented fantasies. The earliest tracks explore infatuation turned to poisonous obsession: “Cut up photos of you and glue it in my eyelids,” goes the first verse of “Dreamland.” “Silly Pony,” the best-conceived track, pairs a single plucked guitar string against Parrish’s exhausted vocals. “You fucked my dogma,” she sings, the syllables barely escaping her throat. “I’ll collect your used Band-Aids/Until my infatuation fades.” During the chorus, her voice sounds like it’s traveling through a playground talk tube. There’s no affection, just a deranged search for validation. Family Party is dotted with mentions of sickness, reminders of the human body’s frailty and mortality. Parrish uses morbidity to manipulate: “If I told you I was croaking, would you love me back?” she ponders on “Silly Pony.” On “The Dentist,” Castleman recalls the pleasures of a day spent hallucinating on nitrous. “God, I love this auto-immune disease,” they sing flatly. They’re hyper-aware of their body, but the lyrics spiral into abstraction; the mind on nitrous is hard to access. “Lobe” takes a darker turn, commanding listeners to “euthanize your friends” so Castleman can “snip off their lips.” “Feed me probiotics/I don’t wanna be sick,” they continue—perhaps a genuine moment of health anxiety, perhaps a sarcastic aside. It’s the disconnection that’s most upsetting about Knife Wife’s music: They don’t react as you’d expect to discussions of animal strangulation or ass-licking, because they mostly don’t react at all. But throughout Family Party, the band seek contact with others—at least by proxy. Whether screaming about lobotomies on “Lobe” or dreaming of becoming someone else on “Fruity Void,” their obsession with bodies, illness, and the grotesque is really about escaping oneself. Underneath their apathy lies personal distress and confusion; Knife Wife just find darkness more palatable when it’s veiled in obscenity.

Falling,Dude York,by: Nina Corcoran,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d39ce6db607ab000972e8e0/1:1/w_160/falling_dudeyork.jpg,2019-08-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dude-york-falling/,Hardly Art,"At their best, Dude York sound drunk with unbridled joy. With two full-length albums, a Christmas record, and a handful of EPs, the Seattle pop-punk band has carved out a spot beside Charly Bliss and Diet Cig, indie rock bands suited for sleepover dance parties. On their third proper album, Falling, the trio loses its individuality in a wash of generic hooks and half-hearted lyrics that only recall contemporaries who did it better. Guitarist Peter Richards and bassist Claire England split songwriting and vocal duties for the first time, sequencing the album so they take turns.  On “Longest Time,” England turns in an alt-rock anthem, and Richards answers with the psychedelic power pop of “Doesn’t Matter.” Drummer Andrew Hall pulls it all together with streamlined, uptempo rhythms and quicksilver drum fills. Over the course of 13 songs, though, Dude York wind up mimicking their idols as opposed to referencing them. “How It Goes” is decent by-the-numbers Weezer, while “Should’ve” huddles in the shadows of Dinosaur Jr.’s towering amp rig. And it’s almost surprising to learn “DGAFAF (I know what’s real)” isn’t a Bright Eyes cover. Falling shape-shifts through ’90s alt-rock, but the band sacrifices its personality in the process. No track captures this problem like “Box.” The glossiest song on the album, it leans into the synth-pop melodrama of the Cure while Richards elongates his vowels, doing his best Robert Smith. The rhythm section is sprightly and the chorus is catchy, perhaps because it is uncannily similar to Janelle Monáe’s “Cold War.” It’s a decent dance song, and the protagonist in the song’s music video does exactly that, jumping and spinning feverishly by herself as band members occasionally join in. Eventually, it’s revealed that the woman is dancing on a stage for approval—a single person sits in the empty crowd, bored and gazing at his phone screen, while she breaks a sweat. It’s an unfortunate metaphor for a band that has lost its voice. “I wish I was someone who could stick up for themselves,” Richards sings on “:15.” It’s hard to disagree with him.

Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack),Various Artists,by: Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3a12cd7943ca0008c14cf9/1:1/w_160/various_onceuponatime.jpg,2019-07-31 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-original-motion-picture-soundtrack/,Columbia,"In the 1960s, Paul Revere & the Raiders were a goofy garage-rock band popular with well-behaved tweens. Calling the band square doesn’t go far enough; they were altogether edgeless. Among the Raiders’ many sins was a habit of dressing in full Revolutionary War regalia, tri-corner hats and all. In Quentin Tarantino’s ninth movie, the actress Sharon Tate (played by Margot Robbie) teases an ex about enjoying the Raiders and, moments later, there’s a shot of Charles Manson leaving the area. The music grows ominous. The message is loud and clear: The Raiders may have been cheesy, but when compared with a countercultural menace, those tri-corner hats start to look pretty good. Since K-Billy’s Super Sounds of the ’70s closed out the opening scene of 1992’s Reservoir Dogs, music has played an outsized role in Tarantino’s films. Some songs take star turns, as with Chuck Berry’s “You Never Can Tell” at Jack Rabbit Slim’s in Pulp Fiction or the Coasters’ lapdance scene in Death Proof. But given Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood’s Los Angeles setting and the density of its references, and given that it’s the first of Tarantino’s “history” pictures to be set in the pop music era, this soundtrack has more resonance than any before it. Essentially a buddy comedy featuring Leonard DiCaprio as an aging actor and Brad Pitt as his stunt double who pal around on the periphery of the Manson murders of 1969, the movie is pretty, pretty, pretty (especially when cars and Brad Pitt are involved); its politics, however, are ugly, ugly, ugly: violently reactionary in their treatment of the late ’60s counterculture and its concomitant burnout. The music that connects the fictional and non-fictional worlds of the movie is a soft-serve swirl, pretty even when it’s ugly, an undeniable, oft-disquieting mixtape of golden-age rock’n’roll, radio DJ patter, and period-specific commercials. Like the Raiders, the groups here evoke the mythic surf-rock ’60s, good timin’ before the vibes went bad. Deep Purple, the prog and metal pioneers, offer two songs from 1968, the year in which the movie begins, the year before the band went feral. One of those songs is a cover of Neil Diamond’s “Kentucky Woman,” and Diamond’s oddball “Brother Love’s Travelling Salvation Show” is on the soundtrack, too. It’s either a celebration or a parody of gospel music; evangelicals didn’t know in early 1969, and it may be that Diamond didn’t either. The rest of the offerings are from minor groups of the mid- and late-’60s, like the Buchanan Brothers, Roy Head and the Traits, the Box Tops, and (the better-known) Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels. These songs bleed tension from the film; it’s hard not to smile at the ringing harmonies on Los Bravos’ “Bring a Little Lovin’” or Dee Clark’s syrupy croon on “Hey Little Girl.” Frequently, they accompany shots of Pitt’s character, Cliff Booth, cruising around town. But it’s all unimpeachable car music, propulsive and melodic, a playlist assembled by a know-it-all who’d be unbearable were it not for the fact that he knows a lot. When less obscure, the music is flagrant in its allusions. Simon and Garfunkel’s “Mrs. Robinson” shows up briefly (The Graduate was released in December ’67) to whisper of transgression. “Paxton Quigley’s Had the Course,” by the British duo Chad and Jeremy, is a song with a rock’n’roll introduction that, two minutes in, shifts to a gorgeous keyboard interlude. It’s a formal playfulness worthy of the Beatles and it’s exciting to hear minor moptops playing similar games. There are other familiar songs here, handholds to guide the listener through the obscurities. A cover of Joni Mitchell’s “The Circle Game” by Buffy Sainte-Marie accompanies a scene of Sharon Tate driving through Hollywood. Mitchell’s original is nostalgic, but Sainte-Marie trills of daffy innocence, forever-youth unmarred by darkness. The carousel imagery is particularly poignant given that so much of Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood deals with westerns and painted ponies; with color, motion, and distraction. Sainte-Marie speeds up when she sings, “We can’t return/We can only look,” as if to race right by it. Other, less cheerful lyrics are lent emphasis by their presence in the film. “Treat Her Right” stresses chivalry only as a means to an end, while the chorus of “Son of a Lovin’ Man” makes a singalong of a genetic predisposition for lechery: “I’m the son of a lovin’ man/My daddy told me get you all the lovin’ you can.” Phrases like these are vestiges of the period, but given the way the movie valorizes old-fashioned men—drinking, watching television, hitting others in the face—they stand out all the same. The DJ patter we hear coming out of the movie’s radios, introducing songs and leading out of commercials, seems more intentional. The ads hawk perfume and cologne and cars and tanning butter, an explosion of superficiality that, Tarantino indicates, was overripe and turning rotten. But they were so funny. So weird. So beautiful. Those are the qualities the director’s fantastical, ultra-nostalgic film means to celebrate. The dream of the ’60s is alive, eternal. We’re urged to ignore the lame cultural context of Paul Revere & the Raiders because you can have fun dancing to their song “Good Thing.” This kind of fun is what makes the movie provocative. It’s a dare: Come on, those hippies are murderers, you have to admit you’re enjoying this. And maybe you’re not. But that’s less of a risk with this soundtrack, which, despite its countless references, doesn’t want you to think too hard. It wants you to push down the pedal and drive.","The music is a highlight of Quentin Tarantino’s new film, an undeniable, oft-disquieting mixtape of golden-age rock’n’roll, radio DJ patter, and period-specific commercials.

Meet the Woo,Pop Smoke,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d37241d1852280008e542c3/1:1/w_160/popsmoke_thewoo.png,2019-07-31 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pop-smoke-meet-the-woo/,Victor Victor Worldwide,"When Pop Smoke emerged late last year from the outskirts of Brooklyn, the first thing you noticed was his deep and raspy voice. Rapping entirely in ad-libs, hooks, and Instagram-ready one-liners, he sounded like a kid raised on a strict diet of Get Rich or Die Tryin’, Finally Rich, and Newports. His production, mostly from UK drill beat wizard 808Melo, mixed grimy, fast-paced drums with vocal samples ripped from UK garage and melodies that could score an anime. This stew of influences could only come from an artist raised on the internet, but Pop Smoke’s smooth arrogance and West Indian lingo remains distinctly Brooklyn. Now that “Welcome to the Party” is his borough's current summer anthem, he capitalizes on the momentum with his debut mixtape Meet the Woo. Meet the Woo arrives at a pivotal moment for Brooklyn’s still-growing drill scene. Ever since 22Gz’s “Suburban” and Sheff G’s “No Suburban,” Brooklyn drill has lingered in the shadows of its Chicago and UK counterparts. Even as 22Gz signed to Kodak Black’s Sniper Gang and Sheff G became a phenomenon in New York City high schools, the prevailing theory was that these guys would never break out of the Northeast unless they switched up their style. Meet the Woo doesn’t overthink this dilemma; it’s just Pop Smoke taking nine swings at making the hardest, dirtiest shit he possibly can. Previous singles “Meet the Woo” and “Welcome to the Party” lead off the mixtape and set its sinister tone. Of the new tracks, “Scenario” comes closest to recreating their magic: Pop Smoke’s voice is harrowing and Marvel-supervillain worthy, the beat a haunted amusement park. He doesn’t show a lot of lyrical creativity, but he can catch you off guard with his delivery: On “Better Have Your Gun,” he goes from ignorant bravado—“Shoot a nigga, go to jail for it/Cause I know I got the bail for it”—to demented and playful, whispering designer brands with a nightmarish echo on his voice.  His limitations as a writer are exposed on “Dior”—outside of the mesmerizing hook, which doubles as an Amiri Jeans ad, he sounds stuck, repurposing lines like “Bitch I’ma thot get me lit” and throwing in a lazy and unneccesary and homophobic one-liner. It might be occasionally unimaginative, but overall Meet the Woo injects life into a Brooklyn drill scene that was running on fumes. Pop Smoke just wants to cause chaos and dominate the playlists of every party before the NYPD inevitably shuts them down. He’s already accomplished this feat with “Welcome to the Party,” and something on this mixtape will follow in its footsteps soon. Maybe a Brooklyn drill rapper can break through without changing, after all.","The Brooklyn rapper makes good on the promise of “Welcome to the Party” with a debut full of the hardest, dirtiest tracks he can manage.

1123,BJ the Chicago Kid,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d386931d260ed0008f5a124/1:1/w_160/BJtheChicagoKid_1123.jpg,2019-07-31 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bj-the-chicago-kid-1123/,Motown,"BJ the Chicago Kid has spent his career straddling the line between sideman and star attraction. The Chicago crooner guested on singles from Kanye West and Schoolboy Q and recorded with many of the most distinguished artists of his generation—Kendrick Lamar, Chance the Rapper, and Solange among them, in addition to Dr. Dre, Freddie Gibbs, Vic Mensa, A$AP Rocky, Lil Durk, and dozens more. He performed at Barack Obama’s 2017 farewell address and earned three Grammy nominations for his 2016 Motown debut, In My Mind. Yet for all that exposure, he still hasn’t had a charting single of his own. It seems the industry loves BJ the Chicago Kid’s voice but doesn’t have much of an opinion one way or the other about him as an artist. For all his obvious talent, he’s a deceptively hard sell. He doesn’t have the voice-of-his-generation allure of Khalid or the tortured-poet mystique of Frank Ocean. He idolizes artists like Marvin Gaye and D’Angelo, complicated figures who carry an aura of importance, but his own records are more in the lineage of Musiq Soulchild and Dwele, singers with great voices and pleasant dispositions but considerably humbler ambitions. The marketplace never quite knows what to do with acts like that. It’s to his advantage that BJ never tries to be anything that he’s not. His fetching sophomore album for Motown, 1123, doubles down on the laid-back, creature-comfort vibe of In My Mind. The Anderson .Paak feature “Feel the Vibe” kicks off the record on an especially charming note, welcoming the listener to a family gathering filled with music, spirited conversation, and generous spreads of soul food (“Don’t forget the cornbread”). From there, nearly every track offers some combination of good times, good drink, good company, and good sex. The closest the record comes to conflict is when BJ wonders whether things are too comfortable. “Real men get scared sometimes because it’s too good,” he laments on the Donny Hathaway-esque relationship study “Too Good.” The album’s other great dilemma: On “Champagne,” a spontaneous roll in the hay threatens to make him late for a pre-existing commitment—though he doesn’t make those plans sound especially important anyway. BJ has never been one to manufacture high stakes. Like all of neo soul’s greats, BJ seamlessly blurs R&B’s past and present, but 1123 tends to sidestep the most obvious tropes, both modern and retro. Save for its Rick Ross verse, the bumping Marvin Gaye update “Playa’s Ball” sounds like it could have been recorded at any point over the last quarter century. In its final stretch, though, 1123 does toss out a few of-the-moment tracks that radio might be able to work with. The hater-smiting “Worryin’ Bout Me” dabbles in trap, with a verse from Offset, and “Reach” casts BJ opposite some contemporary house from Dutch DJ Afrojack. The most conspicuous departure is “Rather Be With You,” the album’s Khalid moment: a big, sappy ballad that wallows in the artificial drama that BJ otherwise almost pointedly resists. It’s the one moment on 1123 where the production upstages BJ’s voice, and the one moment where he sounds anything less than completely comfortable. When a singer proves this good at small statements, there’s no need to try to force a grand one.

Kiri Variations,Clark,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3873c173549b000883a039/1:1/w_160/Clark_KiriVariations.jpg,2019-07-31 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/clark-kiri-variations/,Throttle,"Seasoned electronic music producer Chris Clark sounds like a man in need of a change on Kiri Variations. In the run-up to the release of his 10th album he praised acoustic instruments as “an antidote to frictionless digital music” and advocated for an “anti-muso” approach, sounding exhausted with both electronic timbres and conventional musicality. The album started life as the score to the British TV series “Kiri,” a commission Clark has credited with inspiring new approaches in his productions. This may explain why the Warp Records veteran has swapped out his habitual synthesizers in favor of piano, harpsichord, strings, and voice, topped with a light sprinkling of electronics. Rather than sounding refreshed, though, Kiri Variations comes across as a labored work that can be both interesting and listenable but rarely at the same time. Weighing in on the side of intrigue is “Kiri’s Glee,” which resembles an aural rendering of a not particularly inspired piece of naive art, its tasteful string plucks interrupted by a recorder line that is deliberately out of tune. This may provide useful color within the television show, which centers on the abduction of nine-year-old Kiri Akindele, but here  the effect on the listener is nails-on-the-blackboard annoying, and nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is. “Cannibal Homecoming” walks a similar path, its opening minute marked by a vocal buzzing around, high-pitched and infuriatingly out of key, like a late-night mosquito attack when you’re dozing off to sleep. The self-explanatory “Simple Homecoming Loop” is quite the opposite: a tasteful mixture of piano, strings, and electronics that circles around harmlessly, adding little to the tradition of piano mood pieces that Erik Satie would have considered revolutionary before shuffling off this mortal coil in 1925. You’ve heard this kind of thing before, many times: the kind of prettified sketch that AI algorithms will be knocking off en masse for Spotify dinner playlists by 2030. It doesn’t help that the album’s palette is so limited. Even the more experimental songs on Kiri Variations tend to be built upon the same wispily tasteful blocks of acoustic and electronic sounds, with the mid-album duo of “Flask/Abyss” and “Tobi Thwarted” so similar in their airy ambience you could barely fit a licked cigarette paper between them. Occasionally, Clark does nail the mixture of engaging and effective to create moments of itching disquiet that merit repeat listening. “Forebode Knocker” is genuinely troubling, an unsettling vocal loop infecting the instrumentation around it so that it curdles out of tune before your ears, while “Yarraville Bird Phone” has unexpected melodic leaps that send a delicious shiver up the spine. But it’s not enough. Kiri Variations feels like an album that has lost its way: a soundtrack (though most of the music never appeared on the show) that shoots for terror but settles for unease; an “anti-muso” work that is far too conventionally musical. Clark compares the album to Roald Dahl’s short stories for its alleged witchy feel. But Dahl was never, ever dull.","Elaborating on music he composed for the British TV series “Kiri,” the Warp Records mainstay vacillates between too-tasteful acoustic arrangements and abrasive provocation.

The Big Day,Chance the Rapper,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3f963c87626200084cdaa0/1:1/w_160/Chance-The-Rapper-The-Big-Day-1564418470-640x640.jpg,2019-07-30 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/chance-the-rapper-the-big-day/,self-released,"In the fall of 2015, about a year before Chance the Rapper became the biggest independent rapper on Earth, he released a song with his band, the Social Experiment, about transitioning into a family man. The song, a rendition of Kanye West’s “Family Business” called “Family Matters,” named after the sitcom about a black middle-class Chicago household, warned that things were changing. “In this part of my life, I’m growing up and I wanna do this the right way … grow out of it, in the best way possible,” he said, as cautiously optimistic as ever. His daughter was born the month before. With fatherhood ahead of him, he plotted a new course and in the years since, he has pivoted from a carefree yet careful boy to a God-fearing man of the house. Chance’s new album, The Big Day, pegged as his “debut” after three studio mixtapes, is a preordained coming-of-age spectacle. It’s full-fledged, 401k rap, a snapshot of the moment where the future starts approaching so fast it begins to look like now. “They don’t take teenage angst at no banks,” he raps on “We Go High,” invoking Michelle Obama’s famous line about what to do when “they” go low. It’s a flavor of righteousness that pervades the entire 77-minute album. Though less thematic than his previous albums, the day in question revolves primarily around his wedding to longtime sweetheart Kirsten Corley. “The whole album has been inspired by the day I got married and how I was dancing that day,” he told Beats 1’s Zane Lowe. “Everything in it is all the different styles of music that make me want to dance and remind me of that day.” In an attempt to take the rap auteur baton from his mentor Kanye, Chance has curated these festivities to be eclectic yet holistic, emblematic of the guy who remixed the theme song to TV’s beloved “Arthur” and sampled the indie darlings Beirut. There’s an expansive list of guests: En Vogue and SWV, CocoRosie and Death Cab For Cutie’s Ben Gibbard, John Legend and gospel singer Kiki Sheard, Randy Newman and Shawn Mendes. For the most part, he wrangles them into a collective indicative of the Chance experience (the rapper co-produced every song on this project). There’s nothing that suggests he’s breaking character. It’s just that this 22-track sprawl amounts to everything and nothing at the same time. God, marriage, fatherhood, children, adulthood, the future: all heavy things that feel weightless and inflatable in Chance’s hands. In trying to honor all the love and music that moves him, Chance becomes an ill-advised master of ceremonies for an uneven reception. The songs are infectious and exuberant until they become stilted and underwritten. After reclaiming the maligned subgenre of gospel rap on Coloring Book, Chance is trying to one-up himself by bringing perky, newlywed dad-rap back to the zeitgeist. Somewhere on that dancefloor, or perhaps before, he lost his edge. On the surface, Chance hasn’t really strayed too far from his high-spirited wheelhouse, which presents opportunities for him to find his signature stuff. As the Pi’erre Bourne beat wails and shatters on “Slide Around,” he bounces singsongy nursery rhyme melodies off a more than game Lil Durk and Nicki Minaj, who match his breezy flows and Grammy-speak. There are enough glimpses of genius, like the thoughtful living trust he bestows during “Sun Come Down,” to serve as reminders of why Chance has earned all this fanfare, but not enough to sustain an otherwise middling effort. His failures here are, if nothing else, in good faith. Bringing his family together in holy matrimony under the banner of God is clearly very important to him. It’s also a means to get his life on the right track. “My daughter mother double-ringed up/Finger look like jean cuffs, or two lean cups/Used to have an obsession with the 27 club/Now I’m turning 27, wanna make it to the 2070 club,” he raps on the Ben Gibbard-assisted “Do You Remember.” But songs like “I Got You (Forever and Always)” and “Found a Good One (Single No More)” never reach any level of introspection beyond the enthusiasm of their titles. Through all the celebration, there isn’t much consideration for what being a husband and dad actually means. It takes a lot to make the sheer honeymoon joy of a new marriage sound labored or awkward, but Chance is nearly bursting a vein rapping and singing and squawking about how great things are. His wife and child are his muses but they almost never manifest as humans beyond his awestruck fascination with them. The true history of wives is one in service to the legacy of patriarchs. In Chance’s songs, this marriage exists solely as a symbolic vehicle for his maturation. There are moments where he seems to understand this (“For every small increment liberated, our women waited/And all they privacy been invaded,” he raps on “Zanies and Fools”), but he never interrogates it. One of Chance’s great powers has been balancing a childlike wonder with a world-weary pragmatism. His endearing corniness was a coping mechanism for seeing and knowing too much too soon. Now, as he continues to check off boxes—rich, famous, philanthropic, award-winning, married with kids—it’s as if he’s conquered the game and all that’s left is searing self-congratulation. The charms of his cartoonish performances don’t translate well when he raps about the mundanity of adulthood or his Christian homilies. Coloring Book made piety seem as sublime as an acid trip with heady, expanding verses. Chance was guided by his faith but never blinded by its light; his rapping not just precise but breathtakingly eloquent. It was personalized but still far-reaching, steadfast but non-denominational. Kanye’s self-proclaimed best prodigy, “pre-currency, post-language, anti-label, yet pro-famous,” had brought the secular world of rap an invocation even more profound than “Jesus Walks.” In contrast, The Big Day, which is often just as prayerful, feels closed-off. These raps aren’t just duller and more rigid in motion, they’re dogmatic. He loves his girl, he loves his God, he loves his kid, and anyone who doesn’t share that love is a dissenter. He is so tenacious in his worship that it can feel contrived. “They prop up statues and stones, try to make a new God/I don’t need a EGOT, as long as I got you, God,” he raps, demonizing the same awards he champions elsewhere on the album as marks of progress. The album can become a slog, almost oppressively upbeat, but The Big Day isn’t without wonders. Chance is still one of the most talented rappers working, and there are signs of that latent brilliance across about a dozen songs. There are instances where his assorted taste shines, flipping Brandy’s “I Wanna Be Down” into a hip-house jam with Shawn Mendes or getting CalBoy to rap over a chipmunk’d James Taylor sample for “Get a Bag.” The fierce Nicki Minaj verse on “Zanies and Fools” that closes the album is her best in recent memory, and the most memorable among a slew of rap guest spots (DaBaby, Megan Thee Stallion, Gucci Mane, even his kid brother Taylor) that make the quirkier ones all but forgettable. Still, The Big Day rises and falls on Chance's vows. Even on the dancefloor, his hopefulness can feel like a beacon.","Chance’s sprawling, 77-minute “debut” is an exuberant and often wonderful celebration of love and family that struggles to bring depth to his newlywed dad-raps.

Remembering the Rockets,Strange Ranger,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ceedaf7c13a451294e8367d/1:1/w_160/StrangeRanger_RememberingTheRockets.jpg,2019-07-30 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/strange-ranger-remembering-the-rockets/,Tiny Engines,"For Strange Ranger, indie rock isn’t just a genre; it’s an actual lifestyle, the prism through which every aspect of adulthood can be projected and understood. The 2016 album Rot Forever, by an earlier incarnation of the band, started its 72 minutes of Up Records fanfic with the line “She played rock guitar” and peaked with “Won’t you come see Pile with me?” Going by the name Sioux Falls at the time, core members Isaac Eiger and Fred Nixon were kids in Bozeman, Montana, who were prone to let one or two ideas stretch out for six minutes because that’s what their heroes Built to Spill and Modest Mouse would do. They moved to Portland for the followup, Daymoon, and it felt like a higher education, going deeper into the Pac NW canon and local scene politics (key song: “House Show”). They’re now in Philadelphia, and Remembering the Rockets is everything one might expect from an ambitious, reverent band moving to the epicenter of American indie rock: It’s sharper and more purposeful, forged by the pressure of real expectations. The best album of their deep and underappreciated catalog, it also imagines a life after indie rock. Eiger’s in no hurry to get there just yet. Remembering the Rockets operates from a mid-twenties contemplation stage, having enough distance from the crippling insecurities and dependencies of youth to start formulating an adult identity through jobs, relationships, and homeownership—but not to the point where the impending financial and familial obligations aren’t something to recoil from reflexively. Strange Ranger may present as a scrappy indie-rock quartet, but the emotional pitch of their songs honors this liminal stage of adulthood by operating at the excitable internal frequencies of teen pop. Strange Ranger songs still emulate Buzz Bin bands of yore, though Remembering the Rockets tends to aim higher than the band used to, evoking the headliners of Lollapaloozas past rather than indie rock’s ragtag insurgents. More provocatively, the album often makes the case that both camps were playing the same game: Opener “Leona” sees no reason “Pictures of You,” “Semi Charmed Life,” and “Carry the Zero” couldn’t have coexisted on a Winamp playlist to commemorate a new crush or a fresh heartbreak. The most effortlessly anthemic Strange Ranger song to date, “Leona” volleys two chords and two states of being, giddy anticipation and paralyzing doubt. The lyrics are littered with the potentialities that get people up in the morning—the arrival of Friday night, a ticket for a trip abroad, a new love that leaves room for nothing else—yet Eiger sighs, “Not to say these things fix everything,” as though still distrustful of the idea that things could ever be this good forever. It ends with a symphonic burst of gratuitously overdubbed infinity guitars, a vision of endless uplift that’s at stark odds with the next song, “Sunday,” where Eiger is jobless, aimless, and washing the dishes just for a sense of purpose. “What if I just went away?/I’m alone in the world,” he sighs. Throughout, Eiger and Fiona Woodman vacillate between blind optimism and a nihilism that feels more justified with each passing year. The fear of apocalypse is ever-present on the Woodman-led “Message to You” and “Living Free,” synths shimmering like pink mist, while Eiger ends “Beneath the Lights” melting into a puddle of Auto-Tuned isotopic waste. These are the tracks that give credence to Eiger’s Yves Tumor and Oneohtrix Point Never namedrops, even if those are clearly inspirations and not models—the loops on “Nothing Left to Think About” and “Planes in Front of the Sky” are more in line with the Eiger-endorsed “Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth With Money in My Hand,”  watching time slip away, one lazy summer night after another. But Strange Ranger still leave open the possibility for indie rock to swoop in and save the day. On the piano pounding yowler “Ranch Style Home,” Nixon yelps requests for sex and “French fried potatoes” in a caricatured cowpoke accent. But in a moment of true candor—“I need my gal holding my hand/I need my pals packed in my van”—“Ranch Style Home” makes a silent point: Is that kind of itinerant indie-rock lifestyle the only sensible one when nothing feels permanent anymore? “Awkward angels in the snow/What if I just want a family,” he wonders during “Living Free,” putting a fine point on a question hinted at throughout: Is it morally justifiable to bring children into a planet that’s going to be irreversibly worse for every successive generation? Eiger is on the verge of drifting through another morning on “Planes in Front of Sky” before everything snaps into focus: “I walk to work in fading light/Daddies with their kids/I still want that.” On Remembering the Rockets, Eiger is trying to create a legacy as a musician and a person; given the way the ice caps, indie rockers’ economic future, and maybe even human decency itself are all eroding, his hope isn’t just inspiring, it feels downright rebellious.","The best album of the Philadelphia band’s deep and underappreciated catalog dares to ask what comes after indie rock.

"Live at Alexandra Palace London, 8th and 9th May 2019",Four Tet,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3b2c73579b970008b0e3ed/1:1/w_160/FourTet_LiveAtAlexandraPalace.jpg,2019-07-30 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/four-tet-live-at-alexandra-palace-london-8th-and-9th-may-2019/,Text,"The British producer Kieran Hebden has one of the most distinctive signatures in electronic music. First, a gravelly drum machine; then, some jewel-toned synth pads; and, finally, a strip of harp or chimes or wordless cooing, unspooling like wrinkled ribbon. Hebden gets plenty of mileage out of this trim set of sounds, and Live at Alexandra Palace, London 8th and 9th May 2019 makes for a good display of his range. Drawing mostly from 2017’s New Energy and 2013’s Beautiful Rewind, he fuses everything into nearly two hours of surging buildups, placid comedowns, and hard lefts. The album shows just how dynamic his modest toolkit can be—and proves, by extension, that he is a stellar performer, not just a producer. Last year’s Live at Funkhaus Berlin, 10th May 2018 was Four Tet’s first official live album in 14 years (on Bandcamp and on a clandestine Spotify page, he has since added archival live recordings dating from 2004, 2010, and 2013). The Funkhaus show wasn’t as radically improvisational as his live shows once were; instead, it offered a medley of catalog favorites. Live at Alexandra Palace follows almost the same setlist as the Funkhaus, but the crescendos are more forceful, the moments of chaos more tumultuous, the transitions more drawn out. Alexandra Palace does away with song titles, with tracks named simply “Part 1” through “Part 5,” an implicit acknowledgment that Four Tet’s catalog is a series of variations on a theme. “Part 1,” an extended mash-up between “Planet” and “Dreamer,” opens the album on a high note, hitting Four Tet’s sweet spot of muscular groove and wistful melody and then drawing it out for 16 minutes. “Part 2” turns more labyrinthine: First an ambient snippet of “Ba Teaches Yoga” leads into the stately “Two Thousand and Seventeen”; then, after eight lulling minutes, that song abruptly twists into an extended passage of rapid-fire machine hits, alarm bells, and analog squeals. It’s a neat trick, flipping Four Tet at his most sentimental into an ear-splitting din. Parts three and four, with a combined runtime of 75 minutes, comprise the bulk of the album. Here, Hebden whips through “Scientists,” “Ocoras,” “Only Human,” “Lush,” “Kool FM,” and “Spirit Fingers,” followed by “LA Trance,” “SW9 9SL,” “Locked,” and “Teenage Birdsong”—though close listening reveals trace elements of songs like “Sing” woven into the mix. “Part 4” is particularly impressive: The way he flips melodies and tone colors over shifting beats brings to mind someone snapping the rows of a Rubik’s Cube back and forth. The live shows must have been something to behold: Visual designer team Squidsoup turned the 10,000-capacity hall into a space reminiscent of Yayoi Kusama’s infinity mirror rooms, stringing up 40,000 digitally controlled LEDs in a massive, three-dimensional grid surrounding Hebden, who performed at crowd level. Video of the event suggests a translation of Four Tet’s flickering rhythms and textures into something you could almost reach out and touch. The audio recording doesn’t capture any of that, of course, but it’s still gratifyingly immersive. There’s just enough crowd noise mixed in to lend the suggestion of being there without being distracting. And for those who haven’t caught Four Tet in concert, Live at Alexandra Palace offers a new way of hearing his music. Much like Daft Punk did with their 2006 Coachella pyramid show, it suggests that Four Tet’s catalog is essentially one endlessly remixable song.","Kieran Hebden’s new live album reminds us that he is a stellar performer, not just a producer.

Carnival,Bryce Vine,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3a23cd7943ca0008c14cfd/1:1/w_160/carnival_bryce.png,2019-07-30 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bryce-vine-carnival/,Sire,"Bryce Vine describes himself as “OutKast and Blink-182 got drunk with the Gorillaz.” Perhaps a more apt comparison is KYLE taking bong hits with Dave Matthews Band, or Jason Mraz sniffing poppers with Doja Cat. At 31, Vine is at an unconventional age for frat-rap prominence. He established a fanbase nearly a decade ago, as a contestant on “The Glee Project,” a reality television show based off the Ryan Murphy high school drama. His real rise came with 2017’s “Drew Barrymore,” a swirl of neon synths that went platinum, possibly by being added to every “Chill Vibes” playlist in existence. “Drew Barrymore” is the best song on Carnival, and the best encapsulation of Vine’s problems and promise. It leans into the grit that his other songs just wink at; when the computerized beeps and buzzes fall away in the chorus, a more muted drum and Bryce’s unfiltered rasp take over. But the words are inane: “You’re the next Drew Barry, and I want more,” he sings, taking pains to emphasize the wordplay. Glimpses at specificity slice through the bullshit. “Coffee on the Flintstone, jewelry on the ottoman,” he croons, before sliding into this portrait: “The TV hasn’t worked in ages/Probably got a shorted cable/Way too busy fucking on the sofa or the kitchen table.” It’s not poetry, but it conjures something akin to a real relationship. Compare that to the album’s first song, “Classic and Perfect.” Gleaming piano chords and ra-ra handclaps almost beg you to ignore the lyrics, a cringey pastiche of Bruno Mars, Ed Sheeran, and One Direction. “You’ve got a mind and you’ve got a soul,” he chirps, sounding shocked. In “Drew Barrymore,” he sings the creepy line, “Baby let me in/’fore I get way too adamant about it.” This ignorance extends beyond women. “Factory Love,” an unconvincing strum-along ode to “pharmaceutical pleasure,” sounds like it was written by Googling drug lingo. But Carnival isn’t designed for conscious, focused listening. It’s a mood-setting operation: a fog of layered vocals, splashes of trumpets, guitar licks that sound like an impromptu dorm-room jam session. Production flourishes are precise: a chime-like sound effect here, a splatter of drums there. This is music for poolsides and basements. Lyrics exist to fill a void in a vibe. Vine strikes an odd tone in rap-adjacent music: not the melodic, death-consumed teenagers who sing their verses instead of speaking them, nor the buoyancy of Chance the Rapper, nor the sex and money flexes that clog SoundCloud. His stage name is short for “vinyl,” and many of his songs feel nostalgic for the stolid inertia of story-centered, good-times pop. He used to tour with Hoodie Allen, patron saint of frat boys turned rappers. He could very well continue on that path, doubling down on bad puns and frenetic drum loops, writing about objects with more clarity and grace than he writes about women. Or he could embrace Carnival’s rare moments of authenticity, and sharpen his music into something that sticks.","The debut full-length from the “Drew Barrymore” singer isn’t designed for conscious, focused listening.

Emily Alone,Florist,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d2ddba1cb5eef0009649227/1:1/w_160/florist_emilyalone.jpg,2019-07-29 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/florist-emily-alone/,Double Double Whammy,"On her third album, Emily Sprague is sitting by the ocean, taking walks, tending to her plants, daydreaming. She’s feeling peaceful and existential and acutely aware of every source of light in the house. The previous two albums from her indie-pop outfit Florist were full-band affairs, but in these 12 songs, Sprague steps away from her collaborators for a spell, tasked with filling time alone. It’s a familiar reprieve for the Los Angeles-based artist, who has also released several excellent ambient collections under her own name. But while those long-form compositions have evoked solitude and the natural world using modular synthesizers, Emily Alone is built from simpler tools: double-tracked vocals, acoustic guitar, and the occasional birdsong leaking in from an open window. If Sprague’s ambient compositions are a wash of concrete images and color, then folk music is where she grapples with uncertainty. Her cool, sighing voice lends itself to repeated motifs, rising at the end of each line like a question, even during two interstitial passages of spoken-word poetry. Her guitar playing is similarly inquisitive. Most of her songs alternate between just two chords: bittersweet pivots that draw your attention less to a melody than to the motion, a gentle tide beneath her words. Sprague plays folk music in the traditional sense, but the atmosphere she creates is more like new age—practiced as a meditation, leading toward small breakthroughs. With such simple arrangements, Sprague’s writing can sound like an intimate conversation, with larger context left unsaid. A recurring, fragmented lyric throughout the album, “I could have the reasons why,” alludes to several major changes in her life—particularly, a move across the country and the death of her mother in 2017. As with recent albums by Jeff Tweedy and Bill Callahan, Sprague considers the loss of a parent from an almost cosmic perspective: “Some things last a hundred lives,” she sings, her voice dewy. “You were not your final form.” In “Shadow Bloom,” she imagines how she’d spend her days if she knew precisely how it would all end; in her vision, she lies down for a minute, makes some tea, and eats a tangerine. Her point: Life goes on and then it doesn’t. The reasons why are none of our business. A word that pops up over and over again in these songs is “now.” Repetition of the word is Sprague’s quiet way of addressing the suddenness of life, the abrupt shifts and lost connections that mark time. Her songwriting on Emily Alone exists as a document of all her passing nows: a slow rainy season where her mind remains in constant flux. This dissonance between herself and her surroundings becomes the record’s primary tension. “I believe in things we cannot see,” she sings in “M.” She accompanies herself softly on piano, flickering like dim candlelight: deeply felt but only half-understood, the sound of untranscribable emotions dissolving in warm air. The more directly she composes her thoughts, the fuller the music becomes. “Time Is a Dark Feeling” might be a cathartic singalong if adapted by a full band, with a climactic second verse that seems to gesture over the whole record. “Silence never did it for me,” she sings before letting her words avalanche and fill the room with light. In “Today I’ll Have You Around,” she swerves between call-and-response verses and a simple, persistent chorus. It’s a reminder of how we carry other people with us; by the time it fades out, you can actually sense their presence. Emily Alone proceeds this way—a strangely uplifting summoning of ghosts. Sprague makes her point most plainly in the opening song: “Emily, just know that you’re not as alone as you feel in the dark,” she sings. Then, she repeats those last six words a few more times, ensuring that each syllable is accepted and understood before she continues with her wandering thoughts, talking to herself but singing for many.

The Lost Boy,YBN Cordae,by: Will Schube,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d260a0498713d00083bb787/1:1/w_160/YBNCordae_LostBoy.png,2019-07-29 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ybn-cordae-the-lost-boy/,ART@WARAtlantic,"The YBN Crew’s origin story is already the stuff of internet legend, even though the group formed just five years ago. Nick Simmons was born in Birmingham and met Jay Bradley, of Galveston, while playing Grand Theft Auto V. They bonded out of a shared love of rap music and live-streaming video games, eventually recording  their first freestyles in XBOX Live group chats as YBN Nahmir and YBN Almighty Jay, respectively. In 2017, Nahmir and YBN Glizzy met Cordae Amari Dunston online, and Dunston immediately became the elder statesman of the crew. While the group found viral success with Nahmir’s “Rubbin Off the Paint,” the vision they presented on last year’s YBN: the Mixtape was that of a three-headed monster led by Cordae. With The Lost Boy, Cordae makes good on the promise hinted at on YBN: The Mixtape, turning in a front-to-back redemption tale. It is Cordae at his most humble. It’s occasionally corny and self-serious. But its 15 tracks show a star slowly finding his voice and bursting into the mainstream. Through this lens, the Chance the Rapper-assisted “Bad Idea” makes sense on multiple levels. Over an interpolation of Roberta Flack and Donny Hathaway’s “Be Real Black For Me,” Cordae takes cues from Chance on the chorus, cooing “Don’t you cry/It’ll be alright.” It’s a ghost-of-Christmas-past tale: Cordae imagines what it would be like to never come home again, the adoring family members he would never see. There’s strength in community, he seems to be saying, and it’s a message that permeates the record. On first single “Have Mercy,” Cordae turns his gaze outward. Over a “Mask Off”-inspired flute sample and 808, Cordae begins, “Sweet lord please have mercy/Baby Jesus please save us.” It’s a call to join, and in the hands of a less-deft rapper, this sort of proselytizing would come off as saccharine at best, invasive at worst. But Cordae seems to come only from a place of appreciation, bursting with joy at a newfound life that formerly looked bleak. The Lost Boy splits its time between thankfulness and victory laps. On “RNP,” Cordae basks in the glow of success over a sermonizing Anderson .Paak chorus and bouncy J. Cole production: “Smiling ‘cause I’m young, rich, black, and I’m handsome/Not to mention wealthy/Ass on the healthy.” It is, undoubtedly, a dumb line, and the track is one of the record’s clear misses, mistaking puns for cleverness and energy for quality. On the flip side, he sounds surprisingly assured next to Pusha-T on “Nightmares Are Real.” He goes toe-to-toe with the veteran, even encouraging Push to find grace in the building blocks of his career: “I can tell you how I started in this rap shit/Eighth grade backflipping on a mattress.” Despite the glossy guestlist, The Lost Boy remains Cordae’s show. At 15 songs, it could have used an edit, another voice in the room telling him to tone it down. But still, it’s an assured debut. Cordae raps about life with the patience of a pro but the wide-eyed wonder of a newborn. It’s a delicate balance, and he occasionally stumbles, but it’s promising to even watch him try.","Occasionally corny and self-serious, Cordae's redemption tale shows a promising voice bursting into the mainstream.

De Lorians,De Lorians,by: Steven Arroyo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d2f3dc0132b5e0008d19061/1:1/w_160/DeLorians_DeLorians.jpg,2019-07-29 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/de-lorians-de-lorians/,Beyond Beyond is Beyond,"Listening to the debut LP from Tokyo jazz-fusion quintet De Lorians for the first time is like taking a spin on a dark-ride roller coaster. Not just because the 32-minute prog odyssey is full of hairpin turns and inversions: Its transitions unfurl completely unpredictably. Here, 30 seconds of loungey trot offers no refuge from the barrage of sax honking that might rain down by the time you’ve blinked. De Lorians, led by bandleader and multi-instrumentalist Takefumi Ishida, feed on a theory-drunk disrespect for familiar patterns. The music is calculatedly disorienting, but the assailing squeals of Ishida’s sax or Soya Nogami’s lead guitar should be enough to ensure that you don’t zone out. De Lorians proudly take after the work of Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention (“Zappa is God among us,” Ishida has said). But where their Mothers favorites like Weasels Ripped My Flesh would wholly commit to jumping across stylistic universes while getting messy with math, De Lorians maintain a few constants—namely, that Ishida’s or Nogami’s instrument is almost always atop the arrangement, appearing to direct the music with total autonomy. By minute two of opener “Daytona,” they play like they’re dancing to their own fantastical, incongruous meter, the rest of the band existing only in their imagination, because how could any other rational human minds follow along to this? At certain points, just trying to measure what time signature or key the band is in can be like grasping water: The moment you think you’ve closed your fingers around it, it’s already slipped through them and running down your forearm. On “Roccatsu,” Ishida’s slow, despondent vibrato soundtracks a stroll through a shady alley in a noir film, up until it turns a corner, and suddenly this film is 1970s blaxploitation, underscored with muted wicka-chucka funk guitar. “Toumai” ends the album with no fewer than nine movements inside its seven minutes, sequenced as haphazardly as a game of pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey. Ultimately, there’s a sense of levity in these hard lefts that elevates De Lorians from hostile chaos. That’s where listeners can find payoff. De Lorians arm themselves with fun, from the toy piano that wanders into “Himalia” to the sound effects that crop up throughout, taken from Nogami’s growing collection of environmental recordings from his daily life, like the pop of a soda can or the flick of a lighter. Ninety seconds into the tellingly named highlight “A Ship of Mental Health,” a duel breaks out between Nogami’s field recordings and the band. There’s a second or two of sound—laughing, munching, an empty potato-chips bag crinkling—followed by a two-second phrase of music. They go back and forth a few times, as if in dialogue. The effect is similar to a technique used by artists including Steve Reich, the Books, and Charles Spearin, where recorded speech is transcribed and melodies written around its rising and falling pitches. Suddenly, a different kind of sense appears in the motion of De Lorians, one that doesn’t resemble familiar musical patterns so much as it does the accidental rhythms of your lunch break: the tumbling of a canned beverage through a vending machine, or the hesitation in human speech while waiting for processed thought to catch up. On a dizzying debut, it’s De Lorians’ most interesting twist.

Feel My Love,Vaughan Mason & Butch Dayo,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3f012b579b970008b0e545/1:1/w_160/BEWITH054__outside_front.jpeg,2019-07-29 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/vaughan-mason-and-butch-dayo-feel-my-love/,Be With,"You’d be forgiven for wondering if Vaughan Mason owned stock in a ball-bearing factory. Back in 1979, a Wall Street Journal report that 300,00 pairs of roller skates were being sold each month caught Mason’s eye, and he soon set about making an anthem for the rinks. The result was Vaughan Mason and Crew’s “Bounce, Rock, Skate, Roll,” a knock-off of Chic’s “Good Times” that became an epochal slice of roller disco all by itself, fueling innumerable birthday parties and Saturday nights. Beyond the roller rink, “Bounce, Rock, Skate, Roll” continues to boogie through pop culture: You can hear it in Daft Punk’s “Da Funk,” the Avalanches’ “Electricity,” and shouted out by Janet Jackson on “R&B Junkie.” When Mason teamed up with vocalist Butch Dayo in 1983 to cut Feel My Love, a five song EP, he crafted another roller-disco number in “Rollalong Songs.” Full of rubbery bass, phased snares and handclaps, and a chant urging you to lace up your skates and grab a partner, it seemed like another sure shot for the rink. But that track couldn’t replicate the magic of his first hit. Within a year, the once-mighty disco imprint Salsoul Records would shutter, and the sound of boogie was soon overtaken by hip-hop and house. (Mason turned his attention to the latter under the name Raze.) Mason had pretty much been a one-trick pony up until that point, good at assessing other artists’ hits and repurposing them (another single, “Jammin Big Guitar,” would lift parts of Queen’s “Another One Bites the Dust”), but on Feel My Love he branches out and tests other sounds. Not always successfully: It was definitely a mistake to open the set with the torpid piano-and-synth ballad “Oh Love” rather than close with it. That said, he was astute enough to let master DJ Shep Pettibone mix “Party on the Corner,” filling the song with go-go bells, roto-toms, starburst synths, and a sinuous percussion breakdown. “You Can Do It” uses a similar template, making for a boogie track with cosmic-disco elements. Both songs were released as singles, but as cagey as Mason was in flipping a few ideas into a music career, he failed to recognize the true hit he actually had on his hands in the title track. Feel My Love disappeared, but these days it is sought-after, thanks to the earworm of “Feel My Love” itself, which resonates from the old school well into our meme-able present (this reissue comes courtesy of British label Be With Records). You can trace the aesthetic and sonic template of Dâm-Funk and Chromeo back to this song. It’s strange and immediately endearing, its sleekness cut with some cheese, with bits of electro, modern soul, and house embedded in its boogie sound; it’s powered by simplistic drum programming yet still deeply funky, while Dayo’s overly earnest vocal performance lends an almost naive quality. With a bright, incessant synth line that squirts like a spooned grapefruit, “Feel My Love” has been a staple of block parties, low riders, and skate parties ever since, from the Bronx to SoCal. Simple and sharp, it’s proof of Mason’s knack for keeping wheels rolling.","A sought-after roller-disco anthem from 1983 makes for a tantalizing hybrid of boogie, electro, and house, and lays the foundation for artists from Chromeo to Dâm-Funk.

Moon Pix,Cat Power,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3b2b282d5df30009bba8e6/1:1/w_160/cat%20power%20moon%20pix.jpg,2019-07-28 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cat-power-moon-pix/,Matador,"Moon Pix has a wonderful origin tale, one simply too good to miss an opportunity to retell: Chan Marshall was living in a barn with singer-songwriter Bill Callahan in a South Carolina town called Prosperity, on the brink of saying goodbye to music forever—or so she told scores of eager interviewers—when she woke up from a horrible nightmare. “Hell came to get me again,” she told The Fader, attempting to describe the mortal panic in which she awoke. She wrote the songs that night, with visions of spirits pressing the glass. Voilà: Her very own crossroads. This is the kind of myth that music fans cling to make their treasured albums seem more magical, and sometimes we can use these tales to terrorize their teller. When Moon Pix came out in 1998, the fevered hush of possessive adoration surrounding Chan Marshall was at its peak: This was the era of shows stopping and starting, of her faltering voice and mid-song apologies, of breathless reports of said interruptions showing up in the music press, as if Marshall were a consumptive 19th-century heroine. For her most avid listeners, this was the moment when Chan Marshall’s life and Cat Power’s music swirled together most hypnotically, most dangerously, when one threatened to consume the other. The problem with extricating these complicated ideas—who is making my music? Is this person feeling the feelings I feel?—is that sometimes an artist makes something dangerously potent, a piece of work with a mood so thick that it demands an explanation. Moon Pix is undoubtedly that album for Cat Power. We play it for some of the same reasons we play Van Morrison’s Astral Weeks or Slint’s Spiderland—to bask in the suspended time it creates every time it fills a room. She made albums with more indelible songs on them, but she never again made an album so darkly spellbinding. All of the production choices that go into an album like this wind up feeling a little haunted, because the atmosphere they generate feels so unlikely and so unreal: Yes, that is the backwards drum loop lifted wholesale from Beastie Boys’ “Paul Revere” on the album-opening “American Flag,” and yes, there is almost nothing happening around it—the drone of feedback around the electric guitar blurs into the whine of the sample, so they sound like one hybrid sound. But there is no real accounting for the heavy sense of doom this imparts, why it makes us feel like a low ceiling is suddenly moving lower. And yes, Chan Marshall sings “my new friend plays the drums” before a startled little crash of snares answers the line—as if she has reminded the guy at the kit to wake up, and he has fired off a panicked fill to assure her he’s working—and this gives the music a certain unmade feeling, as if unfolding in real-time. But that doesn’t explain, exactly, its incantatory effect. Nothing can really explain it besides intangibles like conviction, intensity, shared intention. Whatever nameless thing Marshall and her hired band were pursuing on Moon Pix, they were united in their pursuit, and this sustained fever of artistic purpose is another element in the mix, just as palpable as the instruments or the lyrics. It doesn’t take many elements to generate a trance, but it requires a Herculean level of concentration and empathy. All of this witchiness seeps into every fiber of the songs. Marshall reached out to the Australian trio Dirty Three, with whom she had toured. She asked her record label, Matador, to cover her airfare to Melbourne, and they complied. Nearly three months went by, during which not a note was recorded. Then, days before guitarist Mick Turner had to leave the studio, they crashed Sing Sing Studio and recorded everything, uninterrupted, for four or five days. As a result, the band plays as if sleepwalking across a five-lane highway—everything sounds high-stakes and somehow perfectly in place. The drummer was Jim White, a highly skilled player capable of navigating hairpin turns, but here he only played in eruptive splashes. He mastered a sort of controlled aimlessness, a series of managed stumbles that lent an air of hunger to the music. Questlove, another technician with a metronomic heartbeat, perfected a similar blindfold-tightrope style to play D’Angelo’s Voodoo, dragging just a millisecond behind the beat. In both cases, the tension their restraint generates is palpable, nearly visible on the surface of the music, like a neck bulge. If the arrangements were a canvas, then Marshall’s guitar would be the unruliest blot, hogging the most white space. She plays rhythm guitar the way people talk at a cafe—excitably, with varying levels of purpose and speed, prone to slumping off into peculiarly timed silences. Listen to her instrument at the center of “Moonshiner”—she speeds up, slows down, flubs a note here and there, places some notes a little more loudly than others without seemingly meaning to; some of her chords are choked off by her fingers. Her guitar nudges every other instrument into the corner of the mix, moving the entire baggy-shaped composition forward, pulsing blood through its veins with the irregularity of a heart murmur. Everything—everything—in the music seems to be responding directly to her, and to her innermost thoughts. When flute wanders up and down modal scales behind her on “He Turns Down,” it sounds loosed directly from Marshall’s singing mouth. All of the shapes Marshall’s music would later take were vaguely discernible here: the careful way she arpeggiates that root chord on “No Sense,” over and over, and how closely the figure evokes the luxurious stretch of Al Green’s Hi Records band, how the hesitation on the downbeat heightens the tension to near-erotic levels. You can hear her future as a soul balladeer on The Greatest whispering at you. On the rudimentary finger-picked minor chord of “Back of Your Head,” you can hear the shadows of future Cat Power dirges like “Babydoll” lurking. And on “Metal Heart,” the album’s moral center, you can feel her clasping her fingers around a message, a mantra that would follow and sustain through the next decade. “You’re losing the calling that you’ve been faking and I’m not kidding/It’s damned if you don’t and damned if you do/Be true ‘cause they’ll lock you up in a sad, sad zoo,” she sings. The “you” in the song, addressed with such affection, feels like Marshall herself—an unverifiable, if inescapable, impression. She would go on to sing other songs to other “you’s,” also with unclear subjects: on You Are Free’s “I Don’t Blame You,” she offered another benediction to a reluctant and tortured performer. “They never owned you/And you never owed it to them anyway,” she sang. She was coy for years about the song’s source, telling one interviewer it was simply about “that feeling of not being understood, but supposedly being understood by everyone” Years later, she would tell a Guardian reporter it was definitely about Kurt Cobain “blowing his head off.” But whoever it was, her solidarity with them was unmistakable: That person onstage who “didn’t want to play,” was always Marshall, using someone’s story to tell us a version of her own. By the time of 2012’s Sun, she was comfortable and confident enough to start speaking directly to other people, to her idea of “kids” that were not her own obvious narrative surrogates—“You ain’t got nothing but time, and it ain’t got nothing on you,” she asserted, bravely. But here, in the haunted circle that was Moon Pix, she realizes something about herself, her art, and transmits it to us for the first time. “Metal heart/You’re not hiding/Metal heart, you’re not worth a thing,” she sang on the chorus. An “Amazing Grace” quote escapes her like a hiccup—she sounds startled to find herself singing it, mimicking the nature of revelation itself. Grace—itself accidental, capricious, not to be owned—seems to guide Marshall through Moon Pix like a waking dream. If we still yearn to embrace her tale about that single fevered night of songwriting, about keeping devils at bay with just her voice, well, we have Moon Pix to thank for prodding us into believing it.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

1000 gecs,100 gecs,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d2f2f7ce1d34500083e3d94/1:1/w_160/100gecs_1000gecs.jpg,2019-07-27 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/100-gecs-1000-gecs/,Dog Show,"If you're the type to take pleasure in connecting dots across the overwhelmingly scattered trends of 2010s digital music culture, then 100 gecs are right up your alley. Production and songwriting duo Dylan Brady and Laura Les—hailing from Los Angeles and Chicago, respectively—make abrasive, maximalist pop music that isn’t so much indefinable as it is endlessly identifiable, cross-sectioning myriad mainstream-leaning and definitively underground music released over the last decade. Nothing they’re doing is new, per se, but the way in which they do it feels fresh and appealingly unique. PC Music’s arch, conceptualist cyber-pop is an easy reference point, as are the crunchy, compressed headbangers that Sleigh Bells pumped out in their prime; at times, 100 gecs sound like Visible Cloaks producing for Charli XCX (fittingly, Brady’s already turned in an official remix for the latter’s Lizzo-assisted single “Blame It on Your Love”). The duo’s most defiantly ear-bleeding moments recall the bass-shaking abrasions of XXXTentacion’s “Look at Me!”—but they also bring a sense of cocked-eyebrow playfulness shared with storied Swedish indie label Sincerely Yours, especially the dearly missed Situationist pop act the Tough Alliance. If that sounds like a lot, wait until you get a load of 1000 gecs, one of the year's most fascinating, exhilarating experimental pop albums. There’s no better title for this thing than 1000 gecs, which references both the group’s charming self-titled 2017 debut and their sheer multiple-atop-multiple audaciousness. The album’s singles to date—the pulsing, cavity-inducing “Money Machine” and “800db Cloud”’s drop-dotted miserabilia—both conclude in washes of coruscating noise and death-metal thrashing; “I Need Help Immediately” is a sounds-of-the-studio collage in which the most recognizable melodic line sounds like an inverted McDonald’s jingle. The style and attitude of hip-hop is pervasive, but that barely encapsulates 100 gecs’ wild-eyed genre mishmash, which covers chiptuned pop-punk, chintzy trance synths, and the closely mic’d intimacy of indie pop—sometimes all in the same song. Brady and Les are musical fabulists, but 1000 gecs surprisingly rewards close listening when it comes to lyrical content, too. Though the opening line of “Money Machine”—“Hey, you lil’ piss baby”—scans as pure chest-puffing braggadocio, it also contains one of the most appealingly strange taunts in recent memory: “You talk a lotta big game/For someone with such a small truck.” “Stupid Horse” is the catchiest song about the dangers of racetrack betting since the Hold Steady’s “Chips Ahoy!,” doubling as a hilarious evocation of financial hedonism and a touching tale of animal liberation. “Ringtone,” 1000 gecs’ clearest-eyed selection, details intimacy in the age of group chats before its sweet sentiment curdles like milk left out on the counter: “Used to love that ringtone when you called me/Now it makes me sick.” 1000 gecs saw release in May on Brady’s Dog Show label, and the duo is currently affiliated with Diplo’s always-trending Mad Decent imprint as well. But they’re not for everyone, and that might be an understatement. Brady and Les’ ability to turn on various sonic and thematic dimes—to describe a loving exchange between two long-distance paramours one minute and brag about being addicted to Monster energy drinks the next—can be disorienting. Even at their most accessible, 100 gecs sound like a bunch of fireworks stuffed into a fax machine, or human beings singing in the key of dial-up. They traffic in pure and uncut absurdity, but even their most outrageous moments radiate a strange sincerity—the kind that could only come from two denizens of a perpetually logged-on generation.","The duo’s wild-eyed genre mishmash covers chiptuned pop-punk, chintzy trance synths, and the closely mic’d intimacy of indie pop—sometimes all in the same song.

Immaculada High,Cherubs,by: Chris O'Connell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ceee01193a53664d31ee5dc/1:1/w_160/Cherubs_ImmaculadaHigh.jpg,2019-07-27 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cherubs-immaculada-high/,Relapse,"The fabled Austin noise rock band Cherubs have always had a close relationship, imagined or otherwise, to hard drugs. Their 1994 release Heroin Man earned them a permanent cult following with the same people that worshipped The Jesus Lizard, Butthole Surfers, and Cows. Their new label, Relapse, cheerfully characterizes them as drug music for drug people. The video for “18 the Number,” a track off their new album Immaculada High, is a choppy, mutated trip down memory lane, and won’t help dispel that well-worn association. But flying high or not, Cherubs has never sounded more lucid or purposeful. Perhaps this has something to do with their 20-year hiatus, or the reasons behind it. Heroin Man is famously a record for and about Dave DeLuna, a close friend of the band who died of a heroin overdose. Its cover depicts a man facedown in a bathtub. The band broke up following a pre-show brawl in San Diego the night before its release. Despite its place in the noise-rock canon, moving on from Heroin Man was probably necessary for survival, for the art and for the artists. Immaculada High, the band’s fourth studio album and fifth overall, is a larger leap from the band’s early years than their last reunion effort, 2 YNFYNYTY. Kevin Whitley’s syrup-thick guitar is as punishingly beautiful as ever, and his lyrics, sacrilege as it may be for the genre, verge on audible, thanks to production from Erik Wofford (My Morning Jacket, Explosions in the Sky). And even if Whitley’s words aren’t about the epidemic of drug overdoses that swept their once-sleepy Austin hometown in the mid-’90s, they’re still inherently fatalistic. Across 11 tracks, Cherubs paints an ugly world—pigs in filth, hissing insects and serpents—to convey the anxiety of inevitable death: not just their own, but of all of humanity. “This recording feels like the soundtrack to a movie about Mother Nature exacting dark revenge on the nasty homo sapiens,” reads the band’s only comment thus far on the album. “I like being doomed with you/Life is better slipping through your fingers,” a resigned Whitley wails on “Full Regalia.” On the opener, “Turista,” Whitley looks at himself as if detached from his own body: “Give it a home/But barely a home.” “We’re just passing through!” he yells. As with the double meaning in the song title—either a tourist or the type of diarrhea that afflicts some of them—this can be read two ways: a realization of his own mortality, or, as read in the context of the rest of the album, a eulogy for a dying planet. The record’s lead single, the crawling, crumbling “Sooey Pig,” is a tug-of-war between the prettier side that Cherubs hinted at on 2 YNFYNYTY and the wall-of-noise past they can’t escape. Sub-two-minute shredders like “18 the Number” and “Pacemaker,” both underscored by Prager pummeling his tom-toms, reveal that Cherubs is just as content to make noise as ever, and that growing older doesn’t mean getting softer. Immaculada High is simultaneously the band’s most accessible and its most bombastic release. In Immaculada High’s closer, “Nobodies,” Whitley croons for nearly two minutes: “Up, up they float,” he sings. He could be singing about the tense legacy of Heroin Man, or merely our inevitable shuffle off this mortal coil. Whatever the reason, he has never sounded more free. Those are the spoils of moving on.","The fabled noise-rock outfit paint an ugly world on their second post-reunion release, but they have never sounded freer or more purposeful.

Angels on the Slope,Lisel,by: Sophie Kemp ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d30dd311852280008e5408f/1:1/w_160/Lisel_AngelsOnTheSlope.jpg,2019-07-27 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lisel-angels-on-the-slope/,Luminelle,"In her work with the band Pavo Pavo, and as a frequent collaborator of artists like Julianna Barwick and Tim Hecker, Eliza Bagg writes complicated arrangements and string parts masked by doe-like melodies. She exerts god-tier control over her soprano, approaching her work with the dogged precision of serious classical training. The Los Angeles-based polymath brings all this fussy expertise to her debut solo record, Angels on the Slope, under the moniker Lisel. A collection of pop songs with subtle experimental undertones, it’s Bagg’s most outré release to date, albeit one overcrowded by gaudy production effects. On first listen, Angels on the Slope suggests a pop album seeped in the work of Björk and early Grimes. It’s hard not to notice the chintziness of the keyboards that serve as a backbone on “Hunker Down,” or the sweaty, mildly hypnotic drum machine loop. You could dance to it, or at least bop your head as it plays in the background of a fashionable loft party. Listen a few times more, and you’ll notice the frenetic bursts of saxophone and superfluous Auto-Tune accents. It’s certainly an interesting concept, to imbue straight-laced baroque pop with elements of dance music, but it makes for a convoluted way to bridge the world of freaky orchestral pop and the decidedly less freaky world of prefab synth music. “Digital Light Field” centers on Bagg’s spectacular voice, spun through yet another layer of Auto-Tune and immersed in naïve pop textures, plus a couple of densely arpeggiated synths. The song is apparently about the light emitted by cell phones, but the lyrics are muddled by enough distortion that you can’t really tell. Angels on the Slope is not a lyrics record, and it doesn’t have to be. The intrigue lies in the mechanics of the arrangements, and in Bagg’s ability to keep you on your toes, never allowing the apparent sheen of seriousness to become too comfortable. That’s not to say there aren’t bland moments: “Hollowmaker” drags, and the overproduced “Mirage” leans a little too hard into self-consciously weird ’80s pastiche, leaving Bagg sounding lost. Angels on the Slope can’t boast the kinds of surprises that make you jump out of your seat. It’s more about the joys of subtle dissonance, and the need to be unburdened by genre. On “Bloodletting,” the album’s centerpiece, Bagg allows herself to go entirely operatic. Her vocals are pristine, free of over-stylized production tricks. A piano opens like a Venus fly trap, while a saxophone’s upper registers flutter into its mouth; in the song’s soft corners, a synthesizer rotates with the precision of hands on an antique watch. On an otherwise flashy and cluttered record, “Bloodletting” is a moment of lucidity. Bagg has all of the skill and creativity to make beautiful music. It’s time for her to let go of the noise.","The debut solo album from Pavo Pavo’s Eliza Bagg, a collection of pop songs with subtle experimental undertones, is her most outré release to date.

Para Mí,Cuco,by: Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d386815eefc47000891a82d/1:1/w_160/cuco_parami.jpg,2019-07-26 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cuco-para-mi/,Interscope,"“I’m only interested in a label if they come through with whatever terms I send them,” Cuco told Rolling Stone last year. Interscope must have come through. According to Billboard, the 21-year-old bedroom-pop songwriter signed a seven-figure deal with the label, which promised him freedom and flexibility. That’s as much a testament to Omar Banos’ devoted fanbase as it is an admission by the suits that they no longer care to dictate the conversation. Why risk a flop when they can just follow the streams? Para Mí, Cuco’s major-label debut, arrives with no other hands on the joystick. It’s just Banos, who’s still writing songs about love and other drugs and whose eclecticism is still confined to the more pleasant parts of the color wheel. The album pulses with the influence of Kevin Parker, as well as multi-instrumentalist tinkerers like Toro y Moi, Sen Morimoto, and Mac DeMarco. Its backward-seeming track sequence improves significantly as it goes along; its instrumental interludes are better than most of the songs. Para Mí may have been the result of a near-fatal car crash, but the album is a happy meanderer. Cuco knows it. His introduction concludes with the question, “Where is this fool going?” Nowhere, really. Cuco’s unadorned songwriting isn’t for everyone. If you’re not in a place to appreciate a line like, “Don’t play with me/You broke my heart/But I’m also so obsessed with you,” the early portions of the album will be frustrating. (That’s from the third track, “Bossa No Sé.”) Stretch similarly simple lyrics over five minutes of gentle psychedelia and you have “Love Tripper,” the insipid song that’s smack in the middle. Still, Banos’ appeal is undeniable. Every so often he hits upon a great dumb couplet, as irresistable as Best Coast’s early love for the ultimate Californian rhyme, “crazy/lazy.” (Cuco’s biggest hit, 2018’s “Lo Que Siento,” shared the same simple, sincere energy.) One of the highlights here is “Best Friend,” a ballad of devotion with a wry turn: “I know I’ve been quite dumb/But baby we’re quite young.” Awww. It’s this shaggy charm that’s won over Cuco’s fans. A manager, Doris Muñoz, described the audience at an early backyard show: “Latinx teens singing every single lyric in English and Spanish to his music, which is inspired by our culture; it gave me chills.” Banos, whose parents are Mexican immigrants, has talked about how important it is to him to represent the Chicano community. But though his politics contextualize his music, Para Mí is not overtly political. When Cuco does get serious, it’s usually because he’s had a bad love affair. Once over the hump of “Love Tripper,” the album reaches a higher plane, starting with “Ego Death in Thailand,” where an insistent hook shoots skyward from the same gorgeous synths that make the interludes “Perihelion” and “Room Tone” so compelling. These tracks put muscle behind Cuco’s goofy obsession with psychedelics: They’re about expansion and exploration. Imagine Roger Troutman producing an all-instrumental album for Tame Impala featuring Mac DeMarco. There are other standouts. “Hydrocodone” achieves a composure and balance that too much of the album’s first half lacks. The charming lyrics of “Best Friend” are all the more powerful because of the bossa nova rhythm and guitar they ride with. “Brokey the Pear” is like a lost Beach Boys interlude, with shades of “Let’s Go Away for Awhile.” But “where is this fool going?” is a question Para Mí leaves unanswered. The repetitive, literal writing and head-scratching sequencing makes it seem like a bad thing that Cuco’s main sentiments are “I love you,” “I hate you,” and “I’m sad.” (Good pop songs are made of those sentiments too, of course, but they’re usually strengthened by more layered writing, more tightly constructed songs, or both.) Across an album, the weaknesses are magnified. There are not enough songs like “Lo Que Siento” here, heartfelt ballads that could close out a concert. Maybe in the old days, someone would have insisted that Para Mí shed some of its dead weight and be released as an EP. But, reportedly, it’s in Cuco’s contract; no one’s going to do that. It just means he’ll have to find his own way.","The 21-year-old bedroom-pop artist’s major-label debut displays shaggy charm and an eclecticism that’s still confined to the more pleasant parts of the color wheel.

Fraudulent Activity,Teejayx6,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d39b63deefc47000891a9b0/1:1/w_160/Teejayx6_FraudulentActivity.jpg,2019-07-26 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/teejayx6-fraudulent-activity/,self-released,"Teejayx6 is a passionate rapper. It just so happens that his passion is not so much rapping, but scamming, and making money so that he can scam more, and maybe, if he has some money leftover, fund a rap career. The Detroit teenager will do anything to ensure his passions flourish, like illegal purchases of iPhones in his nephew’s name and convincing his younger cousin to sell weed from her lemonade stand. In Detroit, scammer rap is nothing new (see: Bossman Rich and BandGang Lonnie Bands), but Teejayx6’s approach is more direct. Sometimes he’s nervous that he’s gone too far and will be caught, a tension that’s amplified by his anxious, offbeat delivery and fast-paced instrumentals. Teejay always gets away, though, and when he does, he takes the time to reflect on the finer things in life: the strength of his IP address, the VPN that leaves him untraceable, and the social security numbers he’s purchased, like one that belongs to retired NBA player Tony Parker. Last month, Teejayx6 achieved modest virality through his jaw-dropping collaboration with fellow Detroit rapper Kasher Quon. Since that success, Teejayx6 has been releasing music nearly every day, some better than others, like his surreal scamming tutorial “Swipe Lesson” and the birth of his “Swipe Story” series that’s quickly evolving into a street Ten Commandments. But not much has changed for Teejay: He’s still on Instagram trying to convince his followers to DM their bank accounts and uploads music to YouTube on a whim, like his latest mixtape, Fraudulent Activity. On Wednesday, Teejayx6 didn’t even wait for the files to finish uploading before posting a screenshot—not even a link—of his mixtape with the caption, “Out now on my YouTube uploading the rest of the songs right now.” Fraudulent Activity itself is simple, seven tracks of Teejay’s crime-riddled tales and punchlines, all hovering around the two-minute mark. Throughout Fraudulent Activity, Teejayx6 constantly crosses the line, like on the face-palming “Allah,” but when he reels himself in a smidge, his Walmart and Wells Fargo anecdotes are captivating. “Scammed a white lady and she look like Helen Keller,” and “Stole my grandma money I can’t wait to see that preacher,” he says in a deadpan on “Cheat Codes.” And while it’s hard to say, “Yes, I love to hear Teejay rap about finessing old ladies,” I do love to hear Teejay rap about finessing old ladies. The mixtape’s best track, by far, is “SilkRoad,” an ode to the illicit, now-shuttered, deep web marketplace. Teejay rambles on in a somber tone like he’s lost a loved one: “The feds shut the site down, but I miss Silk Road/They sold illegal shit and that’s the reason I got my first gun.” He uses this opportunity to reflect, like a flashback episode of a sitcom, on the scams that hold a special place in his heart: the time he copied someone’s ID, but was delighted to find out he looks just like them and when he catfished and convinced a boy on Tinder to send him $6,000. Maybe, months from now, we look back at Teejayx6 and Fraudulent Activity and scratch our heads. But, for now, just keep him from within arms reach of your grandmother’s social security check and enjoy the daily ride.","The latest mixtape from the young Detroit rapper takes scamming to the next level.

Under the Shade,Caleb Giles,by: Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3866fac0574f00088cc6ee/1:1/w_160/CalebGiles_UnderTheShade.jpg,2019-07-26 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/caleb-giles-under-the-shade/,self-released,"For a while, it seemed like every rapper coming out of the five boroughs was a retro revivalist, tethered to the greats of the past, like a rookie NBA player pulling on the jersey of a legacy team. But young guys like MIKE, Medhane, Adé Hakim (formerly known as Sixpress), and Slauson Malone reside in a New York City where Earl Sweatshirt is a more powerful god than Chuck D. These rappers have run an insurgency campaign on the local scene, contorting elements of classic East Coast hip-hop into their own warped vision for the future. Enter Caleb Giles. On his third album Under the Shade, the 21-year-old Bronx native engages with some core tenets of the classic New York sound—dusty samples, deep-thinking lyricism, soulful attitude—but with a bitter streak as cold as a winter ride on the top deck of the NYC Ferry. Countering the icy atmospherics, Giles’ flow is clean and youthful, his writing is resonant, and he has a way with a pleasing chorus. It adds up to a set that unites past and present more clearly than any of his contemporaries, adding a distinct ripple to this new surge of regional inventiveness. Giles’s burgeoning rap career comes with an interesting peg: he also plays saxophone in Standing on the Corner, the jazz ensemble with credits on both Earl and Solange records. Yet Under the Shade never indulges in the freewheeling jazz meditations you might expect. Sure, there’s a decaying old trumpet here, a stoned bassline there. But they help form a neatly clipped set of percolating beats that compliment Giles’s plainspoken flows. Under the dim light, Giles comes off as a burdened young man. He laments missed opportunities and describes poverty with grim clarity. Rap usually locates poverty comfortably in the past, but Giles wants you to know all about his present-day struggles. On the 50-second “Gather,” he lays out a pretty basic wishlist: He wants a car that runs, to hold down a job, and to simply have $100 in his pocket. It’s fair to say that Under the Shade is a solid release, not a defining statement. At 24 minutes, it’s over too quickly, with shorter cuts like “Gather” and “Syl’s Song” begging to be developed into full-bodied songs. And as a rapper, Giles lacks a force of personality to match his nuanced lyrics. But Under the Shade excites anyway, another welcome shot in the arm for contemporary New York rap.","The 21-year-old Bronx native belongs to an exciting new generation remaking NYC rap in their own image. On his third album, he grapples with present-day poverty and everyday life.

Resavoir,Resavoir,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d239c2e30462100099971bf/1:1/w_160/resavoir_resavoir.jpg,2019-07-26 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/resavoir-resavoir/,International Anthem,"When Kendrick Lamar and Chance the Rapper tapped into their cities’ homegrown jazz scenes, it proved mutually beneficial for the rappers and their collaborators alike. Their breakout works were strengthened by a century-old musical heritage, and newer jazz artists like Kamasi Washington and Donnie Trumpet & the Social Experiment got the chance to shine on their own. Over the past few years, Chicago trumpeter Will Miller has shared the stage with everyone from Whitney to Lil Wayne, A$AP Rocky to the late Mac Miller. Taking lessons from indie rock and hip-hop and infusing the resulting hybrids with his own sensibilities, Miller now steps out as a bandleader with Resavoir. His group draws on the tradition established by other fine Chicago jazz-inflected exports over the years (Rotary Connection, Tortoise, Earth, Wind & Fire) while also pushing beyond categorical boundaries to create a debut that is soulful and ear-catching. Like his fellow International Anthem labelmate Makaya McCraven, Miller deftly draws upon spontaneous improvisation and methodical studio wizardry alike, melding the two practices together (as well as 18 different players) to create an amalgam stronger and sweeter than the sum of its parts. On “Resavoir,” he toggles between crisp beats and sunny 1960s pop, expertly arranged jazz-funk and experimental electronic textures, but its five minutes feel breezy and conversational rather than overstuffed with details. Subtle but deft jump cuts detour from soaring to meditative and back, with plenty of room for instantly hummable horn charts as well as field recordings of gulls and airy vocal harmonies that drift like afternoon clouds. It’s a complex piece of songcraft that also feels dreamy and sunlit. On standout “Taking Flight,” harpist Brandee Younger evokes both the ethereal glissandos of Alice Coltrane and the head-nodding soul-jazz of Dorothy Ashby. In surrounding Younger with expertly arranged horns and a crackling backbeat, Miller pays tribute to predecessors like Charles Stepney and Richard Evans, the Chicago producer/arrangers who thrillingly blurred the lines between pop, soul, R&B, and jazz in their heyday. As effectively as Miller keeps to the background, his electronically treated horn moves to the fore on “Plantasy,” featuring smeared-yet-sharp tones that bring to mind Jon Hassell. Miller doesn’t revel in texture for its own sake; the many layers and whinnying high register move in conjunction with piano and the gentle patter of electronic drums to create something dramatic and poignant. He switches between clean lead lines and small squelches on “Woah,” processing handclaps and percussion in a way that brings to mind TNT-era Tortoise, fusing electronics and instrumentation together in organic fashion. Most of Resavoir is instrumental, but the tracks run at a concise pop length and the melodies are so catchy that when vocalists enter on the album’s last two tracks, it feels as if they’ve been there all along. Both songs neatly encapsulate the album’s dualities. On “Escalator,” a song about the perils of touring life, saxophonist/rapper Sen Morimoto swings between the quotidian (there are “no fucking cashews” at the gas station) to the cosmic (waking “on another planet with a different language”). And on “LML,” murmured affirmations from Mavis Staples and Noname collaborator Akenya Seymour suggest optimism, but the song’s backstory is darker: It was written in the wake of the Parkland shooting. Like the album itself, the song celebrates interconnectedness, embracing both hard life on the ground and the easy revery of the clouds above.","The Chicago trumpeter with hip-hop and indie-rock bona fides steps out as a bandleader, shepherding 18 musicians across a complex, soulful album that celebrates interconnectedness.

Willow,Willow,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d377fefeefc47000891a715/1:1/w_160/Willow_Willow.jpg,2019-07-25 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/willow-willow/,MSFTS MUSICRoc NationRepublic,"Things happened quickly for Willow, as they tend to do for children of celebrities. At 9, she scored a platinum hit and signed to Roc Nation just as the song went viral. At 10, she was cast as the lead in a movie remake of the musical Annie. Just as the Smith family career plan had seemingly taken hold, she rebuked it: She quit Annie, withdrew from the pop sphere, and started releasing music with titles like Interdimensional Tesseract. She has called having famous parents “excruciatingly terrible” and has been in overdrive forging her own path. On “Boy,” the opener to her 2017 album, The 1st, released on her 17th birthday, she was as honest about how the outside world sees her as she’s ever been, looking through the eyes of a new lover: “I come from a cluster of super bright stars/And probably to him it feels scary to reach that far,” she sang. She’s been trying to be more down to earth her whole life. Willow, a child star turned self-professed Star Child, has had a different kind of coming-of-age Hollywood story since. She has been in a perpetually transitional state searching for her own identity, a ghost haunting the Smith family celebrity legacy. That journey has largely manifested as bohemian, third-eye musings in search of absolute truth. But, more often than not, Willow’s vision quests haven’t produced impressionable music. She sounds like if SZA suddenly retreated from the limelight, got really into Alanis Morissette and junk science, and was noncommittal about songcraft. It may be a lack of practice or it may be a lack of interest, but her brand of psychedelic soul and blurry dream-pop can be so immaterial it’s as if it’s trapped in the astral plane. Her self-titled album can be pretty in a tuned-out sort of way, if you let it wash over you like a gentle current of #vibes, but she is no closer to showing us who she really is. Willow co-produced the album with musician Tyler Cole, half of the duo Sol Prophet, who (both solo and in tandem) makes music aimlessly searching for something, anything, to say. He is a member of the MSFTSrep “art collective” Willow founded with her brother, the now full-time inventor Jaden. Two of their previous collaborations, “Afraid” and “Sorrow,” feel like entry points into this nebulous headspace—light on music, powered mostly by hums and incantations. Both Willow and Cole would consider genre an insult. They want their music to transcend the limits of classification to a higher level of consciousness. Willow was already getting into guitars on The 1st, but Cole’s influence is clear. He has driven her toward a more atmospheric sound. The music here is competent enough to pass for enlightened but it’s actually illusory. There is nothing tangible to latch onto. Listening closely feels like trying to identify solid objects when wandering through a fog, particularly on “Like a Bird” and “U KNOW,” which both seem to blur until they’re out of focus. The 1st was rangier and explored who Willow was as a young woman, thinker, and artist, delving into the personal in a way she hadn’t before in her music. The songs on Willow just bleed together at the edges into a composite of wokeness. Cole tweeted that Willow was the official album of the Area 51 raid. Across its 22 minutes, Willow’s “falling into the arms of naked truth” and singing about Annunaki and sacred geometry. She still writes about love, but primarily in the philosophical sense. In the search for deeper meaning, her songs lose all sight of what’s right there on the surface. There’s a song called “Overthinking IT” where she warbles, “I know that sometimes/I’m crippled by my mind/I don’t wanna be.” It’s the realest, closest, most truthful thing she says. On “Time Machine,” she longs to live her life out among a previous generation, so she can rub shoulders with the visionaries of the past with whom she feels kinship—predictably, Jean-Michel Basquiat in 1983 and Kurt Cobain in 1993, two of the most mainstream icons to represent artistic license among teenage misfits. She’s nostalgic for MTV. Her message—things were better any time before now—feels poorly justified and unearned. “I don’t care what anyone says/Everyone is disconnected these days/’Cause everyone is looking at their phone/Tryna feel like they are less alone/And I’m here to tell them that they’re wrong,” she sings, drawing a ham-fisted beeline from technology to despondency. The new age tropes are exhausting, and the means of expression are narrow, but Willow is clearly striving to be something more. She is obviously both talented and ambitious but she still hasn’t translated those qualities into the caliber of music JAY-Z projected onto her all those years ago. Maybe that’s the point. Maybe, with its far-out-ness, Willow is subverting those expectations even now. But in an effort to avoid being the Willow Smith everyone seemed to think she’d become, the pop culture polyglot, Willow seems to have lost sight of what makes her interesting.","The latest album from the child star turned Star Child can be pretty in a tuned-out sort of way, but her psychedelic soul music is no closer to showing us who she really is.

In My Defense,Iggy Azalea,by: Dani Blum ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d30e22e1852280008e54091/1:1/w_160/IggyAzalea_InMyDefense.jpg,2019-07-25 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/iggy-azalea-in-my-defense/,Bad DreamsEMPIRE,"Iggy Azalea wants you to know she’s not sorry. She mentions this on every track of her new album, braiding it into brags about her money and her body until they snarl together in a petty wreath. It’s an odd package for a record with high stakes: This is her first album in five years, after her planned 2016 release Digital Distortion was shelved, and the first she’s released on her independent label. In those years, she has cemented a reputation built on appropriation and controversy. Name a major artist—Halsey, Snoop Dogg, the cartoon character Peppa Pig—and Iggy has entangled herself in some sort of feud with them. On an album with the unsubtle title In My Defense, she attempts to cast herself as a victim while further distorting and dismissing the cultures she takes from. Less than three minutes into the album, she raps, “Because I talk like this and my ass fat/They be saying Iggy tryna act black.” A few tracks later, she drops the record’s thesis: “I started to say sorry, but fuck that shit.” Didn’t we cancel Iggy Azalea? Maybe because of the nature of the internet, or because of the privilege that Iggy both willfully ignores and has worn as a shield throughout her career, she’s somewhat positioned for a comeback; media outlets have been hinting at her potential victorious return for years. This album could have been an opportunity to show an ounce of contrition, to own up to her mistakes and demonstrate that she has learned. Iggy is talented: a four-time Grammy nominee with the vocal toolkit and dancefloor command that allowed her to jump on and invigorate hits. (On “Fancy,” she handily eclipsed Charli XCX, a feat that few of Charli’s collaborators have managed.) But talent isn’t an excuse, and on this album, it’s almost irrelevant. “I just knew I wanted to go to America and be a rapper and have a ponytail and a leopard-skin jacket that went down to my feet, and like, 20 white, fluffy dogs on one leash,” she told Dazed and Confused in 2012. The album is stacked with cartoonish approximations of what she thinks a rap song should sound like: shivers of bass, the occasional “skrrrt,” Mad Libs of designer brands and bodily fluids. Many sound like direct imitations of the rappers she admires. “Sally Walker,” the best song on the album, features sparkling piano chords similar to Cardi B’s “Money” (J. White produced both songs). The exhausting, Juicy J-featuring “Freak of the Week” sounds like a rejected track by Megan Thee Stallion, whose debut album features her own song with the Memphis rapper. She hisses “lil’ bitch” in a way that sounds like Rico Nasty. It’s possible Iggy sees herself as a pioneer who paved the way for female rappers. Her album starts with “Thanks I Get,” a paltry diatribe about the “little mes” she claims to see. Women have been rapping as well as men for as long as rap has existed, but it’s only now, years after Iggy came on the scene, that they seem to be inching towards getting equal attention. Iggy Azalea is not the only current rapper who fills songs with dreary, monotonous references to sex and money, but many find creative, amusing, and even raw ways to write and spit about both. Instead, Iggy crams her songs with one-liners that sound like branded Instagram captions: “I waste my wine before I ever waste my time”; “Catch flights not feelings.” Even worse are the banal repetitions: “I just wanna nut,” she whispers over a bastardized “Push It” sample, subjecting us to the word “nut” 15 times in under three minutes. Mixed metaphors wilt over predictable beats. I found myself bobbing along automatically to the slumped synths and handclaps, then wanting to hit “next” after 30 seconds of each song. For an album so concerned about “haters,” the worst we see comes from Iggy herself. “They call me racist/Only thing I like is green and blue faces,” she sneers, managing to corrode and embarrass herself in one line. Rather than penitence, she offers only a garish caricature. Her only defense is to further offend.","The Australian rapper returns with her first album in five years, sounding not just unrepentant but also tediously uninterested in any kind of growth whatsoever.

Remind Me: The Classic Elektra Recordings 1978-1984,Patrice Rushen,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d24dffc332ba40008a6eebc/1:1/w_160/patricerushen_remindme.jpg,2019-07-25 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/patrice-rushen-remind-me-the-classic-elektra-recordings-1978-1984/,Strut,"When (and if) Patrice Rushen’s two moderate ’80s hits spring to mind, more than likely your memory super-imposes a different voice atop hers. Her triumphant “Haven’t You Heard” broke into the R&B Top 10 in 1980, but couldn’t crack the Top 40. But when Kirk Franklin lifted it wholesale for “Looking for You” in 2005, it charted across the gospel, R&B, and the Hot 100. Similarly, “Forget Me Nots” made the Top 40 and was nominated for a Grammy in 1982, but that beguiling handclap and bounding bassline also laid the foundation for Will Smith’s “Men in Black” 15 years later (George Michael also sampled it). Rushen’s DNA runs through everything: Diddy, J Dilla, Jermaine Dupri, Prince Paul, Q-Tip, and Knxwledge have sampled her, to name just a few among hundreds. “We’re living in Patrice Rushen’s world,” the New York Times recently declared. “We just might not know it yet.” Rushen started playing music at the age of 3. By the time she was a teenager, she was signed to the iconic jazz label Prestige, recruiting heavyweights like Joe Henderson and Leon “Ndugu” Chancler for her debut album, Prelusion. The pianist grew up within jazz. But it was 1974, and the charts were instead filled with funk, R&B, fusion, and the pulse of disco. What was she supposed to do? Her music naturally started to absorb it all. When Rushen jumped to the Elektra label in 1978 and started cutting sophisticated urban pop that drew on all of the above, she wasn’t alone—jazz stars like Herbie Hancock, Donald Byrd, Roy Ayers, and George Benson had already crossed over. Remind Me: The Classic Elektra Recordings 1978-1984 shows us how her production and arranging provided building blocks for decades of future R&B and hip-hop hits. Rushen faced harsher critical backlash for her crossover than her male colleagues, and was deemed a sellout by the jazz community. Worse still, her label did almost nothing to support her efforts. She grazed the lower rungs of chart success, but never reached the heights she deserved. Her dancefloor songs still sound featherweight and spry. “Forget Me Nots” and “Haven’t You Heard” remain indefatigable, grooves that belong on the Great Wedding Playlist in the Sky alongside Chic, Earth, Wind & Fire, and Sister Sledge. Lesser-known numbers like “Look Up!” and “Number One” are sharp enough to inspire new imitators and samplers. Her crack session band is buoyant, and her arrangements made alongside Charles Mims, Jr., are sturdy and supple enough to be twisted in all kinds of new shapes. (My lone gripe is that I wish the ebullient “Call On Me” had made the cut.) Depending on how Melvin “Wah Wah Watson” Ragin’s stinging guitar is sampled, the slinky slow jam “Givin’ It Up Is Givin’ Up” imparts either sensuousness or eeriness, but Rushen’s voice twines with soul singer D.J. Rogers and sends chills regardless. And Rushen’s gurgling electric piano on “Remind Me” shows that despite forgoing her jazz audience for pop, she could still pull head-bobbing clusters from her keys in a manner that brings Herbie Hancock to mind. Her airy vocals might not always stick, but the groove does. But the ballads keep drawing down the energy. “Settle for My Love” is breathy and wispy, liable to drift past without much notice. “When I Found You” relies on Rushen’s nuanced-but-insubstantial voice. She’s early in her pop career, still figuring out how to write the best lines for the right vocal register: “Let’s Sing a Song of Love” dances just beyond the reach of her backing singers. By the time of her last Elektra album, 1984’s Now, Rushen had mastered the language of pop, with songs like “Feels So Real” and “To Each His Own” supplying late highlights. And while her own pop career would wind down soon after, her career as a musical director took off. She began working for the Grammys, NAACP Image Awards, and Emmys. Her status as materfamilias of pop was cemented when Rushen served as musical director for Janet Jackson’s early ’90s world tour. Breaking through the constraints of genre at a time when it was an arduous task for a woman, Rushen’s willingness to draw from across the Black American radio dial with sophistication still resonates today. Offering up pathways for Solange, Teyana Taylor, Erykah Badu, Esperanza Spalding and more to explore, Remind Me still sounds like a guidepost for the future.

Caligula,Lingua Ignota,by: Jenn Pelly,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d14e86e8e04220009a142fc/1:1/w_160/LinguaIgnota_Caligula.jpg,2019-07-25 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lingua-ignota-caligula/,Profound Lore,"Eight minutes into her torrential second album as Lingua Ignota, Kristin Hayter lets out a thundering, apocalyptic scream: “I don’t eat, I don’t sleep [...] I let it consume me,” she cries. Her voice is so ugly and shredded and maniacal and alive that it creates a witness of anyone who hears it. It is the sound of trauma, that which is by definition intolerable, and Hayter traverses its most upsetting depths on behalf of survivors, including herself. With Caligula, she has created a murderous amalgam of opera, metal, and noise that uses her classical training like a Trojan Horse, burning misogyny to ash from its Judeo-Christian roots. From renaissance paintings to murder ballads and beyond, feminist revenge has charged art to cathartic ends—envisioning a world in which women do not only demand justice but see it through, in their work, by any means necessary. Caligula embodies that insurrectionary fury. Working with members of The Body, Uniform, Full of Hell, and others, Hayter crafts a 66-minute world ablaze with contempt for man, which, though divided into 11 all-caps tracks—with such imposing titles as “I AM THE BEAST,” “IF THE POISON WON’T TAKE YOU MY DOGS WILL,” and “SPITE ALONE HOLDS ME ALOFT”—plays out like one continuous, epic composition. More than songs, they feel like a succession of enraged suites, each one a threat, an intervention, an act of solidarity. Lingua Ignota sparks fantasies of demonic avant-opera icon Diamanda Galás joining with industrial-metal titans Godflesh to create a horror soundtrack, or Maria Callas in hell. Her goal seems to be to deconstruct and destabilize, to discomfit. She situates death growls and strangulated vocalizations amidst orchestral strings, choral singing, and chimes—like a hex on the whole social order. “Everything burns down around me,” she sings with incantatory grandeur on “MAY FAILURE BE YOUR NOOSE,” atop the incendiary counterpoint of Uniform’s Michael Berdan. Near the beginning of Caligula, Hayter beckons Satan to come to her side, to “fortify me”—things get darker from there. Her invocation recalls Galás’ own definition of the devil in 1991. “When a witch is about to be burned on a ladder in flames, who can she call upon?” Galás asked in the book Angry Women. “I call that person ‘Satan.’” Hayter summons this original insurgent on behalf of a society that rarely believes embattled women. “How do I break you before you break me?” she seethes on “DO YOU DOUBT ME TRAITOR.” The savage “SPITE ALONE HOLDS ME ALOFT” culminates in her disarming, boiled-over prayer to “Kill them all/Kill them all/Kill them all.” For her enemies, she wishes, “May your foes be many/May your days be few.” Unsparing would be a way to put it. Caligula wants abusers dead. Occasionally, Hayter breaks into fragments of traditional melody and balladeering, but it is never long before she incinerates them. And though she draws on the embittered atmospheres and theater of metal, Caligula’s unwieldy, behemoth-like sprawl practically laughs at the concept of riffs. Hayter said it was her goal to “recontextualize that phallocentric format for people who need it,” and she crafts a sound that, if not feminine, feels decidedly unmale, and crucially vulnerable. The solemn highlight “FRAGRANT IS MY MANY FLOWER’D CROWN,” for one, finds Hayter singing of how “the bitter blood of many foes sustains me” with a low, chilling resolve. She pushes her voice into unsettling gurgles before declaring, with shocking clarity, “I have learned that all men are brothers/And brothers only love each other,” like an ornate rewriting of the Jenny Holzer maxim “Men Don’t Protect You Anymore.” On Caligula’s closing track, in a final turn, Hayter quotes the poet Frank O’Hara: “All I want is boundless love.” The line is from his 1957 collection Meditations in an Emergency, but Haytner undercuts it with her own devastating experience: “All I know is violence.” This brutal ending reminds us that if Caligula is too taxing to bear, that’s because it is a work of realism. When Hayter calls herself “the butcher of the world [...] throatslitter of the world” on a cold-blooded hymn titled “FUCKING DEATHDEALER,” I think of the artist Artmisia Gentileschi, a protégé of Caravaggio, who was tortured in court in 1612 after she opened a case against her rapist. Gentileschi spent the rest of her career painting depictions of violence against men. Women have been seeking this revenge forever. Buy: Rough Trade

The Lost Tapes 2,Nas,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d2e3227132b5e0008d18f7e/1:1/w_160/Nas_TheLostTapes2.jpg,2019-07-24 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nas-the-lost-tapes-2/,Mass AppealDef Jam,"In February 1999, just before the mp3 era reached its peak, 13 tracks from Nas’ forthcoming double LP I Am....The Autobiography leaked onto the internet. With the core of the album in the wild almost two months before the scheduled release date, Nas and his team at Columbia panicked, scrapping the original tracklist and pushing back the album release date. I Am....The Autobiography was intended as a concept double-album, with one disc recounting his life from birth to death by suicide and the second dedicated to his afterlife. The leak blew up that grand scheme, and the album was officially released as the haphazardly assembled single-disc I Am, without most of the leaked songs. Some would be released as part of the career nadir that was late ’99’s Nastradamus, but the rest circulated for years in varying fidelity, creating an aura of mystique around these “lost” tracks. When they finally saw an official release in 2002 as The Lost Tapes, it solidified the resurgence sparked by 2001’s Stillmatic and the legendary beef with JAY-Z. But The Lost Tapes 2 is a sequel in name only. Originally meant for a 2003 release, the project was delayed by his signing with Def Jam and their subsequent disagreements, and it’s unlikely this compilation is the same as the one he intended to release back then. Miles away from the leaked gems on The Lost Tapes—considered some of Nas’ best work—this sequel comprises detritus from the last decade or so of Nas’ storied career. Even if the lows of Nas’ post-millennium output have been plagued by corny hooks and questionable beat selection, his failures were often in the service of experimentation—or in the case of Nastradamus, a rushed production process—and he’s never lacked access to the game’s premier production talents. The credits for The Lost Tapes 2 reads like a hip-hop all-star team: Swizz Beatz, Pharrell Williams, Kanye West, No I.D., RZA, Hit-Boy, Eric Hudson, DJ Dahi, Pete Rock, and the Alchemist are all featured. And there are indeed some highlights: The Swizz Beatz-produced “No Bad Energy,” a moody slow-burner washed in atmospheric background vocals that suits his wistful nostalgia, the crunchy lo-fi wizardry of RZA’s “Highly Favored,” or the vintage Queens boom-bap of Pete Rock’s standout “Queensbridge Politics,” in which Nas plays the wise old uncle, at his most comfortable and confident. But it’s tragic to hear what he’s done with some of these productions. For much of the record, Nas sounds like he’s trying too hard. “It Never Ends” is a swirling piano beat from Alchemist primed for a laid back flow that Nas...inexplicably yells over, biting The Notorious B.I.G.’s infamous “Seven Mac-11’s…” line in what appears to be a tribute. This mismatched energy is also apparent on a perfectly serviceable beat from Pete Rock (“The Art of It”), in which Nas sandwiches a single decent verse (“Pulled out the barrel/Four-fifths rip through bone marrow/Make his toes spiral the dirt/While his feet kick up rock, he’s a sprinter”) in between two head-shakers (“A life, Adidas under A, the B for beater, Bottega/British Knights sneaker...” and so on through the alphabet). “Beautiful Life,” his most direct reference to his divorce from the singer Kelis, offers no real clarity to their mutual allegations of abuse, and its celebratory tone leaves a stale aftertaste. Like most of the songs on Lost Tapes 2, it never should have seen the light of day, a sentiment that was, at one point, shared by Nas himself. That he would release an album that didn’t even meet his own standards is dispiriting.","Ostensibly a sequel to The Lost Tapes, these unreleased songs from Nas’ latter-day output were pulled from the cutting room floor.

Moon: The Area of Influence,Jeff Mills,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d2ca965ea98e20008674926/1:1/w_160/JeffMills_moon.jpg,2019-07-24 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jeff-mills-moon-the-area-of-influence/,Axis,"Jeff Mills likes outer space. Over the past three decades, the Detroit native and techno legend has amassed an expansive catalog, with many of his releases taking direct inspiration from the cosmos, including records devoted to Alpha Centauri, Proxima Centauri, Orion, and a myriad of (often fantastical) intergalactic journeys. He has even collaborated with NASA. On his latest LP, Mills is once again looking beyond our atmosphere, albeit toward an object that’s a little closer to home: the moon. It’s not his first time tackling that particular celestial body; back in 2015, he put together a soundtrack for Fritz Lang’s pioneering 1929 silent film Woman in the Moon, and followed that up with a soundtrack for another silent sci-fi classic, George Méliès’ A Trip to the Moon, from 1902. While those efforts drew from others’ work (not to mention a completely different era when space travel was pure science fiction), Moon: The Area of Influence is purely the product of his own, modern-day imagination. Its arrival coincides with the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, an event that captured his imagination (along with the rest of the world’s) when he was just a young boy. Moon doesn’t really conjure images of rocket ships and astronauts. Although LP opener “Control, Sattva and Rama” does begin with a recording from the NASA control room, the album’s main focus is how the moon affects things right here on Earth. (It’s telling that the moon doesn’t actually appear on the record’s cover, which instead depicts moonlight reflecting off a large body of water.) Mills’ interest in the moon’s influence on terrestrial matters extends from the tides to circadian rhythms (“Sleep-Wake Cycles”) and even people’s moods (“Erratic Human Behavior”). This being an instrumental electronic album, it’s hard to glean any of these things from the music itself. In fact, Moon doesn’t sound all that different from a bevvy of Mills’ other releases. That’s not necessarily a bad thing; the production is precise and minimal, its grooves subtly undulating beneath crystalline melodies. Fans of the insistent techno that usually populates Mills’ DJ sets will likely gravitate toward the hypnotic pulse of “Theia,” the static-laced rhythms of “Erratic Human Behavior,” and the sharp gallop of “180-Degree Repositioning Phase.” “Lunar Power” also sports a steady kick drum, but it’s the track’s analog chirps and swelling strings that stand out. But Moon offers more meditative moments than club bangers. “Sleep-Wake Cycles” is an eight-minute trek through billowing, almost glassy melodies, while the vivid “Decoding the Lunar Sunrise” wondrously combines trundling basslines, dancing synths, and soaring strings. “The Tides” inspires a similar sense of awe, its gorgeous marriage of plaintive piano and shuffling percussion conjuring a bit of Larry Heard’s gentle magic. Moon probably isn’t a particularly essential addition to Mills’ discography. While the production is impeccable and the music is undeniably tasteful, it also sounds like, well, just another Jeff Mills record. As such, the ideas behind the record are more intriguing than the music itself, and with this kind of instrumental techno and ambient, there’s only so much conceptual digging to be done. Mills’ place in the larger electronic sphere is a little like the moon and its relationship to Earth. Much like the heavenly body, he’s a constant presence whose influence is practically immeasurable; it’s no wonder that his work and legacy has given rise to the same sort of wide-eyed devotion that humans throughout history have often felt when they’ve cast their gaze toward the night sky. At the same time, Mills quietly just keeps doing his thing, which makes his outsized influence easy to take for granted. After all, it’s easy to forget just how incredible the moon is if you don’t bother to look up.","Tilting his gaze toward the heavens once again, the Detroit electronic icon delivers an ambient-techno concept album exploring the moon’s pull on the human imagination.

A People’s History of Gauche,Gauche,by: Linnie Greene,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf014c6c13a452798e837d6/1:1/w_160/Gauche_APeople'sHistoryOfGauche.jpg,2019-07-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/gauche-a-peoples-history-of-gauche/,Merge,"Birthed from Washington D.C.’s punk scene like a manifestation of righteous rage, Gauche—which counts as members Priests’ Daniele Yandel, Downtown Boys’ Mary Jane Regalado, and Jason P. Barnett—emerged from the Mid-Atlantic bog in 2015 with a seven-song EP, coupling social commentary and new wave riffs. Four years later, the band debuts their full-length, with six reworked and re-recorded EP tracks plus five new songs that find the band sharpening its sound to a steely point. The studio gloss occasionally smothers, but A People’s History of Gauche is a swamp creature for modern times, a driving and tenacious record that never loses its feral appeal. Dalliances with atonality and structural devolution evoke Devo or the B-52s, but lyrically, the record is a burn letter shoved in the locker of history’s victors. “Everybody tries to win/Look who gets away with sin…/White men get away,” Regalado snarls on the final track, “Rectangle.” The confluence of the personal and the political helps the record avoid abstraction and stay planted in specificity. This is not a “Schoolhouse Rock” of contemporary politics and colonialist history, but a fevered airing of grievances, a burning flag, a renunciation of respectability politics in favor of a more bracing alternative. “Pay Day” rails against the ills of capitalism, repeating the phrase, “I know I can’t survive like this.” The wallop of the drums and the galloping bassline are as exhilarating as the lines, “Income, always think about payday/Always waiting on wages/Always think about systems.” Tell me about it, a freelancer somewhere sighs. “History,” the best song from the earlier EP, still rises to the top of the full-length, but it’s one instance in which all the studio bells and whistles might have been a distracting temptation: the driving bass that kicks off both versions finds a tamer counterpart in the cacophony of sounds, a mix that seems to put every instrument in competition with each other. The album dips in and out of tempos, themes, and varying degrees of intensity without losing any of its urgency. “Boom Hazard,” an ode to implosion both nuclear and relational, provides a salve against the fury and sadness that bookend it. The avant-garde saxophone trills of “Dirty Jacket” lowers your adrenaline before the inevitable spike one song later. The spectrum of subjects covered, from economic disparity to surveillance, clearly defines an insidious and omnipresent “they,” the monolith of power and oppression against which Gauche beat their fists. It’s the government; it’s the bigots with money; it’s history writ large, the way there’s no erasing erasure. Early on, “Cycles” addresses the ravages of white supremacy, Eric Garner (“Reading all about how/He can’t breathe/Or walk around at night”) and bodies piled at the border: “Lost in the desert/She is not alive/Cuz impunity lasts a long, long time.” The horn weaves around this human rot, and yet this is the paradox Gauche asks us to contemplate: the clarion call to bear witness to the atrocity of history while writing one anew. A People’s History is not the first musical rejection of modern ills, but it’s one of the most unflinching. It is the soundtrack to both a particular moment and the defiance that’s powered the proletariat since history began.","Featuring members of Priests and Downtown Boys, the D.C. punk collective’s debut is a driving and tenacious record that never loses its feral appeal.

Songs From San Mateo County,Tony Molina,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d30b44ec4d4cb0009c58bfb/1:1/w_160/molina_SongsFromSanMateo.jpg,2019-07-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tony-molina-songs-from-san-mateo-county/,Smoking Room,"Tony Molina’s fat-free, minute-long missives blend ’60s jangle, ’70s power-pop, ’80s metal riffs and ’90s indie-rock fuzz. They give you everything you might want in a rock song, in other words, in about a third of the time. His songs feel tailor-made for a streaming-on-demand culture where the words “Skip Intro” have become ingrained in our entertainment-consumption rituals. The Bay Area hardcore vet has issued a stream of compact, tunefully oversaturated albums that are rivaled only by episodes of “I Think You Should Leave” for the most fun you can have in quarter-hour intervals. Songs From San Mateo County collects 14 rarities recorded from 2009-2015, encompassing unreleased material, songs salvaged from out-of-print cassettes, and solo takes of tracks later recorded with his bands Ovens and Violent Change. But unlike many similar compilations, the album fits seamlessly into Molina’s existing canon—his work already blurs the line between “impulse” and “finished track.” And where his official albums tend to focus on a specific aesthetic, Songs From San Mateo County touches on every style he’s explored, making it the ideal entry point. While Molina’s 2018 album Kill the Lights showed him occasionally creeping past the 120-second mark, Songs From San Mateo County captures him at his most brutally economical. Even by Molina’s microdosing standards, some of these tracks are so brief they challenge the very notion of what you’re allowed to call a song. Even the leanest scraps feel purposeful—the arpeggiated instrumental “Intro” runs for all of 13 seconds, but still manages to answer the question: what if Queen played Warped Tour? And “#1 Riff” is less self-aggrandizing display than spiritual communion with Big Star’s No. 1 Record, with shimmering acoustic textures that vividly recreate that album’s bittersweet, before-sunrise mood in 28 seconds flat. The core of Songs From San Mateo County lands squarely in the DIY-via-DGC zone Molina staked out on his 2014 solo debut Dissed and Dismissed, and a handful of these tracks (like “Can’t Find My Way” and “Hard to Know”) actually feel like trial runs for that record’s delicate balance of Teenage Fanclub hooks and Thin Lizzy flourishes. It’s also a showcase for his dexterity within confined spaces: “I’m Not Down” chimes like something out of Bob Mould’s Sugar songbook, slips into gloriously metallic riffs, and then slides home on a gloriously J Mascis guitar solo outro. And then there are the songs that feel so effortless and pristine—the Petty-esque heartbreaker “Word Around Town” and the acoustic ballad “Don’t See Me Now”—that it seems absurd they were buried until now. Perhaps Songs From San Mateo County signals the end of this phase for Molina; he’s claimed the songs on his next album will cross the two-minute border, suggesting he’s entering his Under the Bushes, Under the Stars years. Tellingly, this collection concludes with “Outro,” a relaxed, tiki-torch-lit, surf-tinged instrumental that atypically evokes pre-Beatlemania rock ‘n’ roll. Whether it’s just a one-off or a sign that Molina is saying “aloha” to his past remains to be seen. But for now, Songs From San Mateo County presents the opportunity to appreciate an artist who’s accomplished a lot with limited time and space, yet only seems to be getting started.","Tony Molina’s fat-free, minute-long missives give you everything you might want in a rock song in a third of the time.

The Lion King: The Gift,Various Artists,by: Michelle Kim,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d35e4fbc4d4cb0009c58e1b/1:1/w_160/beyonce_thegift.jpeg,2019-07-23 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-the-lion-king-the-gift/,Walt Disney,"As Beyoncé’s art has grown outwardly political and pro-black throughout the decade, she has increasingly called upon African-born artists to participate in and inform her work. She did this with Tofo Tofo, the Mozambican pantsula dancers who appeared in her 2011 “Run the World (Girls)” video. In her self-titled era, she sampled Nigerian feminist writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie on 2013’s “***Flawless,” and Griot vocalist Ismael Kouyaté on the Afro-inspired “Grown Woman.” The Lemonade film, which was threaded by excerpts of Somali-British poet Warsan Shire’s work, featured ritual Yoruba body makeup work by Nigerian-American artist Laolu Senbanjo. During her 2018 set at Global Citizen Fest South Africa, she recruited a local choir to add Zulu backing vocals to a performance of “Halo.” And later that year, her headlining Coachella performance interpolated Fela Kuti, which can be heard on the subsequent Homecoming film and album. In her ongoing quest to both pay homage to a black cultural history and contextualize herself within it, she took advantage of her role as Nala in the super-CGI remake of The Lion King and hired a swath of African artists and producers for a new album inspired by the movie. The Gift is an extension of Beyoncé’s work and its themes of ancestry, self-love, spirituality, and family. But its main purpose is to showcase today’s African musical stars, putting their sound on an enormous platform using the commercial reach of one of the world’s biggest pop titans and Disney’s highest-grossing franchise. Similar to Kendrick Lamar’s Black Panther-inspired album and other recent globe-trotting works like Drake’s More Life and GoldLink’s Diaspora, The Gift is thrilling because of the diasporic connections being made through collaboration. African artists from Nigeria, Ghana, Cameroon, and South Africa all display a wide range of regional genres and merge them with American styles. This works best on tracks like “My Power,” where rap weirdo Tierra Whack and Top 40 songwriter Nija join forces with South African gqom badasses Busiswa and Moonchild Sanelley for a searing DJ Lag-produced track about black girl determination and resilience. Meanwhile, “Don’t Jealous Me” features a survey of different artists that fall under the oft-misused umbrella term of Afrobeat, as Nigerian stars Tekno, Yemi Alade, and Mr Eazi bring their own signature swagger to a sinister gqom-inflected banger. “Mood 4 Eva,” featuring A-listers Bey, JAY-Z, and Childish Gambino, flips a sample Malian artist Oumou Sangaré’s 1989 Wassoulou song “Diaraby Nene” into a buoyant, hedonistic flex track. The album also nods to Africa’s influence in Caribbean music with “Already,” a track that draws out the rhythmic similarities between dancehall and Afropop by linking Ghanaian artist Shatta Wale with global riddim-fetishizers Major Lazer. Meanwhile, the self-proclaimed “African giant” Burna Boy warns against blindly following the crowd on his solo track “Ja Ara E,” a track that channels Fela Kuti with a laidback dembow groove. But, as critics and artists were quick to point out, The Gift doesn’t completely cover all the regions and styles that Africa has to offer. There are no featured East or North African artists, which is particularly odd considering The Lion King’s setting is loosely based on Kenyan geographical features and the character’s names originate from the East African language of Swahili. Beyoncé does her best to rectify the lack of representation by including Swahili in the beginning of “Spirit,” the only Gift song that appears in the movie, and even sings in the language at the end of “Otherside,” a glowing H.E.R.-style ballad about the afterlife. But ultimately, The Gift’s emphasis on West African Afropop and South African house seems like a half-measure in an album that presents itself as extremely dedicated to some kind of authenticity, especially coming from the reliably meticulous Beyoncé. Beyoncé is still at her best when she goes off-book and gets personal. “Brown Skin Girl,” featuring Blue Ivy, Brooklyn rapper SAINt JHN, and Nigerian pop star WizKid, doesn’t seem to be tied to a particular Lion King plot point. And uncoincidentally, it’s one of the more touching songs on the album. After Blue Ivy sings the hook with growing assuredness, Bey sings directly to her and any other black girl who might be judged or dismissed based on her appearance: “I love everything about you, from your nappy curls/To every single curve, your body natural… I never trade you for anybody else,” she sings in a truly heartfelt case for self-acceptance. Beyoncé takes care to dole these pearls of wisdom in a way that’s specific, but also universal to those of African descent. “Bigger,” both directed towards her offspring and anyone else who is of the diaspora, is a rallying call to aspire to greatness, because your life is connected to a greater black legacy and history. But not every track on the album shakes off the precious Disney vibes. The most lackluster songs don’t have a strong conceptual core, meeting the prompt of being “inspired by” The Lion King and not doing much else. On “Water,” Cameroonian singer Salatiel sings about meeting your love interest “by the river,” conjuring up images of Simba and Nala. But confusingly, Pharrell just chants lines about water wings: “Yes, we can make it far/Don't need inflatables.” “Spirit,” the gospel-bop ballad, makes a lot of sense in the movie when it soundtracks two incredibly realistic animated lions bounding through the desert, but it doesn’t fit well with the other, more loose and ambitious tracks. Even though Bey has referred to The Gift as “sonic cinema,” the album stands in the shadow of a movie that stands in the shadow of the 1994 original. Though not fully comprehensive or that musically far-reaching (due to its prioritization of African genres that have already experienced crossover success), the album still succeeds in introducing a whole new musical universe to the average American listener. And for fans already familiar with genres on The Gift, it arrives as a crucial, all-too-rare example in which African music and culture are actually being presented in the American mainstream by the artists who make it. It’s an honorable feat for Beyoncé, who has repeatedly put time, money, and energy into recruiting African talents, broadening the scope of what pop can look and sound like. Only this time, it’s a soundtrack for a Disney movie about cats.","Beyoncé parlays her role in Disney’s The Lion King to put out a fine companion album that showcases today’s African stars.

Planetary Clairvoyance,Tomb Mold,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d3648d4beb5b10009a9806f/1:1/w_160/Tomb-Mold.jpg,2019-07-23 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tomb-mold-planetary-clairvoyance/,20 Buck Spin,"Last fall, Tomb Mold previewed their third album, the sci-fi opus Planetary Clairvoyance, with a limited edition cassette tape. Featuring early versions of two songs from the upcoming record, the demo felt like an artifact from death metal’s late-80s heyday: murky, xeroxed, with little context for the uninitiated. Both songs hovered around the six-minute mark, blasting like wind tunnels. The accompanying liner notes, which attributed duties like “Void Expansion” and “Nebula Observation” to cryptically initialed band members, featured a statement of cosmic gratitude in the place where other bands might list their ‘thank you’s’ or paste their Bandcamp link: “The azure of the heavens is perfect, beautiful.” “Perfect” and “beautiful” are not the adjectives you might think to associate with a death metal band called Tomb Mold. But since forming in 2015, the Toronto quartet have evolved from typically morbid fascinations (song titles include “Bereavement of Flesh,” “Valley of Defilement”) into grander, more ambitious compositions. Last year’s Manor of Infinite Forms felt like a breakthrough, with guitarists Derrick Vella and Payson Power cycling through their infinite arsenal of riffs over a churning rhythm section. Death metal tends to thrive on history, and Tomb Mold never shied away from hero worship, particularly forebears like Incantation and Finnish weirdos Demilich. It was their energy that made them stand out, their ability to find new extremes in their old-school sound. Darker, stranger, and more atmospheric than its predecessor, Planetary Clairvoyance extends their gifts beyond death metal, sounding untied to any particular lineage. It’s their tightest record to date, suite-like in its momentum and thematic coherence. Almost immediately, they gesture toward quiet, eerier textures. The opening track, “Beg for Life,” is interrupted by a passage of classical guitar that echoes over ominous fills from drummer Max Klebanoff. An ambient interlude, “Phosphorene Ultimate,” arrives early in the tracklist as a kind of warning sign. Less than 15 minutes into the record, it’s a purposefully arresting choice, meant to remind you that this is not background music: at every moment, Tomb Mold demand you take stock of the world they create, where passages of silence are as integral as the grinding melodies and chaos. The lyric sheet is where the band’s alien obsession becomes clearest; lines about a burning universe and a planet that devours its children could even be read as topical. And while Klebanoff’s vocals are still completely indecipherable—a dull, smouldering mass losing shape as the music sets it on fire—Planetary Clairvoyance demands to be understood as a whole. Power’s leads are winding and luminescent, often arriving near the end of a song as a psychedelic light show. Vella’s riffs, meanwhile, have never sounded more versatile, mournful and dissonant throughout “Infinite Resurrection” and stuttering like helicopter propellers in the title track. For a group that started out as a studio-only project, Tomb Mold sound proudly alive, aware of how each component of their sound can be unleashed and withheld to maximize your attention. The album closes with “Heat Death,” a climactic explosion that sputters out as its tempo slows into a decaying howl of feedback and noise. It’s the part of the album where the sky goes fully black—devoid of any life or movement. Its slow fade into pure atmosphere is a sign of the artistic leap that Tomb Mold have taken; as their work has grown more technically involved, it has also become increasingly human, emotionally invested and complete. Vella, who co-writes the lyrics, has claimed that he sequenced the record using the template of Hats—the 1989 masterpiece by ambient pop group the Blue Nile. Of course, there’s nothing about these songs that even remotely resembles their starlit, synthy heartbreak, but its influence is a good indicator of the band’s unlikely journey. No longer content to exist within the borders of their genre, their sound can now be admired by all fans of dark, inventive music, aiming wildly toward the cosmos and settling into orbit.","The Toronto death metal quartet push outward into new territory on their darkest, strangest album yet.

stranno stranno. neobjatno.,Nina Kraviz,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d289f0f46e4c00008b9a682/1:1/w_160/ninakraviz_trip.jpg,2019-07-23 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nina-kraviz-stranno-stranno-neobjatno/,Trip,"Earlier this year, Nina Kraviz looked like she might be at a turning point in her career. The Russian electronic musician has spent the past decade using a two-pronged attack to establish herself as one of contemporary techno’s prime movers. On the one hand there are her take-no-prisoners DJ sets—a mixture of rave anthems, vintage IDM, and mind-melting experiments in rhythmic abstraction. On the other there’s her label трип (Trip), a showcase for a new generation of underground producers from places like Russia, Finland, and Iceland—and, often, the source of the very freakiest cuts in her sets. But premiering a new audiovisual live show at Coachella this past April, she took a strikingly different tack, blending theatrical staging and even acting—at the outset, she poured herself a cup of tea before staring deeply into a full-length mirror—with a new focus on her vocals. It wasn’t entirely successful, though Kraviz’ search for new frontiers in live electronic music was, at the very least, provocative. But on her new EP on трип, Kraviz is back in her wheelhouse, revisiting the stripped-back style that has been a staple of her work since early tracks like “Ghetto Kraviz.” That single, the most successful of her career, came out on Radio Slave’s REKIDS label, and “Dream Machine,” the first of the EP’s three tracks, suggests Radio Slave’s influence, at least at first: Hypnotic and slow-burning, it plays pumping synthesizer chords off a restrained drum-machine groove and fills in the empty spaces with Kraviz’ distant whispers and an occasional flash of dissonance reminiscent of a freight train’s mournful whistle. But four minutes through the six-and-a-half-minute track, she flips the script: “I think I’m falling for you,” she intones, and the track is flooded with trembling organs. It’s a little bit eerie, a little bit sexy, and a little bit over the top, despite its studied restraint. “I Want You” is harder-edged and much better, with a sound more in keeping with Kraviz’ DJ sets. Rigid toms hammer away, the claps and hi-hats distorted and raw; Kraviz chops her vocals up into ribbons and weaves them through the jagged beats, scraps of speech (“I started to worry”) disappearing behind overlapping layers of pure, satiny tone. “Stranno Neobjatno” is the best of the bunch. It’s even faster than “I Want You,” but the smoothness of the groove belies its breakneck tempo. Gurgling synths and dial-tone chirps curl around a bare-bones kick/clap rhythm; in the background, shimmering bell tones flash back to Jeff Mills’ steely minimal techno. “Stranno neobjatno,” murmurs Kraviz, over and over, and while that might not mean much to you (the Russian phrase means something like “weirdly immense,” or the sublime), the effect is seductive, her sing-song tone pulling you deeper into the swirl even as subtle electronic effects steadily distort everything around. It’s more funhouse mirror than full-length mirror, and it offers a convincing look at Kraviz’ talent for low-key psychedelia.","The Russian electronic musician offers a mind-melting and hypnotic take on techno.

King’s Mouth,The Flaming Lips,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d02c3bdb6e2e379a2c9d40b/1:1/w_160/KingsMouth_FlamingLips.jpg,2019-07-22 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-flaming-lips-kings-mouth/,Warner Bros.,"If there’s been one constant in The Flaming Lips’ careening four-decade evolution from Okie goth-punk weirdos to festival-conquering freak show, it’s that Wayne Coyne loves to tell a story. Back on 1989’s Telepathic Surgery, he hit pause on the album’s acid-fried garage rock to relate a childhood encounter with UFOs. Throughout the ’90s, he specialized in the sort of musical tall tales (”Put the Waterbug in the Policeman’s Ear,” “The Big Ol’ Bug Is the New Baby Now”) that required narrative exposition nearly as long as the tunes they were teeing up. And even as he started writing more serious songs about humans with wives and children, he was just as likely to dress up heavy themes in fantastical yarns about fighting droids and killer mechanized canines. But, oddly enough for a Pink Floyd-worshipping band that’s introduced us to enough colorful characters to fill several Lewis Carroll novels, the Flaming Lips have never released a proper, front-to-back narrative song cycle. (A handful of robot-populated tunes on Yoshimi doesn’t quite count.) And their first attempt at such, King’s Mouth, arrives with muted fanfare, falling somewhere between a proper Lips studio album and one of their many extracurricular novelty releases. King’s Mouth was initially conceived as the soundtrack to a synchronized light-art installation—or rather, an “immersive head-trip fantasy experience”—staged by Coyne. (This is, of course, is what the viewing chamber looked like.) It was then developed into a 12-song storybook album that was released in a limited-vinyl run last April on Record Store Day. Like many of the projects the Lips have debuted on RSD, it boasts some inspired celebrity stunt-casting: The album is narrated by The Clash’s Mick Jones, who delivers the particulars of its outlandish plot with the tone of a kindly old granddad. I’m not really spoiling anything by telling you King’s Mouth is about a royal baby born to a queen mother who perishes during labor, presumably because the kid has an abnormally massive noggin, which is put to effective use when he saves his city from an avalanche by devouring the universe whole with his giant chompers only to die in the process, after which his followers chop off his head and live inside of it for all utopian eternity. Ultimately, it’s just an elaborate ruse for Coyne to lean into his favorite topics once again——the fragility of life, the inevitability of death, the perseverance of the human spirit, the inexplicable wonders of the universe. Likewise, King’s Mouth is a musical patchwork of familiar Lips flourishes: the operatic exultations of The Soft Bulletin, the campfire electro of Yoshimi, the glitchy textures and simple, sanguine balladry of Oczy Mlody. But the pieces don’t always come together in a satisfying way—scene-setting track “The Sparrow” aims for the multi-sectional splendor of past triumphs like “The Spark That Bled,” but feels too fragmented to take flight. That song provides an early indication that King’s Mouth is not the sort of album you’ll be stripping for playlists—only the winsome acoustic sing-along “How Many Times” functions as a stand-alone track. But as far as concept albums about magical, abnormally sized severed heads go, King’s Mouth is a breezy listen. And at 42 minutes, it’s also the Lips’ shortest album since 1992’s Hit to Death in the Future Head. More than simply reaffirming the Lips’ flair for bizarro storylines, King’s Mouth reminds us that Coyne can draw poignancy and pathos from the strangest sources. On King’s Mouth he voices the title character’s inner thoughts from birth to afterlife, steering the cosmic lullaby “Giant Baby” from Jones’ quizzical observations about the difficulties of sourcing oversized toys into a somber rumination on losing a parent. In moments like these, King’s Mouth may seem a touch too dark to replace Goodnight Moon or Each Peach Pear Plum as an evening storytime staple. But by reimagining the weighty concept record as light, escapist entertainment, King’s Mouth is as strong a candidate as any for Baby’s First Prog Album.

Grace EP,DJ Haram,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d2f3bf38a4fb30009467fa3/1:1/w_160/DJHaram_Grace.jpg,2019-07-22 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dj-haram-grace-ep/,Hyperdub,"In the wake of a family tragedy, Discwoman affiliate DJ Haram uses her debut EP, Grace, as an escape valve. Grace soundtracks a mythological world that hangs between paradise and hell, drawing on Haram’s New Jersey upbringing and her Middle Eastern roots. This duality plays out everywhere across the EP. The darbuka, a goblet-shaped drum commonly associated with Egypt, rubs up against against the raucous, percussive crunch of New Jersey club and ballroom, and celestial melodies share space with dark, distorted riffs that fuse hardcore rave with Middle Eastern souk. Often in electronic music, this kind of dichotomy is characterised as x versus y, with elements pitted against each other. On Grace, these seemingly contrary elements interact respectfully, each taking a turn to bask in the limelight and play a supporting role. Haram has said that drums are “the invisible soul and feeling” of her songs and it shows. “Body Count” and “No Idol (Remix),” two of the record’s most striking songs, are essentially drum jams, in which the sub bass, earthen thump, and sound effects of Jersey club lead a dazzling dance around Haram’s elastic darbuka lines, their interplay coated with the slightest hint of melody. At other times, melody takes the lead: On the original “No Idol,” a breezily evocative Middle Eastern flute riff shares space with an anxious string line, while the mesmerising synth on “Gemini Rising” is pitched somewhere between ethereal and uneasy, like walking through a deserted city park at sunset. Haram leaves enough space for the various elements to breathe, so the listener is never overwhelmed or beaten over the head by the ingenuity of it all. Grace’s only real misstep comes, perhaps surprisingly, in the contribution from 700 Bliss, Haram’s collaborative project with poet, musician, and activist Moor Mother. The 700 Bliss remix of “Candle Light,” the only track here with a full vocal, feels cramped and unwieldy, its distortion oddly flat on a record of impressive peaks, troughs and wide range. Maybe the main problem with the “Candle Light” remix is that amid an EP of reverie, it feels too earthbound. Grace is a record for star gazers, romantics and wanderers, a genuinely transportive work that flies from the mundane.","In the wake of a family tragedy, the producer crafts a genuinely transportive work, seamlessly mixing Jersey club with Middle Eastern instruments.

Black Wave,Lost Sounds,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cc4f8d1c13a453725e81ff5/1:1/w_160/unnamed%20(1).jpg,2019-07-22 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lost-sounds-black-wave/,FDH,"For much of his career, Jay Lindsey’s reputation for being prolific was matched only by his reputation for antagonism. And the artist better known as Jay Reatard was a fighter to the end—in his final tweet, typed out 36 hours before his body was found in January 2010, he was issuing a bounty on the heads of the New Jersey garage band Liquor Store. But at the time of his passing, Lindsey’s volatile public persona had begun to contrast sharply with his artistic maturation. The album that proved to be his swan song, 2009’s Watch Me Fall, found him trading adrenalized punk for Flying Nun-inspired jangle pop, and those in his inner circle say he had designs on venturing into mellower Neil Young-style country-rock territory and retiring the Reatard moniker altogether. But if Lindsey’s late career was marked a growing disconnect between his creative and destructive impulses, these two sides fused perfectly in Lost Sounds. Active from 1999 to 2005, Lost Sounds seemed destined to live up to its name until Lindsey became a hot underground property with his 2006 solo debut Blood Visions. A team-up with his then-girlfriend Alicja Trout (formerly of indie-pop hopefuls the Clears), Lost Sounds took a sharp left from rock ‘n’ roll primitivism into synth-punk futurism, a reaction to the aesthetic conservatism Lindsey encountered in the garage trenches with his notorious first band, the Reatards. But even during the garage-rock and post-punk crazes of the early ’00s, Lost Sounds slipped through the cracks—they were too feral, too strange, too bleak. If the Meet Me in the Bathroom era served in part as an escapist response to 9/11, Lost Sounds stewed in the distress of the times. This wasn’t dance music—it was panic music. Shortly after Lindsey’s passing, Lost Sounds were commemorated with a best-of compilation and collection of rarities that introduced their music to newer fans who were still making sense of his vast catalog. In comparison, the timing of this reissue—a no-frills remaster of the band’s 2001 double-album, Black Wave—feels more random. Still, it reaffirms the confrontational and visceral qualities that made Lost Sounds’ music seem marginal at the time and vital now. Black Wave—the title a half-joking nod to new wave and black metal—became a double album simply because Lindsey and Trout were writing songs at too furious a rate to contain. The record feels like a 19-round challenge to see who could push the group to even more ferocious extremes while adhering to pop-song orthodoxy. Black Wave’s cover image— the band running through empty city streets, fleeing a sinister alien force looming overhead—suggests 9/11 paranoia, but the terror within is more psychological: Trout’s throat-shredding screed “I’m Not a Machine” sounds like a prescient rallying cry against encroaching technocracy, while Lindsey repeats the title of the electro-shocked “Do You Wanna Kill Me” with the blood-curdling hysteria of a young Black Francis. And yet, through the album’s black-mold production, it’s clear that Jay isn’t merely engaging in nihilism-by-numbers. Throughout his life, both his combative attitude and do-or-die work ethic were attributed to his hardscrabble upbringing in the rougher parts of Memphis. And nowhere in his bottomless discography is that impetus more evident than on “1620 Echles St.,” named for the semi-detached home where, while babysitting his little sister, a young Jay overhead a rape happening in the house next door. (As he recounted in the documentary Better Than Something, the incident ended with cops kicking the shit out of the perpetrators and inviting the kids on the block to pelt rocks at them.) When he cries, “Is this the life for me?,” it’s the desperate plea of a scared kid for whom making music would never just be some idle pastime. But for all its relentless aggression and suffocating sense of doom, Black Wave yields early signs of the manic melodicism that would flourish on Blood Visions: the stormtrooper stomp of “Heart Felt Toys” blindsides you with a chorus that sticks out like a puff of cotton candy floating in a pool of black tar, while “Dark Shadows” could be a warm-up for a better known, similarly titled song in his canon. The bridge to Blood Visions would be further fortified on Lost Sounds’ subsequent, increasingly refined two albums, but Black Wave is less a portrait of a future indie-rock star finding his voice than one being pushed to the next level by an equally industrious foil. While Lindsey may have embodied Black Wave’s agitated essence, Trout’s contributions—from the berserker B-52’s bomp of “Lost and Found” to the goth-metal convulsions of “I See Everything” to the ’60s go-go swing of “Soon This Tomb”—brought depth and character to their monomaniacal attack. In 2017, Trout and fellow surviving members Rich Crook and John Garland rebooted Lost Sounds under the name Sweet Knives, following the emergence of a wave of groups—from fellow Memphis noisemakers Nots to Aussie icons Total Control—carrying the torch for dystopian synth-spiked punk. Now, with his death even further in the rearview, it’s easier to see that Lost Sounds was more than just a pit stop on Jay Reatard’s road to infamy. They were a visionary group with a legacy all their own.","Jay Reatard’s early band Lost Sounds veered from rock‘n’roll primitivism into synth-punk futurism, but the result wasn’t dance music—it was panic music.

"Rogue Intruder, Soul Enhancer",Oli XL,by: Alexander Iadarola,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d249ff63046210009997231/1:1/w_160/olixl_rogueintruder.jpg,2019-07-22 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/oli-xl-rogue-intruder-soul-enhancer/,Bloom,"Rogue Introducer, Soul Enhancer is an almost uncomfortably gorgeous piece of work. “Clumsy,” the second single from the Stockholm producer Oli XL’s striking debut LP, is a good distillation of the record’s most memorable qualities. Working with a sound palette that recalls humorless glitch recordings, it offers a demented version of bliss that a listener could live with for a very long time. The melancholy yet weirdly fun track is built around a pair of freeze-dried chords and features a pitched-up rendition of the iconic chorus from Beck’s 1993 single “Loser.” Where the original hook sounds like Sappho on whippets, Oli XL makes the words mean something else. Now they’re not just about a guy in a disorienting historical moment, but about everything, somehow. “Soy un perdedor. I’m a loser, baby, so why don’t you kill me?” Next to Oli XL’s angelic sound design, this comically profane request starts to feel sacred. Rogue Intruder, Soul Enhancer recalls aughts electronica, jungle, and Basement Jaxx, but Oli XL’s approach is thrillingly his own. It follows the producer’s standout contributions to PAN and Posh Isolation compilations, arriving on his own Bloom imprint, a subsidiary of Stockholm's YEAR0001. The record is both gloomy and joyful, and its pop-adjacent tracks are produced with severe attention to detail. “Liquid Love” sounds like a cosmic turntablism exercise, and you get the sense that it might help astronauts in a lonely space station unwind after a long day of arguing with the computer. The heavy drum patterns on “Orchid Itch” make it one of the more DJ-friendly tunes on the album, while the EQ and compression settings are warped to create a sense of disorienting atmospheric pressure. The specter of dub hangs heavy over the LP as a whole: Sonic space is stretched out, pulverized, and uncannily flattened. Even in its most depressive moments, the album is playful. The album would (probably?) sound fine as background music in an H&M, and it would sound great in a playlist alongside heady compositions by Iannis Xenakis and Kara-Lis Coverdale. Rogue Introducer, Soul Enhancer is heavy on breakbeats, and while many club producers have explored that rhythmic world in the last few years, Oli XL is in his own orbit. “I think about music in a pretty ‘theoretical’ way, but it’s my own completely made up rules I try to follow, often with silly analogies,” he said in a recent interview. “Like judging the rhythmic vibe—it’s some dude walking a wire between two skyscrapers… No one wants to see someone just walk flawlessly back and forth, dude needs to look like he just might fall!” The producer suggests that we might think about his music as sleight of hand: a kind of cunning performance. While there isn’t any linear narrative tying Rogue Introducer, Soul Enhancer together, it tells a compelling story on its own terms. There are recurring themes of failure and self-doubt in track titles such as “Hesitation,” “Imposter,” and “Clumsy,” while “dnL” features a funny robotic voice doing some abstract chastising: “Boring… lame!” The album’s less-than-optimistic subject matter has a certain tragicomic effect alongside its borderline effervescent sound. A number of songs feature lyrics, but they’re often hard to parse, which itself feels like a form of self-obfuscation. The final track, called “Sniper Baby”—a very surreal and funny title—does feature some legible verses over its introspective beat. “I don’t go outside/I’m losing my friends/How you gonna fill the void and make it end.” After about a minute his voice coos a little, then trails off as the take comes to a close, breaking the recording’s fourth wall. Just before the song ends, there’s a sound that could either be a muffled sob or a microphone being moved—it’s genuinely hard to tell.","Following a standout contribution to Berlin label PAN’s Mono No Aware compilation, the Stockholm producer delivers an impressive debut album that’s both gloomy and delightful.

Harlem World,Mase,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d30ab74beb5b10009a97f1c/1:1/w_160/Ma$e_HarlemWorld.jpg,2019-07-21 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mase-harlem-world/,Bad Boy,"Mase floats skyward wearing golden goggles and a shiny suit that looks like a tricked-out air traffic control vest. His rise through an ultramodern wind tunnel feels remarkably symbolic as Kelly Price lip-syncs Diana Ross’ “I’m Coming Out” on a monitor behind him. He’s wearing the same diamond-studded Jesus piece the Notorious B.I.G. had on when he was murdered. As he swaggers through the futuristic Hype Williams-directed music video for 1997’s “Mo Money, Mo Problems,” histories are being rewritten in real-time; the nature of rap as an epic retail commodity is growing. It is a eulogy and a coronation all at once. It is Bad Boy rising from the ashes. This was how Sean “Puffy” Combs, marketing extraordinaire, formally introduced a rebranded Mason Betha to the world. Despite guest starring on a No. 1 single months prior, this was Mase’s coming out party, the official induction of Bad Boy’s next star. For several years, Betha had been a foot soldier on the insular Harlem rap scene snarling about returning fire in shootouts, infrared beams, and slug-filled foes coughing up blood. Now he was nearly nonchalant, rapping about Dolce tube socks and putting his name on blimps. The transformation into a flashy ladykiller was Puff’s idea. “I was Murda, P. Diddy made me pretty,” Mase joked on a song called “Lookin’ at Me.” The transformation worked brilliantly and made Mase and Puff arguably more popular than any rappers before them, but it also raised questions about the value of style over substance among a classicist rap community that had just lost two icons to gun violence, the first Tupac Shakur, the other in their own camp. Puff, the man who’d brought hip-hop Biggie Smalls, one of its greatest ever rappers, was suddenly being pegged as an arbiter of bad taste, with Mase his steward in flamboyant emptiness. Initially seen as a sycophant riding Puff’s coattails, and then as an unworthy successor to Biggie, Mase was nearly defiant in his self-belief: “You don’t like me? Bet against me,” he rapped casually on “Niggaz Wanna Act.” That effortless confidence and poise defines his debut album, Harlem World, one of the best rap albums to be almost shamelessly commercial. It was the peak of the shiny suit era, sparking the short-lived jiggy rap phenomenon of the late ’90s. Mason Bethea was a New Yorker born in the South. Perhaps that’s why he seemed to do everything on his own time, why he talked slower than the big city rappers he grew up with. The youngest of six children, he was delivered almost two months early in Jacksonville, Florida, and he and his mother fled an abusive father, showing up unannounced to live with an uncle in Harlem. Unscheduled arrivals became a hallmark of his life. “I guess from the very beginning I was coming onto the scene before people were ready to see me,” he says in his 2001 pseudo memoir, Revelations: There’s a Light After the Lime. After leading the basketball team to the PSAL Finals his senior year at Manhattan Center High School, Betha and teammate Cameron Giles had dreams of going to the NBA, but when Betha was forced to repeat his senior year—which meant a year without playing ball—the friends picked up rap as a hobby. From the beginning, they were opposites. Cam was the fire; Mase was preternaturally chill. As amateur rappers in Harlem going by Killa Cam and Murda Mase, the two immersed themselves in the corner scene, rapping around town at gambling spots and after games at Rucker Park. They joined a rap crew called Children of the Corn, founded in 1993 by a far more serious Harlem rapper named Big L. They were managed by an assertive Manhattan Center student named Damon Dash, but he was really courting L, who was known around town as the best rapper in the borough. (Some years later, Dame’s Roc-A-Fella Records would chase Big L again until his death in 1999.) The crew was primarily rapping about being young and menacing with Mase playing the coolest head. Cam was all action (“I’m a cat with nine lives but every day I risk em.”) Big L was the first in the group to catch a break when his Lifestylez ov da Poor and Dangerous single “M.V.P.” started gaining traction in New York. But a few months later, the Notorious B.I.G. released a “One More Chance” remix with the same DeBarge sample and all but killed L’s momentum. As Big L’s major career sputtered, Murda Mase kept rapping on 139th and Lenox, in front of a 24-hour chicken spot. It was a connection to Biggie that would soon give him his chance to become Harlem’s biggest star. Betha’s twin sister introduced him to Cudda Love, Biggie’s road manager, in 1996. After hearing a Murda Mase tape, Cudda went up to SUNY Purchase, where Betha was going to school, to inquire about his level of commitment to rap. “‘I already know you’re nice,’” Mase remembers him saying, “‘I just need to know if you want to make money?’” The relationship started paying dividends almost immediately. After only a few weeks, Cudda took Betha to audition for Biggie on a freezing New York City sidewalk out front of the Apollo theater. Biggie was impressed and wanted to put Murda Mase in the newly debuted Brooklyn group Junior M.A.F.I.A., but Cudda had other ideas: he sold his Acura to buy a pair of plane tickets to Atlanta for the colossal annual rap convention, Jack the Rapper’s Family Affair. Mase was so broke at the time that he was sharing a one-bedroom apartment and splitting White Castle burgers, but Cudda, knowing the man needed to look the part, let Mase borrow a silk Versace shirt with flamboyant colors, and Mase spent his last dime on Versace pants and shoes to complete the look. “Somebody’s going to notice me,” he remembers thinking. The convention afterparty was at the Hard Rock, and when he failed to woo producer Jermaine Dupri outside the venue, Cudda finagled an opportunity for Betha to try and impress Puff on the dancefloor. “You rap like that all the time? That slow?” Mase remembers Puff asking him, intrigued. “I liked his style,” Combs told the Los Angeles Times in 1997. “His personality stood out. The sound of his voice. He sounded like me.” When Mase got back to New York, he was Bad Boy. Only a few weeks later, he was reunited with Biggie, this time as teammates, on the “Only You” remix. There was a dollar sign in his name now. Puff showed him the money (allegedly $250,000, $50k upfront, outbidding Heavy D at Uptown Records, Tommy Boy Records, and his old friend Dame Dash at Roc-A-Fella) and he planned to make good on his investment. “I’m the newest member of the Bad Boy team/And I’ma bring this nigga Puff mad more cream,” Mase pledged on “Take What’s Yours.” “With hooks galore, leave the city shook for sure/And I’ma take ‘em back where Biggie took ‘em before.” Mase quickly made good on his promise. Puff was anxious to put his talents to use across the Bad Boy roster, and basically every record they cut together from 1996 to the summer of ‘97 hit. In the wake of Biggie’s death in March of 1997, Mase was suddenly thrust into a new role as replacement headliner. He was constantly fielding questions about inheriting the Bad Boy throne. His response was to turn that throne into a recliner. The album was wholly self-aware; chock full of jams and conscious of it. Mase wanted to take his insular Harlem world global, and he did, rolling out a red carpet from Lenox Ave. into suburban households across the country. Harlem World is larger than life. Mase had a buttery touch when in his groove, as if having an out-of-body experience watching himself churn out hits. “Why do what most do? Do what you ’posed to/Make hot jams y’all, sell bicoastal/If you want a hit you can let me coach you/Money back on anything that got my vocals,” he rapped on rhetorical opener “Do You Wanna Get $?” And while it’s safe to say Puff Daddy wasn’t a good rapper and was, in fact, simply just an executive masquerading as a showman, no such claim could be made about Mase. His flows were as silky, or as plush, or as golden as the material world furnishing his songs. He made the realm of luxury feel quaint. Part of the credit is owed to Puff, his ace in-house production team the Hitmen, and other rising beatmakers like the Neptunes, Dame Grease, and Jermaine Dupri who, to paraphrase Combs on the uber-jiggy “Feel So Good,” flipped hits from the ’80s and made ’em sound so crazy. They spun Isaac Hayes, Teena Marie, New Edition, Curtis Mayfield, and Michael Jackson into satiny soundbeds Mase would sprawl out in. Talk of Puff during the late ’90s often found a way back to Berry Gordy shaping the sound of Motown; the Bad Boy exec had a similar genius for putting everyone in a position to succeed. No Way Out remains his crowning achievement as a producer, but across Harlem World he makes Mase look like rap Hugh Hefner. Mase was underrated in his ability to make extravagant things seem quotidian. He had TVs in the headrests of his red Lex years before Xzibit was kitting out cars on “Pimp My Ride.” He preferred his money in yen because the Japanese didn’t tax him, and if you had something to ask him you could send him a fax. Rappers had been rich before but they’d rarely been thriftless. Mase was Scrooge McDuck diving into a vault of coins and finding his wealth exhausting. “It’s like y’all be talkin’ funny/I don’t understand the language of people with short money,” he rapped on “Feel So Good” over a Kool & the Gang sample that sounded like strolling the Las Vegas Strip at night. To listen to his music was to be vicariously untouchable. But Harlem World was wrongly depicted as lyrically limited and uninvolved, as well as far removed from the street rap deemed of and for the culture, emblematic of a transitional period when rap’s reach had, to the disdain of some hardcore fans, become a “Seinfeld” joke. It was too above ground, too kitsch, too expensive. The album was often ostentatious, to be sure, largely materialistic and definitely profit-oriented, but certainly not without its hood charms and never unaware of where it came from. Mase’s raps weren’t dense or heavy with double-entendre, but there was plenty of subtly tricky rapping worked into his flexible cadences. And for all the talk of excess, Mase pulled grit and grind rappers like DMX, 8Ball, and MJG into his orbit, made space for the shriek raps of Busta Rhymes, and matched the finesse of early mafioso JAY-Z. He was just as likely to shit talk as he was to flex. Everything circled back to the ubiquity he’d achieved as a Bad Boy poster child, but it still all began with Murda in Harlem. Almost overnight, Mase set up shop on the Billboard charts as if it was a label requirement. From Biggie’s death through the summer of 1998, all Mase did was make hit records: After handing Puff No. 1 and No. 2 smash hits, “Can’t Nobody Hold Me Down” and “Been Around the World,” respectively, and then bringing things to a head with his zeitgeist-shifting appearance on “Mo Money, Mo Problems,” Harlem World produced three Top 10 singles of its own. The album, which hit stores in October, was double platinum by December. He collected four plaques from the RIAA and was nominated for the same Grammy twice. The only rappers who had bigger years than he did were … Biggie and Puff. The short-lived Jiggy Rap Era—which included Jay-Z’s In My Lifetime, Vol. 1, peaked with Will Smith’s Big Willie Style, and concluded with the rise of DMX in 1998—has been primarily remembered with contempt, along with the Ringtone Rap that would take hold a decade later. But Harlem World remains the sleekest rap album about becoming super famous. It set precedents for decades of posh rap consumerism. It is flagrantly commodified, proud of it, but not lesser for it. Somewhere along the line, Mase grew weary of the fame, which was reflected in his music. He lost his love for rap and retired live on Hot 97 weeks before the release of his 1999 sophomore album Double Up. He became a pastor. He briefly returned to give rap another go in 2004 but was never the same. The magic was gone. As Kanye put it on “Devil in a New Dress”: “Don’t leave while you’re hot, that’s how Mase screwed up.” But Mase’s legacy lives on in every rags-to-mega-riches story that’s become standard in rap; in the flows co-opted by everyone from Drake to Pusha T; in wannabe rap moguls naming their imprint after $200,000 luxury cars; in Jesus pieces as a rite of passage. So much of what rap has become can be traced back to those shiny suits blinged out in that wind tunnel. As Mase floats, an entire genre hangs in the balance.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

Apollo: Atmospheres & Soundtracks - Extended Edition,Brian Eno,by: Alfred Soto,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d138d2df3ed35000960a64d/1:1/w_160/BrianEno_ApolloAtmospheresAndSoundtracks.jpg,2019-07-20 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/brian-eno-apollo-atmospheres-and-soundtracks-extended-edition/,UMC,"A decade into a solo career dedicated to aural novelty, Brian Eno released an album intended to transform weightlessness into a kind of spiritual exaltation. On Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks, the former Roxy Music keyboardist/troublemaker took a break from the fractured narratives and lissome grooves he had helped create for David Bowie and Talking Heads, respectively. The occasion? In its original, 1983 form, a documentary consisting of 35-millimeter footage of the six moon missions; the score composed by Eno, brother Roger, and guitarist Daniel Lanois complement its static, clean images. But in the era of The Return of the Jedi, maybe audiences didn’t respond well to static cleanliness in space movies. After director Al Reinart’s re-edit, the documentary was released in 1989 as For All Mankind. The backstory inspires less interest than the soundtrack itself, which excels at simulating a visual experience from the sparsest means: Call it Another Gravity-Free World. Long a favorite among Enophiles, Apollo: Atmospheres and Soundtracks gets a sparkling remaster and almost an album’s worth of okay-to-pretty-good new tracks. Listeners familiar with consistent royalty generators like “Deep Blue Day” (used to beatific effect in 1996’s Trainspotting) will note the bell-like clarity of these souped-up versions, the better to savor the tension between Eno’s occasional dissonance and Lanois’ penchant for gauze, especially on the friendlier second half. “The idea was to try and make a frontier space music of some kind,” Eno said in a 1998 interview. “When I was asked to do the music for the film, I discovered that the astronauts were each allowed to take a cassette with them on those missions, and they nearly all took country and western songs. I thought it was a fabulous idea that people were out in space, playing this music which really belongs to another frontier—in a way, seeing themselves as cowboys.” Tickled by the protean sampling possibilities of new synthesizer technology, the Enos and Lanois constructed a suite of tracks that approximate Duane Eddy on Mars (there’s another possible album title). This is the album’s real innovation, still under-discussed. Ambient music is called many things, but “cornball” isn’t one of them; the way the guitar twang on “Always Returning” schlocks up the pretty ripples of Eno’s keyboards and the purr of tape manipulations should have produced three dozen offspring by now. (Imagining the electric piano on “Weightless” anchoring a Jack Wagner hit is not out of bounds.) Lanois stars on “Silver Morning,” the ur-text for the well-behaved producer-goes-singer exertions of 1989’s Acadie. “Deep Blue Day” has earned its rep as Eno’s most recognized instrumental thanks to the turquoise density of the synths and the warmth of Lanois’ pedal-steel playing; it’s emphatic¸ unlike other Eno ambient recordings, like 1975’s Discreet Music and 1992’s The Shutov Assembly. When Eno goes on his own solo exploratory missions the results are predictably immersive. Ominous gurgles turn “Matte” into a quiet nightmare: trapped in an oil drum at the bottom of the Pacific. On other tracks he gives Lanois a heads-up on future arrangement ideas—Peter Gabriel, whom Lanois would produce a couple years later, might have concluded after listening to the prominent bass and faint, stately wash of organ on “Stars” that they’d do nicely for “Mercy Street,” 1986’s So mediation on poet Anne Sexton. Credit Eno’s discovery of the Yamaha CS80, one of the first polyphonic synthesizers; it formed, according to Lanois in a 2012 interview about the album, “an essential part of the work we did together.” The new tracks don’t sully the original recordings so much as recontextualize them in sometimes rather garish ways. The gleam of the synthesized chords on “Like I Was a Spectator” doesn’t summon outer space; it summons boutique hotel elevator music, which might be the idea. Perhaps that’s as it should be. As the excitement about manned space missions—a consequence of Cold War politics intersecting with Great Society notions about what the federal government could fund—has waned in the last 35 years, Apollo’s clear lines and our memories of, say, National Geographic back issues with photos of the moon’s surface fuse into a nostalgia of the mildest evocatory power. The following year Eno and Lanois would produce U2’s The Unforgettable Fire, an album on which anthems, Eurodisco, and modest, modish synth doodles rub against each other with nary a fuss. The Unforgettable Fire presents itself as a book of prayers; Apollo: Soundtracks and Atmospheres limns an eternity without a heaven.

Tiny Changes: A Celebration of Frightened Rabbit’s ‘The Midnight Organ Fight’,Various Artists,by: Joshua Copperman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d28fb397953c00009b97a6d/1:1/w_160/VariousArtists_TInyChanges.jpg,2019-07-20 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-tiny-changes-a-celebration-of-frightened-rabbits-the-midnight-organ-fight/,Atlantic,"Tiny Changes was not meant to be a posthumous tribute album. Completed before Frightened Rabbit’s Scott Hutchison took his own life in May 2018, the compilation was intended as a celebration of the band’s 2008 album The Midnight Organ Fight, not a eulogy for its primary songwriter. As a result, the compilation (which shares its name with a tribute concert and a mental health charity; a portion of proceeds will support the latter) feels oddly low-stakes. No one among this collection of old friends and more recent fans thought they would have to honor a legacy when they recorded these covers, and the relative lack of pressure allowed for a relaxed, occasionally unconventional approach. Covering Organ Fight, a breakup album with the sort of insight that arises only from uncomfortably intimate storytelling, would be challenging under any circumstances. Hearing these intensely personal songs sung by others was always going to be jarring; anything too similar would pale in comparison. The weakest songs on the compilation are those that do the least: Mid-2000s Sub Pop signees Oxford Collapse, who reunited for the occasion, deliver a near-exact recreation of “I Feel Better,” while the off-key vocals and piercing cymbals of Right on Dynamite’s “Fast Blood” resemble an unpolished demo rather than a fresh take. While not soulless, these versions fall short of the originals’ force. The riskier these covers get, the better they demonstrate what made Frightened Rabbit’s music compelling. Josh Ritter’s goofy bluegrass “Old Old Fashioned” recognizes that Hutchison’s charm was just as significant as his more harrowing material. The Philistines Jr., the band of Organ Fight producer Peter Katis, clash cheap-sounding synths against heavy snares and processed acoustic guitars on “Bright Pink Bookmark,” connecting Frightened Rabbit’s roots with the polish that defined their later studio output. Meanwhile, the prolific Canadian group Wintersleep’s version of “The Twist” is quirkier and denser than the original, but holds its own with beefier drums and a plainspoken but affecting performance from frontman Paul Murphy. Not every reinvention works; Ben Gibbard’s “Keep Yourself Warm” is too soft-spoken to carry the blunt titular line (“It takes more than fucking someone you don’t know...”), and if Gibbard eventually conjures a beauty of his own, it can’t match the catharsis of the original. Scottish rockers Biffy Clyro’s entertainingly frantic take on album opener “The Modern Leper” ultimately overflows with too many ideas to register. Julien Baker’s version of the same song works much better, her voice wringing out the desperation beneath the gallows humor and bombast. According to the band, who approved all these covers early last year, Baker’s contribution was Hutchison’s personal favorite. Out of everyone, Baker best captures the specific kind of deep depression that Hutchison was known for articulating. Had an album like this been recorded after his death, it’s hard to imagine that anyone would want to cover “Floating in the Forth,” with its eery foreshadowing lyrics and the grim new context of the closing line, “I’ll think I’ll save suicide for another year.” The Twilight Sad are virtually the only band that could, given the close friendship between Hutchison and frontman James Graham. Their claustrophobic version renders the melody nearly unrecognizable, but not the emotion; Graham repeats that last line until it starts to feel as hopeful as it once did. The timing alone makes Tiny Changes a difficult listen, a last glimpse of when fans and musicians could celebrate Frightened Rabbit without the complication of tragedy. It’s far from a perfect set of guests or covers, but it wasn’t supposed to be. A different kind of tribute, less focused on the band’s longtime supporters, might have featured newer musicians inspired by Hutchison; it might have illustrated his band’s influence and introduced their cult following to a younger generation. But those involved in Tiny Changes had no intention of looking to the future—they were merely celebrating how far they had all come.

Brandon Banks,Maxo Kream,by: Stephen Kearse,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d0796c7b6e2e3a51ec9d597/1:1/w_160/Maxo-Kream.jpg,2019-07-19 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/maxo-kream-brandon-banks/,Big Persona88 ClassicRCA,"In a cheeky promo video released on Father’s Day, Maxo Kream’s dad explains the origin of his moniker Brandon Banks. “People could not pronounce Emekwanem,” he says, “I spent 18 hours a day explaining my name...so I changed it to Brandon Banks.” In this telling, which Emekwanem delivers with a jolly charisma, the handle is born from a comedy of errors: his name was hard on American ears, so Emekwanem made it easier. It turns out that’s the Disney version. In reality, Brandon Banks was Emekwanem’s criminal alias. Maxo knew Banks as the scammer whose grifts enriched and endangered his family in equal measure, and whose jail bids sowed the seeds for Maxo to later embrace street life. Sordid family history has long been the source of Maxo’s most resonant storytelling, and on Brandon Banks it becomes a superpower. As Maxo details the trials of his family, he’s energized by the parallels of their struggles, his bonds deepening as he claims his place within this complicated lineage. Maxo’s father serves as both a muse and foil, popping up throughout the record as both a character and a presence. Mirroring the album cover, a collage of their faces, Maxo builds stories around their points of overlap and distinction. His father’s scams aren’t laid out in detail, but their effects are felt in Maxo’s ties to street and gang life. “Bissonnet” breaks down the relationship between Emekwanem’s capers and Maxo’s thugging into direct cause-and-effect: “Police kicking in my door/Threw my mama on the floor/HPD took my pops/I bought a heat, hit the block.” When Maxo later gets kicked out by his mom, it feels like he’s following his dad’s lead. His dad shapes his thoughts in “Meet Again” as well. Written in the style of Nas’ “One Love” and interpolating Ice Cube’s “Steady Mobbin,’” the song is a letter to an imprisoned friend who has become a member of Maxo’s extended family in his father’s absence. Maxo addresses him as a brother: “Let me tell you ’bout your daughter/Yesterday she tried to walk/Everyday she getting smarter/Other day she tried to talk,” Maxo raps like a proud uncle. Because his dad and brother have been imprisoned before, he knows exactly what to write to keep his homie’s spirits up. As he moves from neighborhood gossip to personal news to lawyer updates, his casualness feels practiced. It’s touching and bleak. What prevents the record from becoming weepy and drab is Maxo’s pervasive sense of pride in himself and in his rapping. He has a dark sense of humor and a wry charm that, combined with his choppy flow and gruff voice, give his music a buoyancy. “Drizzy Draco” is a showy fusillade of gun bars that's as much about wordplay as always standing his ground. “Spice Ln.,” named after a street in his hometown of Alief, details capers with various levels of success, from a burglary in which the victim texts the robbers that they missed the money in the attic to a drug boost in which the victim later buys the drugs back. There are deaths on all sides and the gains are always meager, yet Maxo cherishes his life in full, the ups and the downs, the danger and the absurdity. On the record’s best songs, the action is the prelude to soul-searching. “8 Figures” is frank about the slipperiness of fast money, but then explodes into flexes. Maxo knows the smarter route, but he can’t deny that it just feels better to spend money than to save it. “Dairy Ashford Bastard,” another ode to an Alief street, is a tribute to and castigation of his dad. Pulling no punches, Maxo claims that Emekwanem was a cheater and domestic abuser in addition to being a convict. In the context of Emekwanem’s goofy interludes throughout the album, this revelation can feel like a reversal, but Maxo yokes these failures to his dad’s strengths, detailing his father’s overall commitment to his family and to Maxo. “I’m glad you spanked my ass/I’m glad that you my dad/And I’m thankful for yo ass,” he says with sincerity. The forgiveness Maxo offers his dad might feel overly generous or one-sided, given the omission of his mom’s perspective, but Maxo preaches loyalty as the bedrock of all relationships, so loving his dad is a matter of principle. While that sentiment sinks the Tupac-inspired “Brenda,” which feels like a rap adaptation of the Moynihan Report, the larger takeaway is that Maxo sees himself in Emekwanem (who he’s actually named after) and in his many real and adopted brothers. Like Punken before it, Brandon Banks is a major leap in craft and style as well as refinement of his self-image. As Maxo takes stock of the varied fates of his extended family he sees his own life with greater clarity.","Sordid family history has long been the source of the Houston rapper’s most resonant storytelling. His latest project is such a major leap in craft and style, it becomes a superpower.

Next to the Sun,KAINA,by: Peyton Thomas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d28f0b9c570c90008a99cac/1:1/w_160/kaina_nexttothesun.jpg,2019-07-19 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kaina-next-to-the-sun/,Sooper,"On Pennsylvania Avenue, a few blocks west of the Capitol building, the Newseum hosts a permanent exhibit of five hundred years of front pages, from a 1603 broadsheet commemorating the coronation of James I to the present day’s headlines. Some weeks ago after the election of Donald Trump, a devastated friend and I made our way through that cavernous, low-lit corridor, our fingers tracing centuries of calamity pressed into newsprint and shielded behind glass. At the end of our walk, after all that disease and death and disaster, I felt a burden lift. There was something perversely soothing in this irrefutable reminder that the road behind us had been no less difficult than the road ahead of us would surely be. The rising Chicago pop artist KAINA writes with this notion in mind, placing her day-to-day struggles in a long tradition of lamentation, bigger than today and bigger, even, than Trump. Her striking lyrics take aim at present-day bigots who clamor for closed borders—“Look how these brown hands cook all your meals/But mama says you want us all to disappear”—but she’s more concerned with the persistence of this foundational hatred, and with the people she loves, who have thrived “through so many moons” and continue to thrive in spite of racist brutality. The album’s title—along with the sugary expanse of cotton-candy clouds on its cover—makes for a clever bit of misdirection. KAINA spends the better part of “Next to the Sun” interrogating hollow maxims of self-care and searching, instead, for the roots of her community’s resilience. Often, this means flipping an oft-used lyrical symbol into something surprising, even shocking. The sun of the title track is a stand-in for a self-destructive impulse, and KAINA casts herself as Icarus: “Wanna feel it all/The burn and the lesson, the fall.” When she sings the word “bed,” on “Ghost” and “Could Be A Curse,” she calls to mind Tracey Emin’s depressive episodes and disheveled sheets, the furthest thing from standard pop eroticism. “What’s a Girl” is an even more impressive feat, with KAINA flipping empty, you-go-girl affirmation into a scathing indictment of the impossible expectations to which women of color are held. “What is a girl without ambition? ...What is a soul without the fight?” she sings, even after wearily lamenting that “the fight… never stops.” When the personal is political, it is all too easy for one’s very being to become a battleground. KAINA insists that her strength shouldn’t be measured by her capacity to suffer without flinching, but in her ability to heal, assisted by the people she loves. It is KAINA’s new understanding of the deep reserves of love within her and in the people around her that closes the record, on the joyous, gorgeous “Green.” Here, she understands love as something irreducible, irrefutable: “Sky could be blue as can be/Grass could be green, green, too/And my love the same, same as them/They’re facts, it’s true.” After an album’s worth of ruminating on isolation, fatigue, and disconnection, “Green” arrives as a hard-won and genuine celebration. KAINA is helped to this realization by a couple of supportive guests: an adorable young relative, on “Joei’s Secret,” who urges her to ignore fuckboys and focus instead on “drawing, or education,” and close collaborator Sen Morimoto, who reaches through the fog on “Could Be A Curse” and comforts her: “You are not the sum of your fears… Just try to sleep.” This lyrical journey finds a sophisticated mirror in the music. On opening track “House,” the arrangement isn’t so much deconstructed as destroyed; strings and synths ring out in soft, distorted loops, a scrap of a horn riff shatters before it’s even begun, and KAINA’s voice reaches unsteadily through the wreckage. Over the course of the album, sounds slowly cohere until “Green” arrives, an intricate, indomitable piece of Latin jazz. The early songs are no less beautiful for their brokenness, but KAINA’s mission is to reach for more sound, more color, more people to hold in one’s heart. “You like to keep this place empty,” she sings, on “House,” against a spare soundscape. “There’s room for plenty.” (Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)","The daring Chicago pop artist explores resilience and hard-won triumphs against a backdrop of hatred and brutality.

Pity Boy,Mal Blum,by: Abby Jones,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf836a67fd40d6328dba9ef/1:1/w_160/MalBlum_PityBoy.jpg,2019-07-19 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mal-blum-pity-boy/,Don Giovanni,"Saying “no” isn’t particularly fun for anyone—especially for New York singer-songwriter Mal Blum. So, in order to practice, they turned it into a song. On the defiant power-pop single “I Don’t Want To,” they practice the art of brazen rejection with a smile: “I don’t want to/So I won’t...at least not now,” they put it plainly. Much of Pity Boy presents a similar tongue-in-cheek catharsis, as Blum laces endearing humor into sorrowful subjects, resulting in the most personal work of their career. Blum’s early music, such as 2010’s self-released Every Time You Go Somewhere, was mostly acoustic folk, embellished with violin, harmonica, and even toy piano; they’ve now moved into potent pop-punk. If the electric guitar had evolved into a supporting actor by Blum’s last album, 2016’s You Look a Lot Like Me, then it’s the lead on Pity Boy—complete with mixing by Hop Along guitarist Joe Reinhart. The nimble, vigorous riffs here call to mind Titus Andronicus (who Blum will support on tour this fall), ricocheting like rubber balls around “I Don’t Want To” and “Not My Job” with Blum’s vocals surging in countermelody. Fierce solos slice through “Odds” and “Gotta Go,” offering stark contrast to the toned-down strums of slow burners like “Salt Flats” and “Black Coffee.” If there are any weak points in Pity Boy, they come when Blum’s voice strains, but their lyrics—the album’s centerpiece—mitigate that weakness. Blum’s words often divulge unsettling self-deprecation: “All that I want is for someone to take advantage of me/Because I don’t know any other way,” “I even hate the way I breathe,” “27 is 11/Just on different meds.” “Not My Job” offers a brief moment of aplomb: “If I have to, I’ll kill off my better self/Because it’s not my job to make you well,” they sing, reiterating the final words as if to assure themself, too. Blum has been openly queer for as long as they’ve been putting out music, but Pity Boy is the most candid they’ve ever been about their sexuality and identity in their music. Here, they poignantly speak on their transgender experience, spelling it out on album opener “Things Still Left to Say”: “You don’t see me when I’m here/I’m like a ghost of myself already/If I could, I would disappear/But I’m still here,” they sing. “See Me” internalizes those sentiments, acting more as a soliloquy: “I don’t belong/Though it helps to play along/Why can’t they see me when I’m right here?” Both songs refer to Blum being non-binary, but the lyrics remain just equivocal enough to spark empathy in anyone who has felt alienated. While platitudes like “I don’t belong” can feel like “Creep” regurgitations, Blum envelops the phrase in a multi-dimensional earnestness, as the repeated use of “I’m here” delivers a steadfast assertion: despite Blum feeling they don’t quite fit in, they have every right to stick around. “You’re direct/One day, I hope that I can be like that,” goes a line in “I Don’t Want To.” That day is much closer than Blum realizes.

Emperor Tomato Ketchup,Stereolab,by: Jesse Dorris,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d07c766f44363924abcbe95/1:1/w_160/Stereolab_EmperorTomatoKetchup.jpg,2019-07-18 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/stereolab-emperor-tomato-ketchup/,Duophonic,"Shuji Terayama’s 1971 film Tomato Kecchappu Kôtei was an abject and poetic satire of utopianism, a kind of Lord of the Flies meets Pier Paolo Pasolini’s Saló, in which children enslave their parents and create new world order of ritualized sex and violence. It begins with a perhaps tongue-in-cheek quote attributed to Karl Marx, a rough translation of which would be: “A focus on accumulating pleasure, not wealth, will bring capitalism down.” By the time Stereolab took the title of the film for their 1996 album, they’d accumulated an astonishing amount of pleasure, if not wealth. While lyricist Lætitia Sadier was more of a socialist than a Marxist, the earworms like “Ping Pong” and “Peng! 33” she and polymath guitarist Tim Gane cultivated were philosophical tracts as pop tracks, deconstructing economics with pithy verse-chorus-verse structures. Since forming in 1991, Stereolab had stocked shelves with three albums, two compilations, two mini-albums, eight EPs, and thirteen singles, each beautifully packaged, uniformly excellent, and on offer in various limited editions of colored vinyl. Were the lyrics critiquing their own delivery system? Was the medium the message? Emperor Tomato Ketchup is a close as the Lab would ever get to a definitive answer. It documents a premillennial moment in which people—jazzbos in Chicago and red mods doing the Mashed Potato in Washington, D.C., riot grrrls in the Northwest, bass cadets in Sheffield, and the chic set in Paris and the retro-futurists in Birmingham, and especially crate-diggers in Tokyo and London and New York—wondered if record collecting and community organizing might be the same thing. Yes and no, Stereolab replies. They made dialectics you can dance to, and that was revolution enough. While their previous work explored motorik’s horizontal momentum and the aspirational levitation of exotica, ETK was something different. Like Talking Heads’ Remain in Light or LCD Soundsystem’s self-titled debut or Erykah Badu’s New Amerykah Part One: 4th World War, the album consolidated international movements into people-pleasing new forms of funk. Its 13 tracks matched polyrhythms to political slogans with results as electrifying as the needle-on-the-record/tornado-on-the-horizon cover art the Groop nicked from a 1964 Béla Bartók LP cover. That’s not all they nicked. Opener “Metronomic Underground” utilizes bits of Gil Scott-Heron’s “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised” and Yoko Ono’s “Mindtrain” and Don Cherry’s “Mali Doussn’Gouni” for a jam that morphs from amiable to anxious. Live, the track became a roiling headfuck of an epic that panned around the stage’s P.A. as it doubled or tripled its recorded size. “We have about five organs lying around, all plugged in and ready to go,” Tim Gane told the LA Times when the album came out, and on “Metronomic,” they all seemed to gurgle and bubble and scream at once. Singer-guitarist Mary Hansen chants “Crazy/Sturdy/A torpedo” and Sadier intones, “Untie the tangles to be vacuous, to be infinite.” The song proved that having access to everything only works if you can get it into the groove, and that marching can be dancing if you do it right. And vice versa: First single “Cybele’s Reverie” is named for an Anatolian goddess who inspired self-castrating male devotees to hold ecstatic raves in her honor. But this reverie isn’t much of a crowd-mover; instead, it’s wistful, like a breeze over ruins with string arrangements courtesy of new Lab technician Sean O’Hagan. “What to do when we have done everything/All read, all drunk, all eaten…when we shouted on all roofs,” Sadier asks in French. Go back to the start, Hansen suggests, her pre-verbal “ba-da-bas” and “oooohs” a kind of onomatopoeic palliative. For every rebuke of Western imperialism (“What’s society built on?” earning the chanted answer, “Blood!”), there are more personal confrontations. “Percolator” starts out urbane but quickly goes ballistic, its sophisticated point-counterpoint of organ and bass spiraling into squall as Sadier insists, “I’m very scared, that’s for sure.” Her reputation for hauteur is completely demolished by “The Noise of Carpet,” a Farfisa-driven takedown of sad-sack cynics. “I hate your state of hopelessness,” she snarls, “and that vain articulateness/You’re a loser-type wreck wannabe.” Two women, Sadier and Hanson, exorcise self-doubt with such panache in styles that alternate between egging each other on, singing different songs together, and rounding verses like ancient madrigals. Sometimes keyboardist Morgan Lhote would join in along while the rest of the band, including a rhythm section for the ages in bassist Duncan Brown and drummer Andy Ramsay. The unit kept things moving beneath the stereo-separated guitar strums mortared together by warm organ drones, the amalgamations of electro and lovers rock, the splashes of LaBelle and Reich. This pluralism-in-practice was the point: liner notes list all the instruments used, then all the people who played them, singling out only special guests like Tortoise’s John McEntire, who co-produced and played the vibraphone on a few songs as if, should you have a unique talent or two, you might be invited next. “You and me are molded by some things well beyond our acknowledgment,” Sadier sings on the closing “Anonymous Collective,” again and again, her register ascending beyond rocky waves of bass and bells and tumbles of drums. For a band sometimes dismissed as merely the sum of their influences, pilfered “record-collector rock,” the album that proved they could do anything ends by offering a new way forward. It’s an invocation that honors the definitional power of pleasure yet insists on its mystery. Shuji Terayama’s tiny fascists in Tomato Kecchappu Kôtei might have fallen victim to their self-indulgence, but Stereolab had higher hopes. Pleasure might not bring capitalism down, but it can definitely lift us up.","Today on Pitchfork, we are publishing new reviews of five important early Stereolab records, each one a rung on the ladder of one of the most exceptional and historically influential bands.

Mars Audiac Quintet,Stereolab,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d07c429b6e2e3c4e4c9d59d/1:1/w_160/Stereolab_MarsAudiacQuintet.jpg,2019-07-18 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/stereolab-mars-audiac-quintet/,Duophonic,"The sound is a long straight desert road. It’s a nursery rhyme that can bench press a city bus. It is a hundred-gallon jar of honey, a diamond-tipped jackhammer, a mouthful of pyrite Pop Rocks. Stereolab’s early records had toyed with all sorts of humble stuff—jangling guitars and poky home organs, French yé-yé and 1960s kitsch—but on 1994’s Mars Audiac Quintet, they achieved something closer to transubstantiation, converting familiar materials into something sublime. What’s funny is that on paper, at least, they had barely altered their formula. As they had since the beginning, Stereolab drew liberally from Neu!’s monochord chug and motorik pulse, Suicide’s coruscating Farfisa buzz, and the Velvet Underground’s holy modal drone, topping it all with sweet, sing-song vocal harmonies descended straight from ’60s bubblegum pop. But on Mars Audiac Quintet, those materials came together in a synesthete’s dream, a perfect merger of color and heft—a sound so chunky, so tangible, you could practically feel it in the palm of your hand. Stereolab—the brain trust of Tim Gane and Laetitia Sadier, surrounded by a fluctuating cast of collaborators (on Mars Audiac Quintet, they were actually a sextet assisted by a handful of studio musicians)—had surfed into the popular consciousness atop the easy-listening revival’s cresting wave. Their first few EPs and debut LP, Peng!, infused overdriven indie pop with mid-century camp and moon-shot optimism; by 1996’s John McEntire-produced Emperor Tomato Ketchup, they would begin pushing into new frontiers, twisting their sound into odd time signatures and exploring increasingly intricate arrangements. Dots and Loops, widely considered their masterpiece, is the pinnacle of their mature phase; when most people think of Stereolab, that record’s kinks and quirks are probably what first come to mind. Mars Audiac Quintet marked the end of their early years, the triumphant capstone to the run of albums stretching through Peng!, the singles comp Switched On, and Transient Random-Noise Bursts With Announcements. Mars Audiac Quintet is the hardest-rocking music Stereolab ever set to tape; it is the closest they ever came to replicating the jet-engine roar of their live shows. It is also their most hypnotic record, and there is no contradiction in that. Like Neu! and the Velvets before them, Stereolab taught a new generation the power of hammering away at the same chord until sparks flew and stones bled. “We’re about repetition, a riff, a chord, two or three notes going round and round,” Gane told Melody Maker in 1991. The goal, said Sadier, was “the trance.” On Mars Audiac Quintet, they drop straight into it, like a hypnotist snapping his fingers; the zone-out is practically instantaneous. “Three-Dee Melodie” is just three chords, one-note bassline, and methodical drumbeat; the voices of Sadier and Mary Hansen—the group’s second vocalist from 1992 until 2002, when she was killed cycling in London—circle each other in graceful counterpoint. Yet within those tight quarters, something like infinity opens up. Stereolab had been playing with similar ideas for a while; on the Transient Random-Noise Bursts With Announcements centerpiece “Jenny Ondioline,” they had drawn out their trance-inducing churn into 18 minutes of cotton-candy oblivion. But there’s something newly enveloping about the sound of “Three-Dee Melodie,” and the rest of Mars Audiac Quintet, that stands apart. Those bright, buzzing organs and Moogs, with their endless stacks of overtones, loom like gleaming skyscrapers; Andy Ramsay’s drum fills map a labyrinthine path atop the linear groove, a succession of trap doors and detours that always lead back into that endless tunnel. The structure of the album is itself often maze-like; for all the captivating stasis of their most repetitive songs, they are also fond of sideways feints. The Neu!-inspired “Nihilist Assault Group” lays down four minutes of metronomic pulse and shimmer, stumbles across a false ending of gurgling oscillators, and then slips back into a groove that sounds nearly identical to the original—just ever so slightly different, as though you’d been abducted by aliens and deposited in an almost perfect simulation. Something similar happens on “Outer Accelerator,” another kraut-like standout, as the song abruptly fades into a wah-wah-streaked freakout jam unrelated to what preceded it, but complementary nonetheless. (Yo La Tengo fans may recognize the bassline here for its reappearance in Yo La Tengo’s “Moby Octopad”; given that the two bands toured together in 1995, it’s not hard to imagine that the latter song is an homage to the former.) In liner notes to Mars Audiac Quintet’s recent remasters, Gane says that the original idea for the album was for every track to have exactly the same, barely modulating three-chord shape—“actually a single chord with two finger movements on top”—though the idea ran out of steam after five songs. Still, they got plenty of mileage out of it. “Transona Five” lumbers like one of T. Rex’s glam-rock stompers, while the Steve Reich-inspired “Anamorphose” puts Sean O’Hagan’s horn arrangements to spellbinding use, spinning off counterpoint after counterpoint and conjuring the interlocking gears of a perpetual motion machine. Many of the album’s best songs—“Wow and Flutter,” “Anamorphose,” “Nihilist Assault Group,” “Outer Accelerator”—capture this sort of energy, stamping out recurring patterns with near-industrial precision. (Perhaps it’s not surprising that Gane was a Throbbing Gristle fan; rather than that group’s smokestacks and death camps, though, Stereolab’s Technicolor vision of heavy industry hews closer to the fanciful machinery of Willie Wonka’s chocolate factory.) What Stereolab held in common with their post-rock peers was the subversion of rock’s traditional hierarchies: The guitar is demoted from its usual lead role and relegated to texture and timekeeping; Moog and Farfisa ooze to the foreground, not so much hogging the spotlight as flooding the whole damn stage; the bass, pushed high in the mix, is less part of the rhythm section than a kind of thickening agent to hold it all together. Even Sadier’s lead vocals resist sounding like rock vocals. If the rock canon imagines its singers as heroic figures, their voices like torches leading bravely onward, Sadier refused to play that role; her high, cool voice is more like a light rising from within her bandmates’ protective exoskeleton, suffusing it all in soft glow. Twinned with Hansen’s often wordless la-di-das, her singing was frequently all but indecipherable. The liberties she took with phrasing (singing “Need to examine/Uncritical times,” she stressed the final syllable of “examine” and drew out a long “i” sound to rhyme with “time”) could leave listeners without a lyric sheet adrift. But her Marxist critique is as trenchant as ever on Mars Audiac Quintet, and every now and then a refrain will float to the surface (“We can’t avoid dying”), a lullaby to raise the hairs on your neck. In a voice about as threatening as strawberry milk, Sadier sings of military inscription, moral panics, censorship, autocracy; many of her songs seem even more timely now than they did then. “Transporte Sans Bouger” is a prescient look at the psychic damage wreaked by the internet, long before anyone had dreamed of social media; “Outer Accelerator” is directly applicable to the sorry state of representative democracy in 2019. And “Ping Pong” is as perfect a pop song about capitalism and the military-industrial complex that you will ever hear, with a refrain so catchy it can inspire the unlikeliest of singalongs: Bigger slump and bigger wars
And a smaller recovery
Huger slump and greater wars
And a shallower recovery A quarter-century later, Stereolab’s fatalistic protest music looks to have been remarkably on the nose. But what Mars Audiac Quintet offered was more important than a simple political program. It made good on the promise of alternative music in unusually physical terms, using repetition and volume as architectural tools to construct songs that doubled as a kind of refuge. The title “Transporte Sans Bouger” translates as “Traveling Without Moving,” and in the context of the song, it refers to the disquieting specter of telepresence, to a “sickness of the senses” where no one knows their neighbor and loneliness is a pandemic. You don’t need to be extremely online to feel the familiar force of that observation today, when there are millions more people online than in 1994. (In the crushing isolation sweepstakes, the people of the Bill Clinton/John Major years had it relatively easy.) But Stereolab’s first landmark album facilitates another kind of traveling without moving: a whirlwind sound that could—and still can, and does—wrap you up and carry you away.

Transient Random-Noise Bursts With Announcements,Stereolab,by: Josephine Livingstone,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d07c133f6056096454d3b63/1:1/w_160/Stereolab_TransientRandomNoiseBursts.jpg,2019-07-18 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/stereolab-transient-random-noise-bursts-with-announcements/,Duophonic,"A locked groove is that empty loop your needle gets trapped in when you leave a record on the turntable after the music has finished. Technically the record is still playing, but it’s only producing a soft, rhythmic hissing. It’s noise, but for many music lovers, the noise comes with a feeling and a history. A distinctly Stereolab flourish was to sample that repetitive hiss on “Lock-Groove Lullaby,” the last song on their second studio album, 1993’s Transient Random-Noise Bursts With Announcements. The idea of finding romance in an incidental machine sound is Stereolab in a nutshell: As postmodern recyclers of 1960s kitsch and analog sound effects, they were never ones to let the standard definition of musicality limit their quest to invent a new and idiosyncratic kind of pop music. Stereolab was formed in 1990 by British guitarist Tim Gane (formerly of McCarthy) and French singer Lætitia Sadier, and the band’s numbers fluctuated over the years—notably, when they gained backup singer Mary Hansen in 1992 (losing her 10 years later to a cycling accident), added drummer Andy Ramsay in 1993, and gigged and recorded with master arranger Sean O’Hagan, of the High Llamas. In 1993, they were hitting their stride, still a little mired in the heavy guitar of their early material (the 1991 EP Super-Electric is essentially indie rock) but veering toward more esoteric pastures. A series of discoveries in electronic equipment launched Gane in new compositional directions: In particular, there was a secondhand Farfisa Bravo organ bought cheap and only really suitable for two-note drones. Over the course of their long run of great studio albums, from 1992’s Peng! to 2010’s Not Music, the founding Gane-Sadier dyad (a longtime couple, though they eventually split) gradually forged a sound both unmistakable and extremely difficult to describe. Some things are ineffable: How would you describe the sound of a locked groove to somebody who has never seen an LP? Memory is as much an instrument for Stereolab as the Moog. Using familiar reference points from the history of pop—lovely lounge melodies, old-timey grooves—Stereolab created a new model for what a song could be. Theirs have no real predetermined structure, apart from the fact that most (though not all) are under 10 minutes long. Instead of following the usual verse-chorus-verse shape, Stereolab songs are cyclical epics organized around musical phrases repeated so often they become incantatory. In this new form, the pleasant ambience of Muzak muddles with Sonic Youth-ish chugging guitar; nothing is new, but the combinations are unexpected. Transient Random-Noise Bursts is heavier than Stereolab’s later albums, low on the playful jangle of Emperor Tomato Ketchup and high on dark, persistent grooves. “Jenny Ondioline” and “Pack Yr Romantic Mind” are the album’s standout tracks, now classics. The former is a good encapsulation of that darker vibe: It’s dirge-like at first, with a roundabout of a hook and a steady mid-tempo thump. But Sadier’s melodic line elevates what would otherwise be odd guitar rock into something sweet and singsong. “Pack Yr Romantic Mind” is less fuzzy and more tuneful; two chief melodies, split between Sadier and a synth that sounds like her robot alter ego, achieve a rare fusion of funk and minimalism. The music is anchored by a handful of elements: Gane’s repetitive chords, synth drones, and electronic effects, unswerving motorik beats (the Neu! influence), and Sadier and Hansen’s vocals weaving prettily around it all like daisies in a hairdo. For the uninitiated, the resulting music is like nothing you’ve heard before, but also somehow something you’ve been listening to in your head your whole life. That’s partly down to the way nostalgia activates deep, animal parts of one’s brain, and partly due to Sadier’s gorgeous and often unintelligible singing. Cocteau Twins-style, she’s wont to put the stress on a strange part of a word, changing a phrase like “The greater is the beauty” into “Tha grade ari step you tee.” The effect is to break down language, turning syllables into noises and consonants into percussion, while her voice still disguises itself as yé-yé-style pop singing. You can clearly hear on Transient Noise-Bursts that Stereolab composed via a process of live improvisation, all their different elements becoming odd but easy bedfellows through practice. Because Gane provides such a solid foundation for his collaborators to extemporize around, their contributions feel natural, almost automatic or unconscious, as if everybody was playing with their eyes closed. It must be that pre-verbal vibe which makes Stereolab such an instinctive band. To me, “Pack Yr Romantic Mind” sounds exactly how it felt to sit in my teenage bedroom, deeply absorbed in some project as the time and space around me took on a repetitive looping aspect, old records playing in the background. Transient Random-Noise Bursts with Announcements is Stereolab at a slightly more serious pitch than some prefer, but that lends the album a sense of rigor and strength—still joyful and surprising, just lit by a different color.

Low Fi EP,Stereolab,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d07c588b25f86557a4f7859/1:1/w_160/Stereolab_LowFiEP.jpg,2019-07-18 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/stereolab-low-fi-ep/,Too Pure,"In Stereolab’s first few years they released an onslaught of material—singles, full-length LPs, a mini-LP, compilation tracks. It was one of those moments in music where a band is so creative and bursting with so many ideas there simply aren’t enough places to put them all. Being a record collector’s band, Stereolab decided to scoop up their copious non-LP material and compile it. They called the collections Switched On and issued three volumes of the series in the 1990s, each longer than the last. Almost all of their most significant early songs, no matter how obscure their initial issue, found their way to one onto one of these comps. But one release included with that initial rush has so far fallen through the cracks. The Low Fi EP, issued in September 1992, four months after Peng! and a month before the inaugural edition of Switched On, hasn’t been compiled nor is it, as of this writing, available on streaming services. But Low Fi contains 25 minutes of focused Stereolab brilliance, the distillation of the minimalist rock side of their early sound. For most of its runtime, Low Fi is a glorious streak of pure energy, leaving aside the exotica and motorik influences to focus on stomping rock’n’roll. Structurally, the first three songs, “Low Fi,” “(Varoom!),” and “Laisser-Faire,” are all homages to the Velvet Underground’s “Sister Ray,” each offering a variation on that song’s immortal two-chord chug. “The idea was a combination of naïve pop melodies melded with very simple rock minimalism,” Stereolab’s Tim Gane told TapeOp in 1998, discussing the band’s m.o. around the time of Low Fi. “Our innovation was to strip everything back.” The key to that sound here is how the guitar, Moog, and Farfisa organ become a single roaring instrument, one hell-bent on transforming electricity into noise. You can feel the voltage surging through every stretched chord, the rumble of the circuitry and the waveforms being pounded into new shapes. From their hi-fi test record of a band name on down, Stereolab positioned itself as a refinement of existing musical ideas, a collective devoted to bringing earlier sounds and styles into the present moment with the precision of scientists. The records were assembled deliberately, using complicated musical instruments that required a regular maintenance. So one part of the band’s image was as tinkerers, people in white coats working to perfect new formulations, somewhere away from the spotlight. Their kindred spirits were bands like Kraftwerk, laboring in Kling Klang for years, waiting for technology to catch up with their vision, or Kevin Shields, obsessing endlessly about the layering of guitar feedback. Stereolab were that focused on sound, but they were also moving fast, and they wanted to convey their findings to an audience as they discovered them. Low Fi shows that side of the group. Here, it doesn’t matter if every detail is in its right place; it’s about harnessing the noise and directing it even if you can never hope to tame it, the power of chaos over the power of knowledge. The opening title track is the most obvious VU nod, adapting the precise changes and tempo of “Sister Ray” (years after Jonathan Richman’s Modern Lovers borrowed it for “Roadrunner”). Floating over this thick and sticky harmonic edifice are two voices—founder Lætitia Sadier, and a newcomer, the Australia-born Mary Hansen, who would be an important part of Stereolab’s sound until her tragic death in 2002. On “Low Fi,” the fundamental ugliness of the distorted chords is thrown into sharp relief by the clear, uninflected beauty of Hansen and Saider’s vocals, as they trill wordless “la-la-la” in unison, like mischievous sisters who share a secret. Sadier’s voice has an undercurrent of weight and seriousness—Nico was a frequent point of comparison in Stereolab’s early days—while Ramsey adds a note of lightness and warmth. They are yin and yang, and when they are heard together they reach a kind of perfection. The following “(Varoom!)” is another effortlessly catchy pop song, until it’s not: halfway through, it fades down and a delicious feedback drone emerges, the kind of dense, woozy churn of sound that seems to be collapsing and expanding simultaneously. The chords are a slight variation on those on “Low Fi”—there are still just two of them, but now they take up equal space, rocking back and forth like a seesaw or a nodding head. If Low Fi produced one Stereolab standard, it’s “Laisser-Faire,” a track that also exists in a brilliant version recorded at the BBC and collected on ABC Music. Once again there are only two chords, but now the pace is quicker, and Sadier’s vocals hover just above the guitars, touching down briefly with each vowel, while Hansen sounds far away, a memory of the song that unfolds at the same time as the experience of it. Though difficult to discern without a lyric sheet, the words outline a political struggle every bit as relevant in 2019 as it was in 1992: “History will only repeat itself once more/The Western world is going more and more right-wing/Yearning for some sort of protection, too scared to do anything.” Stereolab’s political agenda was outlined by Sadier in an interview with Chickfactor shortly after the release of Low Fi: “To create a disturbance is the best way we thought of to make people and ourselves think.” Arguably the definitive early Stereolab song, “Laisser-Faire” captures all their fusion-of-opposites glory—forceful and delicate, direct and allusive, nostalgic and future-looking, crude and multi-dimensional. Low Fi stands as a tribute to a moment when Stereolab’s cup runneth over, when the songs were coming faster than they knew what to do with them.","Today on Pitchfork, we are publishing new reviews of five important early Stereolab records, each one a rung on the ladder of one of the most exceptional and historically influential bands.

Peng!,Stereolab,by: Nina Corcoran,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d07bff2bb36149063350873/1:1/w_160/Stereolab_Peng.jpg,2019-07-18 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/stereolab-peng/,Too Pure,"Stereolab could never have imagined how experimental, or influential, they would become. When Lætitia Sadier joined her then-boyfriend Tim Gane in his British jangle-pop band McCarthy, the two melted insoluble genres, like 1950s jazz and 1970s krautrock, into a singular style. In McCarthy’s wake, they formed Stereolab—the name taken from a Vanguard Records sub-label—with Sadier on synthesizer and lead vocals, alternating between French and English; Gane on guitar, organ, and synth; Martin Kean on bass; Joe Dilworth on drums. A year later, Stereolab released two 10"" EPs and a 7""—Super 45, Super-Electric, and Stunning Debut Album—primarily on Duophonic, a boutique label they co-created with their manager. In 1992, after attention-grabbing Peel Sessions and in-store performances at Rough Trade, Stereolab released their debut full-length, Peng!, through Too Pure, an independent London label that was about to get its own big break the same year with PJ Harvey’s Dry. Peng! is a blueprint of what Stereolab would become: a band experimenting with 1960s pop harmonies, teethy guitars, and the borderless world of analog electronics. It’s an incomplete picture of the band—two key members, singer-guitarist Mary Hansen and drummer Andy Ramsay, had yet to join—but it has an immediate magic to it, like being there in the studio beside them before their career kicks off. It’s also the closest Stereolab come to being an indie-rock band. Their songwriting chops are there, but they haven’t yet discovered all the instruments and techniques that could, and would, eventually make their music so dazzling. It’s a guessing game of empty spaces as the Groop lay the foundation for what would come. With an eerie synth fade-in, Sadier beings her monotone singing. When the song, “Super Falling Star,” reaches its chorus, twinkling guitar cushions the two parts, establishing a moody, dreamlike first impression fit for a sci-fi film. Stereolab introduce their futuristic sound only to follow it with a string of more traditional indie-rock songs: “Orgiastic,” “Peng! 33,” and later “The Seeming and the Meaning.” All three chase a driving tempo with strummed guitar and peppy one-woman vocals. The songs are charming, straightforward, and just lo-fi enough to feel like gems waiting to be polished. (Perhaps it’s no surprise that Iron & Wine covered “Peng! 33.”) Over this indie-rock foundation stretches an unexpected shoegaze veneer. Fuzzy guitars take priority over sharp electronics, giving listeners a chance to imagine who Stereolab could have been if they followed in the footsteps of My Bloody Valentine or Swirlies. “Enivrez-vous” opens with an anthemic drum roll and buzzing guitar reverb. From afar, Sadier reads a Charles Baudelaire poem about getting drunk, creating a blurry airport-announcement effect. A similar blanket of warm guitar drives closer “Surrealchemist,” while field recordings and a thundering Farfisa organ storm its sprawling ending. Shoegaze’s blend of hooks and noise feeds directly into the group’s evolution as a self-described “high-concept pop group.” For a band that would eventually define itself as the cross-section of analog indie rock and experimental ’60s pop, Stereolab were, for a long period, tied to rigid beats and tight-knit motorik. On Peng!, they diverge from that metronomic timing to embrace flashes of imperfection. Gane breaks out a metallic, quickly strummed guitar solo on “You Little Shits” that misses several notes in its hurried movement. With the jazzy pop of “Perversion,” a Moog solo slowly wanders off beat, humming its way down its own path. In true Stereolab fashion, these moments just make their technological world sound more human. Stereolab claimed never to play live in the studio, yet Peng!’s strongest moments evoke jam sessions, whether it’s the slapdash blues rhythm on “Mellotron” or the manic guitar solo turned group noise session of “Stomach Worm.” The band had yet to discover the knack for sequencing that would make later albums feel like such cohesive statements. The mood shifts abruptly and frequently, forgoing segues or fadeouts. The gentle hypnosis of synth lullaby “K-stars” is awkwardly sandwiched between the record’s eponymous pop hit and a similarly exultant rock number. These jumps in mood and tone are ironic, given how often the band was criticized for its “one-note” sound. And while with Peng! they began sinking their teeth into the staples of their songwriting—minimalism and repetition—the album’s tendency to move in fits and starts undercuts the power those techniques would assume on later albums. Two years after its release, the band would release two studio albums, a mini-album, an anthology, four EPs, six 7"" singles, and six splits with bands like Unrest and Nurse With Wound. Vinyl obsessives, Stereolab refused to let songs to go to waste. “From the very beginning of Stereolab, the idea has been to release as many records as possible,” Gane once said. “I want it to be hit and run.” Peng! was a floodgate bursting open, revealing a range of subgenres and influences—organ-driven krautrock, low-key lounge pop, cinematic noise—they could build upon moving forward. Despite this spirit of limitless creativity, Stereolab didn’t feel comfortable promoting themselves unless asked. In early interviews, Sadier and Gane shuffle around as though unsure how to control the narrative of the band on camera. But on paper, they confidently toyed with expectations, choosing a 1969 Swiss political cartoon for their record sleeves and provocative song titles. Stereolab were still figuring out who and what they wanted to be. Peng! was a trial run for a decade of subverting expectations. They didn’t need promotion, their work said it all.

Angel’s Pulse,Blood Orange,by: Ann-Derrick Gaillot,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d22a42b332ba40008a6ee0e/1:1/w_160/Blood-Orange.jpg,2019-07-17 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/blood-orange-angels-pulse/,Domino,"Recording a perfect cassette mixtape from the radio requires careful tuning, commercial dodging, and the technical dexterity of leaping to your radio’s speaker to catch a beloved song midair. The playback of this now dated practice can be disarming by today’s standards, each song carrying the specific atmosphere of the room it was recorded in, songs cut off or captured in media res, wrenched from their contexts, an incohesive whole. On his new Blood Orange release, Angel’s Pulse, British singer, songwriter, producer, and composer Dev Hynes returns to the snapshot aesthetics of the cassette mixtape age, presenting his sketchbook as the product itself. On previous albums, Hynes used the disarming, suggestive power of abrupt transitions to join together contrasting musical textures and moods. But while 2016’s Freetown Sound and 2018’s Negro Swan are cinematic both in their production and overarching themes, Angel’s Pulse, Blood Orange’s shortest collection of songs, feels like scanning radio stations in a lovingly nostalgic memory straight from the ’90s and early ’00s. The synth and drum machine-driven minimalism of “Baby Florence (Figure)” juts up against gauzy low-fi Southern hip-hop track “Gold Teeth” featuring Memphis legends Project Pat and Gangsta Boo. Low-key dance song “Dark and Handsome” featuring Toro Y Moi, turns chopped and screwed before giving way to the ’80s pop-tinted “Benzo.” There’s a joyful lightness to it all, helped in part by the fact Angel’s Pulse comes less than a year after the heavy but bracing survey of black queer alienation on Negro Swan. In a statement about Angel’s Pulse, Hynes explained that he has a habit of collecting random songs and material from album recording sessions and giving them informally to friends and strangers, if he shares them at all. Angel’s Pulse, one of those collections that he instead chose to release widely, is an exercise in testing the weight labels, listeners, and artists in particular put on what they choose to share with the world. Is art only worthwhile when honed and ordered in service to a monumental statement or purpose? Hynes makes a convincing argument for the preciousness of fragments, one-offs, leftovers, and what they evoke when arrayed with care and passion. Angel’s Pulse shimmers like a soundtrack to a fun if slightly melancholy summer day, but the anxieties, insights, and political convictions that Hynes has explored on previous albums still shine through. Gospel snippet “Birmingham” featuring singers Kelsey Lu and Ian Isiah lifting their voices heavenward on a stirring verse and outro, seems to center a mother whose daughter died in the 1963 Birmingham church bombings, a white supremacist terrorist act that killed four black girls. Meanwhile, “Tuesday Feeling (Choose to Stay)” is a sultry R&B lament for someone sucked into a destructive lifestyle, circling a similar theme that runs through Freetown Sound with the haunting leitmotif, “You chose to fade away with him.” Though the tracks explore the reaches of Hynes’ musical influences, they are united by his belief in what builds his communities up and tears them down. Artistic intentions aren’t conceived in a vacuum but rather run through everything that the artist creates. Even in its moodboard looseness and nostalgia, Angel’s Pulse has all the charm and careful attention to detail of Blood Orange’s last two magnum opuses. Whereas most of the songs are precisely sliced to end before reaching silence, the last guitar strum on “Good for You” merges seamlessly with the sirens and revving sounds opening the following song, “Baby Florence (Figure).” Throughout, Hynes shows off his penchant for unexpected collaborations, pairing Isiah with electropop project Porches or Skye with producer Arca and BROCKHAMPTON’s Joba. Though it doesn’ carry a central message, the mixtape acts as a rare artifact that captures a particular place, time, and moment of wonder in the eyes of its creator.","Dev Hynes’ new mixtape feels light and loose, a pre-production sketchbook presented as a charmingly finished product with the help of several key guests.

III,Banks,by: Noah Yoo,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d28f737ea98e20008674875/1:1/w_160/Banks_III.jpg,2019-07-17 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/banks-iii/,Harvest,"In 2013, Jillian Banks emerged as a poster girl for brooding, twilight-hours pop. She made all the right moves for an artist working in the burgeoning “alternative R&B” space: She committed to a monochromatic aesthetic, linked up with trendy collaborators, and commissioned Hype Machine-ready remixes. It worked, to an extent. Following a stint opening for the Weeknd, Banks became a relatively well-known name. Yet despite impressive stream counts, even her biggest singles weren’t quite enough to push her over the edge. Her signature sound relied on cookie-cutter production and “indie-pop voice” that weren’t hard to find elsewhere. With her latest album, III, Banks seems eager to reestablish her footing and take greater creative risks. While she can’t always shake the anodyne songwriting that plagued her past work, it’s still her best album to date. Other than Banks herself, the most prominent presence on III is producer and Bon Iver collaborator BJ Burton, who produces or co-produces 10 of the album’s 13 tracks. He brings his unique bag of tricks—the Messina vocal harmonizer technique popularized on 22, A Million, the apocalyptic distortion that defined Low’s Double Negative. Paired with Banks’ voice, these strategies work wonders, and album opener “Till Now” sets the tone with liberal doses of both. A song like “Stroke” may lack lyrical finesse—“Say it’s hard to breathe inside my ocean/I give you the deep, but you’re still floating”—but flanked by Burton’s growling fuzz, Banks stands confident, smirking as waves of low-end crash around her. On its face, lead single “Gimme” is another haughty banger about unfulfilled lust. But where on past albums it may have sounded lifeless, Banks’ voice sears through “Gimme” like twisted metal. Hudson Mohawke’s speaker-busting drums and bass blasts undergird a syncopated synth line reminiscent of Justin Timberlake’s classic “My Love.” Ballad “Hawaiian Mazes” strikes a diaristic tone against a melancholy backdrop of piano and old-world string trills, courtesy of Frank Ocean musical director Buddy Ross. “Telling me why you left and then complain you’re alone and I don’t know why,” Banks cries at the song’s apex. Though her lyrics can be as stilted as ever (“I tried my best to follow, but you moving too fast on ya daddy long legs”), the stream-of-consciousness style works far better than more playlist-ready fare. When Banks does attempt the latter, she stumbles. The lone collaboration, “Look What You’re Doing to Me,” featuring Francis and the Lights, fails to extract a memorable melody from either party. “Alaska” half-heartedly pursues a pseudo-dancehall vibe that never finds its rhythm, while “If We Were Made of Water” tries to rebottle the quivering magic of “Warm Water,” Banks’ similarly aquatic 2013 breakout single. When she sings, “Maybe if you say it again, change some words around, maybe I’ll believe you then,” she’s also speaking on behalf of her listeners. The most interesting moments on III tap into life experiences beyond doomed relationships. On “The Fall,” a sharp-tongued critique of the music industry co-written with Miguel, Banks adopts the perspective of a record company bigwig and attacks herself viciously, painting a picture of gaslighting and sexualization that scans all too familiar. It’s not her best vocal performance—Banks can sound brittle through Auto-Tune, and rap-singing isn’t her forte—but it’s one of the only times we glimpse the real Jillian Banks, ostensibly the driving force behind all these songs. Seven years after her debut, III brings the overblown excitement around her career to an official close. With the death of that hype, she’s finally delivered a record that gives her room to expand.

K.R.I.T. IZ HERE,Big K.R.I.T.,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d274db2cb5eef0009648e83/1:1/w_160/BigKRIT_KritIzHere.jpg,2019-07-17 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/big-krit-krit-iz-here/,Multi AlumniBMG,"Big K.R.I.T. has never had much interest in beef or drama, but early on his new record, he drops what could be interpreted as a jab at one of the famous headliners he’s shared shows with over the years. “You on the radio,” he raps, “They came to see me ’cause I did it without a hit.” It’s a brag, of course, but it’s a bit of a self-own, too. Even after nearly a decade on the industry’s radar, K.R.I.T. still doesn’t have anything even close to a hit, and it’s increasingly hard to imagine he ever will. He’s still working at more or less the same ceiling he was nearly a decade ago when his 2010 breakout mixtape K.R.I.T Wuz Here made him a critical favorite and a potential next-big-thing that never quite was. That’s not to minimize what he has accomplished. Unlike Donnis or Charles Hamilton and the blog-rap era’s other flash-in-the-pans, K.R.I.T. was able to parlay his talent into a sustainable recording career. Has a following, and longevity isn’t anything to scoff at. And yet there’s a sense that he’s underperformed. After 10 full-lengths, K.R.I.T. is beginning to look like rap’s answer to Ty Segall: consistently good, rarely stop-the-presses great. Even when his projects impress on first listen, they can’t help but bleed together in the big picture. And so K.R.I.T.’s latest project K.R.I.T. Iz Here captures K.R.I.T. the same as he always is: perfectly likable, admirably sincere, predictably dependable and dependably predictable. The album is ostensibly a sequel to his 2010 breakout project, and the title’s nod to the past only underscores how little his core sound has changed since then. He’s still making music seeped in UGK worship, all soulful Southern country grooves, subwoofer-Shiatsuing bass, and Pimp C snarl. There’s literally a song called “Learned From Texas,” about all the moves he learned from DJ Screw and UGK, as if anybody who’s listened to more than 10 minutes of K.R.I.T.’s music could have possibly overlooked Houston’s influence on him. But unlike 2017’s 4Eva Is a Mighty Long Time, where K.R.I.T. barely even bothered acknowledging current trends, on K.R.I.T. Iz Here he tries branching out a bit, too. “I Been Waitin,” with its posh, nervy production, borrows liberally from Travis Scott’s art-house trap. Opener “K.R.I.T. Here” taps the jazzy joy of Chance the Rapper and Donnie Trumpet. The Rico Love feature “Obvious” rides the same wave of wistful Caribbean music as Drake’s “Controlla,” while the strip-club fantasia “Blue Flame Ballet” mirrors the freak-soul of Childish Gambino’s “Awaken, My Love!” There are shades of Migos in the triplet flows of the clubby trap cut “I Made,” and elements of Frank Ocean in the wistful closing stretch twofer of “High Beams” and “Life in the Sun.” All those songs are perfectly fine, because K.R.I.T. is almost incapable of making a song that’s anything less than perfectly fine. And yet maybe K.R.I.T. Iz Here might have been better off if K.R.I.T. had availed himself of a few swings and misses. On “Addiction,” a shameless and otherwise only so-so knockoff of Kanye West and Lil Pump’s “I Love It,” K.R.I.T. is joined by Lil Wayne, who drops one of those unexpectedly great verses that, even this far past his peak, he still delivers regularly enough that we should almost start expecting them. It’s funny and surprising, blasé yet vital. Wayne’s career, in many ways, has been the antithesis of K.R.I.T.’s.

what we say in private,Ada Lea,by: Margaret Farrell,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d238b5f82ada80008ddf805/1:1/w_160/AdaLea_WhatWeSayInPrivate.jpg,2019-07-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ada-lea-what-we-say-in-private/,Saddle Creek,"Sometimes loss calls for a personal rediscovery. When Alexandra Levy endured a recent breakup she used various creative outlets—painting, journaling, making music—in order to recall who she was before and redefine herself in the aftermath. As a result, the Montreal singer-songwriter came up with 10 songs that embody the tumultuous cycle of pain, anxiety, patience, and acceptance that accompanies major heartache. Her debut album as Ada Lea, what we say in private, is a peculiar vortex of intense emotion and experimental pop music. Ada Lea’s music is a fusion of solemn acoustic-guitar melodies, belligerent distortion, warped saxophone cries, spectral synthesizers, field recordings of birds and snowmobiles and airplanes, and volatile tempo fluctuations. At times her tendencies lead her toward the tempered earnestness of Wilco, while at others she taps into a raw fury evocative of PJ Harvey or Angel Olsen. Ada Lea creates a space for a vision of indie rock that’s both bright and moody, fiery and introspective. Ada Lea begins her chaotic ride with the unpredictable “mercury.” A thumping buzz fades in and out as a resolute electric guitar takes the reins. Then the tempo shifts, the buzz falls away, and we’re left with a solemn bass line that wobbles against Lea’s wispy vocals. Both the arrangement and her voice seesaw between aggression and sorrow. She begins to break down her relationship’s demise: “There is always one person who does love/Just a little more than the other.” Sometimes it feels like Ada Lea might be an untrustworthy narrator. Her lyrics are vivid and visceral yet sometimes unsure of themselves. In “the party,” she questions whether she recalls the moon’s color correctly and if she read the night’s tone accurately. “You have always followed the sun/And I the moon, or have I misremembered?” she asks meekly on the Big Thief-like “yanking the pearls off around my neck...” She displays unusual candor for someone whose self-understanding has been thrown off its axis: “I can’t help wondering if I tricked you into loving me.” Levy journaled furiously for 180 days after her relationship ended, and she uses those journal entries for inspiration throughout the album. “I want the days to hurry by without losing my mind,” she sings on “180 days.” An electric guitar pitter-patters restlessly as she awaits a time when things won’t hurt so much. Across its four minutes, a harp occasionally radiates from behind her, while a static-laced drum machine sounds like a hard drive rupturing. Like her emotions, the song comes in ripples of light and dark. Just as she laments on the edgy closer “easy,” healing isn’t automatic—it’s messy and inconsistent. Ada Lea’s unsettling moments are just as affecting as her quiet, intimate ones. “the party” is one of the album’s most muted songs; the sound of traffic imbues a warm fuzz. Then whirling, high-pitched synths descend upon the chorus, like a halo. Throughout what we say in private, Lea’s heartbreak, recovery, and struggle for self-awareness feel like a walk on a bumpy gravel path branching into numerous shadowy detours. Take “for real now (not pretend),” where Lea trades singing for spoken word. One moment she is telling herself it’s going to be a good day, and then she’s thirsting just to feel anything. These tonal and emotional shifts, as Ada Lea vacillates between timidity and aggression, are what make what we say in private so exciting. But it’s Levy’s willingness to wrestle with her own vulnerability that leads the album to its highest peaks.

No.6 Collaborations Project,Ed Sheeran,by: Rawiya Kameir,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d1cc75fda8a77000924ae9e/1:1/w_160/EdSheeran_No6CollaborationsProject.jpg,2019-07-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ed-sheeran-no6-collaborations-project/,Atlantic,"The rumors are confirmed: Ed Sheeran finally married his longtime girlfriend, Cherry Seaborn. In an interview with radio host Charlamagne tha God—really, an hour of small talk recorded at the studio of Sheeran’s countryside home in Suffolk and released alongside the album in lieu of any major press—Sheeran fills us in with blissful references to their life together. He’s ditched the good-natured, drunken shenanigans that once led to a scar on his cheek from the sword of an actual British royal in favor of nesting with the person he calls “his lady.” Please congratulate Ed Sheeran on his graduation to matrimony, to becoming an absolute wife guy. Therein lies the conceptual premise of the bulk of the guest-laden No. 6 Collaborations Project. There’s “I Don’t Care,” an early single featuring Justin Bieber and maybe the best effort on No.6, a vector of the dancehall-lite rhythms sounds Sheeran debuted on 2017’s “Shape of You.” Bieber, a fellow newlywed, shares in Sheeran’s swelling melodies and loving truisms: “I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah/All the bad things disappear.” Then there’s “Cross Me,” featuring Chance the Rapper and a hook fashioned out of a sample of PnB Rock’s 2017 XXL Freshman cypher, a well-meaning if slightly paternalistic ode to their respective partners. But the change in Sheeran’s marital status has not inspired a shift away from the chip on his shoulder: I’m not a cool guy, I’m a regular guy, is the subtext of his career thus far. No.6 opens with a heavy-handed, Khalid-assisted reminder that he is not one of the “beautiful people,” a catchy calculation appropriate for the sad-pop dominating the charts. “Antisocial,” featuring Travis Scott and his signature skittering drums, begins with a bizarre instruction: “All you cool people, you better leave now.” In an album defined mostly by banality, “South of the Border,” featuring Camila Cabello and Cardi B, is an actual bizarre moment. It’s a Latin-pop fantasy—Sheeran sings of someone’s “caramel thighs” and “curly hair”—punctuated by Cardi’s suggestion that “Ed got a little jungle fever.” Huh? Maybe unintentionally, the raceplay points directly to the elephant in the room: Though he built his fame on confessional, earnest acoustic guitar songs, Ed Sheeran loves black music, and he wants you to know it. Unfortunately, on No.6, that appreciation largely manifests as the belief that he is a competent rapper. On one song, “Take Me Back to London” featuring Stormzy, his flow bears a suspicious resemblance to “Bitch Better Have My Money”-era Rihanna. (Sheeran has settled plagiarism lawsuits on at least three occasions and will go to trial on a fourth this September.) There, and elsewhere, his raps are cringey and simplistic, with all of the subtlety of a plot-driven song written by Lin Manuel Miranda: “It's that time/Big Mike and Teddy are on grime/I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing/Because nobody thinks I write rhymes.” Being a fan of rap doesn’t mean you can rap. I would never delude myself into thinking I could run a kitchen just because I’ve spent years watching “Chopped.” Alongside 50 Cent and Eminem, both way past their prime as rappers, Sheeran sounds even more out of his depth on “Remember the Name”: “Yeah, I was born a misfit, grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich/Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence/I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick/‘Stick to singing, stop rappin’,’ like it's Christmas.” Those unnamed haters were right and No.6 confirms that Sheeran is better off sticking within his skillset. “Feels,” which ingeniously unites Young Thug and J Hus, and “Put It All On Me,” which offers Ella Mai a warm piano to shine over, are legitimately irresistible. In a 2014 Vibe cover story, in which a reporter witnessed him freestyle over beats including YG’s “My Nigga,” Sheeran was described as having a “hip-hop soul.” A couple years later, Stormzy, with whom Sheeran has something of a friendship, took it further. “Even with his rapping he can execute it well,” he told GQ. It didn’t quite come out of nowhere. In the early days, he’d experimented with what a collaborator describes as “singing rap.” And in 2011, after independently releasing a handful of EPs in the style of alt-folk-rock singer-songwriter forbearers like Jason Mraz, he convinced grime greats like Wiley and Jme to participate in his No.5 Collaborations Project album, after which No.6 is modeled. Over the years, he’s performed multiple Nina Simone covers, recorded a song in the Ghanaian language of Twi, and told Billboard that Justin Timberlake, unparalleled in the cultural phenomenon of “blue-eyed soul,” was “pretty close to a direct inspiration.” Nearly 8 years, 150 million albums sold, and dozens of arena-headlining tour dates after No.5, he’s employed a similar ethos but with the expanded budget and superstar access of his status as one of the world’s best-selling artists. Like the original compilation project, much of No 6. is as bad in theory as it is in practice. Pop music has drawn from black cultural expression since the dawn of its existence, becoming increasingly absorbent in recent years. As hip-hop and diasporic genres like Afropop, dancehall, and dembow have framed the dominant modalities of contemporary radio, inspiration and appropriation have become business moves as much as artistic choices. But few releases have been as baldly transparent and destined for ubiquity as No.6, which has all the conspicuous mining of a Drake album, but very little of the finesse or cultural fluency.","The pop star’s compilation features Cardi B, Chance the Rapper, and Stormzy in a sometimes nice but hopelessly transparent attempt at a hip-hop crossover.

Amplified Heart,Everything But the Girl,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d23811930462100099971b6/1:1/w_160/EverythingButTheGirl_AmplifiedHeart.jpg,2019-07-16 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/everything-but-the-girl-amplified-heart/,Buzzin' FlyChrysalis,"A phoenix rising from the ashes. “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” Pick a cliché we use to talk about resilience, and it can probably be applied to Everything But the Girl. The British duo’s career appeared dead in the water when Todd Terry’s club remix of “Missing,” the lead single from their 1994 album Amplified Heart, swept across American dancefloors, eventually carrying the song to No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100—their first U.S. top 10 single—and paving the way for their reinvention as trip-hop/drum’n’bass fusionists on 1996’s Walking Wounded, the most successful album of their career. No one expected Terry’s remix to take off the way it did—certainly not Everything But the Girl’s UK label, Blanco y Negro, which had summarily dropped them a few months before. Today, it’s ironic to think that the duo’s biggest hit was right around the corner, and some suit just couldn’t hear it. But at the time, Everything But the Girl had been twisting in the wind for a while, and perhaps it’s understandable that major-label A&Rs didn’t see the record’s potential, couldn’t fathom that pop music’s pendulum was finally swinging back toward the duo’s spare, pensive style, which never sounded more fully realized than on Amplified Heart. If Walking Wounded is remembered as Everything But the Girl’s miraculous, odds-beating comeback, Amplified Heart represents the first time they got a second chance. Tracey Thorn and Ben Watt had been making music together, their creative partnership inextricable from their romantic one, since 1982. Not only had they outlasted virtually all of their post-punk contemporaries, but they’d put out six albums and traversed nearly as many musical styles: bossa nova, jazz, jangle pop, orchestral soul-pop, adult contemporary. By the time they released 1991’s Worldwide, a too-smooth-for-its-own-good record that was met with total indifference, they were running on fumes. “In many ways it was absolutely invisible,” Thorn wrote of the album (not “a dreadful record, just a not-good-enough record”) in her memoir Bedsit Disco Queen. They were an ’80s band with ’70s ideals, and the wan Worldwide suggested they just weren’t made for the new decade. Worldwide came out in September 1991; a few months later, Watt’s health mysteriously began worsening. He was hospitalized for weeks, wasting away; doctors scratched their heads. Finally, they put him in a coma, opened him up, and discovered a rare disease, Churg-Strauss syndrome, ravaging his insides. Several times, he almost died. It’s not hard to detect signs of the experience carved into Amplified Heart. Written and recorded in the year following Watt’s recovery, the album presents a rare mix of austerity and optimism, fragility and determination. The very first notes of “Rollercoaster” signal a newfound sense of purpose: There’s an unusual eloquence to the call-and-response interplay between double bass and synth that opens the song. It’s not only a matter of tasteful restraint; Thorn and Watt had done that plenty of times before. Here, the way the two sounds twine around each other, gliding fretwork mirrored by the synthesizer’s G-funk legato, feels as perfect an expression of two lovers’ self-sufficiency as anything in their catalog. Across the record, virtually all of the fluff of their previous album—twinkling digital keys, flugelhorn and soprano-sax solos, reverb plusher than the seats of a luxury SUV—has been banished. The duo’s newfound minimalism came in part from Massive Attack, who, in the summer of 1993, had sent Thorn a cassette of demos for their second album and asked her to sing on them. But where the resulting “Protection” was foggy, skunky, stoned, Everything But the Girl’s approach to reduction sparkles. Pared down to guitar, standup bass, drum kit, and the occasional programmed beat, Amplified Heart champions the virtues of economy without sacrificing any of the group’s habitual luster. There are few elements in play, but every one sounds like a million bucks. And by rubbing away the generic sheen of high-end production that smothered Worldwide, the duo’s music breathes anew. So do their lyrics. (On earlier albums, Watt had let his partner handle the bulk of lyric writing; here, each contributed five songs.) Though Thorn had long excelled at nostalgic snapshots and finely drawn character studies, Amplified Heart moves in the opposite direction, boiling down universal sentiments—loneliness, longing, confusion—into simple, indelible images. A turbulent love rolls like a freight train through someone’s life; a depressed woman eats her meals in bed, watching Saturday-morning cartoons with the sound turned down. Only a fool would try to map the inner life of this most private of couples onto their lyrics (for years, interviewers tried, and failed, to understand their domestic dynamic), but Amplified Heart excels at giving voice to the inevitable frustration of any long-term relationship—particularly the occasional, nagging doubt that you can never really know your partner. “Even though I share your bed/Baby, I don’t get inside your head,” Thorn laments on “I Don’t Understand Anything,” and a few songs later she pleads, “Do you ever get me?”—her voice catching on “get,” clicking like a key unlocking an empty room. Balancing out the doubt is “We Walk the Same Line,” a deceptively chipper song about hanging in for the long haul that’s built upon memories of Watt’s hospital ordeal. The two had been through hell, and though they were loath to reveal too much, they were happy to drop artful clues. (In “I Don’t Understand Anything,” Thorn even hinted at a frustrated desire to have children—terrain she finally revisited on her 2018 song “Babies.”) The album’s first side is the stronger, with a stellar three-song opening run (“Rollercoaster,” “Troubled Mind,” and “I Don’t Understand Anything”), a charming (if slightly cloying) he-said/she-said duet (“Walking to You”), and, finally, “Get Me,” an understated love song flecked with the faintest trace of house music. But the second half’s few failings—namely the jump from the maudlin “Two Star” to the perky “We Walk the Same Line”—are more than compensated for by “Missing.” What, 25 years later, is left to say about “Missing”? For a song that has largely been eclipsed by its most famous remix—and Todd Terry’s rework is a masterpiece—the original stands out in part for its quirks. The time-keeping cowbell is louder than you might have remembered it, and at first seems almost out of place; the first few notes of the bassline are dead ringers for the Human League’s “Don’t You Want Me.” Almost immediately, though, Thorn draws you into one of her typically detailed vignettes, as the song’s narrator steps off the train and stands beneath the window of a lover from years ago, long gone, maybe dead. The song’s chorus—“And I miss you/Like the deserts miss the rain”—shouldn’t work; on paper, it’s just a hair too much. But singing it, their voices twinned in close harmony, they sell it. Thorn’s voice, in particular, is the very incarnation of yearning. At regular intervals, an eerie, synthetic siren sound—a key element of the remix that gets its start in the original—drives home the hurt. In the face of such emotion, any corniness in the metaphor falls away. Of course it’s a desert, it had to have been rain—these things are elemental, fundamental, and so is the feeling the song captures. Far beyond the impact of Todd Terry’s remix, the sound of “Missing,” and that of Amplified Heart in general, has resonated widely. Its careful strain of folktronica set the precedent for Beth Orton’s Trailer Park two years later, and then a whole raft of tuneful, trip-hop-adjacent sounds. Fifteen years after the album’s release, its gauzy mix of guitars and drums resurfaced on the xx’s debut album. And Everything But the Girl themselves turned out to have the world ahead of them: two more albums as a duo, three children, parallel solo careers, and several acclaimed memoirs. The narrative around them is of a group rescued from the brink; it’s one of pop music’s great comeback stories. But the genius of Amplified Heart is that none of that was foreordained. Here, all you can hear is relief at being alive, and the hunger to hang on a little longer.

Don’t You Think You've Had Enough?,Bleached,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d238339da8a77000924afff/1:1/w_160/Bleached_Don'tYouThinkYou'veHadEnough.jpg,2019-07-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bleached-dont-you-think-youve-had-enough/,Dead Oceans,"Jennifer and Jessica Clavin had a near-cinematic Los Angeles upbringing—daughters of a guitarist who played noise music in the ’60s, the two formed a punk band in their garage in the Valley while still in high school. They’ve run down the West Coast checklist: toying with surf rock, visiting Joshua Tree, playing the Burger Records showcase. On Don’t You Think You've Had Enough?, the Clavin sisters remain unafraid to wear their inspirations on their sleeves. But they sound sharper and more focused than they have in a while. Some of the record’s most successful tracks, like the slow-burn opener “Heartbeat Away” and the breakup anthem “Rebound City,” stick to basics—distortion-fried power chords, thumping backbeats, bouncing bass lines. Jennifer’s voice dips into twang on “Valley to LA,” recalling fellow West Coast sisters Heart. As with Welcome the Worms, the aesthetic is culled mostly from the sexed-up glam metal of the late ’70s and early ’80s. As if to drive the point home, the music video for “Kiss You Goodbye” recalls the debauched pool party from Boogie Nights, massive hair and all. But Bleached also try on plenty of new looks. On “Somebody Dial 911,” they borrow from the goths, Jennifer’s puppy-love verses backed by basslines dripping with metallic reverb. On “Kiss You Goodbye,” they reach for gleaming funk guitars and gulped, staccato vocals. Some songs miss the mark—“I Get What I Need”’s creeping, bluesy bassline proves awkward—but most of them work, if only because the band sounds like they’re truly putting their all into their melodies and riffs, rather than leaving the heavy lifting to distortion. If it feels like the fog that had set in on their last release has been lifted, it might be because the sisters themselves feel a bit more clear-headed. In recent interviews, they talk about the clarity that has come with their recent sobriety, the ways that abstinence from alcohol can reframe friendships, change long nights out, reset the vantage point from which you examine your own past. Aside from the crisper and warmer production, this clarity comes through in their songwriting. On “Silly Girl,” they sing about cutting off a bad influence with the tossed-off dismissal of someone who’s not mad, just disappointed: “Goodbye, time for growing up/ Don’t you think you’ve had enough?” And “Hard to Kill” serves as a slick reality check as Jennifer coolly sings, “You’re so cool/You hate yourself.” After 11 tracks of scorching riffs and lyrical dunks, “Shitty Ballet” finishes the record on a surprisingly introspective note, with acoustic guitars and a stripped-down vocal performance. Bleached has never sounded this humble or vulnerable—you almost want to lean in to catch the words before Jennifer swallows them. But just after the bridge, as her falsetto slides into its faintest register, they go electric, and the song explodes. Over a whirlwind of fuzzed-out guitar and cymbal crashes, Jennifer’s voice rises to a scream muffled by distortion—“Like, oh my god!” she sings, almost with a wink. After all, control is much more interesting after you've let things fly completely off the rails.

Admission,Torche,by: Zach Schonfeld,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d23860a82ada80008ddf802/1:1/w_160/Torche_Admission.jpg,2019-07-16 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/torche-admission/,Relapse,"Torche’s business is heaviness. The Miami metal band specializes in the kind of formidable, down-tuned riffs you’d expect to hear from the most menacing-looking customer at your local Guitar Center. The twist is that guitarist/singer Steve Brooks grew up obsessing over the Melvins instead of Metallica (he once said that the former band’s 1991 album Bullhead “ruined metal for me”), which helps explain the band’s sludgy sensibility. A great Torche track, like 2015’s “Minions,” doesn’t wow you with speed or exhaust you with unchecked aggression. It bludgeons you slowly and patiently, giving you time to marvel at its punishing repetition before you succumb. This basic strategy has served Torche across 15 years, numerous line-up changes, five labels, and at least one intraband fistfight. The group perfected the approach on 2008’s subversively melodic Meanderthal, while refining it and enlarging its following on 2012’s Harmonicraft and 2015’s Restarter. Admission, Torche’s new album and first in more than four years, retains the sludgy ferocity of their best work while broadening their sound to include elements of shoegaze and dream pop, to mixed success. The most striking departure here is the title track, an uncharacteristically dreamy meditation on self-induced isolation. If you’re a shoegaze nut, the song’s introductory siren of guitar might strike you as familiar—it is startlingly similar to the main riff in Ride’s 1990 gem “Dreams Burn Down.” That’s not a reference point that would have applied to Torche’s previous albums, but it does indicate the band’s growing interest in using lead guitar as an engine of atmospheric grandeur. (Admission is the first Torche album that finds longtime bassist Jonathan Nuñez switching over to guitar duties.) On “Slide,” this results in a slippery, reverb-tinted solo that lacks the agility and laser precision of the Meanderthal solos. Torche aren’t growing soft. From the sputtering machine-gun power chords that open the record (“From Here”) to the chugging doom of “On the Wire,” Admission doesn’t skimp on the band’s well-established propensity for brutalizing riffs. The latter is a highlight of teeth-gnashing sludge, as is “Infierno,” which uses discordant rumbles of low-end guitar noise to illustrate its vision of fiery devastation: As Brooks repeats the words “on fire,” the amp sounds as though it’s literally overheating. That song locks into a thunderous groove before Torche close out the album by dialing up their melodic sensibilities on “Changes Come,” which boasts faint echoes of a synth line and the album’s only trace of an optimistic lyric (“I’m alright/The kid isn’t gone”). Brooks is the rare metal vocalist who sings more than he shouts, here especially so. Those moments are impressive. But for the most part, Admission doesn’t amount to Torche’s most compelling songwriting, especially when you consider the four-and-a-half-year wait between albums. “Times Missing” is another dalliance with shoegaze wall-of-sound density, but the song plods around for five minutes in search of a central idea. “Reminder,” with its staccato jolts of electricity, makes an admirable racket but never quite locks into a groove. And the record’s two punkish interludes, “From Here” and “What Was,” feel as truncated and perfunctory as their titles. Neither pass the 90-second mark. That should still be enough time to produce a hook. Pop-metal, stoner rock, doom metal—whatever amalgam of buzzwords you favor, on Admission, Torche remain a reliable supplier of grizzled riffs to test the low end on your stereo. The stylistic guises don’t always fit, but that’s a function of the group’s creative restlessness.

Hasta el Cielo,Khruangbin,by: Marc Hogan,Senior Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d08f0bcf605602fd54d3c0d/1:1/w_160/hastaelcielo_khruangbin.jpg,2019-07-15 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/khruangbin-hasta-el-cielo/,Dead OceansNight Time Stories Ltd.,"Khruangbin are a conundrum. The Houston band with a Thai name has skillfully showcased a crate digger’s approach to global sounds, setting heads nodding by homing in on southeast Asian funk (2015 debut The Universe Smiles Upon You) before widening out into styles from Iran and the French Antilles (last year’s Con Todo El Mundo). At the same time, despite Khruangbin’s globe-trotting narrative, their more obvious sonic touchstones are among American music’s most heavily sampled, whether the Isley Brothers’ “Footsteps in the Dark” or the Incredible Bongo Band’s “Apache.” Melded together, the group’s low-slung psych-funk threatens to turn into a Spotify chill-playlist slurry: Notice how, although Khruangbin’s music actually has occasional subdued vocals, many publications, including Pitchfork, have described them as “instrumental.” More and more people are listening to Khruangbin, but how many are really listening? Hasta El Cielo, a dub version of Con Todo El Mundo, seems unlikely to settle many debates. Traces of the Jamaican dub reggae tradition are already evident on the original album in Khruangbin bassist Laura Lee’s deep rumbles and drummer Donald Johnson’s cavernous breakbeats, filled out by guitarist Mark Speer’s balmy spaghetti-western brambles and, yes, sometimes Lee’s and Speer’s ghostly vocals. In fact, Khruangbin have released a handful of dub remixes as B-sides going back a few years now, and Lee even purportedly learned the bass listening to Scientist’s dub touchstone Scientist Wins the World Cup. There’s also a decent precedent for non-Jamaican artists issuing dub versions of their albums, from Massive Attack to Bill Callahan and Franz Ferdinand. Khruangbin’s effort succeeds in subtly making a mellow record even more mellow. But it also feels like an album-length equivalent of a B-side. The strongest cuts on Con Todo El Mundo are also the standouts on Hasta El Cielo, where they’re run through the usual dub effects: echo, flange, drop-outs, and more. The “Apache”-based “Maria También” still sounds urgent when it’s warped and hollowed into “Mary Always.” The disco-tinged “Evan Finds the Third Room” basks warmly in a world of echo as the dub version “A La Sala,” with a detached vocal cry of “yes” now more starkly positioned in the foreground, ambiguous as a Mona Lisa smile. Attentive listeners may enjoy flipping between the two albums to notice such little, nuanced differences. For dub devotees, the record ends with two additional tracks processed by Scientist himself, lathering extra atmosphere onto “Rules” and “Cómo Te Quiero.” But the sequencing does him no favors, as other, slightly varying dub versions of the same two tracks appear earlier on the album, as “Order of Operations” and “How I Love,” respectively. A better idea for an album might have been to let Scientist just do the whole thing. As it is, little of Hasta El Cielo sticks. The wobbly instrumental interplay and dub-standard FX of “Sunny’s Vision” (“Shades of Man” on Con Todo El Mundo) or “Four of Five” (née “August 10”) are never less than pleasant in the background. But Khruangbin seem capable of more. Maybe, for a band that recently covered Warren G and ODB at Coachella—and, full disclosure, will be playing at this month’s Pitchfork Music Festival—that “more” is merely a future as a crowd-pleasing live act. But late last year, Khruangbin released a dreamy cover of Vince Guaraldi’s “Christmas Time Is Here.” Conceptually inspired and sublimely executed, this worldly trio’s take on a homely holiday chestnut was a stunning indication that for all Khruangbin’s savvy as curators, they might have it in them to someday create something of their own with comparable staying power. By comparison, Hasta El Cielo is so laid-back that it’s almost inert. Inevitably, Khruangbin’s “Christmas Time Is Here” single also included a dub version—as a B-side.

So it should come as no surprise that an experimental artist like Jefre Cantu-Ledesma returned to school a few years ago to further his education. He emerged with a Masters in Divinity in Buddhism and Interreligious Engagement, which seems less like a new path than a deeply empathetic shift in approach. At a time when some ambient music can feel like it’s drafted solely for inclusion on a “chill” playlist to anesthetize the overworked, Cantu-Ledesma’s explorations have been steering towards deeper waters. On Tracing Back the Radiance, his most profound work to date, he finds them. Spiritual seeking was always at the root of Cantu-Ledesma’s work. His very first release was named after a breathing technique in yoga, and here he name-checks the writings of Chinul, a Korean Buddhist monk from the 12th century. It’s also the album in which his presence is hardest to place. His signature guitar work is nowhere to be found; he is instead credited with vibraphone and effects processing. Multiple players appear across the album’s three long compositions, with contributions from a veritable all-star cast: Bing & Ruth’s David Moore, harpist Mary Lattimore, pedal steel guitarist Chuck Johnson, Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Fly Pan Am member Roger Tellier Craig, Forma’s John Also Bennett, and others. But even the deepest listen makes individuation nearly impossible, so skillfully does Cantu-Ledesma erase distinct instrumentation and egos. Instead, everyone and everything moves as one deep breath, and the music feels like it’s hovering inches off the ground. The quietly glowing “Palace of Time” features flute, piano, synth, and violin and credits five performers. Not much happens, but not much needs to; its serene sound world is established from the hushed opening moments and you want nothing more than to reside within it. Ledesma has cited the works of ’70s Italian composers like Giusto Pio and Lino Capra Vaccina, but what first springs to mind is “He Loved Him Madly,” Miles Davis’ epic ambient piece from Get Up With It. That piece was a brooding, funereal meditation, almost nihilistic in its composition, never building upwards, but instead hovering in the void, a brushed snare drum fluttering about the sonic space like a bat. A similarly spare, rustling percussion appears here, but if anything, “Palace” is the photonegative of that iconic work, less Mark Rothko more like Agnes Martin, a nearly empty space suffused with gentle light. “Tracing Back the Radiance” is similarly slow moving. Simply put, it’s ineffable, seemingly capable of lowering your heart rate and instilling calmness with every listen. Even on playback during a crowded commute, not always discernible amid the din, it seems to lessen tensions. Violin, synthesizer, voice, and Johnson’s drifting pedal steel are all listed, but attempting to trace the origins of such sounds feels futile, akin to painting a landscape while standing in a white mist. A previous review of Cantu-Ledesma’s work noted a fragility, suffering, and “anxiety-tinged optimism.” On Radiance, Cantu-Ledesma pushes beyond such dualities towards a space that unifies it all.

CASE STUDY 01,Daniel Caesar,by: Michelle Kim,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d15374982ada80008ddf2ca/1:1/w_160/CaseStudy_DanielCaesar.jpg,2019-07-15 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/daniel-caesar-case-study-01/,Golden Child,"There are few R&B singers who would sample J. Robert Oppenheimer, the American theoretical physicist who helmed the design and research of the world’s first atomic bomb. But Toronto singer Daniel Caesar spotlights a quote from the scientist describing the Hindu deity Vishnu as the “destroyer of worlds” at the start of “Entropy,” setting the mood for his new album, Case Study 01. Coming from a love ballad crooner that previously held a reputation for having an insane amount of people proposing at his live shows, this might seem a little morbid and heady. But considering that 2017’s Freudian, was, well, named after Sigmund Freud as a tie-in to his grappling of ego and id within his romantic serenades, the 24-year-old artist now delves further into his philosophical explorations. On Case Study 01, Caesar employs science metaphors to work through ideas of death, spirituality, and absolution. He does this best on the aforementioned “Entropy,” where he uses the thermodynamic chemical reaction to represent the chaos in his life and also to suggest we, as humans, have little control over the potentially catastrophic rules of nature. But his resolve is impressive as he quells his concerns and turns to his belief and trust in God. And when he sings about welcoming the end of life (“Raise my jersey to the rafters/Let moths consume me in the light”), his lithe voice trembles. It’s a beautiful, vulnerable display of a young man’s faith, despite his uncertainty of the future. He shows more of this serenity on the standout “Superposition,” as he sings about the natural balance of life through a Buddhist lens, referencing “yin and yang” and the principle of superposition. “I’m me/I’m God/I’m everything,” he sings in his airy falsetto over John Mayer’s hypnotic guitar licks and ghostly background vocals, sounding full of grace. These transcendent moments are accentuated by subtle production that shifts outward from the more straightforward gospel-R&B of Freudian. The Frank Ocean-inspired closing track “Are You OK?” pans out into a psychedelic dreamscape that opens with the introduction of each instrument: glittering chimes, a touch of slide guitar, a skittering synth, and later, the howling sound of distorted voices. While “Frontal Lobe Muzik,” featuring production and vocals from Pharrell, reveals a scattering of new age-y synth bleeps. They sound like they’re ready to drift into space, mirroring Caesar’s sentiments when he says: “I wanna venture into the unknown.” Caesar doesn’t completely ditch the love songs on Case Study 01. “Love Again,” a glowing funk ballad features Caesar and Brandy sharing their respective breakup stories and reassuring each other through the heartsickness. This is the mode that he thrives in, as shown in his many collaborations on Freudian with H.E.R., Kali Uchis, Charlotte Day Wilson, and Syd, respectively—their voices providing an extra texture and point of view that complements his so well. But this is Brandy we’re talking about, and she unsurprisingly shows up Caesar on his own song, as her powerful, multi-dimensional voice glides between the sultry and dark, and airy and light. However, her appearance sits in the shadow of Caesar’s recent controversial comments about race. “Why are we being so mean to white people right now?” Caesar asked his black followers on Instagram live as he defended Yes Julz, the embattled internet personality and “culture vulture,” after she ranted about black women criticizing her. Later he added, “You can’t win the game by choosing to not accept the winning team’s strategy” and urged his fans to “make [him] suffer for his opinion” by boycotting his music. So a cognitive dissonance arises when Caesar admires his lover’s skin, comparing it to “Rich dark chocolate, sweet melanin,” on the Kardinal Offishall-featuring, reggae-tinged bop “Cyanide.” Or when he positions himself as a beacon of enlightenment when he sings, “Follow me to salvation/Your mind still ’pon plantations,” on “Too Deep to Turn Back.” Contrary to false reports that his album flopped due to the controversy, it didn’t result in any major consequences. Case Study 01 debuted higher than Freudian on both the U.S. and Canadian charts. And while there are flashes of wisdom on Case Study 01, there are also a handful of clunky moments when Caesar’s out of his depth. On “Open Up,” he puts on his best D’Angelo impression by deepening his voice, but fails to provide any of the soul legend’s smoothness, as he sings, “I don’t feel like talking unless it’s ’bout me or philosophy.” And it gets even more unsettling horny when he sings in the chorus: “Then you can open up to me, girl/Let me plant my seed, girl.” Or when he brags about his glow up on “Frontal Lobe Muzik” by saying, “Used to be ugly, but now I hit from the back,” demonstrating the antithesis of his earlier humility and tenderness. Like his contemporaries 6LACK and Brent Faiyaz, Caesar is clearly talented, but he’s got a lot of learning to do.","The Toronto singer croons his way into a sapiosexual world of love and philosophy, though not without controversy.

Rouge,Yuna,by: Minna Zhou,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d1ced731e0ca30008a7629c/1:1/w_160/yuna_rouge.jpg,2019-07-15 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/yuna-rouge/,Verve Forecast,"Yuna has always made dreamer’s music: ethereal and achy, often centered on the gap between desire and reality. But on Rouge, the 32-year-old sounds clear-eyed, grounded, and sure of herself. Rouge is Yunalis Zara’ai’s fourth internationally released studio album since moving from her home country of Malaysia to L.A. eight years ago and, not inconsequentially, her first as a married person. On lead single “Forevermore,” she croons, “I’ve been dreaming of this light/ Piercing through the darkest night,” and one gets the sense she’s been waiting for this self-trust and certainty a long while. Her 2012 self-titled debut placed her within the world of Ingrid Michaelson-esque folk-pop, but on Rouge she’s making simmering R&B bops, pulling from disco and hip-hop along the way. “Amy” drifts like incense, flush with the trappings of Sade-inspired smooth jazz and Masego’s shadowy backing vocals. “Pink Youth,” featuring Little Simz, is a girl-empowerment track that rides a hazy disco beat reminiscent of Beyoncé’s “Blow,” while “Castaway,” featuring Tyler, The Creator, is a soft-spoken yet indisputable middle finger to a former lover. Neither song contains their guest artists’ typically sharp bars (Tyler did not need to rhyme “Beer belly is on horizon” with “You really don’t have Verizon”), but texturally, they work. By contrast, on album highlight “Does She,” Yuna’s duet with Jay Park unfolds like actual dialogue, rather than just a requisite 16-bar insertion. Not every track is so seamless. Album single “Blank Marquee” bumps along to a roller-rink-ready beat that recalls the break in Prince’s “I Wanna Be Your Lover,” which then dovetails into a woozy Tame Impala synth groove, only to be interrupted by a grubby and unpleasant G-Eazy. On “Likes,” Yuna’s plum-sweet voice rides atop an aquatic wash of Rhodes piano chords with trumpet lines recalling Donnie Trumpet & the Social Experiment’s Surf. She sings of the double standards she faces as a Muslim woman in the American music industry; if people aren’t knocking her for dressing modestly or not drinking, they’re complaining that it isn’t a Muslim woman’s place to be singing on stage in public. It’s one of the more personal moments on the album—until KYLE enters, and his verse zaps the mood almost as effectively as J. Cole on Jeremih’s “Planez.” These bumps in the road only underscore Yuna’s evolution: She’s broadened her palette, but she is still figuring out how to make these sounds feel like her own. There are some singular moments: her lilting, off-beat synths; the gentle instrumental stretches that feel more experimental than anything she’s done; a recurring motif—alternately framed by traditional Malay gendang-like percussion, meditative vocals, and raindrops—that haunts the corners of the album. It is in the final track that we see Yuna most clearly. Inspired by syair, a form of Malay narrative poetry-singing, album closer “Tiada Akhir” lingers like a faded memory. Against a rainy, silver-gray backdrop, Yuna intones in Malay, “You were born, like a bright light [...] I thought you would save me/But you were the poison that stopped my heart.” It is a poem about loss—and yet, in its ashes, we come to witness the truth: that from its depths, Yunalis Zara’ai is rising.

Aaliyah,Aaliyah,by: Rawiya Kameir,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ceed89393a5362be11ee5d8/1:1/w_160/Aaliyah_s:t.jpg,2019-07-14 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/aaliyah-aaliyah/,BlackgroundVirgin,"Whether you believe in the afterlife or not, it’s easy enough to picture Aaliyah in heaven. The video for “Rock The Boat,” the 2001 single that would be her last, looks as if it were beamed down from one of the mythical seven heavens: gently lapping water, the flare of a bright sun, women dressed in all white. She seems peaceful, softer than in previous clips. In August, after wrapping her scenes in the Bahamas, Aaliyah boarded a flight home. The Cessna twin-engine crashed moments after takeoff, killing the singer and eight others. She was 22. In life, Aaliyah was often described by friends and collaborators as angelic; in her death, that image persists. Just weeks earlier, she had released her third album, Aaliyah, a well-received collection of songs that mapped her personal growth during the five years since her second full-length, 1996’s One In A Million. During that hiatus, she’d taken an interest in acting, starring in a couple of films and lining up others, including two upcoming Matrix movies. But in between being on set during the day and in the studio at night, Aaliyah also had a lot to reckon with. In 1995, she’d ended a professional and allegedly predatory sexual relationship with R. Kelly, who’d produced her 1994 platinum-selling debut Age Ain’t Nothing But A Number. Today, especially following testimony aired in Lifetime’s “Surviving R. Kelly,” Aaliyah is understood to have been a survivor of his predation, but at the time, many people blamed her for the secret relationship and the falsification of her age on a clandestine marriage certificate. Internally, there was a concern that her career would flounder, that she would not be able to match Kelly’s production and songwriting elsewhere. But with members of the Supafriends—Timbaland, Missy Elliott, and, eventually, the late Static Major—by her side, Aaliyah easily eclipsed her work with Kelly. “Tim and I were new producers,"" Missy told Rolling Stone in 2001. ""From day one, she had that much faith in our music that she treated us like we already sold a million records, when we hadn't sold anything yet. She really helped make us what we are today.” The gamble paid off. Where Age Ain’t Nothing But A Number was defined by Kelly’s rote new jack swing and carried by her vocal depth, One In A Million was clever, fun, and forward-thinking. A couple of years later, “Are You That Somebody,” a single made for the Dr. Dolittle soundtrack, changed everything: Aaliyah wasn’t just sweet and sly; she revealed herself as endearingly weird and aspirationally cool—over a bizarre drum pattern and the sample of a baby’s coo, at that. Aaliyah took that many steps further. By the time she began working on the album in 1998, she had developed an interest in both the experimental and traditional, and her collaborators on the album—the Supafriends as well as producers signed to her family’s Blackground record label—were up to the task. She veers wildly, but cohesively, between the futuristic, triple-time experimentation of singles like “We Need A Resolution” and “More Than A Woman” and the throwback soul of “Never No More” and “I Care 4 U.”  It was Aaliyah’s voice that strung it all together. Her falsetto had earned an edge, and her multi-part harmonies, arranged ingeniously, added grace and texture. Even Timbaland’s grating, awkward raps and ad-libs are softened. This time, Aaliyah had added Static, who’d cut his teeth working with Ginuwine and in the R&B group Playa, as a writer. The result was something that diverged from the pop language du jour, yet somehow remained in conversation with it. Though Aaliyah hadn’t yet become a writer, she was inordinately good at picking songs, absorbing them, and interpreting through her bright, wispy soprano. The album’s singles—“We Need A Resolution,” “More Than A Woman,” “Rock The Boat,”—are among her best, boldly off-kilter, imaginative, and alternately mellow and razor-edged. But the deep cuts are just as solid. “Never No More” is an emotional song about enduring and then rejecting abuse at the hands of a partner, “U Got Nerve” and “I Refuse” are formed around a similar suspicion and self-assurance. Her primary currency was an effortless cool matched only then by Janet Jackson and, all these years later, by Rihanna. In reviews and profiles from the time, Aaliyah is praised, at the expense of some of her peers, for eschewing the “candy-coated” sound and style of the charts; actually, she was simply pre-empting the trends many of her peers would eventually try on. The glossy girl- and boy-band era was at its peak at the turn of the century, and before pop acts would attempt to replace that sheen with cool, calling on “urban” producers like Timbaland and The Neptunes, Aaliyah modeled the perfect balance of pop, R&B, and hip-hop. Months before Britney Spears made headlines for performing with a snake at the MTV VMA awards in 2001, Aaliyah had done it in the video for “We Need A Resolution.” Her personal style, creative direction, and choreography were legendarily inventive. She made comfort look luxe as the original little shirt, big pants girl, and tore through dark-and-mysterious years before Keanu Reeves made leather trench coats trendy (in the early years, her omnipresent sunglasses and then side-swooped hair prompted widespread rumors of a lazy eye). By the time of Aaliyah, she’d reinvented herself yet again, this time brighter and more streamlined. Her dancing, unlike that of many of her peers, was fluid and interpretative, designed to communicate more than to be imitated by fans in bedrooms and basements around the world. Her image was like her music: risky and adventurous, with a fondness for just the right amount of cheek. Nearly 20 years after her death, she persists as a moodboardable influence, finding lasting presence not purely of nostalgia but as aesthetic inspiration for a generation that came to age in her absence. Searching Aaliyah’s name on Tumblr brings up thousands and thousands of images—watermarked red carpet photos, GIFs and photo sets ripped from music videos, and the occasional ode of fandom. One photo, of what appears to be a performance look, appears to be a direct inspiration for Solange’s current tour wardrobe: a triangle bikini top with straps crisscrossed across the torso and a pair of flowing, loose-fitting pants. But Aaliyah has been a reference for Solange, and others, elsewhere, too: The multiple-part harmonies that have become the younger Knowles’s signature were in fact once the signature of Aaliyah, most in focus on, Aaliyah.  On what would have been Aaliyah’s 36th birthday, Frank Ocean shared his own take of the Isley Brothers’ “At Your Best,” which she’d first covered more than 20 years earlier, in 1994. She’d updated it with a spare, solemn almost-whisper, and Ocean’s version,  which was eventually given a proper release on Endless, draws equally from Aaliyah’s falsetto as from the Isley Brothers’ original. There are traces of her influence elsewhere, too; the layered harmonies and gentle melodies of Beyoncé’s “I Miss You,” co-written by Ocean, could easily have been recorded first, albeit with more restraint and whimsy, by Aaliyah. Understandably, among the most common refrains about the singer was that she was ahead of her time. And yet, paradoxically to its significance, the legacy of Aaliyah is now diminished by its absence from streaming services. After her death, Blackground Records, run by her uncle and cousin, faced some operational and legal issues. The label’s domain name has lapsed, and a final release promised by an associated publishing company has not materialized. There have been a couple of false starts—a posthumous album helmed, and then abandoned, by Drake and 40; an unsanctioned greatest hits release; the sale of her catalog to a publishing company—but most of Aaliyah’s catalog has remained unavailable to stream or download. Age Ain’t Nothing But A Number, the album written and produced by her abuser, is the only accessible release. For many artists, this could mean being written out of history, forgotten to more convenient nostalgia. For Aaliyah, it means something rarer—a legacy defined not by industry profiteers and hologram start-ups but by friends, fans, and kindred artists.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

"Stranger Things: Soundtrack From the Netflix Original Series, Season 3",Various Artists,by: Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d274c06cb5eef0009648e80/1:1/w_160/VariousArtists_StrangerThingsSeason3.jpg,2019-07-13 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-stranger-things-soundtrack-from-the-netflix-original-series-season-3/,Sony,"Late in the third season of “Stranger Things,” two minor characters attend a Fourth of July fair. One of them, an American, tells the other that all the games are rigged, a way for the rich to line their pockets. His companion decides to try his luck anyway. With a crowd watching, he wins the grand prize in a dart throwing competition. See, the game wasn’t rigged after all! Then, he’s shot in the abdomen. It’s a confused parable that speaks to the Duffer Brothers’ usual sledgehammer-approach to symbolism. Like their viewers, the show's creators are keen to celebrate an America they know isn’t real, and never was. Every so often, it behooves them to pretend they’re jaded. The soundtrack to this season, too, plants itself firmly between veneration and cynicism, allowing the show to celebrate the blockbuster era of Spielberg, Hughes, and Heckerling while winking at their viewers: We know you’ve seen this before. The opening song here is a remix of the Who’s “Baba O’Reilly” from Confidential Music, a Los Angeles based duo that churns out music for movie trailers. (The mix appeared in the preview for this season). It’s a chop-job, Pete Townshend’s strained teenage angst cut with the show’s signature synthesizers and molded into a conventional trailer score with a climax big enough to push you straight into an all-night binge. Americana, but a little uneasy. Get it? Other music choices echo the half-steppin’ the show is fond of. There’s something charming about the obviousness of “Material Girl” as the backdrop to a mall montage early in the season in which Millie Bobbie Brown and Sadie Sink bond through shopping and the male teens of the cast bond through fear of women’s sexuality. It’s a perfect fit: the Madonna song is another undeniable piece of pop art that implies a critique without exactly getting there. Another scene from the same episode finds “Weird Al” Yankovic’s “My Bologna,” which came out in 1979, standing in for actual character development. The boys’ science teacher has played a purely instrumental role; he’s Velma, but he never gets to tag along in the Mystery Machine. Because he’s a depthless weirdo, he does random science stuff while listening to “Weird Al” in the background (instead of the Knack’s original.) In a scene featuring Joe Keery (Steve) or Dacre Montgomery (Billy), the Knack would otherwise fit in perfectly well with other classic rock chestnuts like Foreigner's “Cold As Ice,” John Mellencamp’s “R.O.C.K. In the U.S.A.” and REO Speedwagon “Can’t Fight This Feeling.” It’s a tell that the best episodes from this season—four, five and six—lean less on radio hits of the ’80s and more on the assured work of Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein of S U R V I V E, who have conveyed the mood of the show since the beginning. The two pop songs from these episodes are some of the best on the album: The Pointer Sisters classic “Neutron Dance,” which of course has memorably showed up onscreen before and Vera Lynn’s “We’ll Meet Again,” the old-timey camp artificiality of which is perfectly suited to one of the show’s patented cliffhangers. There are great musical moments in this season that didn’t appear on this soundtrack. Yello, the Swiss duo who found their way into Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, have a cameo in the finale in the form of their great “Goldrush II.” That doesn’t make the cut. Neither does any of Dixon and Stein’s typically excellent synth work, which has previously been featured on the show’s official “soundtracks.” (This time it appears on a separate score.) The Danny Elfman and Philip Glass compositions that lend drama to the show are also absent. These missing tracks make this soundtrack less substantive than the show, which, despite its familiar plot points, distinguishes itself through smart pacing, nice action set pieces, strong performances from most of its core cast, and yes, its instrumental score. It’s a shame that a shallow collection of songs like this exposes the otherwise moving and enjoyable “Stranger Things” to the most obvious critiques. This soundtrack makes it clear what we’re all doing when we indulge in this cutting-edge summer escapism. I can’t even pretend to be thinking too hard when I watch this lightly remixed tale of good and evil where the evil isn’t all that threatening. Sure, things are bad, a monster lurks, and an army of people has been possessed by an inexplicable and evil energy. But the good guys will win. They always do. Right? Right?

Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?,Chinatown Slalom,by: Will Pritchard,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d1bc74d304621000999704a/1:1/w_160/chinatown_whowantstobe.jpg,2019-07-13 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/chinatown-slalom-who-wants-to-be-a-millionaire/,September Recordings,"The house that Chinatown Slalom live in, on Little St. Bride Street in Liverpool, has the words “Everyone’s Invited” sprayed across its walls. It’s become something of a motto for the band, borne out in their home’s open-door policy and the trippy house parties that inspired this, their debut album, Who Wants to be a Millionaire? But the motto is most keenly felt in the group’s pick ’n’ mix approach to songwriting: One that dips exuberantly into musical and cultural history to absorb the best and oddest bits before resurfacing to piece the collage together from a palette of chopped samples, ghostly harmonies, and guitars and synths driven through a squall of analog pedal effects. The band’s Liverpool home, four-piece lineup, and psychedelic leanings—their name comes from a stoned expedition to the city’s Chinatown neighborhood—may invoke comparisons to the Beatles. But what they really have in common with the Fab Four is their playful experimentation within pop’s otherwise stringent confines, and their buckets of artistic chemistry. Listening to the album feels like sitting in on a jam session and, despite their intricate, precise construction, there’s an appealing, thrown-together feel to the album’s 10 tracks. The hand-clapped a cappella intro to “People Always Say What They Want” builds with snippets of laughter, studio chatter, and a new instrument joining the fray every few bars, but never loses its shape. “08:30” opens on drifting choral harmonies before descending into a scuzz of square waves and thrashed-out guitar riffs; “Dreams” is just as unpredictable, with its sparse, wiry vocals disintegrating gorgeously into metallic percussion and crunchy synths. “Bullets on a Screen” and the album’s title track follow more obvious, chorus-led song structures, but don’t necessarily suffer for it. Both sail on beguiling three-part harmonies and effortless riffs and serve as fixed posts for the album’s remaining tracks to drift in and out of. Occasionally—on the aimlessly repetitive “Just Love,” or in the meandering bombast of “Every Minute of the Day”—their agreeably thrown-together approach verges on slapdash, but these minor missteps don’t dampen the mood too much. Landing somewhere between a beat tape and an alt-pop record, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? finds inspiration in unexpected places: early Battles, maybe, or Forest Swords if he wasn’t quite so serious, or the xx if they weren’t so caught up in their feelings. As such, it’s a welcome addition to the UK’s musical landscape which, beyond London’s fizzing homegrown jazz community and a few other exceptions, finds itself amid a dearth of exciting new bands. Like the party scene in your favorite teen movie, this is neatly constructed chaos. And infectiously fun too. It’s a bold debut, frothing with ambition and a desire to push at the bounds of what a pop band should sound like in 2019. The challenge now will be to hone that ambition and tighten up the songcraft that Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? has given fans a glimpse of.

SO EMOTIONAL,Key!,by: Nazuk Kochhar,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d1cb61949bcdc0008fbc67e/1:1/w_160/Key!_SoEmotional.jpg,2019-07-13 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/key-so-emotional/,Hello!,"Underground star Key! has a reputation as a rap trendsetter, championing talent like iLoveMakonnen, 21 Savage, and Playboi Carti early on in their careers. The 28-year-old is also known for his experimental and pioneering flows and adlibs, both delivered with insane ease. He was at his best on last year’s 777, his break-out collab with Kenny Beats. It’s an album that is a triumphant victory lap, navigating the unpredictable highs and lows encountered on his journey to adulthood. On the brief but substantial new release SO EMOTIONAL, he comfortably sticks to the fundamentals that have carried him through his career while leaning into a poppier pocket, and it works brilliantly. The ability to sound at home on virtually any beat or production style is core to Key!’s artistry. His gut-hitting, honest bars sound just as at home on the scrappy, melody-driven cuts of his days with cult Atlanta rap outfit Two-9 and early solo tapes, as he does on the sparse-sounding 2014 cuts that exposed him to larger audiences, like the OG Maco collaboration “U Guessed It” and his guest verse on Father’s “Look At Wrist.” On SO EMOTIONAL, the versatile rapper gets deep and let’s loose. A whirlwind, its eight tracks are super fun, as he raps through the extremes of romantic desire. By tapping a few different producers, he’s able to deftly hop in and out of different sonic realms in a tight space with signature ease. The playful and anthemic opener “MOTHERLESS CHILD”, which showcases him flexing the high reaches of his singing voice, would be a welcome and actually cool replacement for play at a major sports event, with its catchy and sing-a-long hook of “We want what we want/We want it now.” “WHY” laments a taunting lover while sounding like the surprise contender for radio-ready poolside-pop-punk hit of the summer. Produced by Key!’s longtime collaborator TrapMoneyBenny (who’s now best known as one of the producers of Drake’s “In My Feelings”), it highlights the growth and versatility of two of the foremost soundcrafters of the first Soundcloud rap era. The gloomy but urgent “YES OR NO” is an earnest pondering on where he and a love interest stand, that gets super real super fast, “I gotta love me/So I can love you.” Project stand-out “FALL HARD” is a banger reminiscent of an amusement park theme song on which an anguished Key! stretches words over cute video game-y synths to mirror the feeling of falling, and blasts the heart rate of the project up a notch. Through this track, produced by Philadelphia’s Oogie Mane of the quietly rising Working on Dying collective, and the spaced-out and spooky “HARD SOFT,” produced by Atlanta-via-Baltimore producer 14GOLDS, Key! reinforces that he’s still got his ear on the pulse of what sounds are bubbling. Ultimately, at 19 minutes, the project is a travel-sized highlight reel and re-affirmation of Key!’s versatility in this moment of his career, and is a blast to listen to all the way through. It’s the kind of tape that has you choosing a new favorite song every few listens.

Purple Mountains,Purple Mountains,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ce41272c13a4571bee8321c/1:1/w_160/PurpleMountains_PurpleMountains.jpg,2019-07-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/purple-mountains-purple-mountains/,Drag City,"In 2009, David Berman quit music because he’s not a careerist; because he feared that he might start sucking; because, as he posited in an essay called “My Father, My Attack Dog,” his work as a songwriter could never offset the damage done to the world by his notorious corporate lobbyist father, Richard Berman, known as “Dr. Evil.” When HBO approached him during the hiatus to participate in a docuseries about his father Berman backed out, fearing it would end up being a sympathetic Tony Soprano-style portrait. But of all the reasons David Berman has given for abandoning his recording project, Silver Jews, the most pressing one was also the simplest: He wanted more time to read. And so, Berman spent his 40s at home in Nashville, surrounded by books—an experience that he recently described as being “kind of my childhood dream.” It’s an easy image to conjure for anybody acquainted with his body of work, an insular, quotable universe that spans six great-to-extraordinary studio albums, a collection of poetry, a book of cartoons, a documentary, a few EPs, and a compilation. Through it all, Berman maintained the role of the quiet outsider, someone proudly allergic to trends and devoted with scholarly intensity to things uncommon even in the individualist community of lo-fi indie rock: religion, country music, sobriety, an insistence on attributing deep significance to every word he sang and each interview he granted. On 2008’s Lookout Mountain, Lookout Sea, the final Silver Jews album, Berman pared down his MFA-backed control of language for simple, allegorical writing. Throughout the record, his mood seemed light, as he sang words of love and perseverance, accompanied by his wife Cassie, the bassist and vocalist of his always-changing band (which has included, at various points, Stephen Malkmus, Bob Nastanovich, Will Oldham, and William Tyler). Having kicked a nearly fatal drug addiction and devoted himself to Judaism, Berman seemed to be in a good place back then. And while he’s always been one for fabrication—he has given several contradicting explanations for the “Silver Jews” band name through the years—he’s never been one for pure obfuscation. It was easy to believe him when he said he was done with music for good. There were a few appearances following his early retirement; you can find YouTube videos of him, clean-cut and suave, at a poetry reading and a Harmony Korine screening. But there was also a lot of quiet. You never really imagined a Silver Jews comeback, even after rumors started spilling about band practices and new songs with titles like “Wacky Package Eyes.” “No I don’t really want to die,” he sang a long time ago. “I only want to die in your eyes.” And so he did. The way Berman tells it, he picked up a guitar again after his mother’s death. “I think it was like meditation, but it was also like a massage,” he said of that familiar exercise, the wooden body vibrating against his chest. His strumming eventually spiraled into “I Loved Being My Mother’s Son,” a gentle highlight from his new comeback album under the name Purple Mountains. Lyrically bereaved but musically at peace, it sets the tone for the record as a whole. These are plainspoken songs of heartbreak, grief, and bitterness. One ballad, “Nights That Won’t Happen,” can be heard as a pros-and-cons list of just being alive. Backed by members of the Brooklyn psych-folk band Woods, however, Berman’s writing has never sounded so exacting or direct. These songs offer a solid introduction to all the beautiful contradictions that have always made his work so comforting and complex—a rare feat for a comeback album. As warm and immediate as the record sounds—heartland harmonica, cantina horns, and pedal steel all guide his words—Berman’s lyrics reveal all the reading that has inspired him. The singalong chorus of “Margaritas at the Mall” alludes to a philosophical text on the capitalist origins of purgatory; a line about treating the world as a “roadside inn” in “Nights That Won’t Happen” echoes a teaching by the second-century Greek Stoic philosopher Epictetus. And the jaunty “Storyline Fever” continues his tradition of whimsical penultimate tracks by considering the span of life as a long narrative with an infinite number of possible outcomes—it reads a lot like an anxiety attack but sounds a little like the Kinks. That Berman has scrounged a college syllabus’ worth of texts for their most human uses is a testament to the enduring, tragic empathy of his writing. Few writers are so willing to submit to their lowest depths to make you feel less alone. While Purple Mountains is remarkable for affirming what we missed in Berman’s songwriting, it’s equally affecting for what it’s missing. He alludes to crises of faith in both “That’s Just the Way I Feel” and “Margaritas at the Mall,” a song that finds him at his wit’s end looking for answers from “such a subtle god.” His separation from Cassie after two decades of marriage casts a heavy shadow through nearly every song, a thematic and musical absence that gives the album an unsettling starkness. His voice has never been strong, but there’s a new helplessness to his delivery. “The end of all wanting is all I’ve been wanting,” he sings weakly in the opening track. “If no one’s fond of fuckin’ me, maybe no one’s fuckin’ fond of me,” he grumbles in the last. These are the kinds of characters he once observed with self-aware distance; nowadays, he just sounds spent. The subject matter of Purple Mountains is grim, but he’s still David Berman, and he can still dazzle with the sheer beauty of his writing or wink at the camera to lighten the mood when necessary. Back when he first gained prominence in the ’90s, he was called a slacker, suggesting his unpolished delivery was either an affect or an ethos. Over time, he insisted just the opposite—that it was the striving that was important; that even if you couldn’t hold a note, it was worth showing the effort; that a song was something you spend a lifetime learning to sing right.

Cease & Desist,Blarf,by: Zoe Dubno,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d1cc320da8a77000924ae9a/1:1/w_160/Blarf_CeaseAndDesist.jpg,2019-07-12 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/blarf-cease-and-desist/,Stones Throw,"Beneath the clown makeup and knockoff Ronald McDonald costume, Blarf is comedian Eric André, creator and star of Adult Swim’s “The Eric André Show.” The madcap TV program parodies late night talk shows with its trademark brand of high-octane anarchic nihilism. He revels in discomfiting celebrity guests through exhibitions of gore and destruction. On a typical show, André will destroy his set with a chainsaw, tackle the house band, or do something that's just plain gross—while interviewing Lauren Conrad of The Hills, Andre vomited on his desk then slowly slurped it back up. Conrad left, dry heaving. Though André tweeted, “People are confusing this guy BLARF...for me,” it’s pretty clear he made the music. Blarf was the name of André’s band while he was a student at the Berklee School of Music, and, in 2014, he released an album, Blarf, with Toronto based industrial band the First Seed. Aside from these “clues,” Cease & Desist is an absurdist cultural survey, which is kinda André’s whole thing. Cease & Desist comes with a dare to “make it through six minutes of this album,” a foreboding invitation from André, a master of testing the endurance of his show’s guests with gruesome and strange displays. The tracks on Cease & Desist are bound together like files collected in a downloads folder: a collection of random mp3s that someone found interesting. There are short Girl Talk-style mashups that weave bongos through what sounds like The Fast and the Furious soundtrack, Death Grips’ aggression folding into dream pop, Jorge Ben mixed into intentionally annoying “Soundclown” auditory memes, Scandinavian noise that becomes cheesy violin. Just as the celebrity segments on The Eric André Show are satires of interviews, the tracks on Blarf are musical jokes. So, is the album a critique of music? Did André succeed in making something that sounds bad? Well, sometimes the music sounds quite good. “I Dunno,” a 36-second distorted witch house-y instrumental sounds like the start of a decent Crystal Castles song. I kind of enjoyed “The Me in Me,” which sounds like an Oasis song that’s been beaten to death and thrown into a quarry. Meanwhile, “Hella Rhymes,” which pairs West Coast rap with glitchy guitar and arrhythmic drumming, just sounds atonal and aggressive—and not in a renegade punk way. Cease & Desist sounds like the work of a talented person who is too busy or distracted to fully realize their ideas. While juggling a cult television show, an international stand-up tour, and voice-acting as a hyena in the remake of The Lion King, it’s understandable why André may not have devoted himself to polishing Blarf’s debut. The shorter tracks, which are the album’s best, seem like sketches for “real” music, perhaps abandoned because making something actually good requires more time or effort than he’s willing to expend. Meanwhile longer cuts, like “I Worship Satan,”—which sounds like 12 minutes of a pocket-recording while driving a convertible with the top down—didn’t seem to require much effort to produce at all. The best joke (if it is one?) appears on the second track, “Save It Babe.” It opens with a sample of Katie Couric asking Lil Wayne in an interview from 2009 if he’s a good role model. Her earnest, hopeful tone mimics the precious interludes commonplace in popular music (see: “Futura Free,” the emotional interview with a skateboarder that closes Frank Ocean’s Blonde, or “I Got It” in which a woman tells T-Pain she has HIV directly following club banger “Tipsy.”) “If you need an example for how to live,” Wayne says, drawing us in, “then you just shouldn’t have been born.” Blam. The dunk on the interviewer is punctuated by a blast of electric guitar, as if to punish us for believing, even just for a moment, that this could be genuine. Correction: A previous version of this review misidentified the sample in “Save It Babe.”","The frenetic, sample-heavy album from Eric André’s clown alter-ego is hard to take seriously, which is probably the point.

Then I Try Some More,Joanna Sternberg,by: Emma Madden,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d02bc14b6e2e367a1c9d3d3/1:1/w_160/ThenITrySomeMore_JoannaSternberg.jpg,2019-07-12 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/joanna-sternberg-then-i-try-some-more/,Team Love,"Joanna Sternberg is a New York-based cartoonist and musician, and on their website you can find a comic titled “somethings never change.” Sternberg depicts themselves as a lonely child in the first panel, then an equally lone adult in the following three. Underneath the strip, they write: “this comic is not me looking for compliments or words of comfort and wisdom...it is more to remind people that they are not alone.” If Sternberg’s debut album could have included the same addendum, it might have. Sternberg comes to music with a strong compositional background—they specialized in jazz, blues, and ragtime at The New School for Jazz & Contemporary Music, and the pioneering Yiddish singer Fraydele Oysher is their grandmother. They have an intuitive knack for rhythm and meter; while you won’t find any poetry on this album, Sternberg’s concision is underlined by a consistent metrical pattern that gives every one of their words a punch. Sternberg sings as though they’re one half of a conversation that turns from loving, to argumentative, to sleepy, and back again. “I wish I was scared of poison, pills, and pain,” they sing on the opener ‘This Is Not What I Want To Be,” with all the nuance of a speaking voice. Despite only singing of despair and depression, Sternberg gives every single beat weight in a way that both somehow eases the burden and demands every word be heard. Just because the lyrics are clearly stated doesn’t mean they’re easy to hear. With themes of suicidal ideation, abject hopelessness, and self-hatred, Sternberg’s debut can be a challenging listen. For those who aren’t dogged by similar feelings, it may be forbidding, but for those who are able to identify with Sternberg, Then I Try Some More has the potential to be life-savingly relatable. Sternberg balances the despondency with pathos and whimsy—sort of like the way one laughs when admitting that they’re not OK. The sequencing alternates between sad ballads played on piano and ditties on a chicken-scratched guitar. In the middle of the album lies “Pimba,” a story of a fictional penguin of the same name, who Sternberg uses to make their dejection appear cartoonish and endearing. “My name is Pimba, I’m the littlest penguin,” they sing in a near-squeak. In terms of predecessors, one would be most tempted to draw similarities between Sternberg and Daniel Johnston. Both write and enjoy comics. Both have a laconic pop sensibility. Both have been dogged by severe mental illnesses. Both could be considered a musician’s musician (Johnston arguably got his break from Kurt Cobain, while Sternberg’s already been scooped up by Conor Oberst, who they’ll soon be supporting on tour). But where Johnston’s passion made up for his lack of musical virtuosity, Sternberg is able to balance both skill sets, in a way that still manages to endow their music with pathos rather than preciousness.","Sternberg’s debut balances stark themes of suicidal ideation, abject hopelessness, and self-hatred with whimsy and redemptive tenderness.

II,Wilson Tanner,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d02be6db25f86b1404f764e/1:1/w_160/II_WilsonTanner.jpg,2019-07-12 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/wilson-tanner-ii/,Efficient Space,"For their debut album, Melbourne’s Andrew Wilson and John Tanner came up with a relatively simple proposition: What if Balearic music—a catch-all style with ambient undertones popularized in Ibiza in the 1980s—were transplanted to the Southern Hemisphere? Claiming to have recorded their album on the West Coast of Australia, where the Swan River meets the Indian Ocean, the two musicians dove into Balearic’s deepest pools, where aquamarine strains of ambient music swirled with new age at its most beatific. Limpid synthesizers, nylon-stringed acoustic guitar, and the occasional keening clarinet solo pooled together as effortlessly as the ice melting in a Campari glass. As Andras Fox, Wilson had previously been known for Larry Heard-inspired deep house, while Tanner’s Eleventeen Eston project had put a lo-fi spin on big-budget 1980s pop, sounding like he’d dug up a sun-baked cassette of Tears for Fears’ demo instrumentals. But as Wilson Tanner, they achieved a newfound purity. On II, they continue with their debut album’s line of investigation but add a twist to the thought experiment: What if a cold front descended upon their Antipodean paradise? The elements of II have not much changed—their synthesizers remain fluid, their tempos bob pleasantly along, and the maritime conceit is borne out in the sound of actual waves against the prow. (The two say they wrote and recorded the new album aboard a 1950s riverboat in Melbourne’s Port Philipp Bay, utilizing “a resourceful array of weatherproof electronic instruments and a long extension lead,” which, sure!) It’s a dawdler’s paradise, a daydream mapped to MIDI. A few songs could have worked just as well on the duo’s debut: The faux-flute melody of “Loch and Key” sways lazily; “All Hands Bury the Dead” sinks into a mind-clearing keyboard refrain that’s accompanied by the sounds of birdcalls and splashing oars. But there’s a noticeable chill in the air. “Perishable” wraps up melancholy flute and guitar in tendrils of analog delay, suggesting a kind of dubbed-out death folk.“Killcord Pts I-III” fires up churning arpeggios, drizzles in dissolving marimbas, and stews in its own juices for 12 uneasy minutes. The darkest and most adventurous of all is “Idle,” where acid-like bass tones bubble and squelch against lurching electronic rhythms and an almost inaudible layer of feedback. It’s not far from something that Aphex Twin might have put out on his label Rephlex in the early 1990s, and it makes for a provocative new dimension to the duo’s sound. After all, with sea levels rising and coastlines disappearing, blissful drifting only gets you so far.","The latest from the Melbourne electronic duo is a dawdler’s paradise, a daydream mapped to MIDI.

ERYS,Jaden Smith,by: Reed Jackson,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d1cc1583046210009997097/1:1/w_160/Jaden_Erys.jpg,2019-07-11 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jaden-smith-erys/,MSFTS MUSICRoc Nation,"Last spring it was announced that Jaden Smith will play an “alternate reality version” of Kanye West on an upcoming TV series. He won’t have to study much for the role. The rapper, designer, and Twitter theoretician has been closely following in the Chicago MC’s footsteps for years, adopting both his creative bravado—he recently stated that his fashion icons are Pharrell, Batman, and the Greek god Poseidon—and bombastic style of conceptual thinking. This creative mode has inspired the 21-year-old to take on some notably big-hearted projects, including a vegan food truck catered toward the less fortunate in downtown Los Angeles and a paper-carton water company that’s reportedly helping the dire situation in Flint, Michigan. It also led to a debut album that was hugely ambitious in sound and scope (Smith cited 2016’s The Life of Pablo as its primary inspiration) but failed to show any potential beyond its shiny production value. ERYS, his newest, is even grander, a galaxy of beat switch-ups, vocal effects, and genre mash-ups that drown his voice in a soupy sonic mixture. A huge chunk of the project is devoted to Jaden doing everything he can to alter his voice, drenching it in staticky reverb, pitching it down a handful of octaves, or layering it underneath the harmonizing of guest vocalists. When it is distinguishable, it’s stiff and empty, used to deliver stale references like, “Star Wars with the clique, I’m Han Solo with the rips/Kobe with the pass, had to hit it no assist.” It gets even cheesier on the flimsy trap anthem “Mission,” where he fires off a limp diss at XXL Magazine’s annual “Freshman Class” by rapping, “Man, they look at me and know that I’m the freshest,” a gee-whiz boast that could have been ripped from one of his dad’s albums in the ’80s. Things get worse when he tries to mask his flaws as an MC by overcooking the production. Unlike fellow Kanye disciples Tyler, the Creator and Travis Scott, Smith doesn’t practice balance in his curation; he mashes together his favorite artists’ sounds in the hopes of stumbling upon symmetry. The first four tracks aim to capture the goosebumps of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy but instead form a grating mass of Auto-Tuned bridges, piano build-ups, and big drum fills that never arrive at a climax. Not much later, on the backend of “Again,” he imitates the soft guitars, pitch-altered vocals, and sparse drums of Frank Ocean’s Blonde but fails to capture any of the work’s intimacy. Meanwhile, his collab with Kid Cudi, “On My Own,” with its boilerplate organs and stomping kicks, sounds like a Speedin’ Bullet 2 Heaven leftover. Smith fairs better when he stops trying to recreate the revolutionary work of his idols and lowers the stakes. The loosest track on the album, “Summertime In Paris,” which features his sister Willow, is also its most successful: a breezy, guitar-driven tune that gets by on simplicity rather than grandiosity. “Summertime is meant to fall in love, I could fall asleep and stare in your eyes/We’ll dance all night,” Smith hums warmly on the chorus. Willow joins him on the second verse as the two siblings revel in their nostalgia. Not even a clunker of a line by Jaden tarnishes the endearing moment. While nothing about “Summertime” is groundbreaking, at least it sounds fun. Beyond a few other fleeting moments of experimentalism on ERYS—the second half of “K,” when the buzzing of an electric razor slowly morphs into a heaving trap beat, or “Fire Dept,” a decent ode to the fast and distorted energy of SoCal punk—it’s mostly a slog, the sound of an artist with a blurry vision and too many resources at his disposal. In an interview a day after its release, Smith stated that he wanted ERYS “to change the world”; in reality, it’s the least memorable thing he’s done this year.","The young polymath’s latest album is mostly a slog, the sound of an artist with a blurry vision and too many resources at his disposal.

Mr. Muthafuckin’ eXquire,Mr. Muthafuckin’ eXquire,by: Phillip Mlynar,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d237f5c49bcdc0008fbc7d4/1:1/w_160/MrMuthafuckineXquire_MrMuthafuckineXquire.jpg,2019-07-11 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mr-muthafuckin-exquire-mr-muthafuckin-exquire/,Chocolate Rabbit,"“Huzzah!” This was the triumphant cry Mr. Muthafuckin' eXquire rode to viral success in 2011. The Brooklyn-raised rapper broke through with an outlandish attitude and fluid flow, bragging about downing half a gallon of budget vodka over an eerily funky beat sourced from underground gore master Necro. A remix to “Huzzah!” roped in Das Racist, Despot, Danny Brown, and El-P, boosting eXquire’s profile even further. He signed to Universal records. The major label platform didn’t work out for the uncompromisingly creative rapper—pretty much to no one’s surprise. As he rhymed after leaving the label, “When I came, niggas said I was just 40s and orgies/Took all the deep shit I rhymed about and ignored it... My stupid ass sold his soul and didn't even get the fame—I ain't even fuck Rihanna.” Eight years later, eXquire finds himself back where he started, self-releasing music entirely on his own terms via his Chocolate Rabbit enterprise. The move feels full circle, like the welcome reclaiming of his soul. eXquire's self-titled album starts in fiery fashion with “FCK Boy!” Over a lo-fi track that sounds like a no-budget Italian horror movie blasting from a dying television, eXquire gets right to the rabble-rousing: “R. Kelly can rot in hell, but his music too good to mute/Oops!/Telling me no more ‘Ignition’ while I'm dancing/But then I'm ‘posed to stand for the fucking national anthem?"" Next, he’s alluding to reparations and a ""Gucci fabric noose” and adding, ""Fuck Prada, Burberry, fuck Louis Vuitton too/They ain’t do nothing racist but that's just in case they do.” The tirade is eXquire in capsule form, erudite and profane, delivering pop culture and politics in a spellbinding, seamless flow. As much as he channels no-fucks-given icons of bygone eras like Ol’ Dirty Bastard, Eazy-E, and Willie D—and Mr. Muthafuckin’ eXquire gleefully hits Efil4zaggin levels of expletives—his lyrics have always offered savvy political commentary and catharsis for those prepared to hear it. On the slinky piano of “Nosediiive,” eXquire namechecks Abbie Hoffman and updates his philosophies for a world of surveillance capitalism, where corporations are “pulling our privacy from under our feet.” “SpankBang favorites and Amazon wish lists/Algorithm trigger words, they put me on their hit list,” he raps. Balancing the politics are eXquire’s reflections on self-doubt and depression. On “RumbleFish,” over a hazy funk beat by long-time foil CONSTROBUZ, eXquire flashes back to being a 12-year-old kid in the projects, retreating behind comic book fantasies and watching his mom in a physically abusive relationship with a man who’d go on to kill his next girlfriend. Despite the heavy subject matter, eXquire’s sing-song flow and the track’s nostalgic glow make it redolent of Slick Rick’s “Hey Young World”—it’s genuinely tender and moving. Naturally, eXquire follows it with the unapologetically coarse “I Love Hoes,” which expresses exactly what its title promises. But that’s always been the real draw with eXquire: He’s a complicated and multi-faceted artist who defies pigeonholing. He conveys this sentiment on the hook to ""RumbleFish"" in pleading terms, where he repeats, “Don't box me in, don't box me in.” It might not be as catchy as “Huzzah,” but it feels twice as heartfelt.","Eight years after “Huzzah,” the Brooklyn rapper is back on his own label, back on his own terms, and just as defiant and provocative as ever.

Who is experimental music?,Lolina,by: Thea Ballard,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d1bc11849bcdc0008fbc627/1:1/w_160/Lolina_whoisexperimentalmusic.jpg,2019-07-11 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lolina-who-is-experimental-music/,self-released,"“Who is experimental music?” is not an obvious question; the syntax doesn’t quite scan. But then, Inga Copeland (formerly one half of lo-fi weirdo-pop duo Hype Williams, alongside Dean Blunt) has never been much interested in taking the obvious route. And her self-released album Who is experimental music? is as opaque as we have come to expect from the UK musician—even if it does seem to come embedded with elementary questions that might guide its reception. I’m thinking in particular of the second track, “Good or bad,” which attaches that binary value judgment to a dry swirl of manipulated voice that stops and starts, gallops and stutters, in an off-kilter rhythm whose structure is largely elusive. Copeland has previously shown that she knows her way around a song. The Lolina project, though, has always had more to do with the song’s dissolution: bare-bones, stretched-out synth-and-vocal drafts that bear half-cooked traces of club tropes. On Who is experimental music, the song dissolves altogether. Instead, we’re presented with a succession of vocal exercises—or, rather, manipulations of recorded voice that dance at the fringes of music, or of the voice’s capacity for human connectivity. It doesn’t always take up much space on her recordings, but Lolina’s voice is one of the coolest and most distinctive in this particular corner of experimental electronic music; she half-sings in low tones, often sounding a little passive, like her melodies have been simplified to conserve energy. Her vocals have provided a way to feel close to her music, which is otherwise reasonably abrasive. It’s funny, then, that this set of recordings is, as far as I can tell, a cappella—pure voice—yet for the most part abstracted to the point of unrecognizability: converted into pure, if ramshackle, rhythm. First, though, there’s space. “Let Go” begins with Copeland intoning that phrase in increasingly echoey iterations separated, at first, by over 10 seconds of silence. The quiet is filled by a looped track of frenetic beatboxing; the sung vocals come unspooled, dissolving into a trail of digital refuse while the rhythm layers and splits in growing chaos. A two-note hint of bass and a lightly melodic “mm-mm-mm” drift the track somewhere a bit clubby, but in its final minutes it rockets back out into less comprehensible territory. A trio of tracks—“Skipping,” “Glitching,” “Strobing”—plays with their titular effects, warping that beatbox-like vocal line so that it falters and folds in on itself. There are skeletons of beats, with tempos that slow and pick up at will. The title track scrambles a man’s voice over an unidentifiable groove, creating a bouncing tinny soundscape painted over with masculine vocals that glitch to point of sounding like scat singing. It stops mid-scramble, as if someone’s pulled the plug on the entire project. Questioning what exactly Lolina means by all of this is, by now, well-trodden territory—simply put, she has weird impulses when it comes to sound, and she doesn’t force upon her listeners the conceptual mechanisms that might motivate her choices. If there’s a formal framework here, it’s inelegantly processing the voice until it’s stripped of its affective and authorial capacities, and that loss begets discomfort for the listener. The good/bad binary winked at on the second track doesn’t do us much good. What’s exciting about Lolina’s approach to experimental music is its casualness, not to mention its sense of humor—its blithe indifference to creating value.","Looping and manipulating voices into strange, lumbering beatbox fugues, Inga Copeland undercuts expectation at every turn.

Cosmic Thrill Seekers,Prince Daddy & the Hyena,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d1cdb1e1e0ca30008a76298/1:1/w_160/PrinceDaddy&TheHyena_CosmicThrillSeekers.jpg,2019-07-11 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/prince-daddy-and-the-hyena-cosmic-thrill-seekers/,Counter Intuitive,"In the Prince Daddy & the Hyena universe, Titus Andronicus’ The Monitor is the greatest album ever made. Not the greatest punk album, or the best of the decade—the greatest ever, better than Pet Sounds, OK Computer, and Illmatic put together. They’ve also namedropped American Idiot and The Black Parade in almost every interview for their boisterously extra second album Cosmic Thrill Seekers, a “Disney soundtrack written by a punk band” tailored to a very specific set of aspirations—they’ve made a fuck-up’s masterpiece, a hero’s journey following a guy who might conquer the world if he could leave his couch. It’s worth noting that Green Day, My Chemical Romance, and Titus weren’t taken seriously before they bumrushed the rockist canon—they were, respectively, a pop-punk institution in a steady commercial decline, avatars for a widely discredited form of emo, and a band most known for playing suburban New Jersey pool parties. Prince Daddy & the Hyena start from an even greater disadvantage—for one thing, they are called Prince Daddy & the Hyena, and they are leading figures in a punk-rock subset often known as sparklepunk, weed emo, party emo or even “meme-o.” A counterbalance to artsy, cerebral acts like The Hotelier or The World Is a Beautiful Place & I Am No Longer Afraid to Die, these bands played riotous basement shows with songs about self-medication, anxiety and self-medicating anxiety as pleasurable and fleeting as a plate of Bagel Bites or the Bagel Bites theme song. Cosmic Thrill Seekers is a concept album in three parts, albeit one with a plot engine about getting high and watching TV—the final act, where one would expect some kind of moral revelation, hinges on consecutive tracks titled “C’mon & Smoke Me Up” and “Klonopin.” “You tried to put a documentary on the galaxy on,” Kory Gregory shrieks, defacing the lovely acoustic guitar progression opening “I Lost My Life.” The song recounts his experience taking LSD-laced Sour Patch Kids and spending years wondering if he’d permanently fucked up his brain chemistry. Before coming down, he watched The Wizard Of Oz and saw it as a metaphor for his own life; he was impressionable and innocent enough to see this revelation as uncharted territory for punk-rock songwriting. Throughout the album, the band flaunts a previously inconceivable range—careening from proggy musical theater (“Dialogue”), to brassy Broadway punk (“Ursula Merger”), Irish drinking interludes (“Dream Nails”) and grim sludge (“Trying Times”), cramming an entire weekend of Fest into 40 or so minutes. The hooks are shameless and Sum-41 snotty, each one like mashing a nuclear-option big red button. Gregory’s bloodied vocals are an acquired taste even for the band’s fans—he sings like he’s rejecting a tracheal transplant—but they are a perfect vehicle for his hyperbolic self-loathing (“I’m pretty fucking confident that I’ll die the next time I’m alone in my bedroom,” or “pretending to sleep, don’t bother talking to me”). Despite the inherent divisiveness of Gregory’s vocals and his misanthropic tendencies, Cosmic Thrill Seekers aspires to personal revolution and communal uplift—members of Strange Ranger and Remo Drive contribute vocals, while Diva Sweetly, Oso Oso, and Kississippi all appear in the video for “Lauren (Track 2).” Gregory and Kississipi’s Zoe Reynolds actually got engaged on stage at Fest. Gregory calls it a “selfish” album, though the music suggests otherwise: Cosmic Thrill Seekers may be intended as Prince Daddy & the Hyena’s masterpiece, but it’s clear that it depicts a guy Gregory is no longer interested in being.","The Albany emo band offer us a fuck-up’s masterpiece, a hero’s journey following a guy who might conquer the world if he could leave his couch.

The ‘Mercury’ Demos,David Bowie,by: Chris O’Leary,,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d1cb53a304621000999708f/1:1/w_160/DavidBowie_TheMercuryDemos.jpg,2019-07-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/david-bowie-the-mercury-demos/,Rhino,"In the spring of 1969, David Bowie had been in exile from pop music for over a year. After splitting with his label, Deram, as they kept rejecting prospective singles, he’d formed a folk trio with his girlfriend, Hermione Farthingale, and John Hutchinson, a guitarist from his former band. Bowie auditioned for plays, crafted a cabaret act, joined a UFO spotting group, performed mime, got bit parts in films and commercials—a typical late-1960s creative experience. But his primary goal was another record deal, and he was running out of options. Philips/Mercury was one of his last shots—most other major UK labels of the ’60s had already released music by him, with no chart success. Befriending a Mercury A&R rep, Bowie had an inside connection, so he and Hutchinson auditioned via a Revox reel-to-reel. The ‘Mercury’ Demos are simply that: 10 demos for Mercury by the folk duo of Bowie and Hutch (Bowie and Farthingale had broken up some months before). Bootlegged for decades, they finally get an official release as part of Parlophone’s ongoing reissue series. Happily, it’s a single LP here and not a cumbersome box set of 7"" singles, as with the Clareville Grove Demos and Spying Through a Keyhole. Unhappily, it’s a single LP of demos whose retail price is more in line with that of a multiple-CD reissue set. The packaging mimics a promo kit from 1969: photo contact sheets and headshots of Bowie and Hutch, a few stapled pages of “typewritten” liner notes. But as with the other Bowie demo sets, it can’t shake looking like a cynical bid for the fan wallet. Perhaps the final touch will be a “master” box set collecting all previous box sets. (Unlike Keyhole, at least, it didn’t wait months to appear on streaming services.) Still, The ‘Mercury’ Demos are of historical interest and, if you’ve not heard the bootlegs, revelatory. There’s a solid upgrade in sound quality, as many bootlegs were based off a tape that appears to have been slightly sped up. The interplay of Hutchinson and Bowie’s guitars and their vocal harmonies are far better distinguished; there are also exchanges and jokes not heard on the most widely circulating boots. Though these were literal bedroom recordings, complete with microphone clunks, quickly tuned strings, noise from another room, and an audible cigarette break, the tapes are the start of David Bowie as he’s generally remembered. His career retrospective Sound + Vision opened with the Mercury demo of “Space Oddity,” included in this set—Bowie marking off where he believed his performing self began and reducing the rest of his ’60s work to juvenilia. Songs fall in a few categories. There are two covers, with prominent Hutchinson vocals: “Life Is a Circus,” written by Roger Bunn, and Lesley Duncan’s “Love Song,” which paid far more dividends for Duncan (a Bowie intimate and fellow UFO enthusiast) when Elton John covered it on Tumbleweed Connection. “She’s very underrated,” Bowie notes before the take. Of greater interest are songs Bowie wrote after his breakup with Farthingale, which he’d record for his 1969 album Space Oddity: “Letter to Hermione” (here under its original title, “I’m Not Quite”) and “An Occasional Dream.” Gorgeous heartbreak mementos, they’re charming and sweet in their bedsit demo forms. The Mercury “An Occasional Dream” (an earlier demo of it appears on Clareville Grove) is preferable to its uptempo crushed-velvet version on 1969’s Space Oddity, with its jaunty recorder arrangement. The Mercury set shows how swiftly Bowie was developing as a songwriter in 1969: Only “Ching-a-Ling,” Donovan-esque hippie flotsam, and the wonderfully odd “When I’m Five” hail from the year before. Freshly minted songs include “Conversation Piece,” destined to be a B-side (introduced as “a new one,” with Bowie prompting Hutchinson with its opening chords) and “Janine,” whose Space Oddity take (unsurprisingly) lacks the “Hey Jude” homage heard on the demo. Then there’s “Lover to the Dawn,” a Bowie/Hutchinson harmonized song about a “bitter girl” that Bowie soon worked into “Cygnet Committee,” an anti-counterculture rant/prophesy/freak-out track. But its centerpiece is “Space Oddity.”. Bowie had honed the song for months, cutting multiple demos, and a full-band take for a promo film. It was Bowie as a shameless magpie, scanning the radio dial and grabbing what he could. A guitar break from Fifth Dimension’s “Carpet Man.” A vocal arrangement in the line of another folk duo: Hutchinson as Ground Control Simon to Bowie’s Major Tom Garfunkel. And a lyric whose scenario isn’t far from the Bee Gees’ death-bubblegum hits “New York Mining Disaster 1941” and “I’ve Gotta Get a Message to You.” The Mercury demo shows how tightly Bowie had constructed the song—it’s the blueprint for its single recording in June 1969. Mercury signed Bowie, and “Space Oddity” hit No. 5 in the UK in late 1969, but he soon sputtered out commercially and didn’t become a star until landing with RCA two years later. Perhaps we’ll hear the groundwork for that record deal soon enough.","A new installment in Parlophone’s ongoing reissue series revisits an oft-bootlegged 1969 session with fellow folkie John Hutchinson: literal bedroom tapes, but still revelatory.

Midsommar (Original Score),Bobby Krlic,by: Margaret Farrell,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d0a3b62c88b6f2a3810d4eb/1:1/w_160/Midsommar.jpg,2019-07-10 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bobby-krlic-midsommar-original-score/,Milan,"Bobby Krlic has been crafting ominous, atmospheric work as the Haxan Cloak for ten years, so it’s no surprise his first stab at a horror-film score is so masterful. The director Ari Aster listened to Krlic’s music while writing the script for Midsommar, his follow-up to last year’s brilliant, slow-burning psychological horror breakout Hereditary. Aster decided who better to write the soundtrack than his muse, and the result is transfixing, gorgeous, and terrifying at once. Even without the film, Krlic’s revelatory work stands on its own. The plot of Midsommar centers on a group of bros who visits remote Scandinavia for a variety of reasons: Pelle is visiting his home village; Josh wants to get some thesis research done; Mark wants to meet women, and Christian is just trying to figure his shit out. Christian has also invited his girlfriend Dani, who has recently suffered a horrible tragedy, in an attempt to repair their relationship, which is hanging by a thread. Whereas Hereditary began in relative mundanity before its plunge into hell, Midsommar throws us into a deranged folk tale within its first fifteen minutes and never lets up for the ensuing two-plus hours. Krlic’s score alternately offers the relief and turns the screws. The film opens with colorful hand-drawn folkloric images coupled with Krlic’s cheery and romantic “Prophecy.” The piece is a breath of fresh air with cherubic vocals and harp strums—music straight from Disney version of Snow White. It’s the perfect tone for a film in which the hand-stitched floral costumes are just as bright and stunning as the blood that is ultimately shed. During “Gassed,” which accompanies one of the film’s most disturbing scenes, strings cry like nails on a chalkboard, sobs of agony collide with aching violins. Krlic’s drastic tone shifts map precisely onto Aster’s story, but they are just as dramatic on their own. There’s a sinister aspect to Aster’s choice of setting during the midnight sun. Evil doesn’t come from the shadows; it walks out into the blazing light, rendering the ensuing murder and chaos no more comprehensible. Even though darkness can be terrifying, the routine of day and night provides its own comfort. At first, Krlic’s soundtrack captures the instinctive panic that comes with the upset of environmental and cultural norms. But as Aster’s characters grow acclimated to their new surroundings, he relieves us with symphonic moments of clarity (“The Blessing”) and triumph. “Fire Temple” is his exquisite farewell with strings that writhe with sorrow, with intensity, with relief. In life or death, none of these emotions are exclusive, and Krlic’s work continually reminds us that it’s all one tremendous grey area.","Bobby Krlic (aka the Haxan Cloak) scores Ari Aster’s nightmarish new film Midsommar, and the result is transfixing, gorgeous, and terrifying at once.

Eternal Children,Equiknoxx,by: Wayne Marshall,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d1cbbd882ada80008ddf65f/1:1/w_160/Equiknoxx_EternalChildren.jpg,2019-07-10 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/equiknoxx-eternal-children/,Equiknoxx Music,"While the Jamaican group made waves with previous collections of instrumentals, addressing a different, international audience than earlier productions aimed at Kingston’s dance halls, Equiknoxx’s latest finds the whole crew producing a set of songs that aim to bring together, and hold in productive tension, reggae groundings and open-eared experiments in post-diasporic Jamaican music. In merging earthy dancehall with out-there excursions, Eternal Children frequently delivers vocals that brim with sound design and abstraction that goes for the gut. On 2016’s Bird Sound Power and 2017’s Colón Man, both released via Manchester electronic duo Demdike Stare’s DDS label, Equiknoxx distinguished themselves as whimsical, precise producers steeped in Jamaica’s musical wellsprings but inspired by reggae’s transformations in the wider world. On Eternal Children, the quirky riddims of Gavin “Gavsborg” Blair, Jordan “Time Cow” Chung, and Nick “Bobby Blackbird” Deane not only stand on their own but support a range of vocalists and genres. Rounding out the group, dedicated vocalists Shanique Marie and Kemikal ride the tracks with aplomb, speaking in tongues at once global and Kingstonian. Less a return to roots than it may seem, Eternal Children reveals that, like dancehall itself, the Equiknoxx sound is as outernational as ever. Dancehall has always been cosmopolitan even as its artists, soundsystems, and producers prioritize downtown Kingston sensibilities. This commitment to local aesthetics has, ironically, allowed Jamaican music to flourish beyond the island, often taking forms that respond to new contexts and audiences. The Equiknoxx sound embodies their own practice of listening intently back to the echoes of diaspora—to the shifting shapes Jamaican music takes in such sites as Brooklyn, Berlin, Atlanta, and Manchester. That was already true of their instrumental work, and with the addition of vocals and lyrics on Eternal Children, the reference points multiply. Consider “Manchester,” an ode to the city where Equiknoxx spends time working with the Swing Ting collective: The song triangulates a specific locale by sounding like several places at once. Over attenuated horn samples and chugging bass that more closely resembles the sludgy techno-dub of Stefan Betke than anything to come out recently from Jamaica, Shanique Marie recites a litany of grimey British mates while Swing Ting’s MC Fox brings UK soundsystem style to the proceedings, eagerly sending shoutouts back to the island. The chorus offers trademark Equiknoxx humor by referencing the quotidian, “Went on a tram inna Manchester,” paired with some stylish nonsense, “Ta-ta-ta-ta ta-ta ta-ta-ta-ta”—a nod to Missy Elliott’s scat-like patter on “Work It.” Equiknoxx’s instrumentals still enjoy a certain pride of place on Eternal Children. Songs come into shape and recede again as the instrumentals accrue and reveal their strata. The group’s experimentalism is still very much on display, now grounded by verses and choruses, with their penchant for off-kilter rhythms, spacey textures, and crisp, foley-like timbres. Their attention to sculpting every element in the mix remains exacting, giving them control over the stereo field. While the number of ideas can seem dense, Equiknoxx also exercise a restraint that keeps things tense, texturally spacious, and unhurried. Jamaican rhythms and bass are a constant presence, but here they seem unmoored from any current vogues. They’re often slower, weirder, ripped from time, timeless. No doubt the album could have been released as a third collection of instrumentals (and perhaps should be), but the addition of voices adds a whole heap, as they say in Jamaica. Eternal Children revels in Jamaican archetypes, including the rude and vulgar, an approach that no doubt will seduce some listeners and repel others. On “Grave,” for instance, Kemikal and Alozade work to channel Lee “Scratch” Perry’s inspired incantations, the absurdist stylings of Eek-a-Mouse, and the meta-dancehall Jamaican comedy duo Twin of Twins: explicit sex talk, scatological references aplenty, and disrespect for the dead are punctuated by cartoonish jungle sounds, including a cliched monkey’s “ooh ooh ahh ahh” in the middle of the chorus. The thunderous, clacking beat looming beneath them sounds as likely to have been cooked up by London’s Kevin “The Bug” Martin or to support a verse from late Hyperdub vocalist Spaceape. This is not your daddy’s dub, or his dancehall for that matter. The vocals on Eternal Children may be a jarring and puzzling presence, especially those unfamiliar with dancehall mores and Jamaican mythologies. But several standout performances, especially by Shanique Marie, carry the album and give it a sound rooted in a history of Jamaican women getting fierce and funny on the mic. Marie pays sly tribute to this lineage while nodding to its wider influence on “Move Along” by teasing a cherished reggae melody from Deborahe Glasgow’s “Don’t Test Me,” a song made famous by a re-take with Shabba Ranks and, perhaps more so, by the Notorious B.I.G.’s interpolation of the tune on the remix of Junior M.A.F.I.A.’s “Get Money.” Incidentally, Equiknoxx recorded much of the new album at the Kingston studio of Gussie Clarke, who produced “Don’t Test Me.” Eternal Children stands as a showcase for the formidable skills of Shanique Marie, who outshines her fellows here and deserves the wider acclaim this album may bring. But Bobby Blackbird turns in some strong takes too, especially on “Brooklyn,” a strikingly anthemic offering from the group, if one that seems to celebrate a borough frozen in time. “Ain’t no shook hands in Brooklyn” is a great line but in 2019 seems like a pre-gentrification sentiment, a throwback to the 1980s and ’90s when Jamaican culture imbued the borough with cool and deadly style. When Marie jumps into the chorus with distorted and chopped vocals, she insists that the international music and culture inspired by Jamaica over the last few decades lives and breathes and reigns, especially in places where Jamaican icons like Biggie Smalls adorn murals as local royalty. Whether Equiknoxx can reach the sizeable audience that remains in thrall to the sounds of Jamaica and its vast musical diaspora is something Eternal Children seems keen to test.

I'm Losing Myself,An Isolated Mind,by: Andy O'Connor,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d128f3f1cfa49000916cf4f/1:1/w_160/ImLosingMyself_AnIsolatedMind.jpg,2019-07-10 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/an-isolated-mind-im-losing-myself/,"I, Voidhanger","Kameron Bogges wrote and recorded his first album as An Isolated Mind following a week-long stint at a psychiatric hospital and a subsequent bipolar diagnosis. Though rooted in black metal, the music he makes under this alias veers off in multiple directions, charting bipolar disorder’s hellish exhilarations and its debilitating lows. He self-released I’m Losing Myself in March, but now it’s available physically through I, Voidhanger Records, curators of outre and fringe black and death metal. Losing is not a unified listen, but the brutal seams reflect its subject. “Turritopsis dohrnii” is the most tumultuous song, churning through discordant bits of black metal, synthesizer, and goth piano before opening into starlit post-rock guitar. Even a more conventional song like “Pathologized Existence” can’t stay on one track for long. Frantic subgenre-hopping around isn’t new for Bogges; his previous project Four Hoove Death Pig also played with stylistic collisions. But the stakes are higher here: for Bogges, exploration becomes a way to rebuild himself. The last two tracks, “I’m Losing Myself” and “I’ve Lost Myself,” take up nearly half of the record, and they’re a devastating combo. “Losing” travels through desolate, bell-like bass, chilling strings, and errant, faint percussion, leading to “Lost’s” ambient drones, where there’s no metal, no drums, no direction, no hope. Unlike most ambient music, which encourages getting lost, “I’ve Lost Myself” feels claustrophobic and eerily blank. After the tumult, it feels less like release and more like surrender. Bogges captures depression at its most devastating: when your capacity to feel dissipates, where you can’t even conjure extreme sadness or self-hatred. Depression isn’t one monolithic mood, after all, but a complicated force with great internal violence. One-man black metal is usually born of self-imposed isolation and self-righteous anti-humanism; Losing depicts how dangerous isolation can be for an already-fragile mind state. In that way, it feels painfully real, even intimate. Black metal is so often depicted as a destructive force, but Bogges uses it to heal.","Kameron Bogges makes one-man black metal that charts the hellish exhilarations and debilitating lows of bipolar disorder.

Revenge of the Dreamers III,Various Artists,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d23b9c3da8a77000924b008/1:1/w_160/revengeofthedreamersIII.jpg,2019-07-09 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-revenge-of-the-dreamers-iii/,DreamvilleInterscope,"The only person to rap on three J. Cole albums released over the last five years has been, well, J. Cole. “I’m reaching a point in my career over this past year where I don’t want to look back 20 years from now and be like, ‘I never worked with nobody; I never had no fun’,” he says early in the new making-of documentary REVENGE. What started as an empty gesture flaunted by a passionate fanbase soon became a meme wielded by his haters. Going it solo affords you full credit for your ideas and successes, to be sure, but the flip side of that coin is isolation. When you’re the only voice in the studio, or at least the only one that matters, the booth can become an echo chamber. The Revenge of the Dreamers III compilation is an attempt to reconnect J. Cole with his peers. He seems humbled by his interactions with younger rappers in the wake of the abstinence-core of KOD and the schoolmarmish “1985 (Intro to The Fall Off).” He’s hungry for collaborative energy, to find a new sense of community that can both enlighten and inspire him. Though not always unified in vision, Dreamers III reveals new bonds born of passion, circumstance, and shared experience. J. Cole’s label Dreamville touts itself as “the label of the connected age,” but it has been all but sequestered from the wider rap community until earlier this year. After previous Dreamville comps were produced as an assortment of solo songs with a few features spliced in over email, the label heads wanted to get everyone in the same room. So for 10 days in January, the Dreamville roster convened at Tree Sound Studios in Atlanta. Gilded posters requesting the “presence and participation” of over 100 rappers, singers, and producers were sent out. Invited participants started posting their summons on Twitter and Instagram, and the mystique and intrigue of the thing started to take hold. But the Dreamville bosses never imagined these sessions would turn from a label summit to massive assembly of the rap Avengers. Of the more than 124 songs created during those creative powwows, Cole and Dreamville president Ibrahim Hamad settled on 18 for the final Revenge of the Dreamers  III project. A handful are big posse cuts, but it’s largely run-of-the-mill team-ups, solo singles, and a few songs split into two. The Dreamville natives take precedence on the comp, pushing everyone else into the margins. Atlanta’s J.I.D gets to chop it up with one-time king T.I. over old flames, their “Ladies, Ladies, Ladies” a more cordial spin on JAY-Z’s “Girls, Girls, Girls.” “Down Bad” cuts a Young Nudy verse short to get into a Dreamville posse cut. Though the outsiders sometimes feel like window-dressing, they do get some quality time. The idea of the comp is perfectly realized on “Got Me,” where three producers warp Faith Evans’ “Come Over” into an aphrodisiac for mixed company; Ari Lennox, Ty Dolla $ign, Omen, and Dreezy pair off for a jam that feels like being wrapped in the embrace at a slow dance. Then there’s “1993,” a cypher inside a smoke session, where each rapper’s verse gets interrupted by someone yelling to pass the blunt and keep the rotation moving. It’s an apt and unwitting commentary on how the compilation is at its most organic when the rotations are fluid, no one says too much, and everyone’s on the same page. The best parts of DreamersIII are when Cole & Friends mix it up with their guests and step outside of their comfort zones. “Don’t Hit Me Right Now” pairs Dreamville’s Bas, Cozz, and Ari Lennox with Buddy, Guapdad 4000, and Yung Baby Tate and they mesh into a muggy Galimatias production. On “LamboTruck,” Dreamville’s Cozz and TDE’s Reason brainstorm robbing each other’s respective label bosses in one of the few coherent ideas that extends beyond just outrapping one another. Few verses on the album are particularly memorable outside of spots from Maxo Kream, Vince Staples, a string of appearances from the consistently good J.I.D, and the standalone moments of introspection from J. Cole himself. But the comp works because it never feels forced or closed off to ideas. Cole sheds the trap parody of KOD to really identify with those younger than him, even if it’s just to reach an understanding: We’ll all be better off if we work together. “Everything grows/It’s destined to change/I love you lil niggas/I’m glad that you came,” Cole raps on “Middle Child,” and though he’s speaking generally, it feels representative of this successful meeting of the minds.","The first spoils of the fabled Dreamville sessions feature J. Cole and his label mostly thriving in a collaborative environment.

Dawnbreaker,Daughter of Swords,by: Linnie Greene,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cc89bce5a46c237a709761b/1:1/w_160/Dawnbreaker.jpg,2019-07-09 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/daughter-of-swords-dawnbreaker/,Nonesuch,"The persistent pluck of guitar strings is the sound of all that’s fleeting: Robert Johnson’s desperate attempt to flag a ride in “Cross Road Blues,” Bob Dylan’s peripatetic lovers in “Tangled Up in Blue,” Phoebe Bridgers’ trek down “Scott Street.” The meandering strings call to mind a stumble towards or away from some urgent place, a march that mirrors the slap of two feet. Daughter of Swords’s Dawnbreaker, the solo debut from Alexandra Sauser-Monnig—one of three singers in the North Carolina folk trio Mountain Man—is the latest album to chronicle these liminal blues, a 10-song homage to the betwixt and between of a relationship in its twilight. In these folksy riffs on well-trod terrain—heartbreak, confusion, hope that looks like the horizon on an open highway—Daughter of Swords adds a layer of nuance and tenderness to the panoply of songs that came before. It’s hardly a new vista, but Sauser-Monnig’s intimate, earthy songs make the view memorable all the same. Sauser-Monnig can draw the perfect shape of a bruised heart with a blindfold on. There are country ballads (“Easy is Hard”) that conjure sleepless nights listening to the radio on without a single misplaced, derivative note. “Shining Woman” soundtracks the narrator’s admiration of a bicyclist climbing California’s Highway 1,  recognizing the role of other women’s kindness and inspiration during lovelorn, dejected times. “Long Leaf Pine,” which conjures an afternoon in the North Carolina woods near Sauser-Monnig’s home, marks the record’s highest achievement, an old-fashioned incantation adorned in harmonies that wears its list of flora and fauna like a ceremonial wreath: blackberry, muscadine, snake, rabbit, all ordered such that anyone from the region could almost teleport to a certain lake, a certain peace that feels like sadness. Sauser-Monnig’s vocals land lightly, more chickadee than cardinal. She is dexterous and pliant as a willow. It follows that the best songs on the record don’t force a compromise between instrumentation and melody, as with “Human,” whose wistful simplicity is searing. “You can’t will a love to life/But you can do the loving thing/Make like a bird and fly,” she sings. Backed by the simple strums of a guitar, it’s a moment of held breath, like a prayer. Dawnbreaker has its imperfections. The record’s second half has more heft than its first, where the poppy levity of “Gem” and “Shining Woman” seem hesitant compared to the sparer, more intimate arrangements that suit her best. But even when it falters, Daughter of Swords’ debut captures the sun passing through a hot car in a nowhere town, the Big Gulp melting in the cupholder, the stops on a trajectory whose end is never entirely clear. It’s a record so precise as to be sensory, whose arrangements of harmonies, guitars, and lonesome trills are like the intake of breath before a faltering step.

The Flower and the Vessel,Félicia Atkinson,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d02b574b6e2e3ea8bc9d3cf/1:1/w_160/TheFlowerAndTheVessel_FeliciaAtkinson.jpg,2019-07-09 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/felicia-atkinson-the-flower-and-the-vessel/,Shelter Press,"On Félicia Atkinson’s 2017 solo album Hand to Hand, she said, “I wanted to make sounds like cacti, with water and secrets inside.” She succeeded: Pairing almost unnervingly intimate whispers with heavily abstracted synthetic tones, the album guarded a vivid interior life beneath its prickly exterior. But as Atkinson began recording the music that would become The Flower and the Vessel, her perception of the relationship between inner and outer realms began to shift. She was pregnant at the time, and she found herself feeling estranged twice over, caught between her surroundings and the new life growing inside her. In hotel rooms at night, as she composed on her laptop and murmured voice memos into her phone, she asked, “What am I doing here? How can I connect myself to the world?” The Flower and the Vessel is Atkinson’s answer to that question. It is, she says, “a record not about being pregnant but a record made with pregnancy.” The music carries within it the idea of form coming into being; it moves away from the freeform drift of her previous albums and glides toward a nascent kind of order. Though the album uses sumptuous sounds like a Fender Rhodes, marimba, and vibraphone, its essence remains pensive and sometimes unsettling. Many of the record’s hushed, interwoven elements guard their identities. Contrasting rhythms form a lattice of complementary pulses: On the ominous centerpiece “You Have to Have Eyes,” a deep boat-engine throb mixes in with rapid-fire insect oscillations, creaking doors, and a voice looped like lapping waves. “You had to have eyes in the back of your head,” she murmurs, her voice turned strange and glassy by digital distortion. As always, there are Atkinson’s uncomfortably close whispers—lips practically brushing the mic, the grain of her voice rendered in molecular detail. She slips between English and French, and though the meaning of her words is not always apparent, the tone of her voice lends a dead-of-night intensity that renders the music’s pockets of silence all the more potent. It is as though you were locked in urgent conversation with her, or even eavesdropping on her very thoughts. But the invasive nature of the tactic—“Whispering is a way to get inside your ear,” she has said—puts an ominous, alienating spin on what we normally think of as an intimate sound. With many of her texts repurposed from found sources, the precise meaning of most of these songs remains hidden. In “Shirley to Shirley,” she reads excerpts from a conversation between the artists Shirley Kaneda and Shirley Jaffe in Bomb Magazine in an electronically processed voice. In “Un Ovale Vert,” she reads a portion of one of David Antin’s improvised “talk poems” and then, in French, intones images from her own visual art (“a white ball, a green oval”). She is fascinated by the way ideas pass from medium to medium; the methodical way she arranges her sounds is almost painterly. (She also cites ikebana, the Japanese art of flower arrangement, as an influence on the album’s careful sense of balance and proportion.) The album closes with “Des Pierres,” an 18-minute collaboration with Stephen O’Malley, of Sunn O))), which threads Atkinson’s whispers through nebulous clouds of milky drones and guitar feedback. She calls it an “open reading” of a history of images in stone—that is, the accidental “landscapes” found in gems and geodes—written by the French literary critic Roger Caillois. It’s a characteristically erudite reference, but its presence can be traced throughout the music: the guitars roiling like cloudy agate or glistening like an expanse of obsidian. Again, Atkinson returns to the idea of inside (the crystalline image revealed in a cross-section) versus outside (the rock’s nubby exterior). In the album’s opening track, she whispers a poem to her unborn child, meditating on the way that her voice travels through her body to her baby’s ears, and here, at the album’s end, she plunges us deep into that amniotic world.","The methodical arrangements and uncomfortably close whispers of the experimental French musician, poet, and visual artist bring us further inside her surreal world.

Elided in this long tradition of lullabies is the darkness of motherhood—all the notions that might spur nightmares rather than abate them. With Stonechild, Jesca Hoop complicates centuries of feminized folk music by singing about the ugly, violent aspects of motherhood. Stillbirth, spousal abuse, sexism inherited from mother to daughter—all claim vignettes on this record of electro-folk, seeking, much like Love did, to render motherhood in fucking intense terms. The album’s thesis statement arrives early, in the opening of “Old Fear of Father,” when Hoop sings, “I love my boys more than I love my girl/She knows like I knew.” What follows is a regretful portrait of a woman so limited by her own possibilities that she can only imagine the same small, dim future for her daughter: “I’ll shape and mold you so you can get the ring while you’re still pretty.” Like Lucy Dacus on her recent Mother’s Day single, “My Mother & I,” Hoop imagines a mother as both inheritor and progenitor of misogyny. Her songs about this vicious circle reach centuries into the past, deploying subtle historical imagery and traditional melodies to awaken something atavistic. “Shoulder Charge” is especially masterful on this count, walking the tightrope between modernity and ancestry. A line like “These leathers shield my sadness so nobody sees” could refer to a woman in a bar, wrapped in a motorcycle jacket, downing whiskey, or they could call to mind Boudicca on the battlefield, decked out in Celtic armor to avenge her daughters. At the song’s end, the numb alienation of waiting on a subway platform, “shoulder to shoulder to shoulder,” is transformed by a single cry—“Charge!”—into an ancient call to arms. “Outside of Eden,” a duet with Kate Stables of This Is the Kit and, lately, of the National, is the record’s most overt melding of old and new worlds as they apply to women’s lives. Hoop and Stables pose as digital sirens, singing to the incels of the world: “Come, shut-in boys, for the girlfriend experience/Enter the code and I’ll taste real.” The Garden of Eden is the song’s central, ambiguous metaphor: Do these men seek virtual-reality porn because they feel unworthy of real love, or is their digital Eden a soothing fantasy that shields them from the mortifying ordeal of being known? There’s empathy in Hoop’s lyrics for isolated, alienated men who seek intimacy in digital space, and a heavy dose of contempt for those who regard violent misogyny as a balm for their wounds. The record’s production, by PJ Harvey and Aldous Harding collaborator John Parish, complements Hoop’s lyrical tension between past and present through the careful, restrained use of electronic elements, many so subtle they pass without notice on first listen. On “Foot Fall to the Path,” a sudden surge of electric guitar ruptures Hoop’s careful fingerpicking, making narrator’s desperation—“Why love if loving never lasts? I’ll never have what other lovers have”—all the more vivid. The murky filter of Parish’s production lends a grim heft to Hoop’s lyrics, sending would-be nursery rhymes like “Death Row” into witchy territory. The album’s title, Stonechild, refers to a gruesome—and mercifully, exceedingly rare—biological phenomenon called lithopedia: a dead fetus, too large to be reabsorbed by the parent’s body, grows a calcified shell to shield the mother’s body from infected fetal tissue. A parent can carry a stone child for decades without knowing, and carry on having successful, uncomplicated pregnancies all the while. Stone babies have been a grim constant for centuries, documented as early as the 10th century and diagnosed as recently as 2015. The word is eerily apt for Hoop’s work, which lays bare the visceral terror lurking behind the traditional, tender lore of motherhood.

Building Bridges,Move D,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d13904ff3ed35000960a64f/1:1/w_160/MoveD_BuildingBridges.jpg,2019-07-08 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/move-d-building-bridges/,Aus,"Germany has an impressive, almost counterintuitive, record of mixing dub with electronic music, from Basic Channel’s icy minimal techno to Pole’s spectral glitch. Move D—aka Heidelberg’s David Moufang—is a lesser-known figure in this line of Teutonic dub explorers, working the crossover between dub and house music on tracks like 2006’s “Silk Dub,” and employing subtly shifting repetition, echo, and space to devious effect. The songs on Building Bridges, Moufang’s debut album for Will Saul’s Aus Music, were recorded between 1999 and 2019, and they largely share “Silk Dub”’s mixture of undulating 4/4 beats, echoing effects, and basslines that sit somewhere the funk imperative of disco and the spacey wanderings of dub. Within these limited parameters, however, Moufang manages to wring impressive variation, from the dubbed-out French touch of “Cycles” to “Perpetual State,” where house music is a dilated, glitchy memory found in the suggestion of a drum pattern. It helps that Moufang’s sound is warm and welcoming by nature, a mixture of light melodic touches and gently pulsating drums that reeks of indolence on a sunny day. There is something particularly well rounded about this album—a smoothly tactile quality that glides like well-varnished wood under stockinged feet. Only on the title track, a collaboration with the American house producer Fred P, does this sonic benevolence spill over into something cloying, as a voice makes banal pronouncements about people coming together that end up sounding trite, to the detriment of the crystalline drum production. Luckily, this doesn’t detract too much from an extremely elegant album that makes its mark with whispered tonal shifts rather than bothersome handbrake turns. “Cycles” is a wonderful musical tease, distilling a sense of perpetual motion out of a handful of subtly modulating sonic ideas and a rippling bassline, like peak Motorbass; “One Small Step” (featuring Jonah Sharp and Thomas Fehlmann) is a leisurely paddle of guitar noodle, submersed bass, and percussive sound effects that could soundtrack a dolphin’s waking dream; and “Perpetual State” suggests house music slowly dissolving over a crackling open fire, helped along by a spidery suggestion of melody. This strain of caramel-smooth production has little to do with the raw speaker-rattling sound of classic 1970s dub productions. But what Move D has done, much like Basic Channel, Pole and the Orb before him, owes plenty to the genre's exploration of the spaces between infinite shades of reverb. Building Bridges represents the exquisite suggestion of dub, the airborne arrival of the Jamaican sound upon German shores in a breezy triumph of experimentation.

Simian Angel,Oren Ambarchi,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf8379aa8350ac5f9696569/1:1/w_160/SimianAngel_OrenAmbarchi.jpg,2019-07-08 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/oren-ambarchi-simian-angel/,Editions Mego,"The Australian multi-instrumentalist Oren Ambarchi has made the single LP side his canvas. His wispy electroacoustic pieces tend to work best at 15 to 20 minutes a pop—compact enough to retain their focus, yet roomy enough to reward immersion. Simian Angel demonstrates Ambarchi’s mastery of the form across a pair of aqueous ambient explorations shot through with loosely tangled melodic lines. Simian Angel has the free-associative drift of his loosest improv pieces and a sublimated sense of groove. It opens tentatively, with a watery, synth-like tone drizzled over Brazilian percussionist Cyro Baptista’s patient, pitter-pat conga slaps. Two minutes pass like this, then four; in the background, counterpoint synth pads glisten like frost on a field. Whatever instrument Ambarchi is playing—on the sleeve, he is credited simply with “guitars & whatnot”—his melodic figures have a searching quality, like water trickling downhill. Gradually, his tone fattens, and as Baptista trades the congas for gentle shaker rhythms, the spectrum fills with a thrumming, organ-like buzz. It ends as gradually as it began, settling into the root note like an old house cooling after a hot summer’s day. On the B-side, the title track offers a more vigorous take on the same basic material. It opens with a twangy, percussive pattern played on the berimbau—an acoustic string instrument capable of psychedelic pitch-shifting and tremolo effects—that gives the track a forceful push. That momentum carries “Simian Angel” across its 20-minute runtime, even though Baptista sits out for long stretches. Here, Ambarchi uses his guitar first to conjure those organ-like tones (an effect he achieves by running his instrument through a Leslie speaker, whose tremolo is closely associated with the sound of the Hammond organ) and then a bright, crisp facsimile of acoustic piano. Both tracks are powered by melodic instincts that have rarely played such a dominant role in Ambarchi’s music. Over the years, he’s shown us plenty of sides to his playing—brainy, brawny, barely there—but on Simian Angel, we get a glimpse of something new: something sensitive, probing, and even whimsical.

playroom,Nathan Bajar,by: Michelle Kim,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d02ba84f605601c8e4d3904/1:1/w_160/playroom_11.jpg,2019-07-08 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nathan-bajar-playroom/,In Real Life,"Nathan Bajar’s pictures evoke intimacy through haziness. Just take a look at the Brooklyn artist’s stunning portraits of Lakeith Stanfield, serpentwithfeet, or his own extended family in the Philippines, each imbued with soft, blurred lines and the warm tones of vintage film stock. With a delicate touch and apparent talent for bringing out the tenderness in people, Bajar casts his subjects in a nostalgic glow. His affinity for the warm and romantic extends to his lo-fi funk music, which he ornaments with tape hiss, soothing electric guitars, and weathered drum loops. This attention to detail is apparent in the psychedelic and sprawling production on his debut album, playroom. But it’s hard to know what he’s trying to get across besides just a dreamy vibe. His taste and his craftsmanship are self-evident: playroom’s layered production is a pleasure to listen to, and it synthesizes a variety of influences. The reverb-washed guitars resembles those in Mac DeMarco’s slacker rock, the funky basslines recall Kali Uchis and Steve Lacy, and the woozy beats sound like they could have been made for the soul-sampling New York rappers MIKE and Medhane. There are also intriguing auxiliary moments sprinkled throughout the project, like the video-game bleeps and bloops in “playroom (lover’s paradise),” the Funkadelic-esque adlibs on “purple hearts,” and jagged saxophone solo and sweeping string parts of “camille.” It’s the kind of album that you could put on repeat and find something new with every listen, as little instrumental bits peek out from the swirling, nebulous tracks. But Bajar’s lyrics aren’t nearly as evocative as his production. On “the view,” he tries to justify his wandering eye in the tritest of terms: “Wasn’t going to touch/Just enjoying the view.” Then there’s “silver surfer,” whose quasi-romantic lyrics might be found scrawled in a seventh grader’s notebook: “Are you riding/If you say no, girl/You’ll give me the blues.” “purple hearts,” which has a catchy hook and fun, off-beat ad-libs, never quite lives up to its potential because the vague lyrics fail to elucidate the story he’s trying to tell. “Didn’t mean to waste your time/Our love was war/Taking eye for eye,” Bajar sings, using tired language to describe a moth-eaten subject. Though Bajar’s low-key approach helps him achieve nuance in his photographs, it actually ends up doing the opposite in his music. A handful of songs on playroom are about Bajar’s late father, who passed away suddenly last summer. On “the table,” Bajar reflects on his death: “My father now lives in the sky/One last seat at the table,” he sings with a meandering melody and a thick layer of harmonies that partially obscures his diction. Though it’s a touching tribute, Bajar doesn’t give his words the space to be heard, and too many instruments clamor for attention. With all his experience masterfully capturing other people’s humanity, Bajar seems hesitant to sharpen the focus on his own.","An artist known for his photographs turns his hand to music; his hazy, lo-fi productions strive for the analog warmth of his portraits, but they lack his pictures’ intimacy and empathy.

Waves,Sofia Bolt,by: Sophie Kemp ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d127cf3303a81150c51228a/1:1/w_160/sofiabolt_waves.jpg,2019-07-08 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sofia-bolt-waves/,Loantaka,"During a breakup, you fantasize about dramatic reinvention. Maybe you'll move across the ocean, change your hair, pick up a new hobby. For Amélie Rousseaux, the French-American musician who performs as Sofia Bolt, post-breakup reinvention entailed swapping Paris for L.A., getting into surfing—and oh, writing a slightly clumsy, mostly lovely debut album called Waves. The first thing you notice about Waves is the atmosphere. On opener “London 2009,” Rousseaux recalls the initial spark of attraction over snippets of party chatter, clinked glasses, and pouty-lipped surf-rock guitars. “I was so drawn to you/Artistic, timid, cute,” she sings. Her lyrics are often messy, with endearingly clunky rhyme schemes and the occasional cliché, but she’s aided by talented session musicians and oceans of reverb. Sometimes, Rousseaux plays it a little too cool for her own good. On “Ojai,” she casts her disaffected eye across a room full of “wannabe hippies,” sounding not so much above it all as detached. After pontificating about hot springs and horizons, she switches to French and allows a beach-rock guitar solo to see her out. The arrangements are distinctive, but Rousseaux’s own voice gets a little lost. The title track, which comes in two versions, offers the biggest surprise. The first version sounds like every other song on the record: moody, chic, simmering. The second, appearing at the very end, is arranged by the legendary Van Dyke Parks. The master L.A. weirdo’s trademark orchestral flourishes move through the flimsy song like a summer storm spinning a weather vane; it’s a trip to hear Parks’ work punctuating lines as facile as “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger” and “hella easy.” But ultimately, Waves is a debut. It’s an asymmetrical listen, and that’s fine; there’s more than enough promise here. Amélie Rousseaux moved halfway across the world to heal, and it is a pleasure to hear her processing.","On her debut, the French-American musician offers a broken heart, a jaded eye, oceans of surf-rock reverb, and a Van Dyke Parks cameo.

The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time,Koji Kondo,by: Gabriel Szatan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d1cb9d382ada80008ddf65c/1:1/w_160/LegendOfZelda_OcarinaOfTime.jpg,2019-07-07 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/koji-kondo-the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/,Nintendo,"Ever since those four notes guided enemies down the screen in 1978’s Space Invaders, video game music has remained one of the most commonly heard sounds across the world. Yet there is a disconnect between its outsize popularity and its critical recognition. Game soundtracks rarely pad out year-end lists or are regularly reviewed in music magazines, let alone considered as credible listening options outright. The soundtrack for Ocarina of Time, the fifth edition of The Legend of Zelda—a flagship series for Nintendo that inspires such slavish devotion, both Robin Williams’ daughter and Seth Rogen’s spaniel share its name—was so full of creativity and color and wonder that it presented the most convincing possible case to argue game music belongs in the canon. The score, composed by Nintendo’s in-house MVP Koji Kondo, was the first that truly thrived outside of its originating medium, a game centered around an ancient flute-like instrument. It quickly took on a second life as open-source material, where it was enjoyed, adapted, and shared. An entire generation grew up around the explosive popularity of the game in the late 1990s, which explains why mash-up producers feel compelled to slap Clipse over “Lost Woods,” or why countless symphonic orchestras tour their own reinterpretations, and why a genre named Zeldawave exists at all. From the stirring opening screen to the weepy final credits, the music that flows through Ocarina of Time was a generational Rosetta Stone, encompassing Gregorian chants, Arabic scales, harp, flamenco, dark ambience, and at least one rip-off of Gustav Holst’s The Planets—an unforced and generous way to transmit those sounds into the homes of millions. In the 21 years since its release, Kondo’s score remains the one component of the game that has not dated, even as every facet of the industry has advanced by orders of magnitude. By eschewing what was or wasn’t in vogue, Kondo instead hit upon timelessness. Koji Kondo understood the medium of video game music better than anyone. A young fan of regional jazz fusion acts Casiopea and Sadao Watanabe, as well as the grandiose prog of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, he rolled out the Osaka School of Arts in 1984 and straight into a job at his first and only company, Nintendo. He was part of their inaugural wave of sound technicians, hired at a time when the blocky tones pumping out of arcade machines served little purpose beyond luring quarters; a ubiquitous but characterless wavelength, ripe for someone to stamp their imprint. Although the Nintendo Entertainment System was able to play only three notes simultaneously, his score for 1985’s Super Mario Brothers was a revelation: Pixelated fish fluttered along to the rhythm of watery waltzes; the Underworld was a melody-devoid inversion of the Overworld; and you always seemed to be falling down crevices or spoing!-ing off enemy heads pleasingly in time with the music. Variables in how the game functioned were limited, which allowed Kondo to work with Nintendo’s still-small team to compose a soundtrack that existed as an invisible master hand, guiding player movement along while remaining catchy enough to be something that will be hummed or strummed along to until oceans burn. Kondo was gifted a chance to set the parameters of a compositional practice in its infancy. Attempting to make game music diaristic was a dead end. Even Ennio Morricone’s finest film scores existed for situations that you could come across in everyday life, more or less: Binaries of love and hate, comfort and danger, hope and despair, played out with human bodies and recognizable locations. There never could be a relatable analog for Zelda’s elfin hero, Link, strafing around the belly of a whale king or being hounded by flaming skulls, so why bother? Repetition was equally a double-edged sword to master. Get it wrong, and you’re subjecting the listener to a banal ditty over and over and over. Get it right, and you’re creating something familiar to millions yet indelibly personal to the player. By the mid-’90s, Kondo was so accomplished with working through the challenges of constrained composition that the Super Nintendo’s successor, a 64-bit machine with the capacity to replicate sound significantly closer to actual music, might have seemed like letting the rest of the industry start on easy mode. If Nintendo 64, which hit the market in the summer of 1996, broke the stratosphere of what 3D gaming could achieve with its launch title, Super Mario 64, 1998’s Ocarina of Time was the first successful attempt to stick a moon landing. Released with just 39 days left on the calendar, it still became the biggest seller of the year, besting an impressive class of ’98 that contained Metal Gear Solid, Half-Life, Banjo-Kazooie, and StarCraft. An instant hall-of-famer, Ocarina of Time improved on just about everything that came before it: immense scope, absorbing lore, dynamic storytelling, elaborate presentation—and music. Kondo now faced an entirely new challenge to make his vision pay off. The N64’s audio fidelity and internal memory were terrible. To add embellishments to a track, you might need to bargain with coders to discreetly leave one part of the map with the uneven texture of cobblestones. Worse still, the industry was undergoing a kind of reverse automation in lockstep with upscaling technology, replacing machines and machine-capable composers for actual musicians. Compare Yasunori Mitsuda and Akira Yamaoka’s acclaimed soundtracks for 1995’s Chrono Trigger on the Super Nintendo and 2001’s Silent Hill 2 on the PlayStation 2, and the changes feel chasmic. The synthetic twinkle of the former is unmistakably tied to the 16-bit period, but the scratchy, layered textures of the latter break free from those associated tropes, and into an age of CD-quality sound design. Initially, Kondo resisted morphing his beloved bleep-and-bloop game music into real life music. So he rebelled by keeping things unreal. He would spend days rifling through global curios in Kyoto’s record stores before merging his finds into combinations that broke with chronology, geography, and anthropology—combinations that couldn’t plausibly be found outside of a console. Vocal from as far back as 1990 about the changes sweeping through his profession, Kondo eventually embraced them, forging links to the past and casting forward imagined futures. The sheer size of Ocarina of Time was unprecedented, which gave Kondo the freedom to let his imagination roam. As the game was being coded, he would build out his compositions from the trickle of development updates, tracing rhythms from Post-it Notes littered over his keyboard about woodland mazes and collapsing castles and Death Mountains. He waited for fitting motifs to drop into his brain, often while he was in the bath. Progress was generally fluid, nothing like the 18 months spent hacking away on 1990’s Super Mario World. Sometimes, what was called for was pretty obvious. Glassy tones fit the “Ice Cavern,” gladiatorial horns and crashing timpani rolls gave dramatic flair to a “Boss Battle,” and a plaintive twang greets you at the “Lon Lon Ranch,” the kind of snoozy town-that-time-forgot vibe that comes off like Beck B-sides fed through a machine learning algorithm. Kondo also boldly ditched Zelda’s iconic main theme, broadly regarded as his standout work, for the very first time. This could have resulted in open revolt amongst diehards but for two majestic new pieces inserted in its place: The rousing “Hyrule Field,” which follows you throughout the game’s central area, stayed fresh by utilizing an adaptive mechanism that told the game’s internal engine to cleanly cycle between eight-bar segments with open chords, depending on whether you were in danger, resting, or in full flow on horseback. Then there’s the tender “Title Theme” greeting you as soon as the N64 loads up: drifting chords, spare keyboard rolls, one quivering ocarina, and clip-clopping hooves as Link’s horse, Epona, strides across the screen. Other times, Kondo would need to conjure diegetic music that Link and other characters in the game respond to. Twelve of the game’s themes are based around just five notes—re, fa, la, ti and the higher-octave re—simple enough to map onto the instrument in Link’s hands, but resonant enough to occupy a permanent space in your amygdala. Concision was key; so long as your N64 was on, the loops could replay endlessly. Many of the tracks on the officially released score that accompanied Ocarina of Time landed between only 30 and 70 seconds. Striking a balance between complexity and simplicity, Kondo deepened the range of expression while keeping it elemental. “Song of Storms” is so maddeningly catchy it drives a windmill operator in the game to actual madness, ruining his life. What was particularly arresting about Ocarina of Time was its very un-Nintendo embrace of darkness. Here was a game you brought neighborhood friends round to share, curtains drawn, watching and listening intently—not just because it was expansive and fun and un-put-downable, but because this thing was off its axis. Characters age and die, clay zombies rise up to choke you, and dungeons full of enslaved prisoners spiral like M.C. Escher paintings. All along, the music gets progressively more claustrophobic and forbidding. For once, negative space on audio tracks seemed like artistic license rather than technical limitation. When night falls, the music tapers off completely, leaving you exposed to the elements with nothing more than a bone chill for company. Capturing this psychological turmoil in a way that connected to a broad audience pushed Kondo harder than before. The scorched earth of “Dodongo’s Cavern” is evoked through a miasmic mood piece that creeps like noxious fumes preceding a pyroclastic flow—but with Trent Reznor scoring the blockbuster first-person shooter Quake back in 1996, this sort of unsettling soundscape wasn’t exactly new. Kondo’s fascination with arcane instrumentation rarely heard in general, let alone in games, gave him the edge. An Armenian duduk snakes through the musty, grim “Spirit Temple,” marimbas pace around the climactic battle against Ganondorf—set against leaden drums in a 23/16 time signature that looks bizarre on paper, they represent the lithe movement you need to overcome a dominating but cumbersome final boss—while the rattling percussion and ephemeral hollering of “Forest Temple” respectively came from Indonesian angklung and a sample pack named Zero-G Ethnic Flavours. Kondo’s curiosity did, however, lead to one of the larger controversies in Nintendo’s history. Rapt with excitement over an exotic chant he had likely picked up while browsing discount bins for audio travelogues, Kondo did not realize it was أَذَان (adhan), the Islamic call to prayer‎. He layered the sacred verses throughout the “Fire Temple” for atmosphere, and given the fractional Muslim population inside Japan’s cloistered society, no local testers picked it up. Corrected revisions of the game, with a more generic male choir in place, were rushed to stores as soon as the passage was caught, but stands as a lone blot on the company’s customarily sparkling copybook. Ocarina of Time was to be Kondo’s last full soundtrack. He was responsible for most of 1999’s Majora’s Mask, drawing inspiration from Chinese opera in line with its mask-based aesthetic, but had a much-diminished role when it came to the Gaelic sea shanties of 2002’s The Wind Waker. He remains in charge of Nintendo’s music department, but as a composer, Ocarina of Time was his way of leaving it all out on a field that was in the process of being aggressively returned. Nintendo’s latter-day scores for Zelda and Mario skew more orchestral, but so do most big-budget titles now. They lack Kondo’s uncanny ability to bind feelings of happiness and sadness into an immediately nostalgic whole, so that your first listen feels like your thousandth. A remake of Ocarina of Time in 2011 roused Kondo, like a great gatekeeper awoken by a sense of duty. He preached the necessity of continuity, giving employees strict instructions to stick as closely as possible to the original, watching out for fractional differences in tempo and timing that would ruin the malleability of the score. Tampering with the leitmotifs twinned with environments and characters was a cardinal sin: nothing could be worse than jeopardizing fond memories. Even basic SFX had to be recreated to transmit the feel of the N64 era on the handheld 3DS, despite the newer hardware being wired completely differently. Heads were scratched over a revamped “Title Theme” that Kondo kept rejecting, before his young team clocked that the N64’s characteristic reverb, used to mask the harsh compression, had been scrubbed. The opening ocarina no longer drifted into view from a far-off forest, but was front-loaded and far too clean in the mix. Once derided, the N64’s drawbacks were now cherished, imperfections to stimulate a flutter of butterflies in the gut. One of Nintendo’s greatest strengths—or follies, depending on what stage of the deleterious decline/miraculous revival cycle the company finds itself in—is having the confidence to reach for intangible qualities of magic and the sublime in an earnest and uncynical fashion. They remain the lovable dad of the industry, corny and often eye-clawingly frustrating, but self-aware enough to make good on it. Kondo’s scores are the connective tissue in Nintendo’s enormous body of work, like Joe Hisaishi’s for Studio Ghibli films. His particular gift was to not just create music matched to gameplay, but to grasp the way sound folds itself into our surroundings, creating associations forged and never forgotten. The central conceit of Ocarina of Time’s story is the ability to toggle between adult and kid versions of Link, warping between the bleak morass of adulthood and an era of innocence, with only flickers of the hellscape to come. This is not a luxury afforded to us in reality. Yet Nintendo do their best to bridge the divide all the same, striving to make kids feel like adults and make adults feel like kids again. No game soundtrack before or since has brought that to bear quite like Ocarina of Time, leaving an emotional response that lingers long after the system shuts down.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

Mother Earth’s Plantasia,Mort Garson,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d127861c612b80db6663bed/1:1/w_160/MortGarson_MotherEarthsPlantasia.jpg,2019-07-06 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mort-garson-mother-earths-plantasia/,Sacred Bones,"The Moog changed Mort Garson’s life. Until the moment in 1967 when he attended a demonstration by the synthesizer’s inventor, he had been carving out a respectable niche for himself in the pop world, working with the likes of Brenda Lee, Cliff Richard, and Doris Day, although he might be best known for arranging strings for Glen Campbell. Once he discovered the Moog, however, Garson devoted the rest of his career to composing on the modular synth, which seems to have freed something up in him. He stopped thinking in terms of pop songs and began writing album-length compositions, like Black Mass (about the occult), The Zodiac: Cosmic Sounds (about the signs of the Zodiac), and Music for Sensuous Lovers (about… you know). Because his compositions remain open to experimentation and wonder, because Garson was a master of mood and variation, these odd, endearing albums survive as more than artifacts. Perhaps his most beloved album, at least among crate-diggers and record collectors, is also his most whimsical. The story behind Mother Earth’s Plantasia, subtitled Warm Earth Music for Plants… and the People Who Love Them, is just as fascinating as the music. Garson conceived the album with Lynn and Joel Rapp, who ran Mother Earth Plant Boutique on Melrose Avenue in Los Angeles. Joel had been a writer for My Favorite Martian, but had burned out on the TV industry. So he switched from little green men to little green plants, and the Rapps’ store, as well as their series of best-selling books, helped popularize the houseplant trend that lasted throughout the 1970s and has become commonplace today; in fact, it’s one of the few industries millennials aren’t actively killing. Plantasia was given away free at Mother Earth’s with any purchase of a houseplant; it was also included with the purchase of a Simmons mattress at certain Sears locations, although nobody remembers how that promotion came about. (Surely Music for Sensuous Lovers would have been more appropriate.) Of course, Plantasia wasn’t intended for human ears. Or human anything. It was designed to help your indoor plants thrive and grow. This was a new idea at the time, one of those nutty beliefs from the West Coast, which in the ’70s was riddled with cults and communes and a brand-new thing called vegetarian restaurants. The idea came from a 1973 book The Secret Life of Plants, written by Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird and containing some hilariously specious claims: Plants can communicate telepathically, they can identify pain in others, they carry ancient wisdom in their little green cells, and they love music. The New York Times called it “the funniest unintentionally funny book of the year,” which didn’t stop it from climbing like bougainvillea up the best-seller lists and inspiring a documentary film scored by none other than Stevie Wonder. So, what kind of music do plants like? According to Plantasia, the synthetic tones of the Moog. The same instrument that Garson applied to Satanic rituals and erotic couplings gets similarly deployed for the plant world, and while it’s not his best album (I’m partial to Black Mass, which he released under the name Lucifer), Plantasia stands out in his small catalog for its indefatigably chipper tone and its effervescence. There are no dark notes, only a palpable wonder, which fuels the high, reedy theme of the title track as well as the miniature toy orchestra that breaks into the song partway through. With its winking humor and percolating rhythms, Plantasia might turn away some human listeners, but there’s a sense of joy and possibility in songs like “Rhapsody in Green” and “A Mellow Mood for Maidenhair.” Will it actually deliver on its promise to nurture your begonia or your philodendron? Even Joel Rapp isn't quite sure: ""Frankly, we do not know for sure that it will,"" he writes in the original liner notes. ""However, we do know one thing—it couldn't possibly hurt."" More than forty years later, the effect this music has on plants is less important than the effect it has on us.  It’s hard not to smile at the oddball charm of this strange enterprise.

Bird Songs of a Killjoy,Bedouine,by: Vrinda Jagota,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cd5938c93a536bc3f1ed8b3/1:1/w_160/Bedoine_BirdSongsOfAKilljoy.jpg,2019-07-05 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bedouine-bird-songs-of-a-killjoy/,Spacebomb,"The folk music Azniv Korkejian makes as Bedouine has a beckoning quality, a distance that masks the emotion brewing just beneath the surface. Her lyrics are circular and understated; on her second album, Birdsongs of a Killjoy, it often takes a few listens for the wistfulness of lines like, “I love you/You love how much I love you” to sink in. Her music is largely free from temporality—it could have just as easily been made in the 1970s as today. Like the surreal calm under a bridge during a rainstorm, the album’s quiet sadness feels surrounded by turmoil unfolding just outside the frame. Much of that anguish comes from unrequited love. On Birdsongs of a Killjoy, birds symbolize restless lovers that Korkejian is afraid of holding back. “Am I to you some sort of chain/Are you a bird, am I your cage?” she asks on “One More Time.” On “Bird Gone Wild,” she imagines herself “beating ’round a cage like a/Bird gone wild.” Though there is captivating beauty in a bird’s song, the bird can never truly belong to you. Korkejian has grown in leaps since her debut. Her lyrics are subtler and more shaded; the guitar, strings, and horn are more plentiful and detailed. Finger-picked guitars and strings swirl around her rich voice, which is weathered and warm as the back of your grandmother’s hand. On paper, there’s nothing novel about the lyrics “One more time, honey/One more time/I’m gonna set you free,” but on “One More Time,” she croons with such hushed mourning that she sends them skyward. Over the sparse guitar of “Sunshine Sometimes,” she fills the word “wildflower” with a drowsy, lived-in glow. Vivid images dot her lyrics: “Drag my finger ’round the rim/Drag around a phantom limb/When you’re gone,” she murmurs on “When You’re Gone.” Other lines, like “I kept the bottle we drank from together/I don’t know, is that insane?” (from “Bird”) achieve a certain group-chat candor. But the lyrics occasionally verge on maxims, and the space between gems can feel like filler. It’s not always evocative to describe someone as “wild as a storm,” or to compare loneliness to being on an island. When Korkejian alludes to the thrilling unpredictability and turbulence of nature without any comparable rush or sense of awe in the music, those grandiose references feel unearned. At times, it feels like Korkejian is holding back, and the album could benefit from a few more moments as raw as “Bird.” As it is, Bird Songs makes for lovely twilight listening, the kind of reflective and soothing album you play when nestled into a blanket on a porch with the people you love.

BTS World: Original Soundtrack,Various Artists,by: Joshua Minsoo Kim,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d1a349449bcdc0008fbc54d/1:1/w_160/BTS_World.jpg,2019-07-04 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-bts-world-original-soundtrack/,Big Hit Entertainment,"Early in the decade, Akon, Snoop Dogg, and Kanye West all featured on woefully misguided K-pop songs, emblematic of how K-pop collaborations with Western artists weren’t always well thought through. There’s been marked improvement in the past couple years, and BTS have been crucial in making these cross-continental pairings—like their songs with Steve Aoki, Nicki Minaj, and Halsey—feel more sensible. Ahead of BTS WORLD, the group released a new collaboration every week. Those tracks are the most noteworthy ones here by a considerable margin. Despite its title, BTS WORLD isn’t really a BTS album: It’s the soundtrack to a freemium mobile app game of the same name. Less than a third of the record’s 50-minute runtime is devoted to the boy band, and one would be hard-pressed to consider these four tracks among their best. Three collaborations only contain a few BTS members each, mixing and matching the group’s singers and rappers with suitable Western counterparts. While they aren’t as embarrassing as collaborations from K-pop’s yesteryear, they still fail to showcase the strengths of their respective artists. On “Dream Glow,” Jin, Jimin, and Jungkook team up with Charli XCX for a diaphanous EDM song that’s in constant search of a satisfying climax. Its muted nature is intentional—the track is meant to serve as a mantra about following your dreams—but in the absence of any cathartic bombast, the vocal hook and lethargic production are a chore. At last, a song that embodies the tedious labor involved in reaching one’s goals. The spacious and vaguely tropical “A Brand New Day,” featuring Zara Larsson, doesn’t fare much better. Producer Mura Masa throws in a daegeum—a Korean bamboo flute—but since it functions the same as any other flute loop we’ve heard in the past few years, it’s little more than a cute gesture. J-Hope’s shouted vocals are the only thing providing a semblance of personality. Juice WRLD exudes a fair amount of charm on “All Night,” ditching his lugubriousness for some slurred lines that pine for a girl. The relative sloppiness of his delivery proves a welcome contrast to RM and Suga’s prim rapping. Suga in particular is in prime form: He switches up his flow in meaningful ways, bringing to mind K-pop star Zico’s verse on “Oasis,” the very first time a Korean idol rapper adopted overtly ATL flows in a pop-rap single. BTS WORLD’s main attraction is “Heartbeat,” the only song here to have a music video and all seven of the group’s members. It’s an emotive, stadium-ready ballad that recalls fan favorite single “Spring Day,” but its banal instrumentation renders it overwrought. With staid guitar strums, plodding drums, and a line like “My heart’s on fire for your love,” “Heartbeat” could easily be mistaken for Hillsong United’s tepid contemporary Christian music, albeit with a generous number of awkward percussive blips. The rest of BTS World is wholly disposable. Seven instrumentals serve as theme music for the group’s different members, and while a few are charming—Jimin’s theme, the quaint “Cake Waltz,” could soundtrack a Disney film—every track unwisely exceeds three minutes, and each eventually reveals itself as uninspired stock music. A twee folk song from indie-pop duo Okdal and an overly dramatic ballad by Big Hit Entertainment label-mate Lee Hyun round out the soundtrack. They’re a good sampling of the music that gains traction in Korea but not among international fans. Unfortunately, they’re as innocuous and frustratingly nondescript as the seven themes that precede them. If you spend any time with the BTS WORLD game, you’ll quickly notice that it’s meant for a particular subset of fans. Players simulate life as the band’s manager, and the visual novel-style gameplay and aesthetics feel a lot like BTS fan fiction. While it’s never outright erotic, it’s meant to elicit some, well, affectionate reactions: In the first few levels of the game, RM “glistens with sweat,” you “lock eyes with a radiantly smiling Seok Jin,” and you can “feel the warmth of Yunki’s hand on [your] wrist.” (The game refers to the player only with she/her pronouns.) Like the game, the accompanying soundtrack is for die-hards only. But wherever you land on the BTS fan spectrum, BTS WORLD is the most inessential BTS-affiliated project to date.","The soundtrack to the superstar boy band’s mobile app game is the most inessential BTS-affiliated project to date.

OASIS,J BalvinBad Bunny,by: Matthew Ismael Ruiz,"Associate Staff Writer, News",https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d1644fc82ada80008ddf311/1:1/w_160/badbunny_oasis.jpg,2019-07-03 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/j-balvin-bad-bunny-oasis/,Universal Music Latino,"As Alejandro “Sky” Ramirez wrote J Balvin’s verse on “Un Peso”—a standout on his new collaborative album with Puerto Rico’s Bad Bunny—the Colombian musician recalled an old song from the Argentinian rock band Los Enanitos Verdes that his family used to drink and party to back in his hometown of Medellín. Their 1994 hit “Lamento Boliviano” was drenched in self-medication and singer/bassist Marciano Cantero’s romantic pathos offered the kind of lyrics that get screamed back at you when sung to packed stadiums: “Y yo estoy aquí, borracho y loco (And here I am, drunk and crazy)/Y mi corazón idiota, siempre brillará” (And my idiot heart, always shining). For J Balvin, Sky flipped part of the original hook to turn Balvin from the heartbroken to the heartbreaker: “Y tu corazón idiota siempre me extrañará” (“And your idiot heart will always miss me”). Over the course of a single day, what began as a half-serious gag—what if we got Cantero in the booth?—ended with a phone call from the Argentine asking for stems. “It was kind of a joke in the studio,” Sky told Rolling Stone. “But they take the jokes very seriously.” “Un Peso” captures the appeal of Oasis; frothy music made by serious talents. The reigning princes of urbano spend much of the album’s 31-minute runtime promoting tropical hedonist pursuits: too-tiny bikinis, excessive alcohol consumption, ostentatious displays of wealth, and unprotected sex. They bro down over dembow beats and pack as many dancing women as possible into their music videos. It’s goofy, but incredibly fun—a soundtrack for beach BBQs and ad hoc fire-hydrant water parks, summer vibes made manifest. The risk of not taking yourself too seriously is that plenty of the lyrics reveal themselves to be cringe-worthy upon close inspection—“Voy pa’ adentro como Pelé (¡Gol!),” or, “I’m going inside you like Pelé (Goal!),” Balvin sings on “Mojaita”—and much of the record can best be described as ’manos being ’manos. When Bad Bunny sings lines like “Ese booty es un paraíso como Bora Bora” (“The booty is a paradise like Bora Bora”), you can almost hear him smirk. It’s par for the course for the handful of the duo’s pre-Oasis collaborations, and whether you find this charming or gross likely hinges on your capacity for the crassness prevalent in much of urban music of any language. Of the two stars, it’s the 25-year-old Bad Bunny whose voice looms largest on Oasis. His nasal Auto-Tune croon christens every song he appears on, regardless of the style he’s working with. The 34-year-old Balvin, ever the chameleonic wave-rider, is more content to go with the flow. Balvin verses can often feel like guest features on his own records—look no further than Beyoncé’s star turn on the “Mi Gente” remix—or as in the case of “Un Peso,” are sometimes written by someone else. To be fair, few can do the sadboi vibes quite like el conejo malo. Bad Bunny has mastered the moody lament, soundtracking the comedown from the club in addition to the perreo anthems. The latest example is Oasis standout “La Cancion,” a jazzy, romantic ode that slows down the classic dembow riddim and showcases a lonely trumpet reverberating within the arrangement’s ample negative space—a production choice directed by Bad Bunny himself. It’s reggaetón, it’s romantic, and it’s jazzy, combining familiar elements into something fresh and new. Most of the production is handled by Sky and his mentor Marco “Tainy” Masís, the legendary Puerto Rican reggaetón producer who helmed much of Bad Bunny’s phenomenal X100PRE and J Balvin’s Vibras. The production crew seamlessly weave together acoustic elements (“Yo Le Llego”’s upright bass, “Un Peso”’s ukulele, “La Cancion”’s trumpet), trap-style synthesizers, and dembow beats into a coherent pan-Latin aesthetic. This is the sound of the new urbano latino. Bunny and Balvin even tip their cap to Africa—the original source of nearly all the sounds miscegenating on Oasis—tapping Nigerian Afrobeat all-star Mr. Eazi for “Como Un Bebé,” their take on a “Banku” bop, the smoothed-out signature style Eazi named after the heavy Ghanian comfort food. It’s a fitting end to a record devoted to celebrating good times, a healing balm providing temporary relief from the violence and oppression that they’ve addressed in their communities. When Bad Bunny implores us to “Baila pa' mí” (“Dance with me”), we comply, powerless to resist.","The two urbano superstars bro down over trap and dembow beats on a goofy but incredibly fun summertime album.

Dolphine,Mega Bog,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d122add17fa5ef5e7e51c37/1:1/w_160/dolphine_megabog.jpg,2019-07-03 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mega-bog-dolphine/,Paradise of Bachelors,"“Never smother the mystical song that rests deep inside you,” Erin Birgy murmurs midway through Dolphine, her fifth record as Mega Bog. Since adopting the moniker 10 years ago, the Los Angeles-based musician has lived out this sagely maxim. Her music overflows with images of hidden scorpions, blue salamanders, writhing snakes, and a flesh-eating troll. Despite its inscrutability, Dolphine feels genuine—the heartfelt expression of a uniquely weird viewpoint. The album is partially inspired by the otherworldly writings of the late Ursula K. Le Guin, who once said of the label “science fiction”: “My tentacles are coming out of the pigeonhole in all directions.” Dolphine similarly flits from groovy jazz to psych-pop to sylvan folk with freaky glee. Birgy’s idiosyncrasies bear resemblance to the off-kilter lyricism of Cate Le Bon or Aldous Harding, the elastic voice of Jessica Pratt, or the cosmic guitar reverence of Big Thief, whose drummer James Krivchenia, a frequent Mega Bog collaborator, engineered the album. But Dolphine pushes further into uncharted realms, where any rules about conventional melodies and lyrical coherence deteriorate. Opener “For the Old World” wobbles on a slack tightrope, always threatening to tumble into chaos. The song springs between twinkling percussion, smooth jazz, and prickly tension; a woodwind zigzags erratically in the background like a shrill songbird. Melodic shapes undulate to a hidden logic on “Fwee Again,” an instrumental odyssey that references a made-up word for joyful epiphanies from 2017’s Happy Together. Birgy is once again backed on these adventures by a crew of collaborators—among them Krivchenia (percussion, effects), Hand Habits’ Meg Duffy (guitar), and iji’s Zach Burba (synth, bass)—whose performances enrich her remarkably peculiar stories. Yet Birgy is not a storyteller in the traditional, linear sense. Rather, she strings crisp and enigmatic fragments into enchanting collages. “Crazy Kermin in the hall/Shadow plant leaf bleats/Piano stumbling/I forgot all your songs,” goes “I Hear You Listening (To the Bug on My Wall).” “As foxes bloat up Eastern expressway shoulders/Aloe breaks an arm,” she burbles on “Untitled (With ‘C’).” Much like a Le Guin novel, these sentences throw you into fully formed worlds without a map. But immersion encourages acclimation. Birgy explains the process plainly on “Shadows Break”: “The language erodes and unearths me more.” Exploring this new world reveals abstract expressions of pain and loss, both specific and existential. “And now I’m crying like a spider in the sun/It’s not fear, or sadness, or even aches/It’s just living/Long, long, long,” she aches on the curliquing “Left Door.” “Untitled (With ‘C’)” was written for Philando Castile, the Minnesota man killed by a cop during a traffic stop. “Another murder should still disturb you/Delivered like clubhouse music to a white supremacy/Loneliness like this one cannot last,” Birgy sings over mournful bass in a rare unambiguous moment. Midway through the record is “Spit in the Eye of the Fire King,” a duet written by and performed with Ash Rickli, a Georgia musician who later passed away suddenly. Though the song’s cheery folksiness is an outlier, its presence underlines Birgy’s appreciation of the mystical implications of life beyond death. The personal significance of these losses can sometimes be so heavily cloaked as to feel impenetrable. Yet there’s something refreshing about Birgy’s unapologetic commitment to her inner code. This is her reality, and sometimes it can be stranger—and certainly more poetic—than fiction. “Diary of a Rose” plays with a double meaning of the word “rose,” referencing both the shrub and the name of Birgy’s childhood horse to tie together images of flower-induced mania and the animal lounging in grass. The gentle “Truth in the Wild” may or may not be a love song, but it concludes with a clear and profound declaration of desire: “I want to be with the one I love/I want to play with the one I love.” It’s tempting to use the word “surreal” to describe the visionary world Birgy conjures. Her songs teem with colorful metaphors, recurring characters, and dreamlike arrangements, like a Leonora Carrington painting set to music. But often “surreal” is confused with fantasy or hallucination, illogical outpourings of the subconscious thrown together for eccentric value. Even at its most inexplicable, there’s not a moment on Dolphine that feels careless. As her imagination roams, Birgy understands that sometimes irrationality is necessary to make sense of reality.

Clarity,Kim Petras,by: Jamieson Cox,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d1a2d4957efb00008959c0c/1:1/w_160/KimPetras_Clarity.png,2019-07-03 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kim-petras-clarity/,BunHead,"Kim Petras isn’t a revolutionary. Unlike her collaborators Charli XCX and SOPHIE, she doesn’t want to push pop into the future or dismantle it and play with the parts; instead, she takes the genre as it’s being expressed this very moment and renders it brighter, bolder, and more aggressive. If heavy hitters like Ariana Grande and Halsey are making fruit juice, she’s a tier below, churning out frozen concentrate: similar taste, but in an undiluted, hyper-dense package. Despite her extremely online aesthetic and streaming-era approach to releasing new music, she’s ultimately a traditionalist. I listen to her music and hear someone who fell in love with the idea of pop from a distance—she grew up in Cologne, Germany, half a world away from the American music industry—long before she had the chance to make it herself. She’s a scholar of the hit, and she’s honoring her passion by iterating on the form. Clarity, her debut full-length project, feels less like a major statement than the culmination of a lengthy, controlled burn. After breaking out in 2017 with “I Don’t Want It at All,” a strobe-lit sugar-baby anthem that made “Material Girl” seem demure, Petras slowly assembled a portfolio of strong singles that demonstrated her impressive stylistic range. She glided from gleaming, Robyn-esque anthems (“Heart to Break”) and wistful trap-pop ballads (“Homework”) to faithful bloghouse revivals like “Close Your Eyes,” a highlight from last year’s goofy Halloween-themed EP Turn Off the Light, Vol. 1. It’d make for a heartwarming underdog story—an aspiring star moves to Los Angeles to make it in the music business, writing songs and crashing on couches until the dream comes true—if her chief creative partner wasn’t Lukasz “Dr. Luke” Gottwald, the superproducer-turned-pariah whose career entered a precipitous decline after Kesha accused him of sexual assault and physical abuse. When Petras has been asked about or criticized for working with Gottwald, her responses are equivocal but unapologetic: “While I’ve been open and honest about my positive experience with Dr. Luke, that does not negate or dismiss the experiences of others or suggest that multiple perspectives cannot exist at once,” she tweeted last July. “I do want to express my sympathy for any and all abuse victims.” Yet there exists a stark contrast between the complexity surrounding Petras’ career and the flagrant, almost pointed frivolity of her music. Clarity is a collection of decadent, deeply silly songs, all of them delivered by the kind of person who uses even the slightest bit of emotional turmoil as an excuse to immerse herself in sex, drugs, and money. (Consider this representative couplet from the bratty “Blow It All”: “Shorty in the bathroom and she’s asking ‘where the coke at?’/I spent 20 thousand just to leave it on a coat rack.”) Feeling sad, feeling horny, feeling sad and horny, living like you’re dying—these may not be novel themes, but they’re delivered with palpable enthusiasm and good humor. Petras loves pop enough to celebrate its tropes. When she takes a second in the middle of the raunchy “Do Me” to sing about hitting “high notes” in bed, you’d better believe she’s going to cut the backing track and jump up an octave just for that phrase. It’s hard not to giggle. Petras’ keen scholarship of pop is also readily apparent in the purity of Clarity’s craft. Along with  Gottwald—who co-wrote and produced every song on Clarity alongside a series of other close collaborators—Petras understands how songwriting can seem like alchemy when a single beat, modulation, or syllable can transform an average song into something magical. Those moments are everywhere: the crisp, snapping rhythm and rich chords of would-be booty call anthem “Got My Number,” the Daft Punk-lite breakdown in the middle of “Do Me,” the touch of grain on the disco loop at the core of the magnificent “Sweet Spot.” Grouping these songs together in an album-length context sheds light on both Petras’ strengths and weaknesses. She’s so versatile that it’s difficult to identify her musical ground zero: Is it the updated French touch of “Sweet Spot” and “Do Me?” The bouncy, dewy R&B of “Got My Number” and “Another One?” She turns in convincing impressions of Drake, the Weeknd, and Juice WRLD on “Meet the Parents,” “Icy,” and “All I Do Is Cry,” respectively, singing and rapping with surprising speed and fluidity. This kind of diversity might feel incoherent or unfocused from another artist; from Petras, it feels like a natural expression of her interests and talents. She’s the glue holding everything together—think a female Travis Scott, one who grew up worshipping Madonna and the Spice Girls instead of Drake and Kanye West. At the same time, the sheer intensity of every song on Clarity makes it tough to digest in one sitting. (You wouldn’t pull a can of Minute Maid out of the freezer and eat the entire thing with a spoon, right?) Releasing singles weekly gave each new song room to breathe, and when they’re jammed together into a single 40-minute block, they amount to less than the sum of their parts. This effect might explain Petras’ reticence to call Clarity an “album”: If she takes pop as seriously as I think she does, she might be waiting to apply that title to a project with more coherence and narrative thrust. Clarity is still worth your time and attention, even if it ends up being little more than a stopgap measure. For listeners who decide to charge ahead despite the lack of moral clarity around Petras’ career, it’s the best introduction yet to one of pop music’s brightest talents.","The pop star’s debut is decadent and deeply silly, with songs delivered by the kind of person who uses even the slightest bit of emotional turmoil as an excuse to immerse herself in sex, drugs, and money.

A Loss Permitted...,Keiji HainoCharles Hayward,by: Daniel Martin-McCormick,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d1123ccc0b1608a9447e087/1:1/w_160/ALossPermitted_Keiij.jpg,2019-07-03 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/keiji-haino-charles-hayward-a-loss-permitted/,Thirty Three Thirty Three,"Keiji Haino and Charles Hayward have spent decades twisting through rock’s byways, slipping between the cracks of punk, noise, free improv, prog, music concrete, and on and on. If the rock pantheon’s ur-texts valorize righteous authenticity, Dyonisian sexual liberation, and noodly virtuosity, these two are undaunted inversions, Jungian shadows to that mainstream triumphant myth. You can identify either of them in an instant. In the case of Hayward, a founding member of This Heat, it’s that deep, British melancholy that floats somewhere between the looming apocalypse and something unknowably personal. For Haino, it doesn’t matter what instrument he finds himself on—guitar, vocals, hurdy-gurdy—everything comes out blazing with a stark, quasi-demonic spiritual force. In their hands, the basic tenets of rock music become a vessel for something more tectonic. A Loss Permitted, recorded live in 2016, finds the two jamming on the edge of oblivion. From the go, the session is defined by a whisper/roar contrast, with Haino’s guitar slicing near total silence with darting serrations. Caked in reverb, his initial volleys feel like decayed transmissions from a distant realm, both urgent and remote. Without wasting any time, he stretches far out to one edge of the spectrum, as if to alert you to the violence which looms behind every moment of restraint. The duo then quickly starts messing with understated atonal gestures, which initially come off a touch rote. These function as a kind of window dressing for the more shattering forays to come, as if Haino and Hayward want to sketch some mountains in the background of their otherwise starkly contrasting landscape. The interplay is loose but confident, using some of the 20th century’s most well-worn avant cliches to help them along. Haino spends a not insignificant portion of the session on the mic—singing, wailing, and convulsing in Japanese. His yowl at the opening of track 10 lands somewhere between Iggy’s feral bellows on Fun House and the more guttural invocations of death metal. Set against a backdrop of the lightest feedback and some very occasional punctuations from Hayward, it makes for one of the more unsettling and riveting passages, especially when he descends into a hissing whisper. There’s something inhuman about Haino’s throat-shredding cries, something beyond emotion. They don’t translate to anything as pedestrian as anger, anxiety, or pain so much as their own sonic necessity. Performers often describe themselves as channels for some greater force; listening to Haino draw out a piercingly high octave and then descend into writhing death throes might be as direct an expression of this idea as you could hope to find. They aren’t on fire the whole time. There are sloppy passages and moments when they’re caught rummaging around just long enough for momentum to flag. The piano that winds through the set feels, at times, like a warmed-up leftover from the early-1970s European improv scene. But they always seem to pull it through, often led by Haino’s unabashed theartrics. His seething incantations, accompanied by otherworldly feedback groans, usher in a vital final run somewhere around the 30 minute mark. You can feel the energy coalesce, the players suddenly coursing with energy, like a pair of large cats prowling the stage. The album closes with ethereal upper-register drones and a last dash of piano. Haino has stepped away from the microphone, but we can hear his cries in the distance, like a hermit wandering into the woods. A lonesome motif is sketched out on the keys, Haino lets out one last wail, and suddenly, mid-moment, the music evaporates. The last 20 seconds of the album are silent. You might expect applause, a “thank you” from Hayward, one last crescendo—anything, really, to let you know it was over. This moment may be the most affecting on the LP, the moment of uncertain dangling on the edge of a void. That’s where they took you, and that’s where they leave you.","A live recording from 2016 captures the avant-rock titans jamming on the edge of oblivion.

“Let’s Rock”,The Black Keys,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d029e94f605603ca64d38ca/1:1/w_160/letsrock_blackkeys.jpg,2019-07-02 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-black-keys-lets-rock/,Easy Eye Sound,"When the Black Keys look back, they won’t have regrets about striking while the iron was hot. After the mammoth success of their sixth album Brothers, which polished the band’s raw blues-rock enough for the radio, the duo raced out two more albums, including 2011’s even slicker El Camino. They headlined arenas and festivals, touring ceaselessly while licensing their music to seemingly any brand interested—which, for a time, felt like all of them. They were ubiquitous, and their sound became so permanently embedded in the airwaves that casual listeners may not have noticed they’ve been gone. The duo’s new “Let’s Rock” follows their last effort Turn Blue by five years, the longest gap of their career. As the band tells it, they burned out, though during their time off Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney both continued making music at their typically relentless clip, just not with each other. Carney produced records for Michelle Branch, Tobias Jesso Jr., Wild Belle, and others, while Auerbach helmed records by the Pretenders and Cage the Elephant and dropped a leisurely solo album. For some bands, that time apart might have yielded an epiphany that reshaped their approach. But the Black Keys have never much valued change. They’re focused, workmanlike, and committed to what works. As a result, “Let’s Rock” plays exactly like the record they might have rushed out right after Turn Blue. This time, they are working without Danger Mouse, the producer whose modern/retro fusion helped prime the band for their crossover. His fingerprints in particular were all over the psychedelic hodgepodge of Turn Blue and its kitchen-sink strings and keyboards. “Let’s Rock,” in turn, opts for a streamlined approach: just Auerbach, Carney, a pair of backing vocalists (Ashley Wilcoxson and Leisa Hans) and as many overdubs as it takes to get the job done. In truth, Danger Mouse’s window dressings neither added nor detracted all that much from the band’s sound. His absence leaves more room for riffs, and “Let’s Rock” doesn’t skimp on them. “Shine a Little Light” kicks off with a torrent of brawling guitars, the embodiment of those old speaker ads with the guy in a chair blowing away his living room. “Lo/Hi,” about reckless thrills and brutal comedowns, is even more undeniable, pure leather-jacketed swagger. Most of “Let’s Rock” hits its mark, but sometimes the band cribs so overtly from their influences that it feels like cheating off of a test. The guitars on “Walk Across the Water” ape the suave glide of T. Rex’s “Jeepster,"" while “Sit Around and Miss You” lifts its lick so shamelessly from Stealers Wheel’s “Stuck in the Middle With You” that it’s hard to hear it without picturing Michael Madsen slicing off a dude’s ear. Elsewhere the influences are subtler—shades of Steely Dan in the amplified soft-rock of “Breaking Down,” a hint of the Isley Brothers in the nimble lick of “Tell Me Lies.” If none of those reference points are especially hip, that seems to be by design. “Let’s Rock” feels like a deliberate retreat from the limelight, where the Black Keys were always an odd fit anyway. Ambitious? No. Effective? Swish. Just as the album art for Brothers, with its matter-of-fact text, downplayed expectations, “Let’s Rock” is upfront about its meat-and-potatoes aspirations. This is an album by the Black Keys called “Let’s Rock.” It does.

DJ-Kicks,Peggy Gou,by: Claire Lobenfeld,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cddc333fa43fddc0f067e6d/1:1/w_160/PeggyGou_DJ-Kicks.jpg,2019-07-02 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/peggy-gou-dj-kicks/,!K7,"The histories of fashion and techno are frequently intertwined—just ask Raf Simons, who debuted his Spring/Summer 2020 collection at Paris Fashion Week with pieces that paid tribute to the legendary R&S Records—and that’s especially true for the DJ and producer Peggy Gou. Born in South Korea and now based in Berlin, Gou cut her teeth studying at London College of Fashion before turning to dance music. Fashion school is rooted in learning history before adding your own spin, and Gou brings that wisdom to her music. Her tracks are extremely reverent to foundational elements of techno, house, and electro, but she pivots each one into her own point of view. She traces that lineage with her contribution to !K7’s vaunted DJ-Kicks series. Instead of replicating her party-turning abilities, Gou uses the space to create something more like a scrapbook of her loves and influences. The usual suspects of her sets, like Pearson Sound and Kyle Hall, make the tracklist, but certain choices feel like more pointed looks into her taste. Hyperdub founder and bass-music mastermind Kode9 doesn’t seem like a natural fit for Gou’s sunny, melodic style, but his droney “Magnetic City,” a b-side from a 2007 Soul Jazz split, finds a home among the crunchiness of Sweden’s Dorisburg and British rave luminaries Shades of Rhythm. IDM mainstay Aphex Twin also makes an appearance, but it’s with the squelchy Drukqs track “Vordhosbn”—one of the few choices that deviates from the steady heartbeat of bassline hypnosis and minimalism that bumps throughout the mix. The most revealing artifact from Gou’s biography comes in the form of her sole contribution to the tracklisting, a cross-continental joint-loosener called “Hungboo,” the first song that Gou ever produced. Crafted in the style of pansori, a traditional South Korean style of storytelling performed by a singer and a drummer, “Hungboo” emphasizes Gou’s interest in reinterpreting deeply entrenched forms. The same goes for the title, which references Hungbu and Nolbu, a Korean folktale that teaches empathy and generosity. The moral is mirrored with inclusions like “Epirus,” a warmer from up-and-comer Deniro, as well as “Pert,” from Italian duo Hiver, which debuts on the mix, and JRMS’ “3,” a recent staple of Gou’s sets that will be released later this year via her new imprint Gudu. The label is just another of Gou’s prodigious accomplishments. Since 2016, she has become the first Korean woman to DJ Berlin techno institution Berghain and the first Korean to be tapped for a BBC Essentials Mix. With her DJ-Kicks, she becomes the first Korean person at the helm of another benchmark in dance music. But it’s not just these distinctions that makes the mix an achievement. Here, Gou’s studied craftsmanship coalesces with her tastemaking abilities. It’s most meditative in its unwavering commitment to methodical bass. Gou has always appeared to have an old soul and with this endeavor, it’s on full display.

The Fleeting Light of Impermanence,The Appleseed Cast,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d02b131b6e2e31127c9d3c9/1:1/w_160/TheFleetingLightofImpermanence_TheAppleseedCast.jpg,2019-07-02 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-appleseed-cast-the-fleeting-light-of-impermanence/,Graveface,"Though years of sustained, steady success allowed the Appleseed Cast’s Chris Crisci to table the prospect of day jobs and fatherhood, it drained the band of the kind of mystique that powers rapturous reunions. Second-wave peers in Pedro the Lion, Braid, the Get Up Kids, the Jazz June, and American Football returned after long hiatuses with considerate, measured takes on maturity and familial obligation; when Crisci reckoned with “fear and irrelevance and not wanting to become an adult” on 2013’s Illumination Ritual, it was simply one new Appleseed Cast album among many. Crisci admits that it was an insecure work, timid in its viewpoint and execution. An album titled The Fleeting Light of Impermanence is no less aware of humanity’s cosmic insignificance, but the band has come to accept the freedom within: We’re here and then we’re gone, so why not make as much noise as possible? The Fleeting Light of Impermanence does nothing you haven’t heard them do before—all of those things are just done more emphatically. Throughout two decades, the common quality of the Appleseed Cast has been “oceanic”: the misty spray of reverb across their debut The End of the Ring Wars, the midnight-zone submersion of Low Level Owl, an album called Mare Vitalis, and a symphonic post-emo swell that seemed to echo from Sunny Day Real Estate’s The Rising Tide. This time, the opener is called “Chaotic Waves” because the hyperbolic drums push against familiar, stately guitars and Crisci’s stoic bellow, recasting the band’s tidal dynamics as a cruel battle of man and nature—a ship caught in a hurricane, fighting to a satisfying standstill. Crisci usually favors evocative and evasive wordplay that aims just outside the heart or the gut, at times neutralizing the visceral effect of his band. This time, he follows the lead of their most forceful music by saying exactly what he means: “When they try to defeat you/Just clench your fist tight/Stand up and fight,” or “We've got one day to give/One day to work and live and hold the world.” If they have any fear of their own obsolescence, the Appleseed Cast shout it down with more carpe diem slogans and fire imagery than a Japandroids record. It’s the first time in years that the band have legitimately rocked, something that’s never really been their M.O. despite working in punk-based subgenres. But even their atmospheric tendencies benefit from sheer volume. There’s no drift, no ambience for ambience’s sake; even the quietest moments sit with jagged nerves and lingering tension. Crisci junked his original plan for a “pure synth record,” keeping only those that sound most like guitars. In the past, that would’ve left the Appleseed Cast in a post-Radiohead rut, but the brutalist textures of “Time the Destroyer” and “The Journey” push them towards the bleak krautrock of Portishead’s Third instead. Crisci’s guitar leads are more memorable than his pop choruses, and so “Collision” and “Chaotic Waves” use the guitar as the chorus, successfully situating them within the everyman transcendentalism of Explosions in the Sky and Built to Spill. Much like the latest American Football, The Fleeting Light of Impermanence is the sound of a band taking ownership of their sound after years of being emulated or even ripped off by younger arrivals. Still, the album’s uplift wouldn’t feel nearly as well-earned if it weren’t grounded in finality, just as inspiration strikes when the finish line is in sight. As with “Chaotic Waves,” the closer on The Fleeting Light of Impermanence makes no illusions about its intent: On “Last Words and Final Celebrations,” the Appleseed Cast circle back to the youthful stargazing of The End of the Ring Wars. If this is the last song the band ever makes, Crisci seems at peace with it. For the past decade, he’s fretted over the end. The Fleeting Light of Impermanence summons strength to face whatever comes next.","On their first new album in six years, the longrunning emo outfit take ownership of their sound.

I Was Real,75 Dollar Bill,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d040fad39bb0c2e47df5898/1:1/w_160/IWasReal_75DollarBill.jpg,2019-07-02 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/75-dollar-bill-i-was-real/,Thin Wrist,"Guitarist Che Chen briefly worked at New York’s beloved Other Music in the mid-’00s, and his subsequent duo with percussionist Rick Brown, 75 Dollar Bill, bears the stamp of the shop’s aesthetic. Their early music did a lot with a little—Chen’s guitar amp strapped to his back, Brown pounding out beats on a wooden box. They recalled Tinariwen and Group Doueh, as well as obscure favorites like Otha Turner and Henry Flynt, artists the store championed. Naturally, the band’s 2015 debut LP was released on the Other Music imprint, and when the venerated store closed for good in 2016, 75 Dollar Bill was part of the farewell parade. On their new double album, 75  Dollar Bill expand from spartan duo to crack ensemble, with upwards of ten players. Equally attuned to raw world music and psych rock, country blues and drone, jazz and early New York minimalism, they push into a new terrain that blurs the distinctions and record-store categories. “Every Last Coffee or Tea” revisits a number from their very first cassette, amplifying the shifting 3-on-2 groove with viola, upright bass, and rhythm guitar. On “Tetuzi Akiyama,” Chen’s descending fuzz-guitar lick is closely shadowed by the fat, wide frequencies of Cheryl Kingan's baritone sax. The title track, the longest in 75 Dollar Bill’s discography, spends half of its near-17 minutes carefully building up and the other half dying down. Karen Waltuch’s slow-bowed viola recalls John Cale’s drone work in the Velvet Underground, while Chen lazily circles around a few notes. Almost imperceptibly, the band draws everything back down, allowing the ambient noise of your environment—a buzzing AC unit, distant traffic, whatever—to expand into the growing silence. Sprinkled throughout the album are a number of “WZN” tracks (a contraction of “wezin,” which in Mauritania and Northwest Africa denote the kind of dance songs played at weddings). On these, 75 Dollar Bill strip back to their earliest sound. “WZN #4” spotlights a heavily phased guitar and a riff like a turning screw, while “WZN #3” carefully overlays additional needling guitar lines. Such pieces may have their roots in Africa, but as each piece unspools, you might find yourself wondering about the band’s placeless sound. 75 Dollar Bill slyly nudges you beyond the familiar, so that—no matter your record-nerd knowledge—you’ll wind up someplace new.

Sinner,Moodymann,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cffd444f443635c48bcbb4b/1:1/w_160/Sinner_Moodymann.jpg,2019-07-01 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/moodymann-sinner/,KDJ,"Last spring, a new Moodymann album popped up on dance music sites listed only as “coming soon.” A single dropped and vanished, but June came and went with no full-length follow-up to his 2014 self-titled album. At that point, the Detroit producer also known as Kenny Dixon, Jr. had begun showing up in places far outside the dance music underground. Even in his years-long absence, he could be heard purring “fuck dat shit” on Drake’s “Passionfruit” and DJing Prince obscurities around the world. With little effort on his end, his woozy, soul-rooted take on house music had infiltrated everyone from Channel Tres and Motor City Drum Ensemble to Caribou’s Daphni alias. In January, a rumor spread that he had handed out a few copies of his lost album, which subsequently wound up selling for upwards of $500. As of now, it still has not been officially released. Deep in the Ring-esque video for “I’ll Provide,” the lead-off track on Sinner, the fate of that original album is finally revealed, as Dixon dumps entire bags of them into a garbage can. Sinner now arrives with little explanation. Does it replace the lost album? Is it a stopgap? The double vinyl has five tracks, while the Bandcamp version gets fleshed out with last year’s single and a few other goodies. Song by song—even moment by moment—it shows Dixon pulling in multiple directions. The music teems with small details, but it doesn’t feel dense, just more diffuse, harder than ever to grasp. It is also some of the most immersive he’s ever made. “I’ll Provide” is seductive and menacing, driving and aching, his most claustrophobic track since “Freeki Mutha F cker.” But where that track was sleek and seductive, “I’ll Provide” is hurt, forlorn, desperate. Heaving synth strings, pulsing in-the-red bass, overdriven acid lines, digital glitching, crowd noise, a relentless kick—they all jostle for space on the track without affecting its aerodynamics one iota. Atop it all, Moodymann slots in killer couplets—“I got something/For all your dirty, nasty needs,” “Drunk and high/I’ll provide”—that evoke the backing tracks of Marvin Gaye and Al Green. Sometimes whispered, other times whooped from across the room, they make the track feels rowdy and confessional at once. “Got Me Coming Back Rite Now” barely tops 100 bpm, but the house track bustles with sound, from Moody’s vocal scats and crisp hi-hats to dramatic strings and the whoosh of passing traffic. Relaxed as it sounds, there’s an unsettled, on-edge quality to it. As it shuffles towards its inevitable climax, Moody again growls like a man in conflict, offering to do the chores as well as “tie you down on this here floor.” There isn’t really a weak moment: “I Think of Saturday” already feels like a peak-time classic, erected atop a Linn drum sample worthy of the Purple One. Dixon’s utterance of the word “church” alone can make you a believer. Again, Moody roves between nonchalance and urgency, rattling off the days of the week as if he’s merely waiting for the weekend. But another pass through the song reveals that for each day, he hasn’t heard from his crush, so that rather than the weekend offering release, it only increases the desperation. A perfectly placed drop into Joe Simon’s “With You in Mind” instead accentuates that mind in the throes of such an unrequited obsession. “If I Gave U My Love” is more audacious with the source material, interweaving legends like Camille Yarbrough and Al Green into a mosaic. They are both iconic voices—Yarbrough’s will be most familiar to listeners as the source material for Fatboy Slim’s “Praise You”—and Moody even samples the same moment. But as church organ swirls, Moody manages to twist the overly familiar into something newly strange and ecstatic. Even for longtime fans of Moodymann that know his penchant with an MPC, these tracks find him pushing towards new ground. The back half of the set gets stranger, slower. “Downtown” is a noodly smooth jazz jam that first appeared as “Pitch Black City Reunion” last year. “Deeper Shadow” is neo-soul with a bit of razorous psychedelic guitar added to darken the mood. “8 Mile D Boy” is a rare bit of fidgety electro from the man, but paired with the admission “I’m so sorry,” it’s a party track with a conflicted emotion at its core. The title track finds Moody at his simmering, neo-soul best, flickering in and out of focus and drawing everything down by singing about a “lonely winner” who “sat in your lonely dark room listening to Dilla/ hoping they would remember.” Knowing his own deep connection with the fellow Detroiter, one wonders if Moody is not singing about an object of his affection, but rather his own self? Like the man himself, he is in no rush to dispel that mystery.","The elusive Detroit producer returns after a years-long mysterious absence with a burning, urgent, and immersive new LP.

Black Pumas,Black Pumas,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d137b34f3ed35000960a5ab/1:1/w_160/BlackPumas_BlackPumas.jpg,2019-07-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/black-pumas-black-pumas/,ATO,"Black Pumas sounds like a band name coined at the twilight of the soul era, when R&B turned grittier, trippier, and funkier. It’s a name that evokes that of the Black Panthers, the African-American activist group who defined militant protest during the late 1960s and early 1970s—which is not coincidentally the period that the Austin-based duo of guitarist/producer Adrian Quesada and vocalist Eric Burton consciously conjure on their eponymous debut album. At no point on Black Pumas do Quesada and Burton shy away from signifiers of the past. Rhythms roll with the tight precision of the Hi Records rhythm section, “Fire” is punctuated with horns straight out of Stax, “OCT 33” finds Burton obliquely nodding at Otis Redding’s “Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song),” the title of its opener “Black Moon Rising” echoes Creedence Clearwater Revival’s doomsday classic “Bad Moon Rising.” Black Pumas are too clever to succumb to pure nostalgic pandering, though. They pointedly avoid the pitfalls that plague well-intentioned retro-soul records, favoring feel over authenticity, playing as much for the head as the heart. Chalk much of this heady aesthetic up to the duo’s origins as a studio project. A longtime Austin fixture—he played guitar in Grupo Fantasma, who won a Grammy for Best Latin Rock Album in 2011—Quesada started assembling tracks at his studio Electric Deluxe, casting a net for a suitable singer once his ideas took the shape of a song. Friends connected him with Burton, a singer/songwriter who busked his way through the West Coast before settling in central Texas. Possessing a voice that can slide into the slipstream with ease, Burton lends an elegant elasticity to Quesada’s tightly layered productions. Occasionally the producer/guitarist performs this trick in reverse—“Sweet Conversations,” the album’s dreamy denouement, draws upon a demo Burton recorded at home—but the core of the album lies in how the singer helps shape aural paintings into songs, providing them with warmth and a slight trace of spaciness. Burton may command attention with his sweet, plaintive voice, but Quesada’s densely woven tapestries are the key to Black Pumas. Inspired by RZA’s crate-digging productions for the Wu-Tang Clan extended universe, Quesada relies on scratchy drum loops, hits of strings, funky electronic pianos, and fuzz guitar. Actual samples may be rare but the fact that the guitarist cobbled together all of this on his own is admirable, particularly when he marshals all of his skill on one cut. The minor-key march “Fire” gains gravity from its blend of ghostly organs and guitar twang, “Stay Gold” shimmers with the sultriness of a heat wave, and “Black Moon Rising” unfurls with a hushed sense of spectacle. At these moments, which are the best Black Pumas has to offer, the duo’s flair for drama is so stirring, they can seem acutely cinematic. As appealing as this Technicolor sound may be, it can’t quite hide the seams created when the duo stitched their two sensibilities together in the studio. Burton’s misty introspection can give Quesada’s soulful prowess an ethereal edge, yet it can sometimes suggest the whole enterprise is little more than snazzy pastiche. While there may be pleasure in such a patchwork of sound, particularly when it’s done with such style and verve, the assemblage bears a pointed sense of insularity. Burton sings about interior voyages and the tracks were usually constructed by no more than two musicians; it’s music made at home, for home listening. That’s all well and good, since the duo has considerable skill, but this existential lonerism underscores a chasm between the pair and their influences. Unlike the icons of the era they find so inspiring, Black Pumas rarely look outside of themselves.

Foam,Divino Niño,by: Beverly Bryan,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cd06724f2bde66086aac9b7/1:1/w_160/DivinoNino_Foam.jpg,2019-07-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/divino-nino-foam/,Winspear,"Chicago quartet Divino Niño started out playing distinctive-enough psychedelic garage-pop. With Foam, their first proper full-length after a couple of demo compilations, they forge a richer and more inventive sound. Their squiggly, retro-futurist approach borrows freely but selectively from among a vast pop-rock songbook, the psychedelic explorations of the past, and more recent internet subgenres. This is a collection of sweet, brightly colored love songs from the mind of an acid enthusiast, woven from a small used record store’s worth of influences. The opening space-lounge fantasias of “Foam” and the Wurlitzer-festooned “Quiero” represent new territory for the band, and though they toy with different styles, they resist flattening music history into mere aesthetic. Songs like the relentlessly tuneful “Melty Caramelo” sound like singles from an especially quirky boy band, but Foam has the energy and anything-goes sense of adventure of early-2000s indie rock. These blithe melodies and lightly carbonated hooks could click into place on any number of Spotify playlists, yet remain subtly, irreducibly weird. “Ooh la la” backing vocals notwithstanding, Foam is a progressive-minded record. If its references are nostalgic, its spirit isn’t. The band has assembled their touchstones with a connoisseur’s ear and the streaming era’s egalitarian approach: All sounds may be selected to serve the needs of the moment. With a killer mid-tempo chorus and lightheaded glide guitar, the strangely affecting “Coca Cola” sounds like a ’70s AM radio hit by way of post-punk. “Cosmic Flower” plants fibrous roots in British Invasion-era rock as it sways in a vaporwave breeze. The band’s garage foundation shows up now and again, especially on the all-Spanish “Maria,” and though it anchors their music nicely, Foam is more like soft art rock. There is no real kitsch, just cheery, artful clutter. Two of Divino Niño’s founding members, guitarist Camilo Medina and bassist Javier Forero, are originally from Bogotá, Colombia. It’s tempting to connect the band’s romantic lyrics and soulful melodicism to the lineage of U.S. Latino rock pioneers such as Thee Midniters, or classic South American pop groups like Los Pasteles Verdes. But if their background shows up in their music—outside of Medina’s casual shifts between English and Spanish—it is most likely found in their wide palette of influences: everything from Roberto Carlos to Brandy. Foam demonstrates that it’s possible to draw from everywhere, without sounding quite like anything else. With so much music so freely available, it’s easy to get lost in the noise, to fall back on a too-familiar sound from the ocean of possible influence. Divino Niño navigate expertly against the tide.

Digital Kabar: Electronic Maloya From La Réunion Since 1980,Various Artists,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cffcfeaf60560d9984d36f6/1:1/w_160/DigitalKabar_VA.jpg,2019-07-01 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-digital-kabar-electronic-maloya-from-la-reunion-since-1980/,Infiné,"Emanating from the tiny French island La Réunion, nestled some 500 miles off the coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, maloya dates back to the 17th century. Made by the slaves working the island’s sugar plantations, the music only began to be recognized by Réunionese society in the 20th century. But in the 1960s, a turn towards pro-independence and communist lyrics—not to mention its use in trance-inducing servis kabaré ceremonies, which the Catholic Church disapproved of—led to the prohibition of the style. When it emerged again in the 1980s, acts like Ziskanan and Ti Fock presented a more digestible iteration of that sound, which got picked up by western labels. But in the 21st century, artists like Christine Salem and Danyèl Waro have broadened the appeal of maloya, while Jako Maron has used modular synths and drum machines to both modernize and scuff up the form, stripping it back to its spiky, percussive essence. Maron’s 2018 tape for Uganda’s Nyege Nyege label helped spread greater awareness of maloya far from the island. Maron appears three times on Digital Kabar: Electronic Maloya From La Réunion Since 1980, a wide-ranging 18-track set of older material and exclusive tracks that shows just how technology has altered the traditional sound of the island. Previously released on The Electro Maloya Experiments of Jako Maron, “Batbaté Maloya” strikes a midway point between Pan Sonic and charming drum-machine sputters, the ancillary buzz slowly throwing a pall over the entire track. As a producer for the hip-hop group Force Indigène, Maron blends together twanging strings and squalls of feedback. And his remix of drummer Patrick Manent’s “Kabaré Atèr” is as spare as can be. Rooting the mix  in vocal chants and relentless drums, he brusquely chops and loops the vocals into a jostling call-and-response, with a menacing dose of acid bass infiltrating the threshing rhythms of the hand percussion. Rather than intensify and add layers, at the midway point, Maron cuts the electronics out, leaving the drums and voice to tussle, a rare instance of a remixer extracting themselves from the music. Elsewhere, the set shows a plethora of artists moving away from the template, showing how the music naturally mutates the further it roams. In Berlin, the shakers and synth bass underpinning Alex Barck’s rework of Christine Salem’s “Oh Africa” percolate and carefully build to sweet dancefloor dopamine release. Barck, a member of Germany’s Sonar Kollektiv, is wise to foreground the evocative grain of Salem’s voice rather than overpower it with his own programming. Same with the stirring remix of Maya Kamaty’s “Pandiyé,” adding tumbling hand drums and her layered vocals until it achieves liftoff. Such reworkings of maloya don’t always fare so well. Do Moon’s update of Ti Fock’s 1985 track “Kom Lé Long” veers dangerously close to breezy house tropes, mixing marimba and kick drum until the vocals feel like an afterthought. The loungey downtempo dub of “Mahavel” comes across as velvety wallpaper, while Boogzbrown & Cubenx’s hectic “Butcha” gets shot through with a ludicrous array of laser effects, as if hunting for the birds chirping throughout the track. La Réunion’s indigenous feathered species are better served on L’abuse’s “Ré-Union.” The expansive centerpiece of the set, it’s a gently cresting slice of 124-bpm ambient house, the bird calls and handclaps judiciously mixed with wordless vocals and piano. Fragrant as it is, the track unceremoniously cuts out after 13 minutes. In the clash of traditional and futuristic, ancestral and electronic, Kabar brings to mind heady fusions like Shangaan electro, gqom, and batida that are sprouting up across the African continent and diaspora. Too often on this compilation, though, the remixers risk drowning out maloya’s  fiery, vital message. As the singer Firmin Viry once said, “It is the cry of the people.”","A traditional, once-suppressed style from La Réunion, a small island off the coast of Madagascar, meets the electronic music of the 21st century.

Ágætis byrjun,Sigur Rós,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d166b66da8a77000924abe0/1:1/w_160/SigurRos_A%CC%81g%C3%A6tisByrjun.jpg,2019-06-30 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sigur-ros-agaetis-byrjun/,Krunk,"With their second album, Ágætis byrjun, Sigur Rós knew only that they wanted to make things bigger. Their first record, 1997’s Von, was dark and, by the standards of what they became famous for, positively screechy: Back then, they were inspired by the hurtling propulsion of Smashing Pumpkins and My Bloody Valentine, bands that generated soothing textures from cacophony. Von sold 300 copies in Iceland. But the dismal showing left no seeming dent on young Jónsi Birgisson’s confidence. The singer posted a salvo on the band’s website prior to Agaetis’ release: “We are simply gonna change music forever, and the way people think about music.” It’s alarming to consider, from the vantage of 2019, the degree to which he seems to have accomplished his mission. If we now live in a world of small, soft drones, a pruned garden of “Lush Lofi” and “Ambient Chill” and “Ethereal Vibes” Spotify playlists, we can blame this condition, at least in part, on the impact of Ágætis byrjun. It is an album that has terraformed our landscape—so much of our lives now sounds like it, from Nissan commercials to “Planet Earth” documentaries to the long trail of ads that could not procure Sigur Rós’ approval and went about constructing benign replicas of Sigur Rós songs instead. Before Ágætis, post-rock was a niche concern, a tiny sub-sub-genre centered around a dozen or so bands in England and North America—Stereolab, Bark Psychosis and a few others in London; Tortoise and Gastr del Sol in Chicago; Godspeed You! Black Emperor in Montreal. After Ágætis, the sound—massive, surging, triumphal; melancholic and soothing and mostly major-key; wreathed in strings and horns and ripe with melodrama and headlocking you into transcendence—is a global phenomenon. They opened for Radiohead; they turned down a slot on “Letterman” because the host wouldn’t give them enough time. They even appeared on “The Simpsons.” Twenty years into their career, they tour arenas and command a massive following. They are a cultural institution. It’s hard to know if Ágætis byrjun catalyzed the massive shifts that unfolded in its wake, or if those shifts were already brewing, in search of a seaworthy vessel to carry us wherever it was going. Today, Sigur Rós’ career seems like a natural and desirable trajectory: Get your music into the ears of some important people (in Sigur Rós’ case, it was celebrities like Brad Pitt and Gwyneth Paltrow); from there, your music might shoot outward into some large-scale and modestly experimental commercial film (Tom Cruise and Cameron Crowe’s Vanilla Sky); and then it can rain down into dozens and dozens of television shows via the diligent work of music supervisors. But when it all happened to Sigur Rós, it was all pretty new, and it was all happening to the music industry at the same time. To make the album itself, they recruited a keyboardist named Kjartan Sveinsson, who knew a lot more than they did about the things they were interested in—arrangements, composition, songs that sounded like cavernous day spas. They enlisted producer Ken Thomas, who started out as an assistant working on Queen albums before moving on to early industrial acts like Throbbing Gristle and Einstürzende Neubauten. He also mixed the first record by Björk’s early band the Sugarcubes, which is what led him to Sigur Rós. With Thomas, they built a record that felt like being stuck inside a church bell. Their enormous sound came not from size, but from scale. The distance between the quietest noises—the little cymbals ticking the eight notes on “Svefn-g-englar,” Birgisson’s falsetto—and the loudest ones—say, the drums and organ that land like Thor’s hammer about six minutes into the same track—feels measurable only in miles. It is a long, liquid sound, devoid of sharp points: Even the most massive dynamic shifts happen with rounded edges. The drums are nested inside so much reverb that you can nearly hear the air gathering around the snare head before impact. Birgisson played his electric guitar with a cello bow, which offered the sonorous tones of feedback without the disturbance of picks. It is thunderous and dreamy, soothing and stirring—a big, frosted wedding cake of mallet percussion and pianos and strings and piping, cooing vocals. It is a sound designed to overwhelm, and it does, which is probably how British critics ended up gasping that the music was “like God weeping tears of gold in heaven.” Music of this scale is never kind on the higher faculties. The album is a triumph, above all, of arrangement and engineering. When the piano kicks in on “Starálfur” (the same one that accompanies the discovery of the mythical jaguar shark in The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou), I still have to suppress a delighted giggle of wonder. It’s like watching an invasion of CGI superheroes, or (I imagine) revving a high-performance car and watching the speedometer float. It isn’t so much a sound as a special effect, and it communicates with your brain solely in dopamine floods. If you are inclined to sniff suspiciously around grandiose music, examining it for kitsch, you probably reeled away staggering from Sigur Rós, who proudly stink of it. This was another part of their appeal and their strength: The music is texturally complex, for sure, but the emotional framework is deliberately simple and clear. They are gloriously unafraid of blast-off. The piping melody that ends “Olsen Olsen,” doubled up with horns and a choir, is straight out of a Mannheim Steamroller Christmas album. Live, they maintained this communal feeling without sacrificing clarity. You can hear this in the live recording included in a generous and fulsome new 20th-anniversary reissue. The gig was June 12, 1999 at Reykjavík’s Íslenska Óperan—an album-release celebration. They were brand new to this material, but somehow they sounded as commanding then as they do now. The box set also includes reams of demos and half-finished versions of Ágætis byrjun—they provide a nice glimpse into the band’s working method, which was open-ended and involved multiple versions of the same song, some with or without vocals or at different speeds. Spending time with all of these raw tracks is a bit like opening up a “version history” in Google Docs—you learn a little bit about how the final product came to be, but it only serves to heighten your appreciation that you were spared the editing process. Parsing the re-release, I was drawn back to the album itself again. It doesn’t really require elaboration, or added context. It’s entire appeal lay in the sense that it dropped, immaculate and mysterious, from the sky. Unless you were Icelandic, you didn’t know what they were saying—and often not even then. On Ágætis, Birgisson famously dabbled in an invented language called Hopelandic—some on “Olsen Olsen,” and some lightly sprinkled throughout. This might have spurred some listeners on to discover “what he was saying,” but for most of us, he was saying whatever we heard. His words were not messages, they were bird calls. The single most indelible word Birgisson has ever sung—“tju”—is a gibberish syllable, a refrain from “Svefn-g-nglar” that sounded then and will always sound just like “It’s you.” There were no other meanings within to parse or contemplate—just a pretty sound. We heard ourselves in it.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

Bandana,Freddie GibbsMadlib,by: Stephen Kearse,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ceed44185a35da0dae64b10/1:1/w_160/FreddieGibbs&Madlib_Bandana.jpg,2019-06-29 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/freddie-gibbs-and-madlib-bandana/,Keep CoolRCAMadlib InvazionESGN,"On paper, Freddie Gibbs, a straight-shooting street rapper, and Madlib, an eccentric tinkerer, are as mouth-watering a combo as licorice and pickle juice. But their collaborative 2014 album Piñata succeeded because the two are equally uncompromising: Madlib tailors beats to his eclectic ears alone, while Gibbs insists that he can rap over anything. Kindred spirits, the pair bonded through mutual gumption. On follow-up Bandana, the bond deepens. Madlib’s beats remain off-kilter, and Gibbs remains gangster, but there’s a looser feel to this record, a spirit of intuition and intimacy. Their overall recording process didn’t change much: Madlib sent beats and Gibbs rapped over them as is—samples, pauses, breaks, and all. This time, though, they made the effort to meet in the studio and review different mixes and edits, to calibrate. The result is a keener sense of each other’s presence. Moving in lockstep, Gibbs and Madlib pull themselves deeper into one another’s worlds, forging a new one in the process. On Piñata, the duo bridged Gibbs’ street sense and Madlib’s throwback flair by embracing the sounds and attitudes of blaxploitation. Smoky soul drifted out of every crevice, drugs flooded the streets, and middle fingers never came down. The general vibe was defiant, gritty, and nostalgic, fitting the back-to-basics spirit of a proud lyricist linking with an inveterate crate-digger. Bandana is palpably more unhinged, less rooted in a particular time or style or mood. The through line is black freedom. Across the record Gibbs mentions various black figures and tragedies, from the transatlantic slave trade (“Flat Tummy Tea”) to Baltimore drug kingpin Melvin Williams (“Education”) to basketball star Allen Iverson (“Practice”) to the death by police bombing of mass shooter Micah Johnson (“Soul Right”) to Tupac’s assault on the Hughes Brothers (“Massage Seats”), weaving a grand, ambiguous tapestry. Gibbs has been talking black power in various forms since his early mixtapes, but here he’s less certain about what it looks like, who embodies it, how to secure it. As he takes a fuller view of his life and the fates of his idols, he grows more cautious. “I can’t move the same/I gotta readjust how I maneuver,” he insists on “Gat Damn.” He’s kept on his toes by Madlib’s strikingly robust production, which is maximal compared to his revered lo-fi sound. “Half Manne Half Cocaine” begins with ticking hi-hats and bass kicks topped by twinkly bells, then spazzes into a torrent of cymbals and sampled shouts—trap by way of EPMD. The scuzzy riff on “Flat Tummy Tea” is stretched, distorted, and splashed with atonal effects that evaporate into a breakbeat. Madlib has always been an unsparing producer, but this is one of the few times he’s allowed himself to be baroque. Gibbs’ rapping is just as fitful. Jerky yet nimble, he regularly drops in and out of cadence, throttling and braking his flows to accent key images. On “Situations,” he mentions surviving a shooting that claimed his cousin, sprinting through the memory like he’s felt a sudden jolt of pain. “Cousin took two to the brain/Bullets missed me it’s a blessing/I could see the day like it was yesterday I’ll never forget it,” he says, cramming the last line into one bar. On “Gat Damn,” he recalls fasting in an Austrian prison that didn’t provide Muslim-friendly meals. “Say my prayers, Alhamduillah/No bacon, ham, bacon, ham/And cold salami/That’s all they serving,” he sings, evoking the strain of the experience by spacing out his words. Gibbs boasts often of his versatility, but here his movement is dictated by purpose rather than reflex. A current of self-discovery bubbles beneath all this motion. Madlib emerges as less subdued, more emboldened to challenge his collaborator (and the listener) rather than shroud his ideas in fog. His catalog is full of gems, but not since Georgia Anne Muldrow’s Seeds, and Madvillainy before that, has the Beat Konducta felt like, well, a conductor, actively dictating the path the music takes. You can feel Gibbs’ ideas being guided by the dreamy loops on “Crime Pays” and the humid sway of “Cataracts.” The album’s few misfires occur when guests misread the room. Continuing his one-man nostalgia show, Anderson .Paak’s bloodless crooning on “Giannis” is pure pastiche. “Power, love, and loyalty,” he reads from a movie poster. Pusha T and Killer Mike’s appearances on “Palmolive” are stiff compared to Gibbs’ constant action. They treat the song’s beautiful main loop like a fossil in a museum, admiring it from afar. Black Thought and Yasiin Bey are the only ones who seem to share Gibbs’ hunger here. Overcoming the constraints on black freedom was always the underlying mission of Madlib’s beloved jazz and soul artists, as well as Gibbs’ prized black rebels. For Bandana, the pair taps into that heritage and allow themselves to be shaped by its highs and lows, its heroes and villains. Finding themselves within that slipstream of black thought and life, they plot their course on their terms. Bandana is tradition and transgression: one rapper, one producer, no limitations.","On their second album as a duo, Madlib and Freddie Gibbs pull themselves deeper into one another’s worlds.

Taxi Sampler 01: Rhythms & Vibes From the Spirit of Young Africa,Various Artists,by: E. Tammy Kim,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d0a57f717fa5e15c6e51878/1:1/w_160/TaxiSampler_Various.jpg,2019-06-29 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-taxi-sampler-01-rhythms-and-vibes-from-the-spirit-of-young-africa/,Python Syndicate,"When in Rome, the young visual collective Crudo Volta dreams of Lagos, Cotonou, and Maputo. The name Crudo Volta translates from the Italian as “a time for rawness”—something jagged and pure. Its members make high-energy, high-gloss documentary films that bridge Africa and the African diaspora. But despite its flagship medium, Crudo Volta is, at its core, all about sound. In 2016, the group made Woza Taxi, a short movie about gqom, a nocturnal house genre birthed in Durban, South Africa. Next came Yenkyi Taxi, which followed Brendan “Hagan” Opoku-Ware, a London-based producer, through Accra, Ghana, where his family is originally from. And earlier this year, Crudo Volta debuted “Taxi Waves,” an Italian streaming series on youth music scenes in Ethiopia, Mozambique, and Nigeria. Now, the collective has spun off a record label that draws on its sonic archive and transnational ties. That label, Python Syndicate, is a two-man joint, run by Mike Calandra Achode, a Beninese-Italian graphic designer and founding member of Crudo Volta, and Nan Kolè, a DJ and gqom evangelist. Their first release is Taxi Sampler 01: Rhythms & Vibes from the Spirit of Young Africa, a two-LP set featuring “the sonic and cultural landscape” of the continent’s contemporary underground, replete with a 26-page photo booklet. The album is a musical skinny dip into a warm lagoon—which is to say, no previous experience with African club music necessary. Achode and Kolè have chosen a mix of previously unreleased tracks and tunes familiar to Afrophilic cosmopolitan DJs—by artists including Young John, Hagan, Gafacci, Sess the Problem, Ellputo, and TLC FAM. Many of the songs are fun and danceable; others hit a hypnotic groove and get stuck, looping into boredom. Every few tracks on the LP version, there’s also a short “skit”—an interview with a music-maker—reminiscent of both ethnographic field recordings and the palate-cleansing entr’actes on rap and R&B albums. In one, Ghanaian producer Gafacci recalls his father telling him, “Hey, you have to have African elements in your songs.” (This interview appears in Yenkyi Taxi.) Another skit proceeds in an unidentified language, conveying an impression of unmediated foreignness. In their signaling of authenticity, these snippets can feel heavy-handed, but it’s nice to put a lilting voice and laugh to a name. The strongest tracks on Taxi Sampler 01 come from two better-known artists, Rvdical the Kid and Ethiopian Records. In “Tigist,” the Addis Ababa-born Ethiopian Records opens with dueling synth swirls and a heaving drone, then builds with organic complements: palmed drums and a reedy flute. Rvdical the Kid, a DJ and producer who splits his time between the U.S. and West Africa,  blends soul and funk vocals, call-and-response shouts, and an insistent, trap-like bass in “Yama Kegule” and “Free Spirit.” Both artists work up a density in their tunes, as though they’ve swaddled the underlying beat, then peeled and unpeeled the layers, to the listener’s surprise. All this adding and subtracting moves their music along, toward peaks and troughs and suspenseful transitions. Other, lesser tunes on the album are static by comparison, building only in terms of decibels, not emotion. It might be said that electronic music should move with the imagined velocity, mystery, and danger of a taxi, the preferred motif of Crudo Volta and Python Syndicate. On countless productions of World Music 2.0—the term for post-colonial, post-ethnographic global sounds—the taxi has symbolized movement through unfamiliar territory. For listeners new to gqom, Afrobass, and Ethiopiyawi Electronic, that’s what Taxi Sampler 01 does best.","The eclectic comp from the Rome-based collective Crudo Volta is a solid primer for those new to gqom, Afrobass, and Ethiopiyawi Electronic.

Radish,Big Bend,by: Zach Schonfeld,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d02b277b6e2e36116c9d3cc/1:1/w_160/Radish_BigBend.jpg,2019-06-29 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/big-bend-radish/,self-released,"Many working musicians struggle to balance service jobs and artistic pursuits. Nathan Phillips, an experimental pianist and composer from Ohio who records as Big Bend, found an unusual harmony between the two. Phillips wrote the vocal melodies for his airily gorgeous new album, Radish, by listening to the music of Estonian composer Arvo Pärt while mopping floors at a cafe after hours. “When customers weren’t around, Phillips tried out the lines, experimenting with singing outside familiar meters,” his Bandcamp page reads. Indeed, little of the music Phillips makes falls within the constraints of “familiar meters,” or familiar anything. Drawn from improvised sessions with small groups of musicians, Radish flits seamlessly between wobbly electronic pop (“Long Time”), soaring post-rock grandeur (“Can’t Get Around”), and stretches of top-shelf ambient minimalism (“12'-15'”). Big Bend’s previous album, Hunched, was strictly instrumental. Here, Phillips’ bright, flowing voice (which has been compared to Sting’s) shares space with contributions from celebrated experimentalists Laraaji, on zither, and Susan Alcorn, on pedal steel. He also knows when to step away from the mic: “Four,” one of two instrumental songs, is a cosmic communion between half-stepping piano and Laraaji’s fluttering zither. Phillips built these songs by detaching his vocals from the Arvo Pärt pieces and creating new music around them, but the resulting album is not some austere deconstructivist exercise. It is intimate, warm, emotionally inviting. It is even a family affair: Phillips’ mother, also a singer, lends her vibrato to “Swinging Low,” where operatic vocal swells make an intriguing contrast to rustling electronic pitter-patter. “Before” is a less successful experiment, allowing harsh, stuttering beats to bump up uncomfortably against Big Bend’s atmospheric proclivities. Phillips is an inventive songwriter, and his ear for sonic and compositional detail is remarkable. Consider the way the bass enters mid-syllable in “Floating,” bringing sudden rhythmic clarity to the track’s start-stop percussive patterns, or how the whirring feedback that anchors “12'-15'” follows its own melodic logic, curiously apart from other pieces of the puzzle. “Can’t Get Around,” the clear centerpiece, is a brooding stunner that brings to mind the work of These New Puritans, Port St. Willow, or Talk Talk. The song’s climactic weight hinges on Phillips’ shifting piano chords, which unfold with the patience and grace of a Spirit of Eden outtake. As a lyricist, Phillips is interested in aging, survival, and “spiritual phases,” as he puts it, though not overt religiosity. He repurposes a Bee Gees refrain on “Before” (“staying alive, staying alive”) and decides he’s “finally sold on the idea of getting old” in “Floating.” “Can’t Get Around” suggests a spiritual crisis and an accompanying sense of entrapment. But much of this album remains pleasantly mysterious, from the hazy cover image to the title. (The last track, “Floating,” does mention a radish, but still—why?) That’s not necessarily a gripe: Curious, open-ended, and slyly resistant to categorization, Radish is the best kind of mystery.","Experimental pianist Nathan Phillips flits seamlessly between wobbly electronic pop, soaring post-rock grandeur, and ambient minimalism.

Tears of Joy,MIKE,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d10e2f7c0b1609db547e04e/1:1/w_160/tearsofjoy_mike.jpg,2019-06-28 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mike-tears-of-joy/,10k,"It’s easy to get lost in MIKE’s Tears of Joy: the baritone voice, the abstract bars, the unrecognizable sample chops that lift you into his painful world. The Bronx emcee has kept his personal life close to his chest, only revealing small bits here and there, mainly his deep emotional and spiritual connection to his mother. Tears of Joy is a magnetic and loving tribute to his mother, who passed away recently. After years of shadowy raps, MIKE is at his most vulnerable in the face of tragedy, able to turn grief and frustration into an album rich with both musical and individual growth. Much of MIKE’s writing has come off as a stream of consciousness, but on Tears of Joy every bar has a purpose. “Sittin’ with my head in my hands, hold it in” and “Trippin’ why my eyes always damp, roll a spliff,” he says defeatedly on the album’s intro. On the following track, “Whole Wide World,” he sounds like he’s sleepwalking, stuck in a state of gloom. “Shit scary, but I stay spinnin’/Lookin’ through obituaries with your name in it,” says the 20-year-old in a heavy voice, over an Ohbliv beat that feels like you’re stuck eternally in the waiting room at the dentist. MIKE’s music is a mood, always attempting to drag itself through the melancholy to seek a brighter outlook. On “Ain’t No Love,” he warmly reflects over a dreamy Ted Kamal production, perfect for a Sunday morning: “With my moms that type of stress is soothing/Really wrapped around your arm while the weather gruesome.” Then, long-time collaborator Adé Hakim laces MIKE with a head-knocker of a beat and he stumbles into that new outlook. “I remember I was blinded, I can see now,” he says heartily on “Planet.” His feelings are an endless back and forth: breakthrough followed by agony; agony followed by breakthrough. And he often just opts to numb that uncertainty by smoking his days away: “Why you always see me high, it’s hard to come down.” But MIKE shines brightest when he takes over the production reigns under his beat-making alias DJ Blackpower. It’s like these songs specifically were recorded in a room, alone, with his eyes shut, picturing both the past he misses and the future he dreams of. There are times when he realizes that his youth has just been ripped from him and moments when he’s keeping his feelings stuffed in a box, but the way he weaves in his rich vocal samples and the steady bounce of the drums gives off a feeling of joy even at his most bleak. The album’s finale—the horn-laden, Navy Blue-produced “Stargazer Pt. 3”—is both crushing and cheerful. MIKE raps in a voice that sounds like he’s trembling, seconds away from tears. He’s still grieving and maybe he always will be, but those better days are within reach. That hopefulness has been the core of MIKE’s music since he was just a promising Bronx teenager with an affinity for words, searching for the voice he’s finally found.","The Bronx rapper drags himself back and forth between agony and breakthrough on his latest record, the fullest and most realized album of the 20-year-old’s career.

Late Night Feelings,Mark Ronson,by: Peyton Thomas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cfe8f928b427a7a5dc5dbc7/1:1/w_160/LateNightFeeling_MarkRonson.jpg,2019-06-28 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mark-ronson-late-night-feelings/,RCA,"The artist Audrey Wollen, best known as the creator of Sad Girl Theory, has long argued for the radical potential of feminine sorrow. Rather than weakness to be purged, Wollen sees a sturdy foundation for collective action. “Feminism should acknowledge that being a girl in this world is really hard, one of the hardest things there is,” Wollen said, in a 2015 interview. “Our sadness is actually a very appropriate and informed reaction.” Something of Wollen’s principles surface in Late Night Feelings, a collection of 13 songs produced by Mark Ronson and performed and co-written by a suite of female vocalists. Ronson has described these tunes as “sad bangers;” contributor Camila Cabello called them “emo bops sung by girls about love and heartbreak.” And while the prevailing mood is, indeed, sadness, the record makes for a finely shaded portrayal of that feeling. In a pop landscape at present awash in sad girls, Late Night Feelings lands several notches below the profundity of Lorde’s feral manifesto and several notches above Bebe Rexha’s disjointed smash of yesteryear, “I’m A Mess.” Never nihilistic, never narcissistic, the women of Late Night Feelings understand sadness as a vital conduit for solidarity and self-expression. It’s not a knock on Ronson to say that the project succeeds, in large part, because of how little it sounds like his work. His distinctive production hallmarks—the neo-soul of Amy Winehouse, the sticky bounce of “Uptown Funk”—are largely absent, save for brief, restrained doses. The women on this record are diverse in terms of race and orientation, their target audiences, and their places in the music industry. For the most part, Ronson seems content to remain seated at the boards, allowing the unique strengths of each vocalist to inform the music. A long stretch of the album is commanded by YEBBA, who proves conclusively, across three tracks, that she has the range, darling. Her daring vocals leap from near-Joanna Newsom falsetto to sultry, guttural contralto. Her delivery defies convention, particularly on “When U Went Away,” where she makes a glorious, expressive meal of a lyric as simple as “I’m gonna be alright.” Another highlight is “Why Hide,” an understated ballad from tremendous talent Diana Gordon. Gordon, a Beyoncé co-writer whose 2011 debut album as Wynter Gordon flew under the public radar, has been waiting and working for a breakthrough for a number of years. May this track be her first step toward ubiquity. Lykke Li, no stranger to Sad Girl Theory, gives game performances on the title track and the penultimate “2AM,” lending nuanced perspective to narratives of unrequited love and emotional manipulation. She calls the uncaring cad of her affection to account, demanding better from him, never understating or excusing the damage he causes. Her anger, her sadness, even her tendency to fall for uncaring cads—all of these are stated plainly, and none of them lay the blame at her own feet. A similar ethic courses through Angel Olsen’s “True Blue”: heartbreak as reasonable, justified reaction to cruelty. In her delivery, Olsen’s voice becomes a damning, pointing finger: “I ran to you, and you know why.” Not every song on Late Night Feelings can rival these peaks, but even at its lower points, the album is refreshingly candid. “Find U Again,” performed and co-written by Cabello, is wildly endearing for the sheer, unapologetic 22-year-old-ness of its perspective. “This crush is kind of crushing me,” she sings, and follows the line with: “I do therapy at least twice a week.” The lyric is no less effective for its clumsiness, an honest expression of anguish that resists the urge to slap a pretty, poetic bow on weeping on the sofa in a psychotherapist’s office. Even “Nothing Breaks Like a Heart,” a Miley Cyrus contribution that aims to recapture the magic of her “Jolene” cover, is a cut above her middling recent history. Though much of the song dips into pop cliché unmoored from context, a brief reference to a “burning house” with “nothing left” is a jarring reminder of Cyrus’s real, aching vulnerability: her house really did burn down in the Woolsey Fire; she really did lose her home. Cyrus recently starred in an episode of “Black Mirror,” playing a pop star clad in cotton-candy colors who retreated, miserable, to her grand piano in the early hours of the morning to pen acoustic numbers about being, despite all her rage, still just a rat in a cage. The episode was laughably out of touch in its portrayal of the plight of the modern pop star, in large part because pop does, increasingly, take the sadness of girls seriously. It’s hard to imagine pap like “On a Roll” taking root in an era where Beyoncé makes history by narrating her honest feelings of worthlessness in the aftermath of infidelity, or Billie Eilish dominates the charts by vomiting tarantulas. Late Night Feelings is not the first recent record to treat the sadness of women as a healthy response to all manner of hurt. It is, however, a worthy entry in this still-developing pop pantheon, authentic and honest in its rendering of many shades of feminine sorrow.

The Life of Pi’erre 4,Pi’erre Bourne,by: Reed Jackson,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d0cf22cc0b16039d047de62/1:1/w_160/pierrebourne_thelifeof.png,2019-06-28 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pierre-bourne-the-life-of-pierre-4/,SossHouseInterscope,"Most hip-hop producers could put in their 10,000 hours on FruityLoops and still never come close to Playboi Carti’s “Magnolia.” The blissfully simple four-note earworm earned Carti his cult following and turned its maker, Pi’erre Bourne, into a sought-after producer. Rather than continue to feed hits to stars like Carti, Lil Uzi Vert and 21 Savage, Bourne has put all his attention into his solo career as a rapper. Which brings us to The Life of Pi’erre 4, his major-label debut and the first real test of whether he can carry a project. The answer is not quite—his heavily Auto-Tuned vocals have a tendency to get washed out by his hazy backdrops, and Pi’erre 4 is one-note as a result, more vibe than statement. At least the vibe is enticing. Bourne’s beats hum with the same off-kilter melodies that made “Magnolia” so thrilling, and the edges are filled with interesting noises. The fuzzy synth notes on “Be Mine” sound like they were played on an electrified toy piano, while “Romeo Must Die” turns on a distorted refrain that sounds recorded 500 feet below the ocean surface. Most of the tracks are accentuated by over-the-top sound effects—a lion roar, or a reworked vintage DJ drop (“Damn Pi’erre, where’d you find this?”)—that give the project the momentum of a street-bought mixtape. Once you get past the initial dopamine rush, Bourne starts to run into trouble. Unlike the MCs who buy his beats, none of which are featured here, he fully saturates his voice in Auto-Tune, more akin to T-Pain or Fetty Wap than Uzi. His voice often drowns in the mix as a result. Add this to the fact that none of the songs evolve much over their runtimes —put Pi’erre 4 in waveform, and it’d look like a bread loaf, a hunk of sound with no peaks or valleys—and you start to tune out. Which is a shame, because Bourne puts effort into his lyrics. All the obvious tropes are here—money-chasing anthems (“Doublemint”), odes to jealous exes (“Feds”)—but he hints at a more interesting story in between. On “How High,” he dives into his formative years in Queens (where he split time between South Carolina): “Just a college nigga, honor roll/I dropped out of college, lost my home.” On “Try Again,” he speaks of the loneliness that comes with his sudden rise in fame: “It’s just me, and I’m alone again/Spending all my money on my own again.” There are some catchy hooks as well—on “Racer,” Bourne croons nimbly alongside some late-’90s R&B keyboards—but for the most part, the beats on Pi’erre 4 speak the loudest. Nowhere is that more obvious than on standout track “Guillotine.” The beat sounds like Bourne looped a creaking screen door; a warped sample breathes with the beat, groaning ruefully every four bars. The sound alone says more than the forgettable clichés of Bourne’s lyrics, demonstrating that the producer, for now, does his best work behind the boards.","Playboi Carti’s go-to producer goes solo, crooning in AutoTune over his blissfully simple earworm beats.

Raving Disco Breaks Vol. 1,Eris Drew,by: Shawn Reynaldo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d10e60517fa5e7536e51c25/1:1/w_160/RavingDisco_ErisDrew.jpg,2019-06-28 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/eris-drew-raving-disco-breaks-vol-1/,T4T LUV NRG,"It often feels like the word “rave” means about as much to electronic-music fans these days as “punk” does to the rock crowd. The term can still conjure certain iconic images—booming sound systems, dancing masses, Day-Glo attire—but there’s no denying that rave culture long ago lapsed into caricature. You’re as likely to hear the word used by a hectoring politician or youth marketing specialist as by someone actually in the know. So it’s curious that Eris Drew has titled her latest mix Raving Disco Breaks Vol. 1, which kicks off her T4T LUV NRG label with her partner Octo Octa. There are some genuinely ravey moments—particularly the organ vamps and piano stabs toward the end of the mix’s latter half, which she’s dubbed “I’ve Got a Story to Tell…” (The first half is called “Good News Boppers!” and yes, that’s a reference to 1979 cult classic The Warriors.) On the whole, though, the session showcases her deep affection for a particular strain of early- and mid-’90s breakbeat house music that likely soundtracked many of her youthful nights out while growing up outside of Chicago. Drew, who still calls the Windy City home, came of age when house music was still emerging from the local black and queer communities in which it was born. That history is inextricable from this mix, even on a technical level, as Drew relies not only on vinyl, but also on uniquely Midwestern techniques such as doubles (cutting back and forth between the same record on both turntables) and fast-paced “hot mixing” (rapid transitions between records). For a generation of electronic-music aficionados brought up worshipping ultra-precise, nearly imperceptible transitions, Drew’s quick cuts and sudden turns may sound odd or even jarring, but Raving Disco Breaks offers a window into how many of dance music’s originators operate behind the decks. That window also includes the music itself, which drips with elements of funk, soul, disco, and even hip-hop. The mix is full of black voices, many of the diva variety, and although there’s no rapping, the music swings with the same sort of euphoric abandon and loose shimmy that characterized hip-house during its brief heyday. These days, it’s easy to conflate all electronic music with the rigid, four-to-the-floor march of Instagram-ready tech house and Berlin-style techno, but back in the ’90s, house and techno tunes were just as likely to sashay down the runway as they were to pummel you into submission. Where does the raving come in? It’s there, but Drew isn’t waxing nostalgic about glowsticks and JNCOs. Her artistry is driven by what she calls the Motherbeat, a sort of divine feminine energy and ancient healing force that she says first came to her in a vision while she was being driven home from a party, high on LSD, in 1994. Simply put, her rave roots run deep, and she’s interested in the culture’s most powerful element: freedom. She is a trans woman whose life has been profoundly shaped by experiences on the dancefloor, so it makes sense that Raving Disco Breaks’ connective thread is one of joy, elation, and release. Drew not only found herself on the dancefloor; she also found a kindred spirit and loving partner in Octo Octa, and their T4T LUV NRG label—which sprang out of a series of back-to-back DJ gigs under the same name—is both a celebration of that love and a full-throated celebration of trans visibility. (T4T is short for “trans for trans.”) All profits from Raving Disco Breaks Vol. 1 will be donated to the Sylvia Rivera Law Project (SRLP), a nonprofit working in defense of gender identity and expression. Given the “Vol. 1” of the title, we can assume, or at least hope, that additional installments are on the way. If they maintain the vibe of this first Raving Disco Breaks, celebrating dance music’s marginalized past while optimistically working toward a more accepting future, then perhaps the term “rave” might still have some legs after all.","Inspired by house music’s roots in the queer and black communities of her hometown, the Chicago DJ delivers a DJ set joyfully at odds with the dominant strains of contemporary dance music.

ANIMA,Thom Yorke,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d127361303a81d71c512287/1:1/w_160/anima_ThomYorke.jpg,2019-06-27 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/thom-yorke-anima/,XL,"Earlier this month, a strange advertisement for ANIMA Technologies appeared inside London’s Tube. The company purported to have built something called a “Dream Camera,” a device capable of capturing the world of the unconscious: “Just call or text the number and we’ll get your dreams back,” the copy promised. But curious callers were treated to a cryptic voice message, a jumble of stilted legalese read in a thin, unctuous voice, that apparently rendered the Dream Camera’s promise moot: something about a cease and desist from the High Court, an admission of “serious and flagrant unlawful activities.” There were only ever two things this ad could be: Some exhausting promo for the worst  “Black Mirror” episode yet or an oblique tease of Thom Yorke’s third solo album, ANIMA. Dreams and a healthy distrust of a techno-dystopia have long been pillars of Radiohead and Yorke’s songwriting. The wires of the brain and the wires of the world are forever being crossed: Fake plastic trees, paranoid androids, mobiles chirping, low-flying panic attacks. So of course the man who has sung about the narcotized rhythms of urban life would want to snap commuters out of their reveries with a once-in-a-lifetime promise. Dreams, nightmares, and sleepwalking haunt the songs of ANIMA, Yorke’s most ambitious and assured solo album yet. It is the darkest and tenderest music he has released outside of Radiohead, floating uneasily through the space between societal turmoil and internal monologue. ANIMA is the product of what Yorke has described as an extended period of anxiety, and it sounds like it, full of wraithlike frequencies and fibrillating pulses. That’s not a huge surprise: Yorke’s solo material has always sounded anxious, sometimes to its detriment. Where The Eraser, his solo debut, largely succeeded in channeling the decade’s post-millennium tension into compellingly moody electronic abstractions, 2014’s Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes too often felt claustrophobic, morose, enervated. In contrast, ANIMA’s tone throughout is meaty, full-blooded, often a little menacing. Yorke’s melancholy has grown teeth. Yorke has long been a fan of left-of-center dance music; remixes commissioned for The Eraser and The King of Limbs constituted a who’s who of the European club vanguard. But this is the first of his own productions where it feels like he and longtime production partner Nigel Godrich really get it, where their beatmaking strides beyond contemporary fashion. The influence of James Holden and his Border Community label, an avant-techno touchstone, is all over ANIMA’s burly bass synths and jabbing pulses. Syncopated, spring-loaded grooves are reminiscent of Four Tet and Floating Points; the blippy “Not the News” channels Zomby and Actress. Yet for all the music’s heavy electronic bent, it isn’t obviously mapped to a rhythmic grid: It slips and slides all over the place, wheezy synths surging in waves, feeling restless and hungry. Yorke treats climaxes with a boxer’s strategy—feinting, falling back, changing the angle of his attack. Critics have sometimes complained—understandably, if not always correctly—that Yorke’s solo work has felt incomplete. As frontman and linchpin of one of the world’s most dynamic rock bands, Yorke has had to work doubly hard to convince listeners that his late nights in front of a laptop are equally worthy of their attention. But ANIMA proves how much he and Godrich are capable of on their own. His bandmates’ influence colored The Eraser; on the more unmoored Tomorrow’s Modern Boxes, their absence loomed large. But here he and Godrich have perfected a sound of their own, one that doesn’t take Radiohead’s achievements as its primary unit of measurement. Track after track, Yorke proves the importance of stripping back. It’s remarkable how much he can make out of so little: The best songs here get by on the strength of just one or two synthesizer patches, a handful of electronic drum sounds—mostly just scraped white noise, plus the occasional booming kick drum—and his voice, processed and layered as often as is needed. “Impossible Knots” rides a propulsive electric bassline that lands somewhere between Afrobeat and Fugazi; the closing “Runwayaway” makes trance-like use of Tuareg-inspired desert blues guitar. There’s not much else. Every element practically dares you to so much as ask for any further accompaniment. There are a few outright topical songs—“The Axe” (“Goddamned machinery, why don’t you speak to me?/One day I am gonna take an axe to you”) will resonate with anyone who suspects technological progress is moving in the wrong direction—but for the most part, Yorke’s lyrics remain imagistic, non-specific, as intractable as eye floaters. Fragmentary lines play out like pages ripped from a journal on the nightstand. Sometimes he seems to be muttering to himself; elsewhere his voice is chopped into a jumble of words dangled teasingly near the outer limits of meaning. “Twist” ends with an incantation that might be straight from a horror film: “A boy on a bike who is running away/An empty car in the woods, the motor left running.” We’re whipped back into the hypnopompic logic of Yorke’s tangled thoughts, the fogged film of ANIMA’s Dream Camera. A short film by Paul Thomas Anderson for Netflix accompanies the album, sequencing “Not the News,” “Traffic,” and “Dawn Chorus” into a single audiovisual suite. Its opening shots—a subway car full of commuters in drab colors, their exaggerated movements a herky-jerky pantomime of restless slumber—explicitly link back to those ANIMA Technologies subway ads, playfully smudging the edges of the album’s world and our own. Exquisitely choreographed by Damien Jalet, the film takes the form of a dream sequence, following Yorke as he follows a woman (played by his partner, Dajana Roncione) along a labyrinthine subterranean course. Both the album and the film hinge upon “Dawn Chorus,” one of the simplest, most beautiful songs in Yorke’s catalog. It is a reverential song about loss, nostalgia, and regret; a farewell to the departed and a celebration of second chances. Over patient synthesizer harmonies, Yorke mulls over ghosts of a past life, shadows of what might have been: “If you could do it all again,” he muses, each line trailing off into non sequitur, each stanza a stack of stray puzzle pieces. At the song’s apex, the synthesizers pause and crescendo softly, modulating as Yorke sings, his voice hushed: In the middle of the vortex
The wind picked up
Shook up the soot
From the chimney pot
Into spiral patterns
Of you my love If there’s a more perfect image of absence than these ashes dancing in midair, I don’t know it. Anderson’s film ends with Yorke awakening on the train, his face bathed in the light of daybreak as “Dawn Chorus” winds down. A moment before, he and Roncione have been locked in an intimate embrace, but as he opens his eyes, it is clear that he is alone. The song’s title has been a part of Radiohead lore for years now; only they know what other forms it might have taken, other meanings it might have accrued. But here, on a song starkly unadorned, Yorke expands his already vast catalog with a perfect, unforgettable song, an elegy for the dreams that cannot be retrieved.

Commit Yourself Completely,Car Seat Headrest,by: Ian Cohen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d09359d303a81a9b0511c06/1:1/w_160/commityourselfcompletely_carseatheadrest.jpg,2019-06-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/car-seat-headrest-commit-yourself-completely/,Matador,"Commit Yourself Completely is billed as a Car Seat Headrest live album, but it’s not all that conceptually different than Will Toledo’s studio releases. By collecting and reconfiguring previously available Car Seat Headrest songs, Commit Yourself Completely joins Teens of Style, a “Greatest Hits”-style sampler of his wildly prolific early years on Bandcamp, and last year’s Twin Fantasy (Face to Face), an upgraded recording of Toledo’s 2011 cult classic. Even Teens of Denial was subject to 2016’s most costly ex post facto tinkering this side of The Life of Pablo, and its outtakes were made available two years prior on How to Leave Town. But if Toledo has mostly used Matador’s reputation and reach to refurbish his catalog for a larger audience, Commit Yourself Completely aims to present Car Seat Headrest not as “Will Toledo,” but a mighty seven-piece filling a 1000-seat theater near you. Commit Yourself Completely was culled from about 50 shows on their 2018 tour and makes no attempt to imply otherwise—each of its nine tracks mentions the venue in which it was recorded. After finishing off a chiseled “Fill in the Blank,” Toledo asks “How many of you guys are in college?” to a crowd in Columbus, Ohio. The reaction is accordingly raucous for the home of the fourth-largest university in the United States. It’s his segue to a performance of “Drugs With Friends” in Amiens, France, which was likely the smallest gig they played on that tour. “I...feel like a lot of bands these days don’t have a particularly compelling live act,” Toledo said in a 2016 interview. But it’s also worth pointing out that most of the ’90s legends Car Seat Headrest are compared to were notorious for their non-committal stage presence, and Commit Yourself Completely has no qualms about a classic rawk heft that, say, Pavement or Guided By Voices could only embrace with irony or heroic beer consumption. CSH have the makings of a durable live institution. Toledo’s catalog spans over a dozen albums with songs that push past 10 minutes or more, and he’s clearly not against toying with them, live and in the studio. But Commit Yourself Completely offers the exact setlist one might expect from an hourlong set at Coachella or opening for Interpol or Death Cab for Cutie: eight of its nine tracks are culled from Teens of Denial and Twin Fantasy, and none would be considered a “deep cut.” There are no new verses, no extended solos, no unexpected covers or interpolations, no clues into what Toledo says he learned from studying James Brown and Swans’ Michael Gira as bandleaders. “Fill in the Blank” imagines Toledo in a muscle T rather than an oversized suit; “Drunk Drivers/Killer Whales” is strangely sluggish for what was intended to be a compilation of the tour’s most “fun” performances, and neither illuminates the studio original. The only outlier is a cover of Frank Ocean’s “Ivy” that’s popped up on setlists since 2016, treated with the deference one would expect after Toledo yearns to have the guy’s voice earlier on “Bodys.” While Toledo wisely avoids trying to emulate Frank Ocean’s vocals, there is an authorial voice shared between these two—a modern way with confessional tropes, a fondness for clever diversions and meta-commentary, informed by social media’s seemingly divergent aims of oversharing and content curation. Considering how Twin Fantasy and Monomania were Toledo’s longform conceptual explorations of queer sexual awakening and unrequited love, it’s possible he’s been trying to write his own “Ivy” for years; it’s also not impossible to think of the influence Toledo might’ve had on Ocean, a guy who’s shown a clear affinity for indie rock oddballs. For all of Commit Yourself Completely's intentions to recast Car Seat Headrest as a live juggernaut, the only essential cut finds Toledo at his most familiar: a solo performer giving the listener unfiltered access to his creative process.","Will Toledo takes Car Seat Headrest out of the bedroom and into a 1000-seat theater near you on the band’s first major live album.

Keepsake,Hatchie,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d02a090bb36146cb535056c/1:1/w_160/Keepsake_Hatchie.jpg,2019-06-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hatchie-keepsake/,Double Double Whammy,"Shoegaze offers the perfect place to bury bad feelings; there is a storied legacy of groups like Slowdive and Mazzy Star sinking Tory conservatism and post-breakup remorse into hazy swirls of distortion. Harriette Pilbeam uses Hatchie as an outlet for more quotidian concerns — friendships, romances, nostalgia. On her EP Sugar & Spice, Pilbeam offered glassy guitars, long sighs, and some bright choruses, but there was nothing darker beneath the surface to reward your close, ongoing attention. She promised a broader palette for her debut, but Keepsake feels hemmed in by the same lack of depth. Pillbeam's platonic ideal of dream pop goes down a bit too easy, like another rewatch of a John Hughes film. “Not That Kind” opens Keepsake with the same buzzing synthesizers and metallic guitars that made Sugar & Spice such a potent nostalgia trip. By the time the same patterns repeat on “Her Own Heart,” and again, slower, on “Kiss the Stars,” Keepsake begins to drag. Even “Stay With Me,” pitched as an electro-pop escape from the guitar-heavy record, sounds more like a Revlon commercial than anything memorable enough to spin at the party featured in its music video. In a vacuum, each of these tracks is inoffensive but forgettable. Taken together, they are much less than the sum of their parts. For an artist so laser-focused on pop production, Pilbeam’s songwriting is unapologetically sophomoric. Romance is either predestined in stars and magic (“Just as long as you keep me under your spell just a little longer,” she sings on “When I Get Out”) or painfully banal (“Just for a while, let’s reconcile,” she suggests on “Secret”). And as on her breakout single “Try,” the smallest efforts seem to mean the most: “Give it a try,” she repeats on the chorus of “Unwanted Guest.” At the very least, the platitudes provide a canvas of long vowels and deep sighs tailor-made for Pilbeam’s breathy vocals. Album closer “Keep” sticks out as the most successful riff on a preset formula. After a surprisingly upbeat intro propelled forward by rubbery synths, it builds in layers; by the time the vocals come in, mixed low, the song resembles a fresh take on the early Flying Nun catalog. Keepsake is an album filled with small, inspired moments like this, but they don’t add up to much. Sugary but hollow, Keepsake melts like cotton candy, dissolving on impact.

All the Mirrors In the House (Home Recordings 1979 - 1986),His Name Is Alive,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cd5a35685a35d0a62e63c8e/1:1/w_160/HisNameIsAlive_AllTheMirrorsInTheHouse.jpg,2019-06-27 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/his-name-is-alive-all-the-mirrors-in-the-house-home-recordings-1979-1986/,Disciples,"In the 29 years that he has helmed the idiosyncratic project His Name Is Alive, Warren Defever has made many different kinds of music, few of them obvious kin to one another: lo-fi bedroom pop, ramshackle ambient, straight-up R&B, spiritual jazz, stoner metal, even a psychedelic rock opera. Recently, Defever came across a box of cassettes—many without covers or cases, the labels scrawled in ballpoint or Sharpie—that lay at the root of all of it: his own adolescent (and preteen) home recordings, from the years predating HNIA. Some went as far back as 1979, when the Livonia, Michigan, native was just 10 years old. He paid fellow Michigander Shelley Salant, of Saturday Looks Good to Me and Tyvek, to make digital transfers of their contents, and he asked her to flag anything that sounded “new agey, ambient, or had echoey guitars.” All the Mirrors in the House is the fruit of that harvest: a slim, beguiling album of reverberant ambient made with piano, guitar, and rudimentary electronics—reverb pedal, boombox, 4-track recorder—all as smudged a kindergartener’s chalk drawing. Made without apparent prejudice, and fueled by the curiosity of the untutored mind, it is an astonishing document of lo-fi alchemy. On the surface, the sound of all 15 pieces is remarkably simple: They foreground graceful, slow-moving notes wrapped in reverb—though perhaps “foreground” is the wrong word for music that is mostly background. The space of a typical track is a dusky smear; the shape of a melody might suggest itself like the body of a whale slicing its way through cold water before disappearing into the darkness. The opening “Piano Rev” sounds exactly like its title suggests: sustained tones swishing gently in reverse. “Lliadin” is a soft wash of notes, wispy and kelp-like, on what might be a Casio’s string preset. “Something About Hope” multitracks fingerpicked acoustic guitar in wistful counterpoint; “Equally Divided” turns John Cale’s stabbing piano attack aqueous and unsteady. Rarely does a single track seem to use more than one ingredient; taking in the whole album is a little like looking at a backlit bar of homebrewed infusions, each glowing a slightly different shade, but all belonging to the same basic category. But beneath that outward simplicity lies a deeper layer of mystery, and as the album progresses, its composition becomes even murkier and more mercurial. Judging from the title, “Tape Slow” might be an experiment in playback speeds, but going by the sound of the thing, it might also be something far stranger, perhaps a chorus of Amazonian tree frogs on a muggy night. “Echo Lake” is stirred by faint splashing sounds, like oars in the water; the closing “F Choir” could be a chorus of whirly tubes. The album is sequenced to flow as one seamless suite, a technique that draws extra musicality out of what might otherwise feel sketch-like. There’s little trace of these songs’ making in their final forms; even Defever professes to remember little about how they were recorded. “By age 10, I had a tape recorder and was using it to capture the sounds of nearby lakes, thunderstorms, and my older brother’s LP collection played at the wrong speeds,” Defever recalls in the liner notes; he mentions using boomboxes to simulate multi-tracking, and an early-1980s guitar sampler with one second of memory. But these details are just teasing hints, which is as it should be: Part of the album’s charm is its flat-out improbability. As Mike McGonigal writes in a thoroughly entertaining essay accompanying the album: “Holy shit, whatever you think, this music is far better than it has any reason being.” It boggles the mind to imagine a suburban teenager in the early ’80s making music like this, even if he did have the legendary Canadian radio show Brave New Waves to help guide his nascent taste for outer-limits sounds. Ambient music was hardly a household concept back then; Brian Eno’s Ambient 1: Music for Airports, which helped popularize the idea, had been out for only a year before Defever began experimenting with tape. But for listeners familiar with His Name Is Alive’s catalog, what might be most intriguing is how much All the Mirrors in the House is in keeping with the rest of Defever’s discography. You can hear the same diffuse sounds running through the foggy melancholy of Livonia, his debut album; jump forward to 2017’s Black Wings, a workbook of ideas and alternate takes from the 2016 rock record Patterns of Light, and you’ll find exactly the same sorts of drones that form All the Mirrors in the House. “There’s such a unifying element to all of it that’s been there since the beginning,” Defever said of his work in an interview in late 2000, before the release of Someday My Blues Will Cover the Earth. Some details might change, he said, “but ultimately it’s the same feelings, the same perspectives, the same emotions every time in every song.” All the Mirrors in the House bears that out: It captures the essence of an idea that has bounced through his music ever since in a never-ending chain of reflections.","Fueled by the curiosity of the untutored mind, Warren Defever’s collection of childhood recordings is wispy, mercurial, and improbably good.

Help Us Stranger,The Raconteurs,by: Peyton Thomas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cdd979cfa43fd2f23067e64/1:1/w_160/TheRaconteurs_HelpUsStranger.jpg,2019-06-26 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-raconteurs-help-us-stranger/,Third Man,"The gloss of celebrity served the Raconteurs well in the late aughts—“the White Stripes are dying, long live Jack White’s new radio-rock band!” But 11 years after the band’s last album, the novelty has faded and the Michiganers—Brendan Benson, Jack Lawrence, and Patrick Keeler alongside White himself—have found themselves floating in a weightless, haughty bliss, through a perpetual 2008. Help Us Stranger must now contend with the strength of a new indie rock field, and the mere fact of White’s affiliation is not nearly as compelling as it once was. The Raconteurs make the strongest case for themselves through competent, workmanlike song construction. They’ve built a rock record that is sequenced perfectly; sturdy, but never staid. Raucous numbers like “Sunday Driver” recall the band’s biggest hit, 2006’s “Steady, As She Goes,” and they’re nestled alongside softer, more contemplative pieces, like the lovely, acoustic “Only Child.” The players swing skillfully from loud to quiet to loud, never neglecting either side of the scale. There are few surprises on Help Us Stranger, but that tends to be the case when you’re in the hands of capable adults. Some light improvisation in the recording booth lends spontaneity without veering into the self-indulgence that so plagued White’s latest solo album, 2018’s Boarding House Reach. Off-the-cuff flourishes abound. Nigh-title track “Help Me Stranger” opens with a brief, bluesy rendition in miniature by the band’s bassist, Jack Lawrence, equalized to sound like Jimmie Rodgers on an old 78. “Now That You’re Gone,” too, is a welcome change: In its verses, the narrator lashes out, petty and vindictive, at a former lover—“Where you gonna go? Not that I care!”—only to slip in the chorus and lay bare his own lonely stupor: “What will I do now that you’re gone?” Without sacrificing sonic or thematic coherence, the Raconteurs vary their approach enough that each individual track sparkles. But even the album’s brightest moments are colored by a kind of dull, grey disdain. Attempts to conjure bluesy commiseration and evoke alienation are uniformly bloodless. “Don’t Bother Me” is a poor choice for a rock refrain; the song’s rage is so impotent it may as well have been titled “Get Off My Lawn.” Other songs are undercut by static simplicity: “Some days, I just feel like crying/Some days, I don’t feel like trying.” Clunky as these lyrics are on the page, they’re diminished even further by the sheer lack of conviction in White and Benson’s vocal delivery. Their tone throughout is one of boredom, even irritation—with themselves, with anyone who might be listening, with the mundanities of making music. The songs of Help Us Stranger often succeed only because they succeeded before, decades ago, as better songs. Tapping your foot to the giddy “Live A Lie” is fun until you recognize, in a too-familiar riff, a limp effort to conjure the anarchic, animal spirit of “Fell in Love With a Girl.” The piano lines and orotund group harmonies of “Shine the Light on Me” land like painted-by-numbers Sgt. Pepper’s, less tribute than hacky pageantry. The Raconteurs have never been coy about pastiche, but on this record, their motivation for mining the past feels firmly rooted in fear of the unfamiliar. White’s rapping on Boarding House Reach offered, at least, the perverse thrill of real transgression. Here, he never takes any risk so great that failure presents a real possibility. The band’s few efforts to innovate on their own catalogue are peccadilloes in the grand scheme: a new amp here, a new pedal setting there. The result is an air of timidity that dampens the pleasures this album does offer. Other indie rock groups—supergroups, like boygenius even—are presently making music that is orders of magnitude greater than this record, often with vastly less experience, vastly fewer resources, and vastly higher barriers to entry. Recall the indelible moment in “Me & My Dog,” where Phoebe Bridgers’ voice becomes a scooped-out husk of itself, and she murmurs, ashamed, “I cried at your show with the teenagers.” Even in her own song, she is at somebody else’s show, her story dissolving into a crowd of other stories. The Raconteurs, by contrast, would never lower themselves to the level of their audience. They understand their presence on the stage as a given, not something to be earned anew. They have always stood in the spotlight. They assume that they always will.

Text While Driving If You Want to Meet God,Vegyn,by: Noah Yoo,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d02ad17b25f862d9d4f7647/1:1/w_160/TextWhileDriving_Vegyn.png,2019-06-26 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/vegyn-text-while-driving-if-you-want-to-meet-god/,PLZ Make It Ruins,"Never one to pass up an opportunity to self-aggrandize, Kanye West famously immortalized his work ethic on his debut album. “You can't fathom my love, dude,” he declared. “Lock yourself in a room doing five beats a day for three summers… I deserve to do these numbers.” It’s an axiom that’s motivated countless would-be artists in the decade and a half since: You want to be as good as Kanye? Put your nose to the grindstone and eventually you’ll get there. Even if the stuff you make is middling, nobody will hear it but you. Unless you want them to. Text While Driving If You Want to Meet God!, a 71-track collection of bits and beats from Frank Ocean collaborator Vegyn, lays his hard drive bare. It’s a showcase of interesting drafts; an honest recording of the London multi-hyphenate’s musical trials since the relatively concise (but similarly cheeky) All Bad Things Have Ended—Your Lunch Included in 2014. Only a handful of songs reach the two-minute mark, and their nonsensical, diaristic titles suggest a busy artist tapping in the first phrase that comes to mind. Throughout the largely instrumental Text, the artist born Joe Thornalley toys with ambient, hip-hop, and dramatically sound-stretched electronica. Vegyn also explores emotive ’80s synths and electric pianos, an affinity he shares with countless other producers looking to tap into that classic Vangelis magic. He writes crystalline arpeggios, invoking Nobuo Uematsu and other great video game composers, while his drums, if they’re present at all, rarely impose. The lack of structure makes Text even more of a mood record, something to put on in the background of a low-key gathering that won’t distract from conversation. There are moments of brilliance, like the woozy twinkles on “Try and Do a Cd After That (132 Bpm),” the electric piano melancholia of “Sadly Does It (123 Bpm),” or the interplay of guitar and drums on “Save Yall Ready Know What It Is 003 (138 Bpm),” which evokes one of Vegyn’s best Endless contributions, “Slide on Me.” While the music is hardly uninspired, the abundance of micro-exercises highlights just how prosaic even the most beautiful chords can be when, given no purpose within the context of a song, they’re teased out and left to dry. There isn’t much polish to be found here, either. Mastering levels can vary dramatically from track to track, forcing the listener to continuously reach for the volume, and the alphabetical sorting—an inherent result of the album’s framing as a track dump—makes sequencing moot. That’s sort of the point. This is raw Vegyn: an artist pulling back the curtain to reveal the scattered pieces of recorded music littering his cutting-room floor. Like the recent Radiohead OK Computer leaks, Text reveals genre-spanning influences and methodologies. Vegyn is clearly a gifted producer and an inventive arranger. What remains to be seen is whether he can focus those promising creative energies to deliver songs that are less fleeting.","The Frank Ocean collaborator lays his hard drive bare, pulling back the curtain to reveal the scattered pieces of recorded music littering his cutting-room floor.

M3,iLoveMakonnen,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf0133185a35d006be64d00/1:1/w_160/ILoveMakonnen_M3.jpg,2019-06-26 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ilovemakonnen-m3/,Warner Bros.,"For a glorious moment in 2014, every other week seemed to bring a new viral hip-hop hit. It began with Bobby Shmurda, ended with Denzel Curry’s “Ultimate,” and O.T. Genasis and OG Maco happened somewhere in between. The songs themselves didn’t matter as much as the fact that everyone knew them, and everyone knew them because of the beloved six-second video app Vine (RIP). Time hasn’t been kind to “Watch Me” or “Hit the Quan,” but if a one-hit wonder is remembered from this strange blip in time, let it be “Tuesday,” iLoveMakonnen’s anthem for service workers, freelance writers, and anybody else who hustles outside the confines of the normal 9-5. As hits go, it was unlikely, woozy and full of empty spaces, but it made perfect sense at 3 a.m. on a weeknight, when you and your friends were the last ones left in the club. Makonnen was often associated with the “New Atlanta” of the mid-’00s, a wave of innovation that included everyone from Migos and Young Thug to EarthGang. Most of these artists had nothing in common with each other save for their city, but they became ambassadors for their hometown's cultural riches to the rest of the world. Atlanta is currently the fourth fastest-growing city in the country, with 600,000 new residents in the last decade, but Makonnen hasn’t quite benefited from his city’s gold rush; once the club goes up, it must come down. M3 is something of a reintroduction for Makonnen, who has not released a full-length project on a major label since 2016’s Drink More Water 6. There’s a reason for that, one that goes beyond the normal label troubles that tend to plague rappers who seemingly emerge from nowhere. After he came out as gay on Twitter in early 2017, many of Makonnen’s previous collaborators went quiet; some, like Migos, were a little too vocal. In the lead-up to M3, Makonnen has said he feels unsupported by the hip-hop community at large due to his sexuality, even calling out Gucci Mane, the new EP’s lone guest, for not sufficiently promoting the record. At best, the industry hasn’t known what to do with Makonnen; at worst, it has actively hindered his career. It’s telling that fellow ATLien Young Thug has been celebrated for queering his wardrobe, while Makonnen has been shut out for actually being queer. But Makonnen hasn’t been entirely absent. In the past year, he’s released two tracks with Lil Peep, “Sunlight on Your Skin” and “I’ve Been Waiting,” the latter of which features Fall Out Boy and is Makonnen’s first charting single since “Tuesday.” “I’ve Been Waiting” is perhaps the most conventional pop song of Makonnen’s career—I heard it playing a few weeks ago in a Best Buy while I considered buying AirPods—but it’s not representative of M3. “Liquid Supply Daily,” a chilled-out, guitar-driven love song, is the only other glimpse we get of this family-friendly version of Makonnen. Elsewhere on the EP, he reverts to his more rap-intensive side, which was never his strongest. The only appearance from former comrade Drake is in the form of Tay Keith’s producer tag, which hangs uneasily over the EP’s worst track, “Money Fiend.” The song’s primary subject—flipping, selling, stacking, repeat—is one that Makonnen has put a distinctive twist on in the past. He even manages it elsewhere on this EP, like on “Shoot Shoot,” when he calls his AK-47 “cute” and compares it to a puppy sitting on his lap. But on “Money Fiend,” it feels tired and trite. Maybe it’s just Lil Peep’s influence rubbing off, but the best lines on M3 are about emotional anguish and getting fucked up to forget, like the mournfully turnt “Drunk on Saturday.” He is still a vital and strange voice, if only someone would make more room for it. Makonnen helped reignite his city’s creative identity like few others and showed outsider artists a path to the mainstream. As repayment, he’s been left behind in the dust of condos and co-working spaces, exploited by the industry around him, and rejected by a genre that has much more work to do when it comes to sexuality and masculinity. M3 is somewhere between Straw-Ber-Rita dreams and champagne reality, but there’s a taste of the pop star Makonnen could be if the culture would only catch up to him.","The rap zeitgeist has mostly left iLoveMakonnen behind, but his first major-label release in years shows a taste of the pop star he could still become.

Dusk to Dawn,Mr. Tophat,by: Anna Gaca,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf58c572a3b7baf51fcc690/1:1/w_160/MrTophat_DuskToDawn.jpg,2019-06-26 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mr-tophat-dusk-to-dawn/,Twilight EnterpriseJunk Yard,"Hardcore Robyn fans already know the work of Swedish producer Rudolf Nordström, aka Mr. Tophat. He co-produced “Baby Forgive Me” and “Beach2k20,” two of the gorgeous, gently filtered house-pop tracks from last year’s Honey; his own 2017 release Trust Me, a three-song, 35-minute EP of throbbing, desaturated grooves, featured Robyn throughout. His latest solo release, Dusk to Dawn, is an ambitious three-album suite of understated, occasionally disquieting techno nocturnes. More melodic than the distortion-warped A Memoir From the Youth, two and a half hours of mostly chill, mid-tempo house conceal interesting moments within slack expanses. At its best, it’s a triple-album endurance listen that rewards partial concentration; at its slowest, it’s an illustration that Tophat’s signature long-format tracks don’t scale. As in his work with Robyn, Tophat’s specialty is sleek, extended compositions that hide their seams, even as they meander and pool into ambience. Part I opens with the 14-minute “Intro,” a low, slow-building track bookended by medieval-sounding whistles; the beat doesn’t come to stay until two songs later. Vocals surface here and there, as if wandering from room to room at an enormous nightclub. The cheekily titled “Hedonism M.C. Robyn” features little more than some backing vocals, though she’s still unmistakable. There’s a good deal of variety for anyone motivated to find it: a section within “Hedonism” that sounds like ’90s video game soundtrack; acid-house tweaks on “Acid Samba” and “Memento Mori”; the flamenco-style guitars that surface in “Dusk to Dawn (Acoustic Edit Version)” and much later on “Solitude.” “Vivid Imaginations” and “Tears of Illuminations” are highlights of Part I, working twitchy Balearic beats towards Italo-disco. Part II, the most compelling and active section, begins with a run of features from Swedish pop singers Noomi and Lune, as well as producers Axel Boman and Kleerup. Frothy synth and sub bass on the final version of the title track make the kinship with “Beach2k20” clear. But the spacey minimalism of “Pleiades” recedes to the background. Mainstream dance music is beset by expressionless, interchangeable vocal performances; once you’re familiar with how skillfully Tophat handles the real thing, it’s harder to settle for synthetic flute and chime. Dusk to Dawn has moments of real drama and surprise, as when a klaxon-like siren cuts sharply through interstellar glitter on Part III’s “Thoth,” or when the AI voice of “Solitude” poses the alarming question, “Why even wear a heart/When you could store it in a chest freezer?” But seemingly every interesting transformation is counterbalanced by slow changes, like the glacial “Indecision.” The final effect can be tastefully listenable, like a boutique hotel soundtrack; a hipper chain could probably play the whole thing in the lobby. It’s not so important to remember everything about a long night, but too many of these tracks vanish without a trace.","The Swedish producer and frequent Robyn collaborator offers an ambitious three-album suite of understated, occasionally disquieting techno nocturnes.

​Schlagenheim,black midi,by: Jeremy D. Larson,Reviews Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cded447fa43fd6c1e067eb2/1:1/w_160/blackmidi_%E2%80%8BSchlagenheim.jpg,2019-06-25 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/black-midi-schlagenheim/,Rough Trade,"In January, KEXP uploaded a 26-minute video of four British kids positioned in a homey Icelandic hostel, stepping loosely and methodically through a handful of songs that now appear on black midi’s debut album, Schlagenheim. Two things are immediately apparent while watching: Everyone in black midi looks approximately 8 years old and their drummer is an absolute legend. The performance is hypnotic, hair-raising, maybe a little irritating, and definitely out of time—a bunch of schoolboys producing something so staunchly learned, freeform, and anti-pop in an age when pop reigns supreme. Before black midi had even announced their album, the video was passed around like samizdat by people who watch drum tutorials online; older dudes who long for the days when prog bands like King Crimson and Emerson, Lake & Palmer ruled British rock; weirder sects who love the chaotic grooves of no wave bands like DNA or Mars; younger fans who glommed onto the post-punk sound of Preoccupations or Girl Band; guys who own Butthole Surfers records and sometimes play a Fantômas song when no one’s looking. The 323,000 views for this video comprise an underclass of music nerds who worship all things mathy, noisy, wiry, and aberrant. By the end, when we see guitarist Matt Kwasniewski-Kelvin put his cell phone up to his guitar pickups and play a recording of a woman ranting ad nauseam, black midi have shown themselves a band so full of glorious potential (and pretension), the only thing people were left wondering was: What do they sound like in an actual studio? If the KEXP performance was the grabby cold open, six months later, Schlagenheim is the first act of a band that teeters on brilliance—a restless, nerve-wracking high wire act that could easily fall off at any moment. Schlagenheim offers prime counter-programming for our current rich, harmonic, verse-chorus-verse era of indie music. With a froggy-voiced singer and an armful of guitar pedals, black midi sprint in the opposite direction. They are a band for whom references become the main talking point—a chilling thought for anyone who prefers not to think about music through the lens of dudes prattling on about other dudes in older bands. All the indie rock tropes of old are summoned: exclusion, referentiality, insularity, recalling a time in the ’80s and ’90s when the underground just covered each other all the time. Forget about trying to reach out with a poppy lead single, black midi don’t seem to be trying to reach anyone at all. It’s ego and oddity reclassified as a human stand against the computable nature of pop in the streaming age—prog as proof of life. Or maybe they’re just young and operating without any stakes. Whatever the case, it’s black midi’s ability to write songs that screw in deep and rewire the synapses that make Schlagenheim come alive and burst apart. They play passionately and unselfconsciously, drawing upon their youth, imagination, and what sounds like hours upon hours in a practice room. Above all, black midi swings. They are an interlocking unit, yet have a recklessness of someone who likes to close their eyes and take their hands off the wheel. This is best captured by the opener, “953,” where you are introduced to drummer Morgan Simpson’s tender and indestructible relationship to the downbeat. You are also introduced to singer Geordie Greep’s divisive, dynamic voice: Imagine someone with the name “Geordie Greep” and that’s essentially who he sounds like (or, Mark E. Smith if he were a Bond villain). Together, with bassist Cameron Picton and guitarist Kwasniewski-Kelvin, black midi shrink and grow, speed up, slow down, get loud, get quiet, find a groove, destroy the groove, find a better groove, and then move on. This music is dense and well-composed, propelled by the adolescent impulses of a band eager to never be bored again. Part of Schlagenheim’s wonder comes from just how unformed it is. At their best, black midi sound like the first days of Earth: atonal, unstable, a land mass roaring to life before the laws of harmony or rhythm are in place. The thrill of listening to a short burst of gibberish-core on a song like “Years Ago” makes you wonder if they know literally everything or literally nothing about how songs work. On “Western,” they trot through different sections of an eight-minute suite, as Greep channels his inner Lewis Carrol (“a pink caterpillar with six anorexic children”) along his journey to the fictional town of Schlagenheim. At all times, their fellowship of chaos is moored to Simpson’s drumming—shadowy, melodic, crucial to the success of every moment on the album. It is Simpson who elevates these songs from heady improv experiments to a new, exciting language of music. Though Greep’s subject matter and eccentric delivery are a little too affected, there are a few lyrics that pop out amid all the abstract brain doodles. Picton sings a more straightforward lead on “Near DT, MI,” which alludes to the ongoing Flint water crisis in Michigan: When his voice tears apart the words “dead in the water,” it’s the closest black midi come to evoking righteous anger, or any real ideology or emotion you could put a name to. More to their squirrelly nature is “bmbmbm,” a song made up of one note and one circular thought. Greep sings, “She moves with a purpose/What a magnificent purpose/And they find different ways to suck themselves off, but she does not care at all…” with increasing intensity as if trying to win an argument with a mirror. It feels like “bmbmbm” is the band’s anthem, not simply because it’s self-involved or because it’s the best song on Schlagenheim or because they’ve been closing their much-lauded live shows with it, but because it’s a blank slate onto which black midi project their truest selves. Greep plays with the lyrics like a cat toying with a dead mouse, really enunciating “suck” as if he’s realizing all the contours of his lips and teeth and throat in real time. The band keeps a no-wave stomp going, with Simpson interrupting occasionally with precision fills that frustrate the rhythm but never lets it fall out of time. It is primordial and juvenile, dumb and clever, arch and true, and captures a band at that rare time before any self-conscious tones creep into their music. All the while, black midi discover what has been pioneered by countless bands before, and still present it as something entirely new.

Gold & Grey,Baroness,by: Kim Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cfa8cafb25f86d25a4f71a4/1:1/w_160/GoldAndGrey_Baroness.jpg,2019-06-25 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/baroness-gold-and-grey/,Abraxan Hymns,"It is intimidating thing to sit down with a new Baroness record and try to understand its contours. There’s just so much to take into account. This Savannah DIY metal band turned scattered progressive rock collective are an entirely different beast than they were back when Red came out in 2007 and every bike messenger in West Philly was rocking their shirts; or when Blue dropped in 2009 and hipsters caught wind of their promise; or when 2012’s Yellow & Green elevated them to a new tier of progressive acclaim; or when 2015’s Grammy-nominated Purple presented a band who had quite literally been through hell, and returned bearing iridescent riffs. With their fifth album, Gold & Grey, the shape-shifting outfit hands us the latest frayed chapter in their evolution, its words and notes illuminated like a medieval manuscript. Demons still hide in the margins, but divinity radiates. Baroness have lived many musical lives since the band first formed in 2003, and cheated death in 2012, when a terrible bus crash derailed their ascent and led to the departure of two members, drummer Allen Blickle and bassist Matt Maggioni. Seven years on from that traumatic accident, they’ve experienced a great deal of healing and growth—both planned and unexpected. This process was first explored on Purple, a barely-closed wound of an album that concealed a certain rawness of spirit, and now, on Gold & Grey, it’s mellowed into acceptance, the scars still prominent, but smoothed with time. The addition of new guitarist and backing vocalist Gina Gleason completes a lineup that includes bassist Nick Jost, drummer Sebastian Thomson, and vocalist and guitarist John Baizley (an accomplished artist who’s equally deft with a paintbrush as a sheet of composition paper). It can’t be easy to be the new kid in a band with so much history behind it, but Gleason is a natural fit. She makes her presence felt from the onset in the album’s ambitious guitar work; her vocals on tracks like the strange, dreamy album closer “Pale Sun” add both lightness and depth, and harmonize beautifully with Baizley's earnest croon. Gold & Grey is not quite a double album, though it sure flirts with the idea. Seventeen tracks span just over an hour, with a startling amount of variance between them. Synthesizers play an important role, but so does old-fashioned improvisation; here, Baroness convince their disparate influences to gel beautifully without lapsing into the homogeneity (or self-indulgent drudgery) that remains a common defect of long, proggy albums. The second half is noticeably quieter and spookier than the more bombastic first half, easing down gently into more melodic and even acoustic fare. Post-rock, space rock, prog rock, psychedelic rock, grungy Alice in Chains-eyeing hard rock—it’s all here, and since it’s Baroness, it works. The album narrowly avoided being dubbed Orange; as a color, orange signifies oversaturation, an upbeat brightness verging on mania. The final title is far more fitting, as Gold & Grey is none of those things; its palette is muted, a muddle of earth and sky tones. Its lighter moments are sunny but not blinding; its tempo generally treads a middle road, even on more sprightly tracks like “Throw Me an Anchor,” with its splash of noisy synth, or in the barely restrained acid freakout of “Can Oscura.” Baroness have never been afraid of a big rock riff, and they’ve made room for radio-ready songs like opening track “Front Towards Enemy” and “Broken Halo” (underpinned by an immensely satisfying classic heavy metal stomp) on an album littered with stranger offerings. More outré songs like the gorgeous, raw-boned acoustic ballad “I’d Do Anything,” the ghostly electronic wash of “Blankets of Ash,” and the dewy minimalism of “Assault on East Falls” add texture and balance, ensuring that, while Baroness have certainly matured, they’re still plenty weird. Spitfire percussion on “Seasons” hints to the band’s more metallic past; one riff sounds like a spiritual cousin to “March of the Fire Ants,” by fellow Georgia metal turned prog luminaries Mastodon. “Pale Sun,” with its space rock phasers and epic vocal harmonies, feels like both a primal scream and a sign of what’s to come. All this is a far cry from the Baroness of a decade ago, churning out sludgy doom salvos in sweaty basements. If you’d cryogenically frozen a fan from back then and handed them a copy of Gold & Grey upon defrost, they’d be more than a little confused. Fortunately, Baroness trust us to grow along with them.

Dreems,Cassius,by: Noah Yoo,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d0cfb95c0b1604e7c47de66/1:1/w_160/dreems_cassius.jpg,2019-06-25 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cassius-dreems/,Love SupremeJustice,"In 1996, Philippe Zdar didn’t know what to do. Motorbass, his ascendant project with his friend and roommate Étienne de Crécy, had dissolved after Crécy packed his things and moved out of their apartment in the Montmartre district of Paris. That same year, they’d released their sole album, Pansoul, regarded today as one of the defining moments of the French house revolution. His downtime didn’t last long. Within months, Zdar linked back up with his old La Funk Mob partner Boom Bass, aka Hubert Blanc-Francard. Having bonded earlier in the decade through their shared love of hip-hop, Zdar and Boom Bass rebranded as Cassius and released their first album, 1999. Motorbass paved the way, but ultimately it was Cassius who went the distance, bringing “French touch” to the masses alongside peers like Daft Punk. Twenty years (and one decade-long hiatus) after their debut, a new Cassius record has arrived with a heartbreaking asterisk: It will also be the duo’s final album of Zdar’s lifetime. Two days before it was to be released, the news broke that he had accidentally fallen through a window in Paris and died. He was 52 years old. Thus Dreems is a bittersweet homecoming. With their sights locked back onto the dancefloor, Cassius sound reinvigorated. Arranging the record like a cinematic DJ mix, Zdar and Blanc-Francard pare back the kitchen-sink maximalism of their Balearic-tinged concept album Ibifornia. Instead, they adopt a more back-to-basics approach: kick, snare, hat, and bassline take priority. “Summer” is a wistful opener, cut from the same emotional cloth as the Zdar-produced Phoenix masterpiece “Love Like a Sunset Pt. 1.” The downtempo cruiser “Vedra,” tailor-made for the late-night coastal drive, evaporates into a crispy vocal sample that sets the stage for the album’s first real banger, “Fame.” Throughout Dreems, Cassius make strides to remind us that they could always keep pace with the new breed of producers, many of whom were reared on their work. “Calliope” is a bass-heavy belter that wouldn’t sound out of place during any peak-hour club set. Elsewhere, returning collaborator John Gourley (of Portugal. The Man) crops up on the ’80s pastiche “Nothing About You,” his otherwise bothersome timbre softened with immaculate double-tracking, while Beastie Boys’ Mike D lends manic energy to “Cause oui!” Cassius balance their guests with poise, manipulating their voices to feel as if they’ve been sampled off some long-forgotten record and rarely allowing the vocals to dominate the mix. The notable exception is the title track, with its hypnotic dembow rhythm and heartfelt refrain. French singer Owlle is the most prominent guest vocalist on the album, with three separate features, and Cassius give her room for an impeccable performance. “Never before I had someone like you right by my side,” Owlle sighs on the chorus. She and Luke Jenner of the Rapture pair together in an unlikely complement on the hook, singing, “You make me want to dream,” their distinct voices made one within the blend. The lyric feels like a fitting tribute to Zdar, a man who connected so many threads of dance, indie, and hip-hop to help realize masterpieces that changed countless lives. The day before the album’s release, that much was clear when the producer’s compatriots and admirers around the world openly mourned his death. Those who were close to him shared stories of not only his incredible studio wisdom, but also the love he held for his family and the empathy that he brought to his collaborators, all of whom could earnestly call him a friend. It is an immense tragedy that Zdar didn’t get to witness the release of this album with Boom Bass; the two had been steadfast creative partners ever since they were young studio rats trying to scrape together enough experience to make the music they heard in their heads. Cassius may come to a close, but in Dreems, they offer a worthy capstone for a well-lived life: a celebration of love, an uncynical outburst of the kind of joy that feels rarer to come by with each passing day.","Released just days after Philippe Zdar’s accidental death, the duo’s fifth album marks a joyous return to the emotive, immaculately produced house music of their early years.

Ride Me Back Home,Willie Nelson,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf833ed7fd40dd4c7dba9ed/1:1/w_160/WillieNelson_RideMeBackHome.jpg,2019-06-25 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/willie-nelson-ride-me-back-home/,Legacy,"Perhaps the only thing more impressive than the fact that Willie Nelson is still at it—it being writing, recording, touring, and toking—is the fact that he’s still good at it. These 86 years seem to have sharpened his focus and his sense of humor, so there’s not that feeling he’s going through the motions when he plays “On the Road Again” for the millionth time. Nearly six decades after he wrote “Crazy,” he has largely avoided the pitfalls that have snared so many older country and rock artists, instead emerging as a grandfatherly influence for yet another generation of country misfits like Sturgill Simpson and Margo Price (both of whom played Willie’s Outlaw Music Festival last year). To be active, relevant, and beloved as an octogenarian in the business—that’s the dream of any artist. In recent years, Willie has even managed to enter something of a renaissance phase of his career, with a string of albums that include his first new songwriting credits in decades. Apart from his largely overlooked collection of Sinatra covers (which I’ll argue surpasses Dylan’s handful in terms of interpretation, insight, and just plain ol’ enjoyment), he has made his own thoughts on mortality, technology, and creativity the focal points of his recent work. Old age is his new favorite subject, or the subject he knows most intimately, or maybe just the subject that lends itself to the best punchlines. He sings with a kind of chagrinned humor, as if nobody is more surprised by his longevity than he is. That’s a welcome trend that continues on Ride Me Back Home, which features three newly penned tunes. That doesn’t seem like very many, but they frame this album with warmth, empathy, and humor. “Come On Time” finds him challenging the very notion of time to a fight, as though he might spar his way to another couple years on earth. “I say come on, Time/I’ve beat you before,” he sings over a chugging rhythm section. “Come on, Time, what have you got for me this time?” His desperation barely veiled by his humor, he knows he’s bested before the fight even begins, and all he can do is try to make something out of it: “I’ll take your words of wisdom and I’ll try to make them rhyme.” Buying the farm, at least for Willie, is inextricably linked with making music. “One More Song to Write” sounds so breezy that its insights might initially sound modest, but this gracefully melodic tune might hold the key to his long career. “I’ve got one more song to write, I’ve got one more bridge to burn,” he sings. “I’ll know when it’s right, I’ve got one more song to write.” For all his prolificity—is there even an authoritative album count anymore?—he’s always chasing that next tune, that next rhyme, that next show. He’s always thinking about the future. It doesn’t really matter to Willie who came up with that next tune or that next rhyme. At his best, he can rewrite a song just by singing it, and he can suss out new depths just by adapting it to his own jazzy meter. The slight delay in his delivery on Guy Clark’s “Immigrant Eyes” subtly reinforces the song’s dusty two-step rhythm as well as its very timely sentiments about family, immigration, and empathy. Likewise, he capers over the lyrics of Mac Davis’s “It’s Hard to Be Humble,” having a blast singing the word “egotistical” and chuckling with his sons Lukas and Micah over the notion of him wearing “skintight blue jeans.” Ride Me Back Home is Willie’s thirteenth album with producer/co-writer Buddy Cannon, the Pancho to his Lefty, and it casually evokes the old Texas dancehalls where Willie cut his teeth long before he embodied the outlaw country ethos. There’s a roominess to the music, a jovial looseness in its rhythmic complexity, and something like celebration in its exploration of these grave subjects. Nothing on here sounds rehearsed or calculated. Instead, it sounds like Willie has been living with these songs for so long that he can play them as easily as inhaling and exhaling.

Their longevity is a testament both to Alex Frankel and Nicholas Millhiser’s dogged ambition and the everlasting fertility of the style they’ve adopted. Their third album, Work, opens in a familiar mood: a tasteful cocaine-Koyaanisqatsi bed of sequencers, a sturdy piano riff, and a guitar gurgling like champagne bubbles, all gently rising in a 30-second intro just long enough to let you powder your nose and hit the floor. But on Work, it sounds like the champagne’s corked. “There’s nowhere really left to go,” Alex Frankel sings on “Epton on Broadway Part I.” The track chugs along. “There’s nothing really left to say/…but if you want, if you want we’ll stay.” Later, the brief “Epton on Broadway Part II” vamps in a filter-disco style for two minutes, then runs out of gas. Throughout the album, the New York City duo adopts a defensive slouch. The record is expertly mixed and produced: It brims with fully realized moments, like a synth bit on “Anxious” that conjures the exact feeling of seeing an ex like someone else’s post on Instagram; the portamentos on “Slow Burn” should come with a vertigo warning. But the album’s mood is just sour. “You can say we’re stupid, stupid, stupid/But we’re not about to let go,” goes the chorus of “Do This,” which then offers a bit of Imagine Dragons-y festival chanting as if to demonstrate why someone would say such a thing. “Heaven Knows What” is basically “I Keep Forgettin'” plus Frippertronics and icky lyrics like, “I think that I’m moving on/Say I’m kept, look at the company you keep.” The amiably elegant swing of “Nicky Buckingham” offers strings and crisp drums, a la Metro Area, but the macho posturing (“Trash talk/The neighborhood got too busy, didn’t it/Too soft”) is a poor fit. Authenticity is a bore, and clearly not something Holy Ghost! give a fuck about. This is the band, after all, that pulled off a scene-for-scene remake of New Order’s “Confusion” video. But also a bore is unpersuasive rabble-rousing like “Heaven Forbid,” in which Frankel intones “Get up/You can follow my lead/Sit down/You can take a seat” while the hook from Daft Punk’s “Veridis Quo” floats by. In “Soon,” a flaccid take on the guitar hook from “I Was Made for Lovin' You” joins an unswaggering iteration of “Everybody Wants to Rule the World,” and Frankel sounds really in his feelings about it: Can’t believe what I said
Good as new
Good as dead
Silent auction in the back of the room
Don’t happen too often and it just couldn’t happen too soon
We’re making this harder than it used to be
It’s true
Don’t get us started, don’t start with me Two icons of 20th-century American culture adorn Work’s cover. The first is a piece by the crucial conceptual artist Agnes Denes, documenting what she reaped in convincing the Public Arts Fund to let her grow two acres of wheat in the landfill that once lay between the World Trade Center and the Statue of Liberty. The second is the logo of West End Records, Mel Cheren’s disco label that, while Denes was plowing and sowing, was hard at work releasing holy queer scripture like Loose Joints’ “Is It All Over My Face?” and other tracks that expanded the possibilities of dance music, like the filter-dub fantasia of Betty LaVette’s “Doin’ the Best That I Can.” It takes nerve and good taste to conscript those auras. It takes some kind of chutzpah to leave the closest thing the 2000s had to a West End, DFA, in order to convince West End itself to relaunch. And it is a goddamn public service to convince the very inventor of the remix, Tom Moulton, to work his magic on one of your tracks, “Anxious,” then put it out on a 12"" benefiting GMHC and LIFEbeat in honor of Cheren, who died of AIDS in 2007.

The End of Radio,Shellac,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d0411cabb36142c3935065b/1:1/w_160/TheEndofRadio_Shellac.jpg,2019-06-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/shellac-the-end-of-radio/,Touch and Go,"Steve Albini’s convictions about music production and distribution paint him as nearly a mythic figure in the already esoteric world of analog audio engineering. But underneath his impenetrable, iconoclastic facade, Albini practices a sort of radical humility, charging market rate for his engineering services and constantly taking chances on obscure, burgeoning groups in his Electrical Audio studios. This approach to the industry likely came from the rapacious work ethic of the late John Peel: “He listened religiously to every single record he received in the mail, devoting hours of every day to the task,” Albini once noted of the British DJ. Coming from the man whose screeds against popular music make it onto massive billboards, the comment practically reads like hero worship. And the admiration was apparently mutual—when Peel was asked to list his top 20 albums of all time, he placed Albini’s first band Big Black’s Songs About Fucking at 15. And there is a palpable level of trust in these recordings, collected and newly reissued on a double LP. With only an unofficial EP to their name at the time, Albini’s new band Shellac kicked off their 1994 session at the BBC’s Maida Vale studios with “Spoke,” a track that wouldn’t appear fully formed for another 13 years. After Albini’s screeching directive—”Radio 1, play the drums!”—drummer Todd Trainer plays a straight-ahead rock groove and bassist Bob Weston opens with a thick, chugging bassline. Then, as if to poke fun at the inscrutability of his absurdist, often violent lyricism, Albini and Weston exchange some indecipherable gibberish, sounding like an unhinged political debate. Within 15 seconds, the entire dynamic of Shellac is fully formed in real time, months before they’d put out their debut LP. Playing live is a quintessential element of Shellac’s legacy; bootlegged copies of live performances circulate among fans, desperate to hear unreleased material or even riffs on studio versions of tracks (the Peel sessions themselves have been circulating in a lower quality since their broadcasts). Albini has said that the band improvises “40 percent” of their material in any given performance. “Canada,” recorded in the 1994 session and again in 2004, manifests these changes as a kind of loosening of their proverbial neckties. There‘s a hypnotic melodicism in Albini’s singing, but where the 1994 version is all business, wound tightly around the rhythmic crunch of Weston’s low bass, the 2004 version features the band singing the theme song from the Canadian SCTV sketch “Great White North,” as they’ve done live, and a markedly slower pacing to the tinny riffs that lurch the song forward. The 2004 session at Maida Vale favors songs from 2007’s Excellent Italian Greyhound; there are hints at that record’s more extemporaneous approach here—the strumming intros to “Paco” and “Billiard Player Song” sound like the band tuning its guitars; closer “Il Porno Star,” from 1994’s At Action Park, finds Trainer and Weston darting between time signatures while Albini rambles semi-audibly about the titular adult film actor. The second session, recorded with a live studio audience shortly after Peel’s untimely death, feels like a funeral procession cut with an air of irony. “The End of Radio” features Albini narrating from the perspective of the last DJ on earth. Years before its studio release, it carries an eerie “War of the Worlds” realism; one can imagine an innocent listener hearing “This is the BBC World Service. Is this thing on? Can you hear me now?” and thinking their dial had been hijacked by a particularly irate hacker. As far as Shellac songs go, “The End of Radio” is a postmodern masterwork, balancing Albini’s nihilism with an evergreen critique of the centrality of mass media. In a music industry filled with nameless and countless boogiemen, its genius lies in its constant relevancy. To Albini and plenty of other fans at the time, a post-Peel radio landscape clearly felt like the end of something. “The BBC is a miracle, but John Peel was one of the things that kept it human,” Albini later said. On that day, the man who saw potential in Albini’s earliest works was dead, and Shellac had a message for listeners at home: “John Peel was a hell of a man. This session tonight, it’s the end of radio!” (Pitchfork may earn a commission from purchases made through affiliate links on our site.)","Culled from the band’s sessions at Maida Vale Studios in 1994 and 2004, this double-LP that captures, in great fidelity, the acerbic personality and power of Steve Albini’s trio.

Fog FM,Anthony Naples,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf8313113c07d6a7715deac/1:1/w_160/FogFM_AnthonyNaples.jpg,2019-06-24 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/anthony-naples-fog-fm/,Incienso,"American house and techno are in a remarkably good place right now. The underground is thriving, bolstered by a network of labels, club nights, warehouse parties, and off-the-beaten-path festivals, all with a staunchly independent spirit that’s a world away from the high-flying, big-ticket milieu of commercial dance music. It’s an especially welcome development given that house and techno’s well-defined parameters, combined with a retro-fetishizing reverence for the past, have sometimes left the music feeling cautious and conservative. But a new generation of artists is finding ways to tweak familiar templates, carving a zig-zag path between respect for their predecessors and a determination to do things their own way. Within this cohort, Anthony Naples is becoming something like an elder statesman (in relative terms, anyway). The New York electronic musician broke through in 2012, at just 21 years old, on the strength of “Mad Disrespect,” his debut single—in fact, the very first production he ever completed. The resulting flurry of interest yielded a remix for Four Tet and EPs on European labels like The Trilogy Tapes and Rubadub before culminating in a debut LP, in 2015, for Four Tet’s Text imprint. Over the years, Naples has continued to build out his rough-around-the-edges approach, balancing unvarnished sonics with canny dancefloor instincts. Resident Advisor’s Jordan Rothlein called Naples’ debut “not revolutionary so much as perfectly suited for its context,” which could also describe his approach in general. He’s primarily a craftsman, rather than a shredder of rule books. And on his third album, both his instincts and his technique are in top form. Naples’ albums have largely skirted club fare: Body Pill balanced its dancefloor cuts with slow-motion studies for scratchy samples and overdriven machines; last year’s Take Me With You, for the psychedelically inclined Good Morning Tapes label, was an expression of honeyed ambient bliss. But Fog FM is techno through and through. Contrary to the album’s name, virtually everything here, save for two beatless palette cleansers, is tough, upfront, and often bruisingly physical. Burly sub-bass tugs at the lower limits of your perception; intricate drum patterns are carved out of compressed white noise. Naples layers competing rhythms in ways that create friction and throw off sparks; the atmosphere is frequently nervous, turbulent, suffused with clattering sounds that are all the more menacing for the fact that you can’t quite make out what they are or where they come from. Fog FM goes plenty deep, too. That’s immediately apparent on songs like the title track and “Lucy’s,” which avail themselves of the resonant chords of dub techno, one of dance music’s most inviting forms. Intimations of depth also play out in less obvious ways; there is always more here than meets the ear. In “Unhygenix,” a highlight of the album’s back half, a skipping, hissing groove reminiscent of Thomas Melchior’s blissed-out minimal house bounces away against a shimmering backdrop. Even the heaviest tracks have an unusually enveloping quality. “Benefit” is caressed by dissonant squeals that twist like tendrils of guitar feedback, until, two-thirds of the way through its eight-minute run, a cooling synthesizer progression is applied like a balm, taking the edge off. At more than an hour long, Fog FM is Naples’ most substantial piece of work by a considerable margin, but his insistence on wringing his grooves for all they’re worth keeps the album engaging as a front-to-back listen in a way that isn’t true of most techno long-players. In fact, the slipperiness of his arrangements plays out across the album itself: It’s the rare dance full-length that foregrounds its heaviest cuts and then gradually leans back and loosens up.

On Avery Island,Neutral Milk Hotel,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ceffb685a46c24ed7098da5/1:1/w_160/NeutralMilkHotel_OnAveryIsland.jpg,2019-06-23 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/neutral-milk-hotel-on-avery-island/,Merge,"In the mid-’90s, Jeff Mangum moved into a haunted closet in Denver where he had dreams of women in fur coats drinking champagne, yelling at him to get out of their house. During a snowy Colorado winter, the Louisiana-born songwriter and his childhood friend Robert Schneider set about recording what would become Neutral Milk Hotel’s debut album. They worked feverishly, going out to smoke cigarettes when they hit a roadblock, until, in May of 1995, they had a finished record. The North Carolina indie label Merge scooped up the young band and quietly released On Avery Island the following March. At the time, Neutral Milk Hotel were bit players in a wave of buzzy psychedelic indie pop. Virginia songwriter Mark Linkous released his debut album as Sparklehorse in August of 1995; Oklahoma City stalwarts the Flaming Lips released the cult favorite Clouds Taste Metallic later that same year. Beck’s omnivorous breakthrough Odelay and Super Furry Animals’ debut Fuzzy Logic both came out midway through 1996, while Grandaddy issued their first LP in 1997. The record industry was in the best shape it’s ever been in, and even majors were willing to take chances on messy, ramshackle bands that took cues from the 1972 psych-rock compilation Nuggets as they coasted on the drift of college radio powerhouses like R.E.M. It was a good time to make weird shit. Unlike the Flaming Lips and Beck, Neutral Milk Hotel didn’t set their sights on breaking through to the mainstream. They subsisted happily as part of the Elephant 6 collective, a group of psychedelic musicians based first in Denver and then in Athens, Georgia, who played unlikely instruments like the singing saw and the accordion in each other’s bands. Alongside Neutral Milk Hotel, the collective included the Apples in Stereo, the Olivia Tremor Control, and Elf Power. They issued a few early records before most of their groups signed to established and better-resourced labels. In the midst of a college radio renaissance, Elephant 6 carved out a colorful niche. On Avery Island earned a handful of positive reviews from music magazines, and after its release, Mangum got a band together and toured steadily. In February 1998, Merge released the band’s second album, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea, expecting to move about 7,000 copies. It did sell modestly at first, receiving warm but not effusive reviews in the music press. Mangum kept touring, and the band’s profile grew; fans showed up at NMH gigs knowing every word to his songs, and often sang them louder than the frontman did. Music magazines started asking for interviews, and Mangum found that he hated explaining himself. By the end of 1998, Neutral Milk Hotel turned down the opportunity to open for R.E.M. Disturbed by the unexpected success of his project, Mangum withdrew from music and spent a few years in a state of panic. Neutral Milk Hotel vanished almost as soon as it had arrived. And then music nerds figured out they could share mp3s with each other on the internet. In the early aughts, Aeroplane became a cherished totem among people who hid from the world in strange music. A sweeping, surrealist concept album loosely based on the life and death of Anne Frank, its carnivalesque singalongs and horny, apocalyptic lyrics attracted people too young to have followed NMH while they were active. That the band was in stasis and Mangum gone from the public eye only added to the record’s mystique. It was just a few years old, but it felt like an artifact unearthed and shared covertly among those in the know. Aeroplane might be an offbeat record—its unwieldy title, its songs about cum and communism, Mangum’s brassy, abrasive voice—but its songs are simple and tuneful enough to be played at expensive weddings. In 2005, the teen drama “The O.C.” featured a cover of the album’s title track in an episode, causing a mild uproar over possessive fans who didn’t want normies in their midst. But the word was already out, and Aeroplane became something of a sensation, a living record of an extinct band. There are NMH devotees who will argue that On Avery Island is the better of Mangum’s two official LPs. It’s certainly less spoiled by exposure, and certain songs, like “You’ve Passed” and “Gardenhead / Leave Me Alone,” easily rank among NMH’s best. Within the fan community, On Avery Island served as a throttle between Aeroplane’s broadening pop appeal and the sprawling collection of bootleg concert tapes that could be easily snapped up via file-sharing programs. There are some curios in Mangum’s back catalog—minutes of unintelligible screaming, rackets of ear-scraping noise, a prank call where Mangum pretends to be an old man asking a phone sex hotline for bestiality roleplay—and there are also some of the most moving, sublime songs he’s ever written, preserved only in the tape hiss of early demos and live recordings. On Avery Island bridges these two worlds. It offers a glimpse of a pivotal songwriter in transition, moving from making shoddy cassettes for his friends to making art rock that spoke to untold thousands of lonely teens listening to pilfered mp3s late into the night. All the seeds of Aeroplane can be heard scattered throughout On Avery Island. Mangum already balanced the gross and the transcendent in his lyrics: On “A Baby for Pree,” he imagines a pregnant woman full of bees who spews infants until they fill up her bedroom. Throughout the course of the rambunctious, trombone-heavy opener “Song Against Sex,” the speaker kisses another boy while the apocalypse sets in, complains about the porn he hates and the drugs he won’t take, and then lights himself on fire. Certain songs hit closer to the bone than anything on Aeroplane. “You’ve Passed” envisions a woman’s spirit coursing away from the hospital where she’s just died, while “Three Peaches” articulates an uncanny emotional register between mourning and celebration as Mangum sings to a friend who survived a suicide attempt. It’s one of the hardest NMH songs to endure; Mangum sings from the very bottom of his diaphragm as if dredging up muck from beneath the earth’s crust, dragging out the words “I’m so happy” while sounding like he’s about to keel over with grief. There are love songs here, too, like the effervescent “Naomi” and “Leave Me Alone,” and there are spooling, chaotic instrumental tracks: “Marching Theme,” which rolls along on a breathing drone, and the 14-minute closer “Pree Sisters Swallowing A Donkey’s Eye,” which rides the album’s final triumphant burst out into a slow-growing silence. The album veers wildly between the accessible and the inscrutable, like putting the Velvet Underground’s best-of collection on shuffle with excerpts from Lou Reed’s squalling feedback symphony Metal Machine Music interspersed. The abrupt transitions between perfect pop melodies and gaseous balls of noise lend the album a certain wildfire charm. It has less varnish than Aeroplane, and that raw face makes it a little easier to see into the mind of the guy who wrote it. Aeroplane’s thematic ambitions can make it feel bigger than any one person: It’s an album about death and loss and evil, and about how human beings keep searching for the good in ourselves despite our long history of being awful to each other. On Avery Island’s scope is narrower. Mangum sings about himself and the people he knows. Instead of mountaintops and oceans, he sets his songs in bedrooms and public parks. His characters smoke cigarettes and hate themselves for being horny. They break up and hook up and yearn for each other like teenagers. They fall asleep on other people’s floors, listening to the rain hit the streets outside. Mangum swirls mundane imagery into surrealist fantasy, sprinkling bizarre references to angels and halos throughout, as if contemplating an aunt’s ceramic cherubim while on an acid trip. Grounding these jerky lyrical turns are horns, organ, and fuzz bass, which all sprout distortion like moss. If Aeroplane sweeps you off your feet through time and space, rocketing back and forth between World War II and the present, On Avery Island roots you in the here and now, strange as it may be. In their postmortem popularity, Neutral Milk Hotel would become a beacon for a glut of aughts bands who never quite achieved their idols’ specificity. Arcade Fire, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, Wolf Parade, and Beirut all sprang up on the ground Mangum cleared, mixing boisterous vocals with antique instrumentation. But even the most lyrically adventurous songwriters of the aughts never approached the way Mangum saw the whole world as if it were melting. On his first official release, he established himself as the sort of artist who feels everything at full volume, who bellows through the mess of his life because it’s the only thing he knows how to do. I was biking home from a movie one summer night in Denver when it crept up on me, a feast of color illuminating the riverside trail. There is an old amusement park on the other side of the river from the buildings that make up the skyline. It pops into view unexpectedly when you’re driving on Route 25, a tangle of wooden roller coasters and Starflyer rides rubbing up against the Colorado sky. It looks out of place, especially at night, when it leaks neon into the dark. In “Gardenhead,” Mangum sings about a roller coaster that crashes into the ocean, and there’s a B-side from 1996, a fan favorite, called “Ferris Wheel on Fire.” On Avery Island is a theme park plopped down on a city: It rushes the fantastical into the everyday, conjuring the weird sensation of getting knocked loose from a rut into the intoxicating unknown of what’s still to come.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

An Obelisk,Titus Andronicus,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ce414125a46c2f23b0986f9/1:1/w_160/TitusAndronicus_AnObelisk.jpg,2019-06-22 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/titus-andronicus-an-obelisk/,Merge,"Patrick Stickles understands that it takes a gimmick to sell music these days, so he’s winkingly provided one. To tease their throat-grabbing new album An Obelisk, the band released a meta, 36-minute pilot for a sitcom called “STACKS” that satirizes the modern promotional cycle while simultaneously feeding it, following a barely fictionalized version of Stickles as he endures the indignities of the record industry. After the album’s first video flops, his label PR suggests manufacturing a viral dance challenge (“#TitusAndronicusChallenge or something like that?”). When he dismisses that idea, they suggest a pivot to synth pop. His day plays out in a sequence of deflating interactions that make the episode feel like a structural mirror of A Charlie Brown Christmas—both chronicle a melancholy idealist as they process the commercialization of something they cherish. “STACKS” isn’t required viewing. The acting is stiff and the pacing is pokey, but it’s punctuated by moments of inspiration, especially a barroom cypher where Stickles throws down some surprisingly spirited raps about narrow-minded critics: “The last shit that I dropped was A Productive Cough/The media greeted it with a reductive scoff.” The relatively cold reception to 2018’s A Productive Cough can’t help but cast a shadow over An Obelisk and its gripes about the music industry (as Stickles testifies on opener “Just Like Ringing a Bell,” “They’re making a dirty fortune selling something that’s barely working, an inferior version of rock’n’roll or whatever else has touched your soul.”) But Stickles preemptively refutes any suggestion that An Obelisk’s rowdiness is a response to that record. It was always the plan to follow up that more acoustic album with a punk rock one, or so his sitcom insists in an interview with a condescending music journalist. It’s just a happy coincidence, then, that the new record corrects much of what didn’t work about the last one. A Productive Cough felt more like a genre exercise than a passion project, and that’s true of An Obelisk, too, except this time the genre is a far better fit. Produced by Bob Mould and recorded at Steve Albini’s Electrical Audio studio, it’s the band’s shortest album (38 minutes) and by far their leanest (even 2012’s Local Business, which seemed streamlined at the time, was only stripped down in comparison to the Civil War epic it proceeded). Where Titus Andronicus once made a statement out of bloat, here they do it with brevity. Two consecutive songs clock in at under a minute and a half, including the 68-second standout “On the Street.” With its “There’s too many police” rally cry, that song is Stickles’ most overt attempt to write an archetypal oi! anthem—and it really does sound like something anarcho-punks might have rioted to circa 1978—but the entire album is peppered with callbacks to punk’s glory years, from the “Clampdown” stop/starts of “Within the Gravitron” to the pint-raising Pogues breakdown of “Hey Ma.” Though it isn’t as elaborately themed as Titus Andronicus’ most celebrated work, there’s an arc to An Obelisk. From an opening stretch that literally includes a song titled “(I Blame) Society,” Stickles gradually stops pointing fingers and begins interrogating himself, considering his own complicity in systems he abhors. “I say that I’m innocent but it isn’t true,” he fesses in a Johnny Rotten snarl on “Beneath The Boot.” After exfoliating its sour facade, An Obelisk ends on a constructive note. In keeping with the record’s ’70s pub rock undertones, closer “Tumult Around the World” plays like Stickles’ own “(What’s So Funny ’Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding,” an uplifting plea for empathy. “There’s tumult around the earth/But everywhere, there’s people dreaming and people holding on to hope,” he sings, abandoning cathartic punk sloganeering for earnestness and an implicit vow to be one of those people. His opinion of the music industry may not have improved any, but at least his view of humanity has.","Where Titus Andronicus once made great statements out of bloat, on their sixth album they do it with refreshing brevity.

How Am I Not Myself?,French Vanilla,by: Zach Schonfeld,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d029c89b25f86d20a4f7643/1:1/w_160/HowAmINotMyself_FrenchVanilla.jpg,2019-06-22 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/french-vanilla-how-am-i-not-myself/,Danger Collective,"The most liberal use of saxophone you’re likely to hear on a rock record in 2019 does not involve Bruce Springsteen, nor any titans of third-wave ska (yes, Reel Big Fish put out an album recently). It’s the new album by French Vanilla, a cheerfully subversive art-punk group nurtured in Los Angeles’s queer punk scene. Throughout How Am I Not Myself?, Daniel Trautfield’s saxophone squawks, groans, and erupts into melodies far more playful than you might expect from a band that cites Leonard Cohen and novelist Dodie Bellamy among its lyrical influences. These sax parts share virtually no DNA with the smooth sax solo, that much-mocked ’80s tradition recently rehabilitated by the likes of Carly Rae Jepsen and the 1975. Like much of French Vanilla’s music, they are jittery and anxious and a little bit outrageous⁠—critiquing cultural norms and reveling in their own absurdity all at once. French Vanilla are a relatively new band: They released their self-titled first album in 2017, after finding a local audience playing queer punk parties and then DIY performance spaces in L.A. But their music taps into a deeper lineage, one that includes the nervous energy and eccentric vocal stylings of the B-52’s and the jagged no-wave dissonance of early ’80s acts like Bush Tetras. (You could draw a fuzzy line from the latter band’s underground hit, “Too Many Creeps,” and French Vanilla’s own unease with misogynistic institutions.) On “Suddenly,” a devilishly funky mid-album highlight, an octave-leaping sax solo conveys the simultaneous intoxication and anxiety of modern nightlife. “All the Time” evokes the robotic edge of Devo as vocalist Sally Spitz sings about the terror and glee of an intense crush: “The way you look at me, so deep into my eyes/You’re not like other guys,” she blurts, giddy with panic. Spitz, French Vanilla’s lead vocalist, studied performance art at UCLA, where she was influenced by avant-garde giants like Diamanda Galás and Nina Hagen. She is a compellingly weird and charismatic singer; on this album, she whoops (“Real or Not”), talk-sings (“Move Along, Move Ahead”), shrieks cartoonishly (“Joan of Marc by Marc”), and enunciates words with the odd pursed-lips affect commonly employed by Mark Mothersbaugh. The rhythms are fast and nervy; the guitars eschew conventional chord progressions because guitarist Ali Day never learned them. Like Priests, the D.C. punk band with whom French Vanilla have played, much of the songwriting addresses the overlap between the personal and political, with a probing eye towards sexist power structures. “Lost Power,” one of the record’s more conventionally catchy numbers, finds Spitz reflecting on a sense of identity loss she felt while in a long-term heterosexual relationship. “Bromosapien” skewers a sexist and condescending coworker as Spitz hopefully wonders, “Will there be a day when guys like you don't exist?” It’s an irreverent take on a maddening situation; despite the band’s academic interests, they are not above shouting “I think I hate you!” four times in a row. How Am I Not Myself? is a brief and self-contained album. What it lacks in stylistic diversity it makes up with sustained and unrelenting energy, even on the least distinctive songs, like the relatively flat “Protective.” The saxophone, of course, is present most of the time—including on the final track, “Sensitive (Not Too Sensitive),” where it trades phrases with Spitz’s righteous exhortations against the indignities of wage labor. That insistent sax is the raucous, unwavering id of a band that takes its anti-oppressive, anticapitalist spirit—but never itself—seriously.","On their second album, the cheerfully subversive L.A. art-punks critique societal norms as they revel in their own absurdity (and saxophone).

III,Bad Books,by: Nina Corcoran,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cfe7fd6f6056060a14d3569/1:1/w_160/III_BadBooks.jpg,2019-06-22 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bad-books-iii/,Loma Vista,"Both Kevin Devine, the Brooklyn-based singer-songwriter, and Andy Hull, frontman of Atlanta band Manchester Orchestra and sole member of Right Away, Great Captain!, have been around longer, sold more records, and played bigger venues than their collaborative side project, Bad Books. In 2010, the longtime friends (and the rest of Manchester Orchestra) partnered up to workshop one another’s ideas under a new moniker. Instead, they wound up writing material that sounded like reworkings of their respective catalogs: alt-leaning indie folk, deceptively mopey rock, and heartstring-tugging acoustic songs. After a seven-year break, Bad Books return with III, the album that finally articulates who, and what, this band is about. Created during scattered sessions over the past two years, III fills the gaps left open by 2010’s self-titled debut and its 2012 follow-up, II. The first album grappled with religious ideology and deep-seated regrets; the latter explored fictional stories through self-reflective characters. Both zigzagged abruptly, swerving from peppy alt-rock to barren ballad without much regard for flow. Devine and Hull wrote catchy songs independently, but—perhaps as a symptom of the distance between them—their collaboration struggled to find a singular focus. (Even they admitted as much.) Now they’re on the same page. Shedding the keyboardist, bassist, and drummer of their previous incarnation, Devine, Hull, and Manchester Orchestra member Robert McDowell use a few acoustic guitars, a bare piano, and the occasional keyboard to set their scenes. Recording with just three members results in intimate, hushed storytelling reminiscent of Devine and Hull’s early days sharing the stage—so honed in and aware of the other’s movements that onlookers fell silent, entranced. The stripped-back approach allows “UFO,” a song about suicidal ideation, to swell with layered vocal harmonies just as the lyrics turn confessional. By comparison, the emotional nine-minute closer “Army” sounds like an explosion, slowly building the acoustic instruments to a breaking point, when the protagonist, a soldier, takes his own life. Within a comforting, relaxed musical space, Bad Books reach beyond B-side material, using this platform to wrestle with previously untouched topics. Devine and Hull, both new fathers, wax poetic on the joys and anxieties of raising a child. Hull’s haunted whispers tell a horror story on “Neighborhood,” a graphic condemnation of homophobic violence. Meanwhile, Devine’s songs—“Myths Made Plain” and “I Love You, I’m Sorry, Please Help Me, Thank You”—are consumed by political inequality, parental failure, and a blurred sense of self. These aren’t road-trip singalongs the way “Forest Whitaker” and “The After Party” were. They’re confidential poems descended from one-on-one conversation—a natural approach, given that Devine and Hull regularly speak on the phone. There’s a refreshing candor to III, especially when it comes to the heaviest subject matter. Bad Books are getting honest, even if the truth—“I’m a seven-page laundry list of sinful deeds I swore were not me”—is unflattering. At the end of “Wheel Well,” there’s a lull where the music subsides and Devine’s voice floats in like a raft: “No one’s alone/Or it’s the one thing we are.” Solitude suits Bad Books; it’s what allowed Devine and Hull to become comfortable starting from scratch. Without the hooks of their previous albums, never mind those of their better-known bands, the songs on III take a while to sink in. In return for the slow approach, Bad Books offer a serious body of work that can stand on its own, a testament to the friendship that brought them together in the first place.","Kevin Devine and Manchester Orchestra’s Andy Hull used to record collaborations that sounded like reworkings of their respective catalogs, but they’ve finally articulated what this band is about.

It’s part luck, part genius, part of the YeeHaw agenda, a song so unstoppable, it has actually shifted the status quo of country music and is currently one of the biggest singles—and memes—of all time. Even if you pass on bootcut jeans, the meme has the same contagious effect. Before he became the newly crowned prince of country, Lil Nas X was just another guy looking for fame by quietly throwing his music onto SoundCloud. When it happened, it happened fast: A $30 YouTube beat, a hypnotic Nine Inch Nails sample, a faux-twangy accent, and “Old Town Road” went from a viral moment on TikTok to the center of a controversy about whether or not the song could be classified as country music. (It was initially removed from the Billboard country chart because it did not “embrace enough elements of today’s country music.”) One irresistible, if slightly harrowing Billy Ray Cyrus remix later, and Lil Nas X was back—not just on the country charts, but on the Hot 100 with the biggest song in the U.S. To Lil Nas X’s benefit, it never mattered whether “Old Town Road” was good or bad. It’s so good it’s bad; it’s so bad it’s good. It’s a critical hall of mirrors from which there is no escape. Criticizing “Old Town Road” is like trying to fight the sun. From the start, the song was completely aware that it was essentially a meme. Everyone was in on the joke, and if you tried to criticize the joke, you were now the joke who was trying to ruin everyone’s fun. The fact that Lil Nas X’s vocals were easily imitable or that the lyrics were packed with country buzzwords gleaned from “Red Dead Redemption 2” or that the drums could be programmed by your little cousin who heard Astroworld one time was irrelevant. “Old Town Road” was a spectacle and everyone loved being a part of the ride. On Lil Nas X’s debut 7—a 19-minute EP bookended with the Billy Ray Cyrus remix and the original version of “Old Town Road”—he opens himself up to the criticism that “Old Town Road” bypassed. Each new song on 7 is an attempt at stumbling into another lighthearted hit. We don’t learn a single thing about Lil Nas X on 7 other than he might have actually been born in a Reddit test tube in 2018. His collaborations with the production duo Take A Daytrip are soulless. On “Panini,” Lil Nas X has the droll personality of a Kawhi Leonard interview when stripped of all the gimmicks. So it makes sense that “Rodeo,” his second track with Take A Daytrip, is a desperate return to the bulletproof cowboy persona. “Rodeo” hits all the beats of 2018’s “Mo Bamba”—also produced by Take A Daytrip—and feels like Lil Nas X just praying that the “Old Town Road” goodwill has enough legs to latch onto this single. It probably does. That hit-seeking dart game continues on with “F9mily (You and Me),” a cheap rock song made to be performed at summer camp talent shows. In an Instagram snippet for the song, Lil Nas X gets out in front of the potential criticism of this track, calling it “Disney soundtrack confirmed” and “Travis Barker on the beat.” Both are perfect descriptions, neither is positive. While listening to his attempt at SoundCloud alt-rock on “Bring U Down,” I can picture Lil Nas X thinking up this song while sitting at a big corner-office desk at Columbia Records. For the entirety of 7, it’s unclear if Lil Nas X actually likes music. He uses a lazy, out-of-tune melody on the reflective “Kick It,” a song that looks back on the past six months, which is apparently the only thing he has anything to say about. Then, there’s the sloppy finale “C7osure (You Like),” which sounds like B.o.B. got hired to make a J.C. Penney commercial in 2010. The EP ends up being a set of nothingness, like watching a Kylie Jenner vlog, content made for the sake of justifying its existence. Eventually, one of these songs on 7 will draft behind the still-overwhelming charm of “Old Town Road” and find some success of its own, and Lil Nas X will be there online, with his savvy internet wit, ready to saddle up and burn another meme to the ground.  What he lacks in musicality he makes up for in Instagram followers, boots he can strap on whenever he needs to remind people that he’s the great unifier, the one who tore down the walls of a genre. When that’s all over, which it will be, what’s left will be “Old Town Road,” an all-time hall-of-fame pop hit that will one day be explained with an “I guess you had to be there.”","The songs on the debut EP from the viral rap and country star do not even come close to the pure magic of “Old Town Road.”

Turn Off the News (Build a Garden),Lukas NelsonPromise of the Real,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf91fc5b145121f776676ba/1:1/w_160/TurnOff_LukasNelson.jpg,2019-06-21 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lukas-nelson-and-promise-of-the-real-turn-off-the-news-build-a-garden/,Fantasy,"Looking the part has never been a problem for Lukas Nelson. Between his scruffy charisma and clear love of the stage, the rocker looked so much the part that Bradley Cooper recruited him as the “authenticity consultant” for A Star Is Born, modeling his character’s look and presence after Nelson’s. That gig bloomed into a bigger role contributing to the film’s soundtrack, parts of which Nelson co-wrote, and on screen, where Nelson and his band Promise of the Real appeared as Cooper’s backing group. Symbiotic relationships don’t get more glamorous than this: a rock star who looks like a movie star, helping a movie star look like a rock star. For Nelson, A Star Is Born was just the latest lucky break in an already charmed life. The son of Willie Nelson, he inherited quite a bit of his father’s talent and, just as importantly, enough of his father’s connections and goodwill to grant him a head start in an industry where traditionalists devoted to the 1980s Rolling Stone Record Guide ideal of Good Music aren’t exactly hard to come by. By his early 20s he was opening for and recording with his father; after 2014’s Farm Aid he and his band began backing Neil Young, further cementing their standing among rock purists. Even before his big-screen moment, his band was already well on its way to becoming to throwback roots-rock what Greta Van Fleet are to blacklights and bell bottoms. Lady Gaga lent her star power to Nelson and Promise of the Real’s 2017 self-titled breakthrough album, and an air of celebrity hangs over the group’s new Turn Off the News (Build a Garden) as well. Sheryl Crow sings backup on the title track, a Byrds-esque imagining of a better world, while Kesha graces “Save a Little Heartache,” a breezy piña colada of a blues-rock jam, and Neil Young sits in on pump organ on a rustic reprise of the title song. Randy Houser and Shooter Jennings both guest, too, although they take a respectful backseat to a father/son duet on “Civilized Hell.” The younger Nelson’s reedy lisp so resembles his father’s that it’s like hearing Willie sing with a Benjamin Buttoned version of himself. Sometimes Nelson even seems to be writing for his father’s voice. “I don’t trust computers anymore, gonna buy a little weed in the marijuana store,” he ambles over some leisurely twang on “Lotta Fun,” accompanied by Margo Price. “Simple Life” doubles down on the boomer-baiting, playing like a worry-free rewrite of Buffalo Springfield’s “For What It’s Worth (Stop, Hey What’s That Sound).” Nelson’s entire persona is pitched somewhere between a tailgater at a Jimmy Buffett concert and Paul Rudd’s surfer bro in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, bragging that he quit wearing a watch because his cell phone has a clock. To the extent he acknowledges society’s woes, it’s only to recommend how best to ignore them. That escapist worldview may be the most divisive thing about an album that otherwise aims to build bridges. Nelson is a natural showman, and his band plays with similar spirit—there isn’t a moment on Turn Off the News where they seem to be faking their enthusiasm for this material. There’s a fine line between escapist and naïve, though, and Nelson and company aren’t afraid to toe it. The extent to which listeners enjoy this record depends on how much they buy into the fantasy of Nelson and his famous pals clinking Coronas around the pool while the rest of the world goes to hell. If it feels a little hollow, well, that’s by design.

Empathy EP,Jean Deaux,by: Michelle Kim,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cfe7bbef60560537e4d3564/1:1/w_160/Empathy_JeanDeaux.jpg,2019-06-21 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jean-deaux-empathy-ep/,EMPIRE,"Almost a decade ago, Jean Deaux met Saba and his brother Joseph Chilliams at a youth open-mic event. Since then, the rapper/singer born Zoi Harris has become one of the most versatile features in and beyond Chicago hip-hop. Early in her career, she landed collaborations with UK psych-pop band Glass Animals and London electro-soul singer Sampha. And though she’s regularly self-released projects on SoundCloud, Deaux is perhaps best known by association with her impressive list of collaborators: Saba, Mykki Blanco, Kehlani. With last October’s Krash EP, she began working to make a name for herself—building an identity around her airy, flexible voice and affinity for weightless house-hop beats. On her new EP, Empathy, she raps with restraint, revealing a glimpse into a wide inner landscape. Throughout Empathy, Deaux’s soft vocals emulate sweet-toned greats like Janet Jackson and Brandy. On the Kehlani-featuring standout “Anytime,” her voice smolders as she outlines her plans for a certain someone: “Call me anytime you wanna get it/I could have it crackin’ for you,” she sings, before jumping into a high-pitched falsetto that aligns her with funk-inspired vocalists like Childish Gambino or Smino. Though her voice rarely rises above a whisper, she flows effortlessly between the sensuous and the sorrowful. On the EP’s final track, “Speakerphone (Trust Issues),” she raps vaguely about someone who’s left, her scattered language suggesting an emotional stand-off. “I know you planning to tell a lie/I wear my power, you see it on,” she raps, her tenderness now evoking dejection and betrayal. She shares the talent for emotional pivots with fellow Chicago rapper Tink, who writes about relationships with gripping melodrama. But Deaux’s spoken-word poetry background shines through with songs that decline to follow a concrete storyline. “Henny straight, wanna taste mine?/Lil’ baby gon call me up, he wanna FaceTime/I tippy toe’d out the party, mami gon’ make time,” she raps on “Break Time,” flashing a staccato string of images rather than methodically setting a scene. This impressionistic songwriting can feel slippery; it’s hard to know exactly what she’s rapping about or why she feels a certain way. At the same time, the open-endedness creates intrigue. “Life Lines” conjures a scene so arresting it doesn’t need a backstory: “I can’t read your damn mind/But when I hold your hand/I can see your... life lines,” she sings, dragging out the notes. “Life Lines” ends with a recording of Deaux discussing the concept of empathy with Bari, another Chicago rapper and close collaborator. “Instead of reacting or taking something personal,” she explains, “be like, ‘Damn, you probably going through some shit.’” Perhaps it’s only natural for a skilled and evocative performer to be fascinated by emotional awareness. Yet Deaux’s reluctance to spell out the details of a situation creates distance within her songs, a slight fog that protects her from full transparency. Ultimately, empathy is what she asks of her audience. When you listen to her words closely and begin to recognize their subtleties, Empathy is her most layered and sumptuous project yet.","The Chicago rapper and singer makes a name for herself with an airy, flexible voice that flows effortlessly between the sensuous and the sorrowful.

Big Dread Moon,Claire Cronin,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cfad2aff443631a47bcb952/1:1/w_160/ClaireCronin_BigDreadMoon.jpg,2019-06-21 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/claire-cronin-big-dread-moon/,Orindal,"In 2017, the singer-songwriter Claire Cronin published an essay called “Blue Light on the Screen: Notes on Horror.” Writing about her lifelong attraction to ghost stories and slasher flicks, the Athens, Georgia-based artist explored the comforts of the genre—being able to predict what will happen next, who the killer might be, when to expect a resolution. In one section, she lists her favorite movie taglines, disembodied from their titles so that they read like poetry (“They’re here,” “They won’t stay dead,” “Before you die, you see:”). In another, she makes you feel genuinely sad for all the franchises that ended prematurely and ambiguously: death without resurrection. “Perhaps more than any other genre,” she writes, “horror demonstrates the pleasure of repetition.” It’s a quality that horror shares with folk music, and Cronin’s fascination with one has aided her mastery in the other. Big Dread Moon, her latest album, is full of scenes you’ll recognize from any number of Halloween classics. There are werewolves and ghosts, guns and knives, fangs and blood, ominous weather and dolls in gowns. Cronin has a cracked, cawing delivery like Will Oldham or Scout Niblett—artists who could turn from conversational to spectral with the quietest gesture. Her music is alluringly sparse; most of the arrangements feature only her guitar and Ezra Buchla’s viola, with occasional synth and percussion for texture. Like her nonfiction writing, Cronin’s lyrics are kaleidoscopic. She writes from the center of the action, wandering through the dark; we’re likely to see the danger lurking before she does. In “What the Night Is Thinking,” she sings in the third-person to justify this instinct: “We want wild winds,” she sings. “We want bones bleached and scattering.” She often does the job herself, writing songs that swirl like tornadoes through quiet streets. “Tourniquet” is a blues song bled dry; “Like a Shield” surges like a ’90s alternative rock hit stripped to its bleakest form. Stretches of silence in horror films generally forecast just how violent things are about to get. Cronin’s songwriting is heavy with pre-traumatic calm. The simplicity of her music grounds its intensity. Many singers could take a line like “Coffins long for the touch of death” and have it sound vaguely creepy, but Cronin has a gift for confiding it like something she has experienced first-hand. This balance between tenderness and terror, the supernatural and the quotidian, is crucial to her work. Movie screens appear in multiple songs, while “Call Out” finds her surprised by the way blood looks in real-life—brighter than she expected. The album’s peak is “Wolfman,” a slow, menacing ballad sung with the devotion of a love song. Her words are vague enough to sound like a nightmare but specific enough so that you can see the lamplight, hear the rain on the streets. It’s the kind of whispered story that’s usually laughed off early in a film, only to become frighteningly real by the end. When she sings, you believe every word.","Claire Cronin’s latest record connects her lifelong love of horror movies to her simple, creaky songs.

A Bath Full of Ecstasy,Hot Chip,by: Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cd5cc7585a35d884ee63c95/1:1/w_160/HotChip_ABathFullOfEcstasy.jpg,2019-06-20 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hot-chip-a-bath-full-of-ecstasy/,Domino,"New Hot Chip songs always seem like spaceships: sleek, polished, unsubtle, a little ridiculous. These qualities make it easy to marvel at the work of the London group while also underestimating it. Hot Chip have been around for nearly 20 years now, and though they reached a peak about halfway through (their mid-career albums Made in the Dark and One Life Stand are hard to choose between), they’ve never entirely dropped off. Their last album, 2015’s Why Make Sense, was a grower, complete with one of their best singles to date (“Started Right”). Their new one, A Bath Full of Ecstasy, sounds at first so Hot Chippy as to be a caricature, with big Technicolor beats and big, tenderly sung ballads from lead vocalist Alexis Taylor, but it turns out to be another strong entry. For the most part, it’s compulsively listenable, oddly moving, and stranger than it first appears, as the band gets existential on the dance floor. This is despite some truly dopey lyrics. The opener is called “Melody of Love,” and floats this sentiment at you: “I always seem to hesitate/Too little always comes too late/There is a sound that resonates/A melody of love.” That’s purpler than a bruise. But Hot Chip have one of the more interesting relationships with banality this side of Dan Bejar (think of their ludicrous, beautiful song “Brothers”). And the more you listen to “Melody of Love,” the more comforting you find it. The scale of the music is just immense, enough to dwarf the silliness of the words. The track was created from a 12-minute, gospel-sampling instrumental track and whittled down to a state of intense purity with the help of the xx producer Rodaidh McDonald, but it still feels colossal. At some point, even the lyrics start to make sense as a catalyst for free association. A line as throwaway as “Do you have faith to feel in this world” seems profound for the kinds of thoughts it inspires with the soaring music accompanying it. If this sounds like testimony from someone who has done a slow-acting but effective hallucinogen, then I’ve managed to deliver the correct impression. Hot Chip recruited the psychedelic whiz Philippe Zdar, of Cassius, and his Dionysian energy overflows as he monkeys around with the mix of songs like “Positive,” playing restlessly, helping the track light up like the dance floor at Angels in the early 1990s. The band is most effective when Zdar or McDonald succeed in pushing it out of its comfort zone; the lesser songs here—“Spell,” the title track—feel as if they could have been recycled from old sessions. (But neither is without its charms: The hook on “Spell” takes you right back to the “Ready for the Floor,” too catchy to dismiss entirely.) Taylor had an interesting exchange with a reporter at The Guardian on the subject of chemical escape. The reporter seemed more than a little bit taken with the idea that the “ecstasy” in the album’s title was an explicit reference to the party drug. Taylor responded that the feeling of ecstasy was “just a nice thing to be talking about these days.” Whether drug-induced or not, it didn’t matter to him (and it shouldn’t, really, to anybody). More to the point, the songs on A Bath Full of Ecstasy were written “for people to bathe in, or be lost in an active way,” he explained. This goal, when met, puts the best songs here in line with recent releases from Neneh Cherry and Helado Negro. It’s music that creates a soothing bubble, not to seal off the outside world but to create space to breathe within it. For perspective, not escape. The tracks that best exemplify that idea are mostly mid-tempo numbers in the album’s back half. The entire band rises to meet Taylor’s dreamy melancholy on “Why Does My Mind?,” one of a pair of heartbreaking songs, and perhaps Hot Chip’s most Zen expression to date, as Taylor wishes away his desires, lust, and blues. Goddard follows on its fraternal twin, “Clear Blue Skies,” his friendly, casual warbling belying the weight of the questions he poses (“Why does it matter?”) over a 2-step-indebted beat that sounds like something Kieran Hebden, a friend of the band, might have cooked up. It all wraps up with the gorgeous “No God,” where Taylor jubilantly embraces life on Earth, rejecting the importance of anything else. (“No God… can make me feel the way you make me feel.”) Perhaps 70 years ago, the suggestion that a romantic connection could be more important than a divine one would have registered as a radical act. Now, it scans as sweet and a bit strange, the perfect Hot Chip combination. Also, it’s a jam.

Endorphins,Octavian ,by: Dean Van Nguyen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d0128b2f443630848bcbbfd/1:1/w_160/Endorphins_Octavian.jpg,2019-06-20 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/octavian-endorphins/,Black Butter,"In the crowded and competitive world of UK rap, Octavian Godji is doing everything he can to stand out. The 23-year-old South Londoner arrived on the scene with a gripping backstory: He left France for Britain at an early age, attended the prestigious BRIT School, endured homelessness at age 15, and slipped into drug dealing. But it was last year’s debut mixtape Spaceman—an elegant suite of woozy beats, deft poetics, open-book confessionals, and the spirit of Noah “40” Shebib—that lifted him out of the pack. Follow-up Endorphins goes in a new direction—or rather several. Octavian is having fun, pulling at different stylistic threads to see what’s at the other end. And with high-profile guests matched by a crisp collection of beats, Endorphins feels more like a major studio debut than the mixtape it’s billed as. How diverse is this set? Well, consider the following: Octavian doing a dead-on 21 Savage impression alongside Skepta on the creeping “Bet”; matching A$AP Ferg’s boasts on a track called “Lit”; enlisting Abra for the Lil Peep pastiche “My Head”; underpinning the Theophilus London-featuring dancefloor jam “Feel It” with 1980s-style pop drums;  linking up with Jessie Ware amid the thumping drum machines and grinding synths of “Walking Alone.” Yet these swerves rarely feel jarring. With forceful presence, Octavian establishes himself everywhere he goes and never sounds out of his depth. While Spaceman’s downtempo ambience was punctuated by flashes of naked fragility, this new tape finds Octavian—deploying slang originating everywhere from London to Lawrenceville—mostly interested in drugs, money, and girls. Opening track “Gangster Love” is an ultralight beam of gospel choirs, piano chords, and half-rapped croons doused in Auto-Tune. Except Octavian isn’t reaching for a higher power, unless you consider hooking up a holy moment. “Skrrt away from them man like a ’Rari,” he wills a potential sweetheart from the other side of the room. The unlikely combination of music and lyrics works, if only for its audacity. Still, there can be a captivating precision to Octavian’s performance. “Molly Go Down” plays like a druggy lurch around an empty house at 4 a.m., slowing time as he slurs out lines like, “I take molly to slow down.” It’s in these instances that Octavian shows his voice—raspy, heavily accented—to be his most potent weapon. Some missteps remain. The tail end of “Walking Alone,” where he croons formlessly over an electric guitar, could have been nixed. The light dancehall beat of “World” is too translucent to leave much of an impression. But there’s enough here to affirm what we already knew: Octavian has carved out his own distinct corner of British rap. On Endorphins, he asserts his artistic flexibility without diluting his natural gifts.","The rising London rapper flexes his versatility with a musically diverse set that feels more like a major studio debut than the mixtape it’s billed as.

Long Live Mexico,Lil Keed,by: Alphonse Pierre,Staff Writer ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d0405f6b25f8695ad4f773c/1:1/w_160/longlivemexico_lilkeed.jpg,2019-06-20 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lil-keed-long-live-mexico/,Young Stoner Life300,"Every week, Lil Keed logs onto Instagram and spends countless hours giving fans glimpses of him recording and playing unreleased music. Fans with Young Thug avatars flood the comments with fire and snake emojis, then subsequently rip the clip and pass the snippet around social media. Since Keed emerged with his promising but ultimately undercooked 2018 mixtape Keed Talk to ’Em, the public’s relationship with the 21-year-old has been mainly through snippets. It’s a release strategy that helps rappers maintain relevance year-round and for some, like the leaked snippets of Playboi Carti, it is often the only way we experience their music. In recent months, Lil Keed has been essentially creating his debut album Long Live Mexico in real time on Instagram, building on melodies and deliveries indebted, as always, to Young Thug. Until late last year, Lil Keed was little more than a serviceable, occasionally special, replacement Thug. Understandable, given that Keed grew up idolizing and mimicking Thug in the same Cleveland Avenue apartments in which both were raised. But on Long Live Mexico, Keed uses elements of Thug’s versatile set of flows as a foundation to build off of, specifically the high-pitched, mush-mouthed delivery. One of the album’s best tracks, “Million Dollar Mansion,” finds both rappers side by side over an airy Pi’erre Bourne beat that belongs in a dystopian sci-fi flick. Thug’s flow is squeaky-high and eccentric, while Keed’s is at a similar pitch but more subtle, eliminating Thug‘s quirkiness. Those differences don’t make Keed sound better or worse in comparison to his mentor; instead, he finally emerges as his own entity. Despite the daunting 20-track length, Lil Keed’s delivery is hardly ever tiring. His ability to easily change pace makes it appear like he’s trading bars with a guest, like on the first verse of “Real Hood Baby” as he raps about the designer brands in his wardrobe. “Just a Dream” adds a whispery touch to his melody, despite his controversial anti-hug stance: “Yeah, I go savage mode, ho, fuck your hugs.” His hypnotic vocals make the album breeze by, though a portion of the credit belongs to his ear for selecting dreamy production. On “Snake,” the PyrexTurnMeUp and CuBeatz guitar instrumental is soothing, while Keed sounds like he recorded his verse after inhaling helium. But the album’s best beat is by JetsonMade, who pairs a mellow flute with his signature distorted bass on “Oh My God.” It’s also one of Keed’s strongest lyrical outings: “She like them Percocet things because of me/Got drugs heal pain for me/Told her drugs heal pain, but don’t OD,” he says, taking an introspective look at his own habits. The perennial downfall of an hour-long album is the filler, the ones that could be left off. The “Make U Proud” instrumental sounds like a demo version of Omarion’s “Post to Be” and “Proud of Me” is similarly outdated, which makes sense given it’s a leftover 2015 Young Thug leaked snippet that Keed repackaged. But the one miraculous part about “Proud of Me”—and Long Live Mexico—is that now when Keed digs through Thug’s past for inspiration, he manages to sound like a new artist all his own.","The Atlanta rapper finally steps out of Young Thug’s shadow and showcases his own style and versatility.

Am I Who I Am,PTU,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cfe6784b6e2e3310cc9d0df/1:1/w_160/AmI_PTU.jpg,2019-06-20 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ptu-am-i-who-i-am/,Trip,"The music of Russian producers PTU is a ragtag collage, the gleeful antidote to sensibly beige tech-house or the cynical opportunism of corporate EDM. Originally from the southwestern city of Kazan, the duo of Alina Izolenta and Kamil Ea found wider attention thanks to star DJ Nina Kraviz, who included their track “A Broken Clock Is Right Twice a Day” on her stellar fabric 91 mix. There, its tightly wound mixture of found sound, thumping drums, and kaleidoscopic IDM suggested a brilliantly overactive musical imagination. PTU take no great innovative leaps on Am I Who I Am, their debut album for Kraviz’s трип (Trip) label—rather, they ride roughshod over the usual boundaries. Their idea-rich sound is packed with details borrowed from four decades of electronic music: a breakbeat here, a rave squelch there, and a healthy sprinkling of oddball found sound and jacking-techno vigor. PTU’s production largely relies on dancefloor fundamentals like galloping BPMs, distorted four-to-the-floor kick drums, and abrasive synths. But in a genre famed for repetition, their hyperactive tracks refuse to sit still. Ideas that would form the backbone of other producers’ EPs are tried, tested, and tossed aside as PTU scramble for new pastures. Their frenetic approach is more techno egg-and-spoon race than tech-house marathon, a crazed trolley dash to EDM’s efficient weekend shop. The 12 tracks on Am I Who I Am slip by in 45 giddy minutes, with little opportunity for tail-chasing repetition. “I Heard You Breathe” teases a breakbeat that rings tantalisingly out of reach, like the bell of a sunken ship that can be heard only at low tide. “How Does It Feel” drops a jittery jazz sample that lasts just 20 seconds, but its use is telling; like jazz musicians, PTU are improvisers, and their music crackles with the unstable energy of spontaneity. As a result, they tend to move in zigzags. “Skyscript” lurches from straight-ahead four-four beats into a nightmarish coda where an organ drones in anguished stupefaction. “Over” begins with a bouncing Joey Beltram hoover riff, which is then abandoned in favor of moody bass surges and the tinkle of a triangle, before being overtaken by a strangulated vocal chorus. Not until a minute in does the track find its feet, kicking into propulsive techno. But PTU don’t just have any old ideas. They have great ones, packing Am I Who I Am with improbable sounds, intriguing blind alleys, and eyebrow-raising quirks. The wandering bass line and “Star Trek” door swoosh on “The Pursuit of a Shadow,” the cutlery rattle and chipmunk vocal on “Former Me,” and the ghostly spectre of polyrhythmic rave on “After Cities” are the work of two people in love with electronic sound. And yet this music is the opposite of a functional DJ tool. There’s nothing practical or workman-like about songs like “Over” and “Skyscript”; they are awkward, spiky, and strange, oddities held together by the kinetic energy of imagination.","The Russian duo’s frenetic approach is more techno egg-and-spoon race than tech-house marathon, packed with improbable sounds, intriguing blind alleys, and eyebrow-raising quirks.

Diaspora,GoldLink,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf156e22a3b7b6063fcc435/1:1/w_160/GoldLink-hq.jpg,2019-06-19 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/goldlink-diaspora/,Squaaash ClubRCA,"GoldLink’s 2017 album At What Cost was a monument to the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. It was a valiant attempt to capture the unwanted (read: gentrified) remnants of a lost city before it changed for good. But it wasn’t bitter about what was lost; it was hopeful about what it found. His second album, Diaspora, stretches outward. It pulls not just from across the music of the many displaced black communities the world over, as you might expect from the title, but follows the tendrils of influence back to Latin America and China. It is daring to follow your most local album with something so international, which just happens to be the best music of his career. Because this is a GoldLink album, the center of his diaspora is still D.C., and he can’t help but sneak in DMV locals from Gaithersburg (Bibi Bourelly), Capitol Heights (Lil Nei), and Woodbridge (WaveIQ), along with Virginia Beach’s Pusha T. But the album follows throughlines from D.C. to Los Angeles to London, then to Nigeria, closing the gaps between rap, R&B, Afrobeats, reggae fusion, and pop music in the process. GoldLink proudly stands in the middle of a tremendous musical legacy, honoring its many corners and the many people who represent them. “GoldLink,” as he says on the song “Yard,” “is a black work of art.” As such, Diaspora is first and foremost a confluence of black music; hip-hop tracing its way back to the universal sounds of Africa. The album doesn’t make rap feel global; this isn’t an attempt to unpack the sham “world music” genre. By connecting dots, it makes the world feel smaller. It’s another illustration of how the realm of black music is interconnected. With producers hailing from London, Los Angeles, Ghana, and Kenya, Diaspora is ambitious, expansive yet intimate, dutty wine-worthy, and slick. As the diaspora converges around GoldLink, he performs a heightened version of his patented stoicism. “Sold weed, sold pills, sold D, sold this, sold that/Look, I don’t wanna talk about it all/Seen fiends, seen death, seen shots, seen this, seen that/Look, I don’t wanna talk about it all,” he raps on “Maniac,” and his verses largely stick to that withholding pattern. There aren’t any metaphors. He isn’t setting up punchlines. It’d be inaccurate to call him a storyteller. He mostly raps in narrative told through epigrams and personal proverbs. The chronicles, which are all anecdotal, have lessons or tidbits baked into them. “Couple months ago, I was in the city on a date with a single ting/You’d prolly know her, and I never show, and she told me how she get security/But I always tell her, ‘I’m a hood nigga and this famous shit is new to me’,” he raps on “No Lie.” Some info is imparted as exposition; some the listener obtains second hand through dialogue. He’s never quite forthcoming, always concealing something, which is fitting for someone who kept his face hidden through much of his breakthrough. But his raps are bracing, and he is in complete command. Whether navigating the “Future Bounce” of his debut mixtape, Soulection’s “lo-fi beats to chill to” aesthetic, or the more intensely rhythmic music of the black diaspora, GoldLink nestles so deeply into the groove it’s as if he’s been sucked into a riptide. His flows are so painless they’re almost leisurely. That natural almost easygoing sense can be quite a juxtaposition with his hard knocks raps (“Turned 13, had my first stick/Ride around the city with the stolen whips/Fought niggas ’fore I had a first kiss”). He is a brass tacks rapper whose verses are nearly spartan in their presentations of his ever-changing life (“I done seen so many come, I done seen so many go/Pistol packing, then I started trapping, then I started rapping, then I blowed”), but his cadences are always poised, precise, and fluid. He’s swift when he has some margin but he’s even better in tight spaces, as on “U Say,” where he twirls between the polyrhythms like he’s jumping double dutch. Diaspora is simply further proof that there isn’t any beat he can’t zip his way through. It’s GoldLink’s ability to seem at home in any space that makes Diaspora so coherent, and so specific to him, despite pulling music from all over. He is the anchor. He is as snug next to Wizkid as he is with Khalid. He has Bibi Bourelly singing in Lingala on a song with British-Nigerian Afro-fusionist Maleek Berry. As “Coke White / Moscow” and “No Lie” rev up to bigger and sleeker second acts, he simply adjusts his default setting like he’s shifting into another gear. On “Rumble,” he is the bridge between his DMV roots and rap’s global impact: He brings together the extremely local Lil Nei and Got7 rapper Jackson Wang, a Hong Kong native working in the K-pop industry. These two wouldn’t be rapping together under any other circumstance. Working that unlikely pairing is undeniable proof of Diaspora’s ambition to harness rap’s power to integrate.","GoldLink’s second album stretches far beyond his home in the DMV. It is a confluence of black music; hip-hop tracing its way back to the universal sounds of Africa.

Nighttime Stories,Pelican,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf153e6b14512d0bf667249/1:1/w_160/Pelican_NighttimeStories.jpg,2019-06-19 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pelican-nighttime-stories/,Southern Lord,"Nighttime Stories is Pelican’s adult album, a direct confrontation with those existential milestones their music once merely suggested through its tension and scope. Family, grief, distance—all are now active components in their songs. The four members of the instrumental metal band are split between their native Chicago and Los Angeles, so they had to schedule blocks of time to hammer out new material together in person. Between sessions, they communicated through a Dropbox folder of fragments and jams and stray recordings from phones—the creative equivalent of a group text with old friends, where you reminisce and make plans that may never actually happen. It’s been six years since the band’s last album, Forever Becoming, and you sense that it’s all been something of a blur. But if growing up is often a process of coming down, then Pelican are still focused on finding transcendence in subtle places. Their music has always thrived on patience—a virtue that makes aging gracefully feel like a seamless evolution. The benchmark of their current sound is the warring, restless interplay of guitarists Trevor Shelley de Brauw and Dallas Thomas, whose soaring fretwork conveys the emotional candor that most metal acts seek from their vocalists. On Nighttime Stories, they push each other toward aggressive textures they had abandoned after their earliest material. They’re accompanied by blast beats and pummeling rhythms, and they alternate between ragged solos and riffs that sound like they’ve been dragged from the lowest depths of sludge and doom metal. Through sheer volume or atmospheric intensity, it’s the sound of making up for lost time. Other songs absorb the quiet into their songwriting, lending their music a depth that feels haunted but dire. After an initial burst of songs characterized by concise, melodic crescendos, “It Stared at Me” arrives as a tangled bed of mood music, its spacious arrangement like the scene setting to a violent Western. When a slide guitar winds through the song’s final minute, it ushers in the record’s adventurous second half. The title track staggers and lurches toward a mid-song breakdown that searches for stability but only slips into further chaos. And while the epic “Full Moon, Black Water” embodies the longform template of their previous centerpieces, its gentle finale feels uncommonly emotional. Nighttime Stories plays like one seamless expression—its 50-minute runtime passes remarkably quickly—but it’s a statement heavy with meaning and memories. Jody Minnoch, a bandmate of Shelley de Brauw and drummer Larry Herweg in the band Tusk, died unexpectedly in 2014, and the album’s title was one of his last ideas. The low, mournful opening track, “WST,” features Thomas strumming an acoustic guitar that once belonged to his late father. These are specific tributes, but the whole record carries an unspoken aura of necessity. That their narratives proceed without lyrics only underpins the poignancy of their message—those implicit connections that go unspoken, the expressions that can be read only by people with an intimate understanding of one another. These relationships do not come easy and, if nurtured and maintained, will only intensify with time.","The instrumental metal quartet’s first album in six years grapples directly with loss and grief, channeling dueling guitars and pummeling rhythms into a dire, haunted sound.

The Complete Birth of the Cool,Miles Davis,by: Nate Chinen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d0a89e6c612b8d71c66356d/1:1/w_160/cover%20art-Miles%20Davis_The%20Complete%20Birth%20of%20the%20Cool.jpg,2019-06-19 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/miles-davis-the-complete-birth-of-the-cool/,Blue NoteUME,"“And right now, ladies and gentlemen, we bring you something new in modern music,” announces Symphony Sid Torin from the stage of the Royal Roost, a chicken shack turned bebop haunt on Broadway, near Times Square. “We bring you: Impressions in Modern Music, with the great Miles Davis and his wonderful new organization.” This introduction opens Side 3 of The Complete Birth of the Cool, a deluxe vinyl reissue of a modern-jazz touchstone that opened the door to sleek introspection and sophisticated aplomb and, fairly or not, was credited with the boom in 1950s cool jazz. Davis was only 22 at the time of the Royal Roost gig. Best known as the trumpeter who’d bravely succeeded Dizzy Gillespie in the Charlie Parker Quintet, he had been workshopping a less mercurial, more chamberlike strain of bop in collaboration with the brilliant arranger Gil Evans. Their experiments in form and mood, fleshed out in Evans’ New York basement apartment on 55th Street, expanded on ideas that had gestated in the Claude Thornhill Orchestra before the war. Thornhill’s signature was a delicate blend of timbres, with soft projection and virtually no vibrato—a far cry from the regimental blare of a garden-variety big band. Evans, who arranged for the orchestra, famously described its effect: “The sound hung like a cloud.” The unorthodox nonet that Davis brought to the Royal Roost in 1948—featuring bebop confreres like Max Roach (drums) and John Lewis (piano) as well as forward-thinking Thornhill alums like Lee Konitz (alto saxophone) and Gerry Mulligan (baritone saxophone)—did in fact represent “something new in modern music.” But as Symphony Sid’s next utterance implies, the ensemble wasn’t yet known by a catchy album title. Studio sessions for The Birth of the Cool were still months away, initiated by a Capitol Records producer, Pete Rugolo, who was persuaded by the gig. Those sessions would yield a series of 78-rpm sides in ’49 and ’50. The iconic moniker wouldn’t be attached to the project until a compilation album in 1957, touted on the LP jacket as “the classic recordings” that “launched a jazz era.” Which is to say that The Complete Birth of the Cool is a repackaging of a repackaging, informed at every stage by a canny awareness of its own cachet. Seventy years since the studio recording of The Birth of the Cool, we’re equipped to understand that phrase as a signifier of aura and intention in Davis’ multifarious career. A documentary film by that name premiered at Sundance this year. It’s also the title of a new children’s book. To state the obvious, that earlier tag, Impressions in Modern Music, has a lot less mystique; The Birth of the Cool, timed to coincide with the rise of hi-fi systems and the word “cool” as a lifestyle, had a title intrinsic to its success. The music itself is rightly considered a landmark and in this new edition, mastered from the analog session reels for the first time since ’57, its exquisite intricacies assume an almost tactile form. I’ve been listening closely to The Birth of the Cool for about as long as I’ve been listening to jazz. Hearing the new reissue on my turntable was a revelation: not so much a matter of “warmth,” as vinyl proponents often put it, but rather a function of spatial clarity. The slithery inner voicings of Evans’ orchestration—on both a lissome swinger like “Boplicity” and the intriguing highlight “Moon Dreams”—sound present and alive in a way they hadn’t before. Some sly, murmuring touches from the tuba and French horn are clearer in the mix, without diverting from the coherence of the whole. The other arrangements, mainly by Lewis and Mulligan, shine nearly as bright; there’s a unifying style that makes each piece seem like a room in a house, with Davis’ trumpet serving as a guide. (For a present-day listener, the only truly jarring moment may be “Darn That Dream,” a vocal feature for Kenny Hagood that evokes the bandstand customs of the big-band era.) Due to the limitations of the source material, there isn’t nearly as much improvement in the quality of the Royal Roost recordings, made on Sept. 4 and 18, 1948. (They first appeared in sanctioned form on a 1998 2-CD reissue, also titled The Complete Birth of the Cool.) So the primary selling point here is the superior sound of the studio material. The new set also features exemplary liner notes by Ashley Kahn, who connects all of the dots while preserving a big-picture narrative arc. Among the sources that Kahn quotes is the authoritative jazz critic Gary Giddins, who once wrote that The Birth of the Cool nonet went “straight from cult to classic,” at least among jazz cognoscenti. “Its musicians redesigned jazz in the ’50s,” Giddins goes on, “calming bop’s fevers, soothing its brow, bringing wreaths to its entombment.” Davis always expressed ambivalence on the subject of West Coast “cool jazz,” which made stars out of Mulligan, trumpeter Chet Baker and others. There was a racial dynamic at play in the popularity of the style, and Davis wasn’t one to let such matters slide. “Birth of the Cool came from black musical roots,” he asserts, maybe a touch defensively, in Miles: The Autobiography, first published in 1989. “It came from Duke Ellington. We were trying to sound like Claude Thornhill, but he had gotten his shit from Duke Ellington and Fletcher Henderson.” At the same time, it’s worth noting how harmoniously the nonet functioned as an integrated unit. Davis heard complaints from black musicians about that, as he recalls in his book: “I just told them that if a guy could play as well as Lee Konitz I would hire him every time, and I wouldn't give a damn if he was green with red breath.” (Listen to Konitz’s harmonically daring and hummingbird-quick alto saxophone solo on “Israel,” a John Carisi tune, and the remark will make perfect sense.) In his notes, Kahn also consults with arranger Ryan Truesdell, a leading authority on Evans, who elucidates the quantum leap of a track like “Boplicity,” in which “all the inner parts have strong melodies, much in the way you would write for strings, which brings out the strength, warmth, and color of the piece.” The Birth of the Cool not only opened the next lyrical phase in bebop’s evolution; it also foretold the expansive Davis-and-Evans collaboration realized on albums like Porgy and Bess (1959) and Sketches of Spain (1960)—feats of synthesis between jazz and symphonic music, often hailed as emblematic triumphs for the classical-jazz hybrid known as Third Stream. Davis himself regarded them as high-water marks in his recorded career. And yet it would be an error to categorize The Birth of the Cool as a document of transition. The “birth” in the title may have been a marketing flourish, but this music did signal a new set of possibilities for modern jazz, while establishing Davis as a savvy bandleader and a leading trumpeter. The unhurried calm in his phrasing as he improvises on “Move,” the brisk opener, could be seen as a statement of intent. Even in the most boppish of circumstances, with Max Roach swinging fast behind him, Miles is going to set his own terms: unharried, unhurried, and yes, fundamentally cool. Whatever this album prefigured in his career, and in the modern-jazz discourse, it should take a backseat to an experience of the music. As this new reissue only helps clarify, The Birth of the Cool stands very much on its own—not as a counterargument or a checkpoint, but a singular achievement unto itself.","A modern-jazz touchstone that opened the door to the sleek introspection and sophisticated aplomb of 1950s cool jazz gets an exquisite and essential vinyl reissue.

Become Desert,John Luther Adams,by: Matthew Strauss,News Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf82ea3a8350abf23696563/1:1/w_160/BecomeDesert_JohnLutherAdams.jpg,2019-06-19 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/john-luther-adams-become-desert/,Cantaloupe,"John Luther Adams has long been a naturalist outsider to the insular world of classical music. In 2014, he won the Pulitzer Prize for Music for Become Ocean, an orchestral piece that rumbles and bursts and flutters, pointedly bringing to mind the shifting tides of the sea. Become Desert is Adams’ sequel to his mammoth Ocean. The piece offers a calmer and more inviting journey than its predecessor. Desert is wide and expansive with a stillness that makes it the most forgiving piece of Adams’ Become trilogy, which also includes the intricate and winding Become River. Across Desert, Adams explores resonance and the way sounds mutate, stick in our heads, or just disappear. A high-pitched ringing may stick around so long that you forget it’s gone when it’s morphed into another note. Sometimes that noise comes from a chorus of women singing “luz;” other times it’s violins holding a placid tone. It’s not the sort of place you want to sit and think, as may be the case with genre-tagged “ambient music.” But there’s also not the underlying dread present in Ocean. Instead, Desert offers some intangible glimmering: Bells and chimes ring only to plop away; horns swell gently but don’t linger. It doesn’t sound designed to exist for very long. There’s a moment midway through Desert that recalls the “Sunrise” movement of Richard Strauss’ Also sprach Zarathustra. The Seattle Symphony, however, dampens the drums and brass for a much humbler evocation of sunrise. It’s emblematic of the piece as a whole: The nature that John Luther Adams wants to conjure is real, not some imagined fantasy of the outdoors to symbolize the human condition. Humanity is not built to survive the desert for long stretches. An orchestral piece about the desert should, Adams’ music suggests, reflect the inability to conquer vast swaths of arid land. A darkness surrounded John Luther Adams’ Become Ocean. Strings quivered and crescendoed as drums rolled beneath them, instilling a sense of danger. The piece has lighter moments, but they’re quickly washed away by louder passages, as when piano roars behind the horns and strings. Hearing Ocean now highlights how restrained Desert is. The various instruments become indistinguishable at times, as if they’ve all decided to float together at a higher plane instead of crashing together from all different directions to envelop the listener. Even at its loudest, Desert does not feel menacing. John Luther Adams has assessed nature’s extremes. There’s the ocean, which is inspiring and life-giving. But it’s also a beast, an unpredictable entity that will swallow you whole if you’re not careful. And now with the desert, Adams is reverent in his portrayal, reflecting the landscape’s openness and the ephemera that may flit in and out of the frame. With Become Desert, Adams portrays a respectful image of the world, full of beauty yet unknowable.","The Pulitzer Prize-winning composer’s latest installment in his Become trilogy is expansive and inviting. The piece explores resonance and the way sounds mutate, stick in our heads, or just disappear.

Madame X,Madonna,by: Rich Juzwiak,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ceed24dfa43fdeff80684ea/1:1/w_160/Madonna_MadameX.jpg,2019-06-18 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/madonna-madame-x/,Live NationInterscopeMaverick,"There is a case to be made for classifying Madonna, in 2019, as an underdog. Granted, it requires overlooking the superstar’s grotesque wealth and enduring ability to command some sort of an audience with every public move. But her status as a pop star has degraded considerably in the last 15 years. Whereas they once inspired awe, or at least controversy, her live televised appearances of late tend to yield mockery. Her days of hit-making seem long behind her. Her last album, 2015’s Rebel Heart, was a mess with more tracks and less to say than any Madonna record that preceded it. Apathy ensued. It seems that Madonna, once queen of pop and enforcer of the regimentation that comes with that, is no longer controlling her narrative. This was never more evident than in her denouncement of a recent New York Times Magazine profile by journalist Vanessa Grigoriadis, who Madonna dragged in an Instagram post for focusing on “trivial and superficial matters” such as her age. “It makes me feel raped,” wrote Madonna, echoing a contentious comment she made to Grigoriadis about her reaction to several Rebel Heart tracks leaking months before she had completed the album. The magazine perhaps leaned too heavily into the age thing—the article, after all, was titled “Madonna at Sixty.” But of course Madonna’s age is relevant to her current story because it reminds us that her career path has always been one of uncharted territory. Today, the question is what does a veteran who redefined pop stardom for decades do in her 60s? Even she doesn’t seem sure on her muddled 14th album, Madame X. Convoluted in sound and concept, it is intended as a means for both dissociation and the reaffirmation of Madonna’s multitudes. “Madame X” was a nickname given to her at 19 by her dance instructor, the legendary Martha Graham. “That was in the beginning of my career when I didn’t think about who I should be or what I should be,” Madonna told Billboard in May. In recent press, her wariness of public scrutiny after almost four decades of stardom is palpable: “I preferred life before phone,” she told Grigoriadis regarding the internet’s consistently shabby treatment of her. You can see why she yearns for a clean slate. Hear her pining in the opening lines of Madame X’s first single, “Medellín”: “I took a pill and had a dream/I went back to my 17th year.” At the same time, Madame X is a secret agent, a dancer, a professor, a head of state, a nun, a housekeeper, and several other things, according to Madonna’s video announcement of the album. Later, she clarified: “I embody all of those people but then I also use those people to the extreme in the form of Madame X as a disguise to do my work.” Excepting the specific eccentricities here (such as referring to Madame X in the third person on Twitter and the fashion eye patch), the Madame X concept is the most recent example of a marketing trope in which divas use real nick- and middle names to thematically signal that they are revealing more sides of themselves than they previously allowed (see: Mariah Carey’s Mimi, Janet Jackson’s Damita Jo, and Beyoncé’s Sasha Fierce). Needless to say, these exercises are rarely illuminating even when the accompanying music is good. It’s a lot of puffery for business as usual—so much that it’s tempting to give Madonna a pass for trying. Madonna and her collaborators (chiefly Mirwais who co-helmed much of 2000’s Music and 2003’s underrated American Life) recorded in several different countries, marrying genres as disparate as Portuguese fado, baile funk, Cape Verdean batuque, and good old American trap to make a literal, at times clinical, rendering of world music. Madonna’s astonishing work ethic is written all over her voice: she raps, she sing-raps, she sings (in English, Spanish, and Portuguese). She has crafted a motif of did-they-or-didn’t-they sexual intrigue to accompany two collaborations with hunky Colombian superstar Maluma. Madonna and company have produced the shit out of virtually every notion here. But blatant ambition has an unfortunate way of accentuating failure. In what could be most charitably described as delirious exuberance, many of Madame X’s songs trip all over themselves to change course and offer something new every few seconds for the attention-span deficient. Consequently, they often fall flat as an adolescent’s self-conscious contrivances of weirdness—the 808 gloom of “Dark Ballet” gives way to an interpolation of Tchaikovsky’s “The Nutcracker Suite: Dance of the Reed-Flutes” done in the heavily synthesized style of Wendy Carlos’ score for A Clockwork Orange. It is horrendous. On “God Control,” Madonna’s mumble-rap intro begets a creepy children’s chorus, which begets ersatz disco whose strings are in perpetual flights of fancy, which begets Madonna affecting a cheesy I’m Breathless-era accent to rap about not smoking dope using the meter of De La Soul’s “Me, Myself & I.” Oh, and the song’s theme is roughly: “something…something…gun control.” This is supposed to be fun, but it’s exhausting. Thematically, there are some vague references to civil unrest and social justice, but for the most part, Madame X is lyrically inarticulate. The grave “Killers Who Are Partying” opens with some unintentional comedy: Madonna referring to gay people as “the gay” (“I will be gay, if the gay are burned”) as if they’re elk or something. Over a shivering fado acoustic guitar and light four-on-the-floor pulse, she aligns herself with a litany of persecuted identities—people of Africa, Muslims, Israel, children—to gesture empathy without an iota of practicality. “I will be poor, if the poor are humiliated,” she sings. But no, she won’t. The poor are humiliated, and she will be wealthy for the rest of her life. The only functional implication here is to remind us of Madonna’s benevolence—the only thing this song actually expresses is an image. Meanwhile, “Future,” begins with the line, “You ain’t woke.” Madonna sings this over a dubby Diplo beat as Quavo weaves in and out of her lines for punctuation (and eventually delivers one of his all-time least inspired verses). Madonna warbles through Auto-Tune and adopts a contemporary hip-hop posture that ends up just sounding like a flat sort of honking out of her nose. It’s not so much that she’s riffing on hip-hop that’s the problem (we’re not going to solve appropriation with one Madonna album, especially when it’s rampant); it’s that she’s being smarmy as she does it. And look: Madonna’s always gonna Madonna. She’s always going to put her twist on culture to which she has no legitimate claim. From her first record’s dabbling in post-disco boogie to voguing to new jack swing to her Eastern philosophy-and-fashion period to revolutionary posturing to trying on Timbaland’s and Pharell’s space-age takes on R&B: Sharks bite, Madonna appropriates. Her pop exists to exploit and sand off edges, packaging esotericism for the masses. It’s just that on Madame X, she is not merely dining out on other cultures; she’s whipping around drive-thrus. Perhaps some find this sort of pretense charming, as she plays peek-a-boo with a tabla on “Extreme Occident,” describing globetrotting, feeling lost, not being lost, and then resolving that, well: “Life is a circle.” But it seems absurd to grade a superstar on a curve and to forgive her hackneyed attempts at depth simply because of who she is. There’s a distinct tension between Madame X’s idiosyncrasies and its commercial aspirations. The best-case scenario for striking the balance is the first single “Medellín,” a sugary reggaeton cocktail shared with Maluma. The song’s beat slowly fades in and intensifies, like a great idea. But not enough of these songs are good enough to justify overlooking their imperialism, and the ones that are—the rickety, triplet-drunk “Come Alive” and “I Don’t Search I Find,” a loosely structured workout with chunky ’90s house percussion that sounds like it was ripped from The Rain Tapes—aren’t quite as extreme in their cultural pilfering. The worst-case scenario is “Crave,” a mid-tempo trap ballad with Swae Lee that sounds like a naked attempt to score Madonna her own “We Belong Together.” The singing is flat as a denial, and the lyrics are all tell, no show: “My cravings get dangerous,” Madonna warns without even the smallest sense of danger in the vicinity besides falling asleep at the wheel. What is she even talking about? If you’ve cared about Madonna in the past, but aren’t currently viewing her through rose-colored standom, she presents an exhausting challenge: Rooting for her when you know she has done (and probably could do) better. At her height, Madonna was a great persuader who could convince you of her dominion over whatever she took on. But as her career stretches on and she finds herself in the position of niche artist, her large-scale projects have the one-way intimacy of a rich friend who drags you with her to a boutique and makes you watch her try on clothes that will sit in the back of her closet for the few months before they’re donated. Life is short; aren’t we all getting a little too old for this?","Madonna’s 14th album feels stretched thin all over the globe, layered with an ambitious concept that ends up muddled and convoluted.

Klaus Nomi,Klaus Nomi,by: Sean T. Collins,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ceff385f2bde63a03aada8f/1:1/w_160/KlausNomi_KlausNomi.jpg,2019-06-18 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/klaus-nomi-klaus-nomi/,Real Gone,"Klaus Nomi is an easy artist to eulogize. The German-born East Village fixture’s striking, self-made look and soaring operatic countertenor—in layman’s terms, he sang really, really high—brought him to the attention of culture vulture supreme David Bowie. Nomi famously performed with the Thin White Duke on “Saturday Night Live,” hoping for a full collaboration that never materialized. A deal with Bowie’s label RCA, however, enabled Nomi to release two albums abroad before his death, from complications due to AIDS, in 1983. From ANOHNI’s angelic warble to Janelle Monáe’s sci-fi tuxedos, it isn’t hard to find Nomi’s legacy in pop’s outer reaches. Klaus Nomi, his 1981 debut album, affords us an entirely different opportunity: celebrating Nomi’s music rather than his myth. When an album’s repertoire goes from Man Parrish to Chubby Checker to Camille Saint-Saëns, it’s hard to look anywhere but the music. As beautiful as Nomi was, it’s worth peeling your eyes away from the ghost-white makeup, mountain-range hairstyle, and Tristan Tzara tux to see the truly gifted musician beneath. A trio of pop covers displays Nomi’s interpretive range even within narrow bounds. Take his handling of Lou Christie’s cloying AM radio hit “Lightnin’ Strikes” as a starting point. (Here it’s titled “Lightning Strikes”; the informal contraction feels beneath Nomi’s dignity.) Working off an arrangement by Kristian Hoffman that plays the song relatively straight, Nomi uses his piercing voice to subvert the lyrics’ smarmy, swinging-bachelor heteronormativity—hearing Klaus Nomi sing “Every boy wants a girl” is never not funny—and the very idea that America’s postwar culture comprised the full range of human experience. But in covering Lesley Gore’s teen-feminist anthem “You Don’t Own Me,” Nomi lets the power of the original do most of the talking for him. From his pointed delivery of “Don’t say I can’t go with other boys!” to singing “I’m free and I love to be free” even higher than Gore did, he’s simply making the same points in a shifted context. There’s more that unites his struggle and Gore’s than divides them. “The Twist,” which via Chubby Checker became one of the biggest dance crazes of all time, gets a much more thorough reimagining. Nomi slows it down into a bass-driven space-out, using his upper range and Germanic diction to make one of the most overplayed songs of all time sound disorientingly unfamiliar: “Come on humans,” he science-fictionalizes, “let’s doooooooo the Twist!” By the time you realize he’s transforming the original song’s subtext into text, turning Checker’s hip-shaking anthem into an alien’s plea to understand what we humans call “sex,” it’s already too late! Nomi’s originals also show an impressive thematic and tonal scope. Suffused in ominous synth washes by electro godhead and frequent Nomi collaborator Man Parrish, “Keys of Life” is the most Bowiesque thing on the record. A message from an otherworldly visitor that’s both messianic and apocalyptic in intent, it’s his “Oh! You Pretty Things,” “Ziggy Stardust,” and “Station to Station” all rolled into one. “Nomi Song,” by contrast, is a much warmer affair, a tender self-portrait of a man desperately and doubtfully seeking acceptance (“If they saw my face, could I still take a bow?”), while “Wasting My Time” feels like a rejoinder from the woman to whom the cad in “Lightning Strikes” was singing infidelity’s praises. Finally, the nuclear panic of “Total Eclipse” wouldn’t feel out of place on a Devo record, except of course for the singing. Terror about the seemingly inevitable atomic apocalypse was thick on the ground in those early Reagan years, but Nomi was one of the few artists who could sound like an air-raid siren when he sang about it. Which is not to say the song’s sentiment is at all dated. Exhibit A, the opening line: “Big shots argue about what they’ve got, making the planet so hot, hot as a Holocaust.” But the songs from Nomi’s operatic oeuvre, which open and close the album’s second side, are the showstoppers. “Cold Song” is based on an aria from baroque composer Henry Purcell’s King Arthur; the melody is evident in Giorgio Moroder, Michael Nyman, and Hans Zimmer’s themes for Scarface, The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, and The Crown respectively, but it’s forever Nomi’s. His daring transformation of the original bass vocals into his most urgent and terrifying countertenor work (“I can scarcely move or draw my breath/Let me, let me freeze again to death”) is a career pinnacle, as footage from a performance a few short months before his death demonstrates. Nomi’s rhapsodic, album-ending interpretation of Saint-Saëns’s “Mon cœur s’ouvre à la voix” aria, “Samson and Delilah,” is heartbreaking in a wholly different way. It’s a song about doomed love, sung from the perspective of the still-loving person who dooms it; Nomi embodied the role powerfully enough to poleaxe an audience full of cynical scenesters when it was part of his New Wave Vaudeville act. It’s this kind of multifaceted musical intelligence that belies any attempt to write Nomi off as a novelty act or one-trick pony. Depending on the context, Nomi’s singular voice could cut right to the bone of operatic compositions, drawing forth their desire and despair like some kind of glowing quicksilver ichor. Or it could make like an inverted-triangle tuxedo and turn the conventions of pop upside down, pointing out their inadequacies while celebrating their strengths. Yes, his voice, and yes, his look, and yes, his tragic story—you get it, I get it, we all get it. But he’s so much more than merely interesting. He was, and on this album he remains, a spectacle in the best sense. The album’s overwhelming impression is of outsized emotion, and that’s precisely the spectacular thing that Nomi’s spectacle was designed to convey.","A reissue of the Downtown fixture’s 1981 debut album is a reminder that despite his striking look, campy repertoire, and operatic range, the onetime Bowie collaborator was no novelty act.

CHORDS,Ellen Arkbro,by: Daniel Martin-McCormick,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cfe7d59f60560a11e4d3566/1:1/w_160/Chords_Arkbro.jpg,2019-06-18 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ellen-arkbro-chords/,Subtext,"The title of Ellen Arkbro’s CHORDS couldn’t be much more succinct—or accurate. Her longform compositions, first encountered on 2017’s stunning For organ and brass, consist entirely of rich harmonies rendered in obscure tuning systems, unfurled one at a time. Melody, rhythm, lyrics, and other beloved chestnuts we tend to enjoy in music are unflinchingly cast aside. Listening to Arkbro’s work means listening to chords and nothing else. If that sounds dull, or strict, or technical, then you haven’t heard these chords. Though in interviews Arkbro enthuses about high-functioning academic subjects like septimal intervals, the ultra-complex computer program SuperCollider, and “microtonal tuba,” her music is infused with a profound emotionality that transcends its heady origins. Passing through the gates of extreme rigor, CHORDS finds private infinity in a handful or stretched-out drones. The A-side returns to the organ with “CHORDS for organ.” Here the instrument is rendered bare and unaccompanied, and the first impression is one of scale—a mammoth stack of tones that swells, churns, and undulates in place. Notes are added and taken away with a technician’s cool remove. Sunn O)))’s Stephen O’Malley recently described the experience of working with frequency relationships as being akin to becoming a “witness to phenomena,” a comment that finds much purchase here. Arkbro’s cadence has a strikingly chunky quality; she plops each new harmonic shift down with the matter-of-factness of a butcher weighing meat. Yet this absence of romance or theatricality works in the music’s favor, allowing us to hear the depth and power of the organ without feeling manipulated or needled into some calculated epiphany. These austerity measures are a step or two away from her debut. Comparing the albums, CHORDS is notably more severe, and also more mercurial. For organ and brass at times recalled the muted yearnings of Arthur Russell’s Tower of Meaning, but CHORDS feels less expressive and more like a force of nature. It may inspire awe, dread, deep calm, or nervous discomfort, but that’s on you. The press release describes the album as built from a “carefully selected combination of tones,” but you get the feeling that the tones selected Arkbro, rather than the other way around. The longer you sit with them, the more they speak. On the B-side, Arkbro shifts her focus to the guitar, though it sounds particularly alien here. Could this be a function of tuning? Or has Arkbro returned to the world of software, where she worked until recently? We hear each string sounded one at a time, strummed with a dirge-like solemnity, in a languid cascade. The action is really in the decay, where the strings resonate together in beautiful stasis, though it doesn’t sweep you up with the same immediacy as her organ works, which essentially feel like limitless explorations of those same fading harmonies. I’m reminded of Morton Feldman’s search for “sourceless” sounds. “The attack of a sound is not its character,” held the composer. “Decay, however, this departing landscape, this expresses where the sound exists in our hearing—leaving us rather than coming towards us.” A piece built entirely out of these floating evaporations could be an experience. Though “CHORDS for guitar” moves in the direction of this mystery, it doesn’t quite arrive. It’s almost majestic, almost hypnotic, and almost feels sublimely empty, but not quite. This is not a blow to Arkbro’s work, however. Her debut showed a young artist composing with remarkable assuredness and clarity of vision, and CHORDS is a strong, occasionally astonishing next step. Give it a close listen and try to resist being entranced by the subtle, pulsating viscera of the A-side. A single note hangs in the air, oscillating with a sludgy tremolo. A second joins, and suddenly the interaction of the two causes a fluttering. But then there’s something below, a deeper moan, answered by the jackhammer drill of the next combination. Time seems to freeze as you sit there, parsing out this gentle paradox of stillness and movement. When Arkbro reintroduces a long-neglected lower octave—forget it. This could go on forever.","On the follow-up to her 2017 album For organ and brass, the Swedish composer delves even deeper into microtonal interplay, balancing heady theoretical terrain with a rare emotional resonance.

Cages,Redbait,by: Kim Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cd2f1c15a46c24edc097c10/1:1/w_160/Redbait_Cages.jpg,2019-06-18 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/redbait-cages/,New Age,"Punk has a long tradition of political soapboxing, whether an anti-Reagan screed or a howling demand for trans rights thinly cloaked behind a veil of distortion and d-beats. St. Louis metalpunk outfit Redbait, however, put their politics at the forefront of their music. They approach every note and syllable with unwavering intention, down to their self-identification as “proletarian crust” and the name “Redbait” itself—a thumbed nose to the right wing’s long history of smearing leftists. The idea for Redbait germinated not at a basement show or a bar, like so many other notable punk acts, but as their press materials note, at the “healthcare rallies, vegan potlucks, and protests against police brutality” where these six musicians initially got acquainted. The band’s members—vocalists Rebecca Redbait and Madeline B., guitarists Will J. and B., bassist Nicholas J., and drummer Cody A.—came up in the St. Louis activist community, and they apply that knowledge and praxis to their music. In a way, Redbait follow the lo-fi Crass model of politics—except they’ve also got riffs, and they can write the hell out of a catchy, confrontational punk song. Their latest EP, Cages, rails against racism, white supremacy, capitalism, wage slavery, factory farming, and, on the pummeling title track, the Trump administration’s brutal ongoing campaign to rip migrant children from their parents and pen them in concentration camps. “They use power to divide/Power to imprison/In a country so free it incarcerates children,” comes the song’s snarling climax, delivered in a duet of guttural roar and ragged shriek. The EP is stuffed with disparate influences and palpable rage, serving up five distinct and ambitious tracks in a blistering 13 minutes. Less is often more when it comes to punk, and despite Redbait’s obvious allegiance to the more metal (and historically more indulgent) side of the aisle, their commitment to brevity is admirable. Thanks to a brutally sludgy mid-song break, “Cages” is also the band’s most metal track, while on “Bred for the Knife,” a furious diatribe against the cruelties of factory farming, they soar to their breathless, Tragedy-referencing best. Redbait’s self-identification as “proletarian crust” works on multiple levels: Not only is Cages grounded in radical working-class politics, it’s also alive with the clang of machinery, the screech of grinding metal, and the smell of blood on the factory floor. Blink-and-you’ll-miss-it opener “Capital Gains” is more straightforward: The minute-and-change track rails against capitalist exploitation while charging along to the tune of mid-2000s thrash and swinging its knuckles like a mid-2000s pit boss (undoubtedly the only kind of boss Redbait recognize). The most personal track, “Forever Ends Now,” opens on a maudlin melodic note, its first stanza cleanly sung before a bolt of chaos kicks in to close out the EP. Elsewhere, the potent crust of “Our Town” offers an uptempo hometown anthem with teeth, skewering racist NIMBYs and name-dropping nearby Ferguson, Missouri: “Talk back to a cop/And you can lose your life/Shut it down!” Every generation of young punks needs its Dead Kennedys, its Crass, or its Anti-Flag; with any luck, Redbait might be this one’s.","The St. Louis metalpunks put their politics at the forefront of their music—except they’ve also got riffs, and they can write the hell out of a catchy, confrontational punk song.

Loom Dream,Leif,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ceebdc785a35d55e7e64b09/1:1/w_160/Leif_LoomDream.jpg,2019-06-17 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/leif-loom-dream/,Whities,"Baskerville Hall, a country hotel built in 1839 in the Welsh village of Clyro, is known for a few things. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of Hound of the Baskervilles, was a frequent guest at the inn. Paranormal enthusiasts believe the place is haunted. And every summer, it hosts Freerotation, a beloved, members-only affair where the hippie ethos of the 1990s free-party rave scene meets cutting-edge electronic music. Resident Advisor’s Will Lynch called it “600 friends knocking around a weird old hotel for three days—it feels more like a massive sleepover than a festival.” Leif Knowles has been playing Freerotation for years now, and his DJ sets there have become legendary for their range, their risk-taking, and their bucolic scene-setting, providing a fitting counterpart to the rolling green hills and rural idyll. With Loom Dream, he captures that spirit on vinyl. Leif, as he is known, has been putting out records since the early 2000s, his style gradually evolving from pert minimal house to freaky, futuristic bass music. Loom Dream is his third album, but it is his first ambient full-length—never mind that Whities, the label putting it out, is itself better known for forward-looking bass mutations. Just 34 minutes long, Loom Dream is the kind of mini-LP that is particularly suited to a certain, evocative strain of ambient music: not too short, not too long, but a Goldilocks-like, just-right length for catnapping and coming back up for air. Loom Dream’s tracklisting comprises six songs, but really the record plays out as a single suite of music, the tracks seamlessly joined by chirping birds, footfalls, and creamy swirls of reverb. Leif’s choice of sounds is faithful to the chill out room aesthetic that artists like Mixmaster Morris and the Orb pioneered in the late 1980s: Synthesizers waft through gentle delay chains while field recordings suggest a sense of place and submerged rhythms generate the subtlest forward motion. The record follows a loose botanical theme—its six tracks take their titles from plants and herbs like yarrow, borago, and myrtle—and between the omnipresent birdsong and lush textures, it’s easy to imagine that Loom Dream would make a lovely soundtrack to a supine half-hour in a sun-warmed glade. But Loom Dream can also be surprisingly (and impressively) intense. Leif’s pastel atmospheres frequently give way to deep, chest-quaking drums: layer upon layer of thrumming hand percussion, sub-bass rumble, and sampled kit. “Myrtus” is driven by quick, trilling marimba melodies, and in “Rosa,” faintly distorted thumb piano takes the lead. In “Borago,” pummeling floor toms accompany echoing blasts of choral voices, creating a mood that’s both stormy and majestic. Leif’s rhythmic instincts don’t just keep the music moving, they keep the vibe in constant flux, as time signatures shift and tempos vary. This dynamism helps set Loom Dream apart from its ambient contemporaries. Much like Brian Eno envisioned of ambient music, it is an emotional blank slate—the mood he evokes may be blissful, wistful, or simply serene, depending upon the listener’s headspace—but the constantly shifting grooves keep the record’s limited palette from getting stale. At the record’s end, he switches things up one more time: Over gossamer new-age chords, a steady drumbeat kicks up little clouds of dust that gradually swell into piercing dub-delay feedback; by the end, the sound is a strobing shriek, almost like a car alarm. It’s a suggestion, maybe, that rural idyll can’t last forever. Or maybe it’s just an appearance from one of Baskerville Hall’s ghosts.","A dreamy, bucolic ambient LP, full of lush textures and birdsong, along with a number of other pleasant surprises.

Jinx,Crumb,by: Ann-Derrick Gaillot,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cd082cdc13a45369de82576/1:1/w_160/Crumb_Jinx.jpg,2019-06-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/crumb-jinx/,self-released,"Obituaries and biographies often give the illusion that lives unfold along ever-advancing, if wandering, timelines. In fact, those forward trajectories are made up of millions of tiny spirals—routines followed, patterns performed, habits fallen into. Most days are slightly deviating copies of one another, with periodic breaths of novelty. On their debut full-length, Jinx, New York City psych-rock band Crumb give shape to the ambivalence and hypnosis of those lulling spirals, bending indie rock and jazz influences to shape a clear-eyed perspective tinted amber with dirt. Beckoning the listener with dreamy keyboards, twinkling guitar, and a recognizable buzz of stoic anxiety, Jinx rewards with the promise that within the dizzying haze are moments, turns in direction, worth waking up to. Crumb formed in 2015 while the group’s members attended university in Boston, and their first, self-titled EP realized songs that guitarist, vocalist, and lead songwriter Lila Ramani began writing as far back as high school. Crumb and 2017 follow-up Locket, both misty and meandering, cast the four-part group as the new kid on today’s jazz-influenced psych block, among bands like Tame Impala and King Krule. On Jinx, those free-jazz influences and arrangements—an affinity Ramani also flexes as a member of New York City experimental collective Standing on the Corner—remain, but there’s something decidedly murkier afoot. Embracing the analog-suffused production they dabbled in on past projects, Crumb’s debut offers a warm, hazy snapshot of banal existence from the inside out. Concealed emotion, strained facades, and the desire to break free from the numbness underlying both are recurring themes, but Jinx is no dense, depressing slog. Languid love song “Ghostride” sets a scene of passive action as Ramani, voice wavering at a dispassionate hum, observes her subjects moving through the world on autopilot. A moment of hope emerges as guitar and drums break to a higher register and she breathily sings, “Come on now/Don’t let this go/Don’t let the light fade away/People come/And people go/But I—.” With a shade of hesitancy, she cuts off the sentiment, not finishing until the chorus repeats with the final word, almost a pronouncement: “stay.” That longing for cloud-parting connection and devotion peek out through the album’s rises and falls. Crumb have a knack for entrancing the listener, only to then displace them with airy, twinkling release. Flashes of silence—abruptly muted guitar strums, complete rests—and Ramani’s penchant for spell-like repetition can warp time, one hallucinatory spiral suddenly interrupted by another, more promising one. The album’s hypnotic quality grows ever more romantic and tense with repeat listens, a prescient-feeling experience that matches a zeitgeist: strung-out maintaining in the face of impending doom. “This city is dense/And it makes me tense/And it makes me tense/And it never ends/And it never ends,” Ramani sings, her voice recessed by a gauzy filter, on “And It Never Ends.” How do we get off the eye-glazing treadmill of the day-to-day? In lieu of tidy answers, Jinx offers a sympathetic fellow witness to the mystery.

Years to Burn,CalexicoIron & Wine,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf7e06b7fd40d1664dba9e4/1:1/w_160/yearstoburn.jpg,2019-06-17 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/calexico-iron-and-wine-years-to-burn/,Sub Pop,"When Calexico and Iron & Wine released In the Reins, their first collaboration together, back in 2005, both bands were in a state of flux. Sam Beam had just released the Woman King EP, which added a few new musical twists to his disarmingly intimate acoustic songs, and he was two years away from releasing The Shepherd’s Dog, which would redirect the next decade of his music into ever more elaborate jazz-folk compositions. Meanwhile, Joey Burns and John Convertino were incorporating Latin American styles such as samba and cumbia, not to mention more vocalists and musicians, into an increasingly orchestral and cinematic sound. An indie-rock eon later, it’s easy to forget how new In the Reins sounded at the time, how it represented tentative steps forward by acts who would become tenacious music lifers. That 2005 mini-album becomes a useful point against which to measure both bands’ growth. If it sometimes felt like a great backing band and a great frontman working in parallel lanes, its successor Years to Burn mixes those roles up to reveal musicians who’ve learned to corral swarms of instruments and styles into a newly complex sound. Nowhere is that more apparent than on “The Bitter Suite,” which is not a Marillion cover but a musical triptych showcasing the various voices in this collaboration. It opens with Calexico trumpeter Jacob Valenzuela singing a Spanish-language overture, based on Beam’s lyrics about “exploring dreams wild enough to pass the time”—one of those Iron & Wine phrases that sounds straightforward but demands some unpacking. Fluidly the song morphs: first into a lowdown desert groove, its rhythms fraying at the edges, and then into a quiet finale, Beam and his deftly picked guitar commenting on what’s come before. The sections complement each other nicely but not too perfectly, creating just enough friction between them to catch a spark. Despite that hacky title, “The Bitter Suite” is certainly the most compositionally ambitious song either entity has released in years. Nothing else on Years to Burn complicates the equation quite so radically, although there are compelling flourishes and fresh twists on familiar tropes. Calexico invest “Father Mountain” with a kind of pop stomp, a performance that reinforces the catchiness of Beam’s hooks. Tracing the lifelong arc of a beleaguered relationship, opener “What Heaven’s Left” ratchets emotional tumult to a dusty country-soul arrangement that culminates in a coda where trumpets dance around each other, offering more hope and reconciliation than the lyrics extend. These two groups always intended to record a follow-up to In the Reins, and they’ve guested on each other’s subsequent albums. But it took them more than a decade to align their schedules, and Years to Burn might be better for that lifetime in between. Fittingly, it’s a record that’s all about time and how we measure it: against our own memories, against other people, again previous albums. “We only want a life that’s well worth living,” Beam sings on closer “In Your Own Time,” “and sleeping ain’t no kind of life at all.” Such a line might come across as too obvious if it didn’t sound so hard-learned, if the music surrounding it weren’t so imaginative. Comparing the two releases, it’s clear that Calexico and Iron & Wine have found a way over the years to leave a little more mystery in the words and let the music provide more of the clues.","It took more than a decade to follow up In the Reins, but its successor reveals musicians who’ve learned to corral swarms of instruments and styles into a newly complex sound.

TEARS IN MY HENNESSY,Joey LaBeija,by: Eric Torres,Editorial Producer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ceebfb8f2bde6032caad93c/1:1/w_160/JoeyLaBeija_TearsInMyHennessy.jpg,2019-06-17 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/joey-labeija-tears-in-my-hennessy/,Coming for Blood,"Bronx-born Joey LaBeija is a homegrown New York DJ, with diverse taste reflecting his city’s disparate communities. He’s a known quantity on the queer nightlife circuit—he previously co-hosted the defunct Techno Cumbia party, which put on shows by Bbymutha and LSDXOXO—and in his punkish, winking vision of club music, there is equal space for dembow, ballroom, rave, and techno. His first LP, 2016’s moody Shattered Dreams, slowed down the tempo to ruminate on themes of loss and death, rendering much of the music nondescript in the process. Luckily, LaBeija’s club bona fides are more discernible on TEARS IN MY HENNESSY, a breakup record on which he vacillates between sinewy club workouts and synth ballads to seek deliverance from a deteriorating relationship. As its melodramatic title suggests, TEARS finds LaBeija in a miserable headspace, self-medicating with alcohol and sex so as to not face the end of a crumbling romance with his boyfriend. LaBeija translates this heartache best when he writes in vivid, blunt terms; there’s brutal clarity to a line like “the way you fuck me feels like charity,” as he vents on the queasy, psychosexual synth centerpiece “charity.” Capped off by an extended garage breakdown, the song is an example of LaBeija firing on all cylinders, melding genres at breakneck speed à la his DJ sets while still carving out space for his own deeply personal revelations and experiences. That tendency, however, doesn’t extend to all of TEARS. “dial up affection” chugs over stuttering programmed beats, with LaBeija’s voice pitched up demonically high as he compares personal issues to computer errors. (Even with a Vocoder, no one can convincingly sell the stilted technobabble that is “Gateway timeout/Bandwidth limit exceeded/Time to force quit/All our pages are freezing.”) He one-ups it instantly with “simulated love,” which similarly pitch-shifts his voice for a paranoid club song that zeroes in on a simpler lyrical conceit: “Why do you wanna play with my emotions?/Simulated love just going through the motions.” Blown up in size with airhorn synths and twitchy beats, the song reshapes his frantic, increasing paranoia to better effect. TEARS succeeds elsewhere as well: The sawing industrial morass that envelops “wait” resembles Yves Tumor’s seething experimentation. He even recruits mid-’00s twin sister duo Nina Sky for the hook on R&B cut “dry your eyes,” amid skyward synth lines and pulsing 808s. And on the comparatively upbeat closer “animosity,” he seems to finally find a way out, offering up a bittersweet sense of altruism: “There is no animosity/Over your curiosity/You gotta do what’s best for you/So baby I’ma set you free.” It’s a generous outlook that sees him finally at peace, and the off-balance, rubbery synths and club-ready drums behind him reflect the changing mood. LaBeija may have lingering scars to carry, but on TEARS he wears them like armor: durable and, in their own way, life-saving.","The Bronx-born DJ melds genres at breakneck speed on a disconsolate and deeply personal breakup record.

Back in Black,AC/DC,by: Steve Kandell,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ce580d1f2bde617d5aad496/1:1/w_160/ACDC_BackInBlack.jpg,2019-06-16 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/acdc-back-in-black/,Leidseplein Presse B.V.,"For many bands, the sudden and horrific death of their lead singer at the peak of their popularity would be a career-ender. AC/DC took a few weeks to regroup and then recorded one of the biggest albums of all time. Back in Black is claimed in equal measure by the jocks, the stoners, the nerds, the delinquents, and the teachers. Nashville studios used it to test their acoustics. The title track boasts nothing less than one of the most gloriously elemental riffs ever devised—the perfection of the form, the ne plus ultra of jock jams, destined to be clumsily chunked out for eternity by teens testing fuzz pedals in God’s own Guitar Center. It might not necessarily be AC/DC’s best—if their career can even be measured in units of particular albums rather than one long, loud, continuous mid-tempo guitar riff spanning five decades. But it is their most album—most accessible, most successful, most enduring, most emblematic, and, given its genesis, most unlikely. In 1979, AC/DC had made the leap from workingman Australian hard-rock band, opening arena tours for the likes of Cheap Trick and UFO, to bona fide headliners in their own right. Highway to Hell—their seventh album in five years—had gone platinum in the U.S., thanks in large part to producer Robert John “Mutt” Lange, whose kitchen-sink ethos would define the sound of rock radio for the next decade. (Previous AC/DC albums had been produced by the legendary Australian songwriting duo of Harry Vanda and George Young, the latter of whom happened to also be the older brother of AC/DC guitarists Malcolm and Angus Young.) The success of the album cemented the image of the band as libidinous but harmless dirtbags, perfecting carnal anthems tuneful enough to attract normies seeking an edge and heavy enough to keep the metal faithful in line. Angus was as much mascot as musical director, a perpetual motion machine decked out in a schoolboy uniform, but ultimately less threatening than an actual teenager. Though not necessarily the band’s focal point, their lead singer was 33-year-old Bon Scott, a hard-partying, Scottish-born, impossible-voiced dynamo for whom the word impish was invented. He died alone in the passenger seat of a car on a freezing February night in London in 1980 following a night of drinking, having asphyxiated on his own vomit; authorities ruled it “death by misadventure.” The Young brothers retreated doing the only thing they knew how—coming up with shitloads of guitar riffs—then kicked off a search for Scott’s replacement in earnest almost immediately. Among the candidates to join the band were Australian rock mainstays like Jimmy Barnes and John Swan, as well as Stevie Wright, who’d been in George Young and Vanda’s band the Easybeats in the ’60s. It was Mutt Lange who recommended Brian Johnson, lead singer of British glam band Geordie and owner of a cat-in-heat vocal register that was unlike anyone’s other than, as luck would have it, Bon Scott’s. Johnson was 32 and living with his parents in Newcastle, in northern England, and running his own shop repairing the vinyl roofs of classic cars when he got the call to meet the band. “In the rehearsal room sat the boys of AC/DC, looking quite bored—they’d been auditioning singers for a month,” Johnson wrote in his 2009 memoir Rockers and Rollers. “When I walked in, I introduced myself and Malcolm said, ‘Ah, you’re the Newcastle lad,’ and promptly gave me a bottle of Newcastle Brown Ale. He said, ‘Well, what do you wanna sing.’ I told him ‘Nutbush City Limits’ by Tina Turner.” The next afternoon, Johnson got a call asking him to return, and that was that. AC/DC decamped to record their eighth album in the Bahamas, again with Lange, and were finished seven weeks later. By July, the album was out, nearly a year to the date after Highway to Hell, and about five months after Scott’s death. This would prove to be the most acrobatic mid-career personnel change in pop history. Although sketches of some songs had begun with Scott, Johnson was given free rein to write his own lyrics. Nothing strayed from the band’s tried and true formula of meditations on rocking and/or rolling. The first new song they did together would prove to be their biggest: “You Shook Me All Night Long” was a Top 40 hit, something that had eluded Scott-era AC/DC. While Back in Black is largely an extension of the things that worked on Highway to Hell, “You Shook Me All Night Long” was as close as the band could come to an outlier, yet never felt like pandering. It was a pure, melodic sing-along, and possibly the best to ever compare a vigorous sexual encounter to a car, a meal, and a boxing match all in three and a half minutes. The single’s success may have been thanks to beginner’s luck and inspired songwriting, or possibly an assist from beyond the grave. “I remember sitting in my room writing that and I had this blank sheet of paper and this title and I was thinking, ‘Oh, what have I started?’” Johnson said in 2000. “I don’t give a fuck if people believe me or not, but something washed through me and went, it’s alright son, it’s alright. This kind of calm. I’d like to think it was Bon, but I can’t because I’m too cynical and I don’t want people getting carried away.” But that was as far as Johnson would color outside AC/DC’s pre-drawn lines. He did not try and will the band into some sort of new direction or bend them to his taste. The degree to which the transition felt seamless was a triumph of branding as much as human resources: The idea of AC/DC prevails over any one song or album, but Back in Black happens to be the moment when that idea found its purest form and its widest purchase. If someone says “AC/DC,” you will think of the logo before you think of anything else, and Johnson’s fast acceptance and immersion, without any appearance of ghoulishness or greed, was the ultimate validation. His omnipresent tweed newsboy cap quickly became as central to the band’s iconography as Angus’ schoolboy getup. His voice may have lacked Scott’s nuance and character—a belt sander with one less speed—but there is no way of knowing how many people who embraced Back in Black in 1980 didn’t even realize there was a new singer. It definitely wasn’t zero. Back in Black doesn’t ignore Scott’s passing but isn’t maudlin or cautionary— you can’t spell death by misadventure without adventure. “Hells Bells” opens the album with the clanging of the one-ton iron bell the band had custom-made to bring on tour, but that is as mournful as things get. Johnson howls, “You’re only young but you’re gonna die,” more as permission than warning before genially big-upping Satan and coming down squarely on the side of tempting fate in the name of a good time, of celebrating the abyss rather than stepping away from it. Five tracks later, “Back in Black” is similarly defiant—“Forget the hearse ’cause I never die”—but that is pretty much it for discussion of mortality beyond the tacit assumption that the bereaved want to fuck, too. “Have a Drink on Me,” a gleeful ode to getting absolutely hammered, might be an odd choice for a band whose previous singer just drank himself to death, but Back in Black was not meant to be a reckoning, it was meant to be a reaffirmation. Helping matters was the fact that AC/DC were funny, almost always intentionally. “Givin’ the Dog a Bone” is half an entendre short of a double entendre but thanks to its big, fat chorus of layered background vocals, you laugh even if you think you know better. AC/DC seemed to invite absurdity: The T-shirts sent to be sold at the North American tour’s first stop in Edmonton were all misprinted as “BACK AND BLACK.” They didn’t walk the fine line between stupid and clever, they drew it. A year later, the one-ton “Hell’s Bells” bell was replaced by the “For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)” cannon, keeping the streak of acquiring heavy antique iron totemic metaphors alive. Lange returned for a third and final time and 1981’s For Those About to Rock hit No. 1, something that Back in Black did not do. Their 1976 album Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, which had not been released in the U.S., was, finally, in the wake of Back in Black’s success, giving Bon Scott a proper posthumous bow at the considerable risk of confusing new fans. A band that was on the brink of oblivion instead became the paragon of consistency and longevity for another four decades. There is no such thing as a bad AC/DC song. You can certainly not like an AC/DC song, which would then mean you probably don’t like any AC/DC songs, which is fine. But none of them really fail at what they intend to do and they all intend to do more or less the same thing. Some turns of phrase are less dunderheaded than others, some riffs make their point more indelibly than others. They didn’t really have an experimental phase unless you count the bagpipes in “It’s a Long Way to the Top,” but that wasn’t really an experiment because it totally worked. There were no ballads, no curveballs, no symphonies, no DJ remixes, no synths or pianos, no unplugged sessions, no cute covers, no BIG HAIR. Their greatest hit features the line, “You told me to come but I was already there” and may have been co-written by a ghost. They were the Ramones chopped and screwed, and similarly frozen in amber, eternally wearing their teenage uniforms. Beyond the tens of millions of copies sold, it is easy to overlook the legacy of something like Back in Black. The album didn’t signify any sort of change or cultural marker; it instead proved the power of stasis, of doing something well, then doing it again but louder and with more money. In a sense, the success of Back in Black helped predict the current reboot moment: Give the people what they want, but more. The music does not feel of any time or place; it means now what it meant then. The record’s ultimate legacy comes less from the artists it influenced or even the songs that remain staples of whatever is left of commercial rock radio than in its confirmation that evolution can be an overrated quality. And, as ever, AC/DC were their own best messengers for this simple idea, laid bare in the final moments of their most famous work: “Rock’n’roll ain't no riddle, man.”","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit the classic rock staple from a band who rebounded from tragedy to record one of the biggest albums ever made.

Black Star Dancing EP,Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cdd9b3493a536324c1edc52/1:1/w_160/NoelGallaghersHighFlyingBirds_BlackStarDancing.jpg,2019-06-15 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/noel-gallaghers-high-flying-birds-black-star-dancing-ep/,Sour MashUniversal,"For a guy whose rock’n’roll values skew so traditional his name is practically a synonym for Dad Rock, Noel Gallagher has long harbored a desire to break free from his six-string. Black Star Dancing—an EP named after a single he released in early May—arrives accompanied by a self-generated torrent of hype that climaxed with Noel claiming Nile Rodgers “literally danced in the studio” when he heard the song. These proclamations suggest the EP offers something new, but the truth is Gallagher has always dabbled in dance culture. He came of age during the glory days of Baggy, the heady time when rock, dance, and electronica came together as one during the paisley-pulsating fever dream dubbed the second summer of love. The earliest Oasis records were smothered in loud guitars, but Gallagher’s magpie songwriting wasn’t far removed from the sampledelica of hip-hop and acid house at the dawn of the ’90s. Once he became a superstar, he happily collaborated with the Chemical Brothers for “Setting Sun,” a 1997 hit that pulverized the Beatles’ “Tomorrow Never Knows” through a Big Beat filter. From there, Gallagher tentatively threaded drum loops and extraneous electronica onto Oasis albums, a process he continued with Noel Gallagher’s High Flying Birds, the group he formed in 2011 once he finally had his fill of navigating the id of his brother Liam. Until 2017’s Who Built the Moon?, Noel generally kept these diversions reserved for remixes, B-sides and bonus tracks, but that record leaned into colorful cacophony constructed in equal parts from psychedelia and memories of late club nights long gone. Black Star Dancing doesn’t depart from the previous High Flying Birds records so much as pick up threads left dangling from Who Built the Moon? while pushing ideas Gallagher usually left in the shadows right into the spotlight. It’s a canny reframing that helps banish lingering memories of High Flying Birds’ tastefully somnolent first few records, but it's hard to call “Black Star Dancing”—either in its original incarnation or its two extended remixes or its accompanying pair of B-sides—“fresh.” All three versions groove to retro rhythms that are throwbacks to throwbacks: the spangly ’70s filtered through the ecstasy of the early ’90s. The two variations—a succinct 12"" mix and a “Reflex Revision” that sprawls amiably for 10 minutes—expand upon ideas already fully formed on the original single. Perhaps “Rattling Rose” and “Sail On”—the former a breezy bit of good vibes with a vaguely spacey undercurrent, the latter an ornate campfire sing along—don’t burst as brightly as “Black Star Dancing,” but by using the dance rhythms and electronics as accents, Gallagher winds up showcasing his melodic craft more appealingly than when he’s dolefully strumming an acoustic guitar. Granted, every bit of Black Star Dancing telegraphs how Noel Gallagher isn’t in step with his times. It’s psychedelic music made by a rocker who straightened out ages ago, dance music made by a musician who hasn't set foot in a club in at least 20 years. But that flaw is also ingratiating: Gallagher retains his ear for sturdy melodies and his instinct for swiping ear-catching sounds and conscripting them to his humble purposes. As he always does, Gallagher stitches these elements into familiar and comfortable tapestries.","On his new EP, Noel Gallagher breaks free—a little—from his six-string to embrace the Big Beat of his youth.

This Land Abounds With Life,Fabian Almazan,by: Matthew Kassel,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d0115a08b427a3c01c5de06/1:1/w_160/FabianAlmazanTrio_ThisLandAboundsWithLife.jpg,2019-06-15 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fabian-almazan-this-land-abounds-with-life/,self-released,"The Cuban-born jazz pianist Fabian Almazan has always been interested in roots. On his 2011 debut Personalities he paid homage to his homeland with renditions of Antonio María Romeu’s danzón “Tres Lindas Cubanas” and Carlos Varela’s “Bola De Nieve,” one of the first songs Almazan says he remembers hearing. On Rhizome, his second album, Almazan explored the idea of interconnectedness, inspired by the underground root system from which the record took its name. Almazan draws on a similarly naturalist metaphor with his fourth album, This Land Abounds With Life. It is his most fully realized to date. In some ways, the album is a tribute to Cuba’s natural splendor: Almazan, now 35, was just nine when his family left Cuba and settled in Miami by way of Mexico. He returned to his birthplace three years ago and brought back some vivid recordings of bird song, along with the improvised poetry of a local raconteur. The field recordings, which are featured on “​Uncle Tío​,” “Songs of the Forgotten” and “The Poets,” cast a spell, especially when juxtaposed against Almazan’s atmospheric piano playing. Almazan’s project here has something in common with that of David Virelles, another young Cuban-born jazz pianist who, for nearly the past decade, has been making a deep and thoughtful study of the disappearing folk traditions of his native country. But Almazan’s new album is both more personal and perhaps more universal in scope. For the most part, This Land Abounds With Life makes the case for Almazan—who also plays in the trumpeter Terence Blanchard’s band the E-Collective—as a soloist. His previous albums were more form-focused and classically oriented, with heavy string accompaniment. But on this record there is only one track with strings, a reprise—from Personalities—of “Bola De Nieve,” which in Spanish means “snowball,” the nickname of the great Cuban singer and pianist Ignacio Jacinto Villa Fernández. On this record, Almazan gives himself the chance to stretch out, accompanied by his longtime trio mates, drummer Henry Cole and bassist Linda May Han Oh, who play on all of his previous albums. Cole’s funk beats are like water; he creates rhythms that expand and contract. Oh’s bass work, meanwhile, is thick like molasses, keeping everything in place, even when she takes a solo. Almazan navigates each track with a dexterous touch. On the first tune, “Benjamin,” so named for the donkey in George Orwell’s Animal Farm—one of a few overtly political compositions—Almazan begins with an impressively fleet-fingered introduction. “Jaula,” on the other hand, dedicated to Nelson Mandela, is a solo number, slow and contemplative. If the album itself has a narrative, it exists first and foremost as a catalog of Almazan’s own diverse and ecumenical interests as a musician. And that makes sense, given that, at root, Almazan’s long-term project, going back at least to Rhizome, seems to be focused on music’s binding power, whether it comes via bird song, poetry or piano. It’s a lovely thought when filtered through his hands, because it is implied rather than stated. The record’s unofficial anthem appears to arrive, quaintly, at its end—a sweet solo rendition of Willie “the Lion” Smith’s understated stride composition “Music on My Mind.” There is, his own playing suggests, no higher pursuit.","Interpolating field recordings and birdsong, the Cuban-born jazz pianist's fourth album explores the sounds of his home country with warmth and fervor.

The Age of Immunology,Vanishing Twin,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cfe63b8b25f86e6f64f7282/1:1/w_160/AgeofImmunology_VanishingTwin.jpg,2019-06-15 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/vanishing-twin-the-age-of-immunology/,Fire,"When the Brussels-bred, London-based musician Cathy Lucas was 12 years old, she learned some startling news about her family: She was supposed to have had a twin sister. But at some point in her mother’s pregnancy, the twin embryo was absorbed into Lucas’ own, through a process called fetal resorption. And though it’s the sort of event that many pregnant women don’t even realize has happened, it can have profound effects on the living child, who may experience deep feelings of survivor’s guilt. For Lucas, that sadness has been offset by a fascination with the notion that her phantom sibling somehow lives on inside of her, as a facet of her personality. It’s a concept that not only inspired the name of her psychedelic pop outfit, Vanishing Twin, but also its guiding aesthetic. This is a band that fearlessly floats in the hazy space between the real world and an imagined one, blurring the line between warmly nostalgic and eerily haunted. Vanishing Twin began as Orlando, the experimental solo project Lucas launched in 2015 after a stint playing violin and mandolin for London indie-pop hopefuls Fanfarlo. But as she embarked on her inner-space explorations, she amassed a seasoned flight crew that includes Japanese bassist Susumu Mukai (aka electro-funk producer Zongamin), Italian drummer Valentina Magaletti (whose credits include Bat for Lashes and Gruff Rhys’ Neon Neon project), former Broadcast sound manipulator Phil M.F.U. (a.k.a. Man From Uranus), and Parisian avant-garde filmmaker Elliott Arndt on flute and percussion. The group’s cosmopolitan membership initially reflected its mission to synthesize psychedelic traditions around the globe, from tropicalía to kosmische rock. But as Brexit has stoked the fires of xenophobia across the UK and beyond, Vanishing Twin now stand as a model of the inspired cross-cultural pollination that results when you encourage open borders and open minds. On The Age of Immunology, they respond to our tense present by using strange sounds from the past to light the way to a utopian future. The Age of Immunology takes its name from a 2002 book by A. David Napier that examines how the logic of medicine—i.e., ridding the body of foreign agents—is reflected in reactionary social attitudes towards the Other in all aspects of life. More so than Vanishing Twin’s 2016 debut, Choose Your Own Adventure, the new album foregrounds the group’s international spirit: Where its predecessor positioned Vanishing Twin as eager heirs to Stereolab and Broadcast’s bottomless milk crate of Free Design and BBC Radiophonic Workshop records, The Age of Immunology better highlights the individual personalities and nationalities that inform the group’s unique alchemy. Lucas’ elegantly stoic voice remains the orienting focal point in Vanishing Twin’s panoramic, ever-expanding sound world. On the enchanting opener “KRK (At Home in Strange Places),” she issues the calming siren’s call that guides the song’s Brazilian psych-jazz drift. And with the divine “Magician’s Success,” she rallies the band for a hit of narcotic northern soul that suggests the first step toward toppling the forces of darkness is to picture the better world that awaits after they fall. (“The noise of hope/Is like a racket in my heart,” she sings, before letting us savor the emphatic follow-through: “Imagine that!”) But Lucas is also the sort of lead singer whose presence is amplified by her absence—after letting the band float atop the seasick disco rhythm of “Cryonic Suspension May Save Your Life” for nearly four minutes, she coolly emerges for a lone extended verse that snaps the song into taut, militaristic funk. While Vanishing Twin have reined in their wandering tendencies in service of more sculpted songcraft and laser-guided hypno-jams (like the bewitching Can-meets-Congotronics trance of “Backstroke”), they’re still redefining their methodology as they go. On The Age of Immunology, Lucas’ star turns are supplemented by lead-vocal cameos from Mukai (on the meditative, Japanese-language title track) and Phil M.F.U. (whose new-agey drone-folk opus “Invisible World” imagines a parallel universe where Mark E. Smith detoxed, mellowed out, and decamped to an ashram). One of the album’s most sublime moments belongs to Arndt, who grabs the mic on “Planéte Sauvage” to wax rhapsodic in French about the namesake 1973 sci-fi cartoon. As the song’s stuttering West African groove gets massaged by lush synthetic strings and Lucas’ wordless harmonies, this absurdist exercise gradually fortifies into a showcase of the band operating at peak strength. Vanishing Twin started as a vehicle for Lucas to explore her unresolved feelings about the sibling she never had, but with The Age of Immunology, it’s become a communal celebration of the second family that’s helped fill the void.

Western Stars,Bruce Springsteen,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cddc1275a46c2419209837f/1:1/w_160/Bruce%20Springsteen_WesternStars.jpg,2019-06-14 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bruce-springsteen-western-stars/,Columbia,"The voices in Western Stars are old and restless, lost and wandering. On the title track, Bruce Springsteen sings from the perspective of an actor who once worked with John Wayne but now mostly does commercials—credit cards, Viagra. Elsewhere, we meet a stuntman whose body has been destroyed by the job, a lonely widower idling in his old parking spot, and a failed country songwriter wondering if any of the sacrifices he made in his youth were worth it. Sung in a defeated growl, this latter track is among the shortest, starkest things that Springsteen has ever recorded: an acknowledgment of how quickly a song—and life—can pass by. That song is called “Somewhere North of Nashville,” and it’s an outlier on Springsteen’s 19th studio album, both geographically and musically. On the rest of the record, Springsteen, with producer Ron Aniello, aims to conjure the golden expanse of the American West, with sweeping orchestral accompaniments unlike anything in his catalog. Springsteen albums are usually grand affairs but he’s never made one that sounds so vast and luxurious throughout. Paired with the down-and-out characters who haunt its mountains and canyons, the purposefully anachronistic arrangements—recalling jukeboxes, FM radios, sepia-toned montages, faded memories—carry an elegiac tone. It’s been a long time since popular music sounded like this, and it ties these characters to an era as much as a place. Neither is where you expect to find Springsteen, who turns 70 this fall. He has spent the last few years drawing attention to the most beloved corners of his career, from lovingly curated box sets and live releases to an anniversary tour behind 1980’s commercial breakthrough The River. His nostalgic bent culminated in two presentations of his life story: a 500-page memoir and a one-man Broadway show. Both begin with a wink toward his self-described fraudulence—an “absurdly successful” entertainer who made his fortune by telling stories of blue-collar workers—and end with solemn prayers and reflections on mortality. In the book, Springsteen discusses the struggles with depression that have threatened to derail him over the past 10 years. “Mentally, just when I thought I was in the part of my life where I’m supposed to be cruising,” he writes, “My sixties were a rough, rough ride.” All this looking back plays into the music of Western Stars. “Hell, these days there ain’t no ‘more,’” he sighs in the title track, “Now there’s just ‘again.’” Repetition and waiting course through the record as constants—sunrise, sunset. There’s a song called “Chasin’ Wild Horses” that prescribes its title as a means of counterbalancing pain; the arrangement grows more romantic as the chorus hardens into a routine. Springsteen’s narrative writing has always served to reflect his host of anxieties outward. A darkening mindset and feelings of isolation in his early 30s inspired him to summon the hellbound outsiders and dark highways of Nebraska; navigating his first marriage resulted in the doubt-plagued domestic portraits on 1987’s Tunnel of Love. During his exhaustive live shows, he is known to venture into the crowd to be swarmed by the community that’s united by his work. In the studio, he has to invent it himself: a sea of faces where he can find his own reflection. Western Stars transports him to a ghost town of broken male narrators, alone with their never-ending work and shortening timelines. He sings to us from somewhere among them, looking wearily beyond. Following 2012’s Wrecking Ball and 2014’s High Hopes—records that responded to current political issues and sought to modernize the E Street Band’s rock’n’roll exorcisms with loops and samples and Tom Morello—this music is a left turn. The stories, however, remain archetypically Springsteen. Occasionally, he sounds like he’s checking in with characters from his songbook, furthering them along or bidding them farewell. For those wild spirits who worked 9 to 5 and somehow survived till the night, there’s “Sundown,” a tour through a bittersweet twilight where you long for companionship. After all his promises of escape—these two lanes that could take us anywhere—there’s the hardened narrator of “Hello Sunshine,” cautioning that “miles to go is miles away.” And while nearly every one of Springsteen’s road songs is sung from the driver's seat, this record opens with “Hitch Hikin’,” a folk song propelled by a gentle windmill of strings, sung by a drifter with nowhere to go. He invites us into the backseats of three cars, whose drivers stand in for the pillars of Springsteen’s career. There’s a father, a trucker headed toward a big open highway, and a solitary racer in a vintage model from 1972, which also happens to be the year that Springsteen scored his record deal with Columbia. These avatars introduce a record that favors new sounds and perspectives—he often sings as a shadow or a visitor, giving credence to a recently revealed habit for crashing strangers’ funerals—but remains carefully rooted in his history. David Sancious, an early collaborator who played the virtuosic piano solo in 1973’s “New York City Serenade,” returns here to guide “The Wayfarer” to its tragic-triumphant conclusion. His jazzy touch on the keys offsets the thump of Springsteen’s acoustic guitar and the earthy twang of his baritone, as open-hearted and desperate as it has ever sounded. In this song, Springsteen reframes his wanderlust in a series of confessions. He acknowledges that put in his position most people would be happy with what they have. He knows his worries are nothing new. The title of Western Stars is a phrase that also appears in “Ulysses,” a 19th-century Tennyson poem that Springsteen has drawn from before. (Another, more ubiquitous, Tennyson quote is invoked at the end of this record: “It’s better to have loved,” he sings in “Moonlight Motel,” his voice trailing off.) It’s easy to see why Springsteen finds resonance in these particular texts: defining works by a grief-stricken poet wondering if our brief, complicated lives are worth the legacy we leave behind. “Ulysses” is narrated by a hero approaching old age, returning from a long journey only to realize he felt more fulfilled on the road. So he heads out again, “to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.” And stay alive, if he can.","Bruce Springsteen returns with elegiac and wise songwriting conjuring the golden expanse of the American West; it’s his best studio album in years.

Happiness Begins,Jonas Brothers,by: Olivia Horn ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cfa89def60560eb094d3440/1:1/w_160/HappinessBegins_Jonas.jpg,2019-06-14 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jonas-brothers-happiness-begins/,Republic,"Before they could all legally drive, the Jonas Brothers could stop traffic. In Chasing Happiness—the documentary that, in a bit of spectacularly on-the-nose cross-promotion, accompanies the release of their first album in nearly a decade, Happiness Begins—the brothers recount a time in 2007 when they had to be air-lifted to a performance at the Texas State Fair because their fans had caused a traffic jam stretching all the way to Oklahoma. At the time, Kevin, Joe, and Nick were 19, 18, and 15, respectively; they had just finished filming Camp Rock, the Disney Channel movie in which Joe starred opposite a then-unknown Demi Lovato, and, unbeknownst to them, would spend the next several years selling out arenas across the country. In their earliest iteration, the Jonas Brothers were a bunch of preacher’s kids from New Jersey, signed to Columbia and touring the East Coast mall circuit billed as a punk rock group. Later, after they were picked up by Disney subsidiary Hollywood Records, a necessary branding refresh placed them squarely in the realm of pop-rock. They swapped their Ed Hardy t-shirts for blazers and scarves, and got to work pumping out stadium-sized guitar riffs (“That’s Just the Way We Roll,” “S.O.S.”) and anthemic choruses destined to be screamed by thousands of pre-adolescent lungs (“When You Look Me in the Eyes,” “Lovebug”). Though those songs will surely have their moment when the trio heads back out on tour, with Happiness Begins, they (wisely) don’t shoot for pure nostalgia. If Jonas Brothers 1.0 was punk rock, and Jonas Brothers 2.0 was pop-rock, Jonas Brothers 3.0 is true pop—which is to say, a little bit of most things you could hear in today’s Top 40. They haven’t made music together since breaking up in 2013, but the brothers weren’t inactive in the interim: Nick released two albums, including a Top 10 single, on his own; Joe found success as the frontman of the electro-pop group DNCE. Reunited, the group have adjusted their sound to incorporate elements from both projects—Nick’s soulful, sexy R&B and DNCE’s light-hearted funk. In 2019, the Jonas Brothers rely on spacious synths and programmed drums; on several songs, guitars aren’t even a notable part of the mix. Nick and Kevin’s Gibsons have never been so underworked. Often enough, the smorgasbord approach yields solid results. “Only Human” rides a reggae beat that works surprisingly well; it’s a Shellback-produced show of brass (instrumental and otherwise), on which the boys try out new percussive cadences and punctuate their phrases with in-vogue, monosyllabic ad libs. “Don’t Throw It Away” is a feat of falsetto, with enough West Coast breeziness, synthetic shimmer, and rich harmony to recall another dominant sibling trio, Haim. The fizzy, supremely self-assured single “Cool” packages up some of the brothers’ best tricks, old and new: acoustic strums meet vocal processors and a thundering stomp-clap beat. “Cool” also benefits from a hearty dose of good humor. Laced with celebrity name-drops, it harkens back to “Year 3000”—the group’s first big hit, which gave voice to their dreams of outselling Kelly Clarkson. On “Cool,” Joe reports feeling “like Post Malone” and audibly grins into the mic when he references his thoroughly cool new bride, “Game of Thrones” star Sophie Turner. Though it borders on silly, the song packs oomph that some of the others lack. Notoriously guarded while on Disney’s payroll, the new iteration of the band has inhabited the public eye more fully than ever before—weddings, babies, and family therapy included. One might hope their newfound transparency would translate into a bit more personality and specificity on tracks like “Love Her” and “Hesitate”—two tender, but very generic, love songs that appear on the back half of the album. “I will take your pain/And put it on my heart,” Joe croons on the latter, sounding like someone not entirely familiar with the concept, before the song turns into overproduced soup. In the late aughts, at the height of JoBros fever, the group’s commercial success was tempered by ridicule in popular culture at large, stemming from some combination of their Disney affiliation, their purity rings, and the demographic of their fan base. There was a South Park parody; Russell Brand mocked them from the 2008 VMAs stage while the boys sat in the audience, stony-faced; Jay-Z rapped, “No I’m not a Jonas Brother, I’m a grown-up/No I’m not a virgin, I use my cojones.” Youth has always been currency in pop music, both as it applies to performers—especially women—and consumers, who, in their teenage years, often have time and cash to expend on artists they care about. But the biggest paydays usually go to label execs; Disney, in particular, has faced criticism for micro-managing young stars and commodifying family values to reap profit from children. It wasn’t hard to imagine the entire Jonas Brothers franchise as a cash grab predicated on marketability rather than genuine talent and hard work. With the added baggage of their openly acknowledged Christian upbringing and the physical markers of their abstinence—a practice deeply at odds with the lifestyle expected of “real” rockers—the brothers had a hard time getting people to take them seriously. In the intervening years, quite a lot has changed. Social media and readily available production technology have given young artists unprecedented power to create and disseminate their own music without prerequisite label backing. Stars like Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X—17 and 20, respectively—amassed fame through a combination of talent and internet smarts, undermining skepticism about the artistic agency of the very young. The sex, drugs, and rock’n’roll ethos the Jonas Brothers famously eschewed continues to reveal its dark underbelly, casting new doubt as to whether that lifestyle was ever really something to aspire to. And as feminism gains cultural ground, it’s more obvious than ever that discounting the interests of girls and young women says more about societal misogyny than the validity of their opinions. Happiness Begins is by no means an extraordinary album, but it’s a respectable showing from a group that has long deserved more respect than they’ve received. Though they’ve brought their sound up to date with current pop trends, aesthetically, not all that much about the Jonas Brothers has changed in the past decade: They’re still earnest, charismatic, media-savvy family men. When Nick sings, “When I grow up, I want to be just like me,” on “Cool,” you can kind of see what he means. The Jonas Brothers didn’t need a total reinvention to come back—they just needed a clean slate.","The former teen heartthrobs’ first album in almost 10 years is by no means extraordinary, but it’s a respectable showing from a group that has long deserved more respect than they got.

"Sonic Youth: Battery Park, NYC: July 4, 2008",Sonic Youth,by: Susan Elizabeth Shepard,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf586207790032eaddb9f82/1:1/w_160/SonicYouth_BatteryParkNYC.jpg,2019-06-14 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sonic-youth-sonic-youth-battery-park-nyc-july-4-2008/,Matador,"Sonic Youth ceased to exist in 2011, at the end of a 30-year career, much of which was obsessively archived in live audio and video recordings that have surfaced both officially and not so officially. Documents of their last few years together show a band that had perfected its live show and was spending a lot of time revisiting the songs of its early days. Battery Park, commercially released for the first time this month, was originally given away along with pre-orders of the band’s final full-length, The Eternal, 10 years ago. A free show in a lower Manhattan park on the Fourth of July is a pretty good place to capture a band that was forever inseparable from New York City, specifically its lower reaches. True professionals—the only events that ever derailed them were a massive instrument theft in 1999 and, finally, the breakup of a marriage—and seasoned festival players after years on the European circuit, they handled a daylight set in a park like just another day at the office. That might make it sound as if they were going through the motions, but that undersells how seriously they took their job. Up until the end, they came to play. The set is relatively heavy on audience-friendly tracks from Daydream Nation. That album had just turned 20, and Sonic Youth had spent a good amount of time in the previous months on tour playing it in its entirety. Those songs perfectly showcased how polished their organized whirlwind had become over the years, while retaining the ability to give listeners whiplash with a sudden change of pace or blast of noise. “Hey Joni” veers from hardcore ranting to dissonant squalls to furious rave-up. “The Sprawl” is the set’s jammiest improv moment, extending into a dreamy cymbal-and-guitar back and forth, dying down to just a single strummed note, then roaring back. It’s also a tease for those fans who lived for the moments when the band would stretch out, toying with effects to create not so much a wall of sound as a whole, enclosed room. A couple years later, even Daydream Nation would seem like recent material in a Sonic Youth set, as their last few shows consisted almost exclusively of material from the Bad Moon Rising through Sister era. This set didn’t touch any of those, instead reaching back to the band’s debut self-titled EP and first LP, Confusion Is Sex. Hearing those 1982 songs played by 2008 Sonic Youth collapses time in a way that’s more familiar to reunion tours, but of course there was no break for this band until they called it quits. Early, bare-bones no-wave stompers “World Looks Red” and “Making the Nature Scene” get the benefit of more musicality and, of course, Steve Shelley’s drumming, the X factor that propelled the band from very good to one of the greatest of all time. Karen Carpenter and Madonna were always as important to Sonic Youth as the Beat poets and Glenn Branca, and, unwilling as they were to baldly grasp for the brass ring, they clearly wanted at least one big hit. Their closest shot was probably “Bull in the Heather,” one of Kim Gordon’s signature songs, released in the heat of the Lollapalooza boom. And here it gets the loudest audible audience reaction, from the start of its plinking, dissonant intro, before Shelley’s maraca-accented drumming begins. Gordon seems to be having a decent amount of fun here. Mark Ibold’s presence as the fifth Youth, in addition to filling out the band’s sound, allowed Gordon to occasionally switch to guitar or take a turn as a pure frontwoman and focus on vocals. Here she plays around with a goofy British accent while singing “Making the Nature Scene.” As with all bands that so thoroughly reshape the genre in which they work, it’s impossible ever again to hear Sonic Youth as they sounded when they emerged. At times, it seemed like the electric guitar had been invented just for them to fuck up. The sudden blasts of feedback on their early albums were physically startling, the interplay of Lee Ranaldo and Thurston Moore hypnotic. Live, they could freeze you to the floor—trying to hear everything, wondering if all of it really existed or if some of those sounds were only inside your skull. Gordon’s determinedly simple bass and Shelley’s powerful, tom-forward drumming tied it all down and provided the center around which all that guitar noise swirled. While Battery Park isn’t their best or most comprehensive live document, it is further proof of how consistent their genius was and how enduring the qualities that made them such a special live act were—not dependent on youth, novelty, material, or anything except for the irreplicable chemistry between four people. Just before “The Wonder,” Moore asks Ranaldo, “Do you start this or do I?” ""We start together,” Ranaldo responds. Moore echoes him: “We start together, man. Together, forever!” Or three more years, as it turned out. But he could hope.","Three years before they split, at an Independence Day concert in a downtown park, the band tore through its earliest work with the polish of seasoned pros.

Derretirse EP,DJ Python ,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ce587affa43fd257c068090/1:1/w_160/DJPython_Derretirse.jpg,2019-06-14 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dj-python-derretirse-ep/,Dekmantel,"The mid-2000s were banner years for reggaetón—particularly in Miami, where the fledgling sound, a Latin American take on dancehall reggae’s dembow riddim, could be heard booming from cars up and down the avenues. One of the people who picked up on the lurching kick drums and syncopated snares as they dopplered down the block was Brian Piñeyro. As soon as he heard it, Piñeyro told Pitchfork, he realized he wanted to make music that sounded like that, but to “recontextualize” it, make it his own. Eventually he moved to New York, where he became a fixture of the city’s underground electronic community, and as he began developing his voice, crafting nuanced lo-fi house and techno under aliases like DJ Wey, Deejay Xanax, and Luis, reggaetón’s telltale syncopation snuck into his productions alongside house grooves and slow-motion jungle breaks. One project in particular came to embody his “deep reggaetón” sound: DJ Python, a name whose serpentine connotations are a good fit for Piñeyro’s slinky, sidewinding grooves. Unlike some other producers working under a reptilian moniker, there’s nothing threatening or venomous about DJ Python’s music, and the six-track Derretirse EP, the follow-up to his 2017 album Dulce Compañía, is Piñeyro’s warmest and most inviting record yet. (Its title translates as “to thaw” or “to melt.”) Reggaetón is having another moment right now, as part of the broader urbano movement, but DJ Python’s music sounds nothing like the luxe beats favored by Bad Bunny or Ozuna. Piñeyro remains rooted in the muffled drum machines and foggy synths of underground house and techno; the music on Derretirse is all instrumental, too, save perhaps for a strange, hard-to-identify sound that goes wriggling through “Cuando”—it sounds a little bit like a heavily vocoded scrap of speech or possibly jaw harp, but it could be anything, really. That ambiguity is part and parcel of the DJ Python aesthetic. Instead of using well-defined, declarative sounds to project emotion outward, he deploys nebulous elements in ways that draw the listener in. His pacing is just as seductive. This is Piñeyro’s slowest record yet: Where most of 2016’s ¡Estéreo Bomba! Vol. 1 and Dulce Compañía bubbled along near house music’s lower limit, the tempos on Derretirse take a precipitous dive. At the same time, the dembow influence is as pronounced as it’s ever been. In “Tímbrame,” loping snares perforate a foggy expanse of synth pads and bell tones; in “Cuando,” handclaps take up the backbeat pulses, answered by echoing claps that lend a hint of the “Diwali” riddim. Sometimes, the dembow groove is mostly implied: In “Pq Cq,” the album’s spacious closing track, overdriven kick drums and rippling castanets carve out space where dembow’s accents would normally fall. Still, despite the record’s languid energy—“I like calm shit,” Piñeyro once told Resident Advisor—this is no garden-variety chill. It’s lush and heady, and shot through with an undercurrent of wistful contemplation, but none of it sounds like an exercise in presets, whether musical or emotional: In “Espero,” muted rave stabs sing a doleful melody against guitar-like plucks and machine-like chirps—a strange jumble of expressive cues that somehow just works. What’s clear from moments like these is how far Piñeyro’s production chops have come; this stuff can’t be called lo-fi anymore. That’s especially true on “Be Si To,” a clattering highlight. Metallic, scrap-heap drums that leave a ringing in the ears are balanced by enveloping synth pads and bass so deep you can only feel it. This full-spectrum array of frequency and texture is held together by a no-frills synth melody that sounds like a filtered dial tone, but is expressive–lyrical, even—in a way that’s unusual for this kind of subterranean club cut. As it bumbles away, one finger on the keyboard, it occasionally rises or falls in pitch before returning to its ostinato foundation. It sounds a bit like a car stereo whipping past—an echo, maybe, of the sensation that captivated a young Piñeyro all those years ago.","Lush, heady, and shot through with an undercurrent of wistful contemplation, producer Brian Piñeyro’s “deep reggaetón” sound can’t be called lo-fi anymore.

Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest,Bill Callahan,by: Jayson Greene,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ceed15193a53689ac1ee56c/1:1/w_160/BillCallahan_ShepherdInASheepskinVest.jpg,2019-06-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bill-callahan-shepherd-in-a-sheepskin-vest/,Drag City,"Listening to a Bill Callahan album used to mean contemplating solitude. His music wasn’t about aloneness, but the man making it sounded supremely alone. His baritone voice rumbled near the bottom of his arrangements, and it sounded so serious, so grave: If you weren’t paying attention to what he was saying, you might have conscripted his music into all sorts of cliched lone-wolf expeditions: staring at mountains, nighttime highway drives, reading Hemingway on a fishing trip. On his long, sun-warmed new album, Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest, Callahan doesn’t sound alone. He sounds surrounded. For one thing, the woman he loves isn’t an absence haunting his nightmares, as she was on 2009’s Sometimes I Wish We Were An Eagle; she’s in his house. His son, their son, is in the next room. The sights, sounds, smells, and textures of domesticity are everywhere: “Sesame Street” is on the television in his living room, and in the bedroom, his wife is laying out a towel on the bed so that they can start “making love.” Does Callahan underline exactly what he means by this scenario? He does: “It’s late,” his wife tells him. “I’m bleeding.” There you have it: The first Bill Callahan album ever to mention period sex. All of this might sound disarming or odd, but what is tremendously rewarding about Shepherd in a Sheepskin Vest is how thoughtfully Callahan writes about his happiness, and how much his happiness proves to be enlightening for us. Happiness is a difficult emotion to plumb for wisdom, after all—we tend to reserve intensity of observation for the feelings we are trying desperately get rid of, hoping that if we study them hard enough we might never have them again. Happiness? Well, happiness we just try to enjoy, praying we don’t fuck it up. And yet Callahan seems unafraid of fucking up his contentment by thinking too hard about it. Somehow, Callahan with a mile-wide grin on his face has as much to say about the universe as the grave, stoic guy he used to be. His career—from his early lo-fi instrumental experiments as Smog, to his slow evolution into the singer-songwriter he is today— is too rich and storied for easy superlatives, but Shepherd feels like his most something album ever—his warmest, his most generous, possibly his most profound. It is his longest, for sure, lounging comfortably across four sides of vinyl, none of it wasted. It is a high note, fond and deep and sustained. The sound is looser than is typical on Bill Callahan records. The arrangements are full of sensual touches, like the upright bass that wriggles with pleasure in response to Callahan’s announcement, “You can call me anything just as long as I can sing” on ""Call Me Anything.” There is a beery honky-tonk lilt to “Black Dog on the Beach,” a single muted pedal steel guitar crying in the background. On “Confederate Jasmine,” he compares the scent of the flowers to “a soft note from a dented horn”—a precise and lovely image, and also a perfect evocation of the album’s sound and feel. It is a livelier record than his last two, full of quiet noodling in the edges. “What Comes After Certainty” foregrounds two acoustic guitars, one fingerpicking and the other doubling up an octave higher, traveling up the neck to find little improvised-sounding turnarounds. The two guitars are not tightly in sync, and some of those little solos sound messy, like the player chimed before they figured out what to play, but the smudged notes add a texture of rumpled joy to the songs. His records tend to sound monastic and spare, but this is a living-room record, made in and around a roomful of clutter. Every note, no matter how spontaneous-sounding responds lightly and immediately to Callahan’s voice, which remains the central character. “I never thought I’d make it this far/Little old house, recent-model car/And I’ve got the woman of my dreams,” he sings on “Certainty,” and as if shuddering a little at the unlikeliness of all this, the song dropping briefly into two minor chords at the words “dreams.” Contentment, after all, can feel terrifyingly fragile, particularly when you are in the full flush of it. “True love is not magic, it is certainty/And what comes after certainty?” he wonders. He does not answer. Callahan writes about his contentment in the same vivid, tender, and elegiac way that Leonard Cohen did. Any sunburned grinning idiot in a hammock could admonish you to “live in the present”—irritating, if technically good advice. But Callahan examines that same wisdom more closely and retrieves this: “Well, the past has always lied to me/The past has never given me anything but the blues,” he sings on “Young Icarus.” Writing classes call this work “defamiliarization” but it’s not really a technique to teach as much as a habit of mind, a peculiar way of seeing the world: “We are flies on a mule, and we’re good at what we do,” he concludes on “747.” The song is one of a handful of masterpieces on Shepherd. On it, Callahan is on a plane, writing about the thoughts that slide into and out of his head as the plane ascends to 30,000 feet. Mark Kozelek, another would-be poet of the mundane, might stare into his vacuum-sealed airplane dinner and wonder about the last time he was served pasta primavera, and which pro wrestler had just died; Callahan wonders about the border between birth and death, about the clouds he’s flying through and the light seen by the born and the dying: “I woke up on a 747 flying through some stock footage of heaven,” he begins, before giving us this: “There was blood when you were born and the blood was wiped from your eyes/This must be the light you saw that just left you screaming/And this must be the light you saw before our eyes could disguise true meaning/And this must be the light you saw just as you were leaving.” Callahan isn’t the first writer to identify, in the deep and elemental stillness of the soul that comes with true contentment, a note of death. On the album’s fourth and final side, death looms over everything, without darkening the landscape: “Death is beautiful,” Callahan tells us. “We say goodbye to many friends who have no equal.” One of the last songs is a cover of the Carter Family’s “Lonesome Valley,” a song essentially about facing the terror of your ending alone. But Callahan tweaks the words so that the verses are about all his loved ones—not only does he have to “walk the lonesome valley” by himself, but so do his mother and his father. We all share this passage, he realizes. A cognitive dissonance, maybe, more than a paradox, a thought to be savored more than a puzzle to be solved. As Callahan adds new verses, killing new family members each time—“My sister’s got to walk that lonesome valley”—the song swells behind him. Women’s voices appear behind his, as does a piano and a few different guitars, all of them wandering into what feels like a curtain-call. Perhaps in this moment, he suggests, we won’t be nearly as alone as we imagine.","A peerless storyteller gazes deep into domestic life and offers a long, sun-warmed double album that is a highlight of his career.

Bob Dylan: Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings,Bob Dylan,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf590ec779003b85bdb9f84/1:1/w_160/BobDylan_TheRollingThunderRevue.jpg,2019-06-13 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/bob-dylan-bob-dylan-rolling-thunder-revue-the-1975-live-recordings/,ColumbiaLegacy,"Bob Dylan’s Rolling Thunder Revue didn’t last long. From its conception to its dissolution, it spanned just under a year, not long for a career that’s about to enter its seventh decade. Maybe that’s why Dylan professes ignorance about the inspiration for his roving carnival in Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese, a lengthily titled documentary that recently premiered on Netflix. In one of the new interviews for the film, the singer-songwriter claims, “I’m trying to get to the core of what this Rolling Thunder thing is all about, and I don’t have a clue because it’s about nothing! It’s just something that happened 40 years [ago]—and that’s the truth of it.” Other people remember a lot about Rolling Thunder, though. Since the waning months of 1975—when Dylan roamed New England with a ragged band of musicians, playing small venues at the drop of a hat—the revue has been the thing of legend among Dylan conoscenti. Much of its mystique lies in the way the superior first incarnation of the tour only lasted about as long as a torrid summer squall. A second leg followed in 1976, but by all accounts Dylan was ornery and withdrawn—a contention supported by Hard Rain, a ’76 live set that was the only official document of Rolling Thunder until selections from the 1975 shows were compiled, in 2002, as the fifth volume of Dylan’s ongoing Bootleg Series. Certainly, The Bootleg Series, Vol. 5 is easier to digest than The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings, a 14-CD box released to accompany the Scorsese film. Containing Dylan’s sets from the five professionally recorded Rolling Thunder concerts, along with three discs of rehearsals and a disc of oddities taken from the tour, the box assumes a high level of interest from the listener: A set that runs for ten and a half hours is not for dabblers. This ungainly sprawl suits the Rolling Thunder Revue, which was meant not as a mere evening of entertainment but rather an immersive theatrical experience. Much of that heightened sense of drama diminishes on record, but it can still be felt, and the big box occasionally does an excellent job of suggesting the circus taking place both on and off stage. All those rehearsals help build the atmosphere. Here, Dylan and his band of old folkies, new rockers, and unknowns get acquainted, playing folk chestnuts and songs he’d just cut for Desire, which wouldn’t be released until after the first leg of the tour wrapped up. Harmonies are ragged and tempos tentative, but the bonhomie is palpable. What’s also evident is the nature of Dylan’s singing: open-hearted, bold, and clear, qualities decidedly lacking on Before the Flood, a double-album souvenir of his 1974 return to the stage. The concerts excerpted on Before the Flood were intended to be a spectacle. Dylan had rarely played live since his motorcycle accident in 1966, and he was supported by the Band, who had made the transition from his backing band to stars in their own right. Although the ’74 tour was a wild success, Dylan grew tired of playing arenas, and that boredom, combined with personal unrest, was the catalyst for his attempt to re-create his coffeehouse roots via the Rolling Thunder Revue. Surrounding himself with figures from his past—his old advocate and paramour Joan Baez, Ramblin’ Jack Elliott, Bob Neuwirth, and Roger McGuinn—Dylan also roped in new blood. He wound up having a drink with Mick Ronson, late of David Bowie’s Spiders From Mars, so he invited the guitarist to become part of the unruly band that would eventually become known as Guam. He saw Scarlet Rivera wandering the streets of New York with her violin in hand, so she brought her into the fold. Most importantly, he happened to stumble upon Jacques Levy, the director of 1969’s Off-Broadway hit Oh! Calcutta!, and the pair hit it off so well, they wrote most of Desire together and decided it was time to put on a show. Levy staged the Rolling Thunder Revue as an old-fashioned circus, encouraging Dylan to indulge his theatrical side—the singer often performed in a face caked with white makeup—and that sensibility trickled through the entire production. Thanks to its ever-expanding cast of characters and guerrilla marketing—the troupe often arrived in town without warning and without its star attraction mentioned by name—the Rolling Thunder Revue gave off the suggestion that anything might happen. Like all theater, that was an illusion. Particulars may have changed on a given night, but the skeleton of the show was immutable, something that this big box—which boils four-hour extravaganzas down to only the sets involving Bob Dylan—makes plain. Each night, Dylan appeared at three specific times during the show: strolling onstage unannounced to sing “When I Paint My Masterpiece” with the band, playing a duet set with Baez, then closing the show on his own. For each of the three phases of the Revue, he stuck to a largely static setlist. Departures from the norm were rare, and many are featured on the final disc, which is ragged enough to live up to Rolling Thunder’s reputation. Some of these tracks were captured at odd locations—a lean, almost rollicking version of “Simple Twist of Fate” was performed at a Massachusetts mah-jongg parlor, an empathetic cover of Peter La Farge’s “The Ballad of Ira Hayes” given at a Native American reservation—while others provide a variation on a familiar tune, such as a slow churning “Isis” in which the band seems on the verge of collapse. In this context, a nearly whispered hotel-room take on Smokey Robinson’s “The Tracks of My Tears” and a rampaging version of “It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry,” featuring Robbie Robertson on guitar, act as revelatory grace notes, showing how heartbreaking and galvanizing the Rolling Thunder Revue could be. Still, the heart of the box sets lies in those five full concerts, all sharing the same basic momentum, all distinguished by passion. The vigor doesn’t belong to Dylan alone. The Guam band is unwieldy and enthusiastic, taking the time to let all their disparate voices mesh. Rivera’s careening gypsy violin lends an earthy wildness to the proceedings, while Ronson’s guitar pulls the music back into focus whenever it threatens to get too folky. Dylan matches Ronson for electrifying verve, singing with a jovial bravado and untrammeled freedom that’s distinctly different from the primal howl he used during his fabled 1966 tour with the Band. Despite this kinetic kick, the Rolling Thunder Revue is at its core a hootenanny, a down-home bash that’s equally earnest and corny. Its folkie heart is evident by Joan Baez’s role as Dylan’s co-star and foil. Baez helped bring Dylan to stardom during the peak of the folk boom in the early 1960s, and here she’s determined to let the audience know that they’re on equal footing, harmonizing and sometimes dominating Dylan during their duets. However briefly it happens, hearing Dylan happily share the spotlight underscores the charms of the Rolling Thunder Revue, specifically how he sought solace in a communal setting. If the tour was solely about reconnection, it would’ve been little more than a footnote in Dylan’s history, but the nostalgia act was strictly surface-level; the form may have been familiar, but the individual performances were thoroughly, thrillingly of the moment. Dylan plays with a wild-eyed fervor that’s partially inspired and partially shtick, and he’s surrounded not by sycophants but old friends who acknowledge his bullshit and find it amusing. Why else would they sign up to play in the Rolling Thunder Revue? By design, the tour erased the barrier separating ruse and reality, and that deliberate, wicked conflation is as quintessentially Dylanesque as the fact that it lasted for a matter of weeks and then disappeared, its vibrant spirit never again conjured by its maker.","A mammoth, 14-CD box set released to accompany Martin Scorcese’s documentary captures the 1975 tour in all its ragged glory.

SAVE ME EP,Future,by: Reed Jackson,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf983bf7790037e16dba205/1:1/w_160/SaveMe_Future.jpg,2019-06-13 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/future-save-me-ep/,Epic,"For better or worse, Future has released the same album for nearly five years now. Whether it’s the slightly-more-romantic HNDRXX or the slightly-more-polished BEASTMODE 2. It’s all made from the same recipe, one for an enticing dish that’s slowly started to worsen with each forkful. SAVE ME, a quick seven-song EP, is no different. While it proves that he’s still a master of melancholic detail, dissecting his self-inflicted misery with little jewels of profundity, there’s nothing new or groundbreaking here. Sonically and thematically, he’s hit a wall. Which is a shame considering the project’s single, “Love Thy Enemies,” contains some experimental elements. Over wispy guitar strums that sound like they were ripped straight off a hard drive from the Blonde sessions and woodblock clicks, Future’s pitch-corrected moan is left to fend for itself and, as a result, feels more vulnerable, with each cry, coo and choke (he audibly coughs at one point) given space to sink in. “You wasn’t considerate to my feelin’/How am I explain this to my children?” he gripes. The rest of the project is less ambitious. “Please Tell Me” is anchored by the same hissing flutes heard on his 2017 hit “Mask Off,” as well as any number of sparse trap songs of the moment (“Effortless” by Chicago upstart Polo G comes to mind). On “St. Lucia,” clever lines about his vices—“Tried to talk to the pastor, found out he doin' the same thing/ Been havin' a secret relationship on his main thing”—are tarnished by cardboard instrumentation, a puddle of melodic layers that fail to stand out. And “Government Official,” with its garden-variety hi-hats, lack of hook and low-mixed vocals, could be swapped out with any of Future’s archetypal bangers on Spotify and no one would notice. While pockets of his songwriting remain both brilliantly petty and self-deprecating, the ignorance shown in others is tiresome and, even worse, boring at times, like he’s playing a caricature of himself. On the aforementioned “St. Lucia,” for example, he starts the chorus by crowing brazenly, “I’m a big dawg, I can fuck a bitch out in France now,” and kicks off his first verse with the leaden “I got one that's Chinese, she a ten/I made my Hong Kong girls wear snakeskin.” At other points, he comes off plain lazy: “My wifi lit, ten thousand feet off the ground,” and, “Ten thousand feet up, we get wifi,” are two separate lines delivered on different songs not far from each other on the track list. This is after he included a song called “WIFI LIT” on last year’s BEASTMODE 2. But maybe the toughest moment comes on the opener, the predictably titled “XanaX Damage,” which sounds half-finished. Strange gaps of silence are sprinkled throughout the mix, with a hard fadeout arriving only a minute and a half in, ending the track abruptly. It’s an otherwise beautiful song, with a tender guitar riff, pitched-down vocals and the most original hook of the project, with Future gently muttering, “Baby, when the sun is out, it's like I'm not myself.” It’s a flash of greatness bogged down by poor execution, which could stand as a theme for the EP as a whole.","His latest EP proves he’s still a master of melancholic detail, but thematically and sonically, the Atlanta superstar has hit a wall.

Erotic Reruns,Yeasayer,by: Evan Rytlewski,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf1523ba8350a4319695ff0/1:1/w_160/Yeasayer_EroticReruns.jpg,2019-06-13 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/yeasayer-erotic-reruns/,Yeasayer,"For a band that sounded so far out at the time, there was a lot of precedent for Yeasayer’s eccentricities. With their first two albums, 2007’s All Cymbals Hour and 2010’s Odd Blood, the band charted a Venn Diagram of nearly every major indie rock trend of the era, shading their art rock with Animal Collective’s hippie splatter, MGMT’s burnt-out party psych, and TV on the Radio’s dark plays on Peter Gabriel, while touching on R&B, African music, and just about anything else that was music-blogger catnip during those years. Did I mention they were from Brooklyn? Do I need to mention they were from Brooklyn? It was almost uncanny, Yeasayer’s ability to embrace all the right sounds at exactly the right time, yet they pieced these styles together so inventively that they rarely came across as opportunistic. Whatever they may have lacked in originality they made up for with creativity, and their records were so generous with leftfield surprises that you could forget how of-the-moment they were. They could dole out pop pleasures but they could just as easily make your skin crawl. Odd Blood is most remembered for the euphoric delights of “O.N.E.” and “Ambling Alp,” but it opened with “The Children,” a skeevy number that played like the imagined soundtrack to an alien ritual sacrifice. The band was always most exciting when they were kind of a mind fuck. The trio's fifth album Erotic Reruns begs for some of that old interdimensional weirdness. A slight and unwaveringly safe 30 minutes, it goes down easier than anything the band has ever done, while making less of an impression. Pivoting hard from the heady psychedelia of 2016's Amen & Goodbye, Yeasayer fall back on the same good-times and falsetto formula of Portugal. The Man or every other similarly punctuated alternative band that’s learned to crib just enough from Maroon 5 to secure some licensing deals.  The most shocking thing about the record is its pep. With its Emotional Rescue strut, opener “People I Love” could easily dance its way into Spotify’s crossover playlists. The album’s big attempt at an earworm, “Ecstatic Baby” is a slaphappy serving of Midnite Vultures-style funk. They're both “fun:” in the way that pre-show movie theater trivia or gas-pump infotainment segments are, diversions pitched so nondescript to its hard to imagine anybody gleaning meaningful enjoyment from them. Only the occasional shot of bitter politics offsets the album’s pervading syrupy sweetness. “Blue Skies Dandelions,” ostensibly about James Comey’s firing and Donald Trump’s ego, rides an easy groove that disguises its subject matter. “24-Hour Hateful Live!” comes closer to drawing blood, with lyrics that rhyme ""Steven Miller"" with “child killer” and “Sarah Sanders” with “propagandist.” “Goebbels might be her true Pa,” Chris Keating sings, pulling no punches, but the music itself is too staged and tasteful to rile any real emotion or capture the misery and chaos of the modern news cycle. Even with a layer of blustery saxophones amplifying its message, the song has all the anger of a high school musical. I wonder what Odd Blood-era Yeasayer could have done with the outrages of Trump administration as an animating muse. At their peak they could have made music almost as unnerving as the headlines, but it’s been albums since they’ve conjured that intensity. Somewhere over the last decade they exhausted their imagination. There’s a danger in over-romanticizing Yeasayer’s early records just because they felt so fresh—in truth these guys have never been especially deep songwriters or distinguished lyricists, and they’ve always struggled to match their style with substance. The difference, though, is those records could genuinely thrill. Erotic Reruns never does.","A slight and unwaveringly safe 30 minutes, Yeasayer’s latest goes down easier than anything the band has ever done, while making less of an impression.

Die a Legend,Polo G,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d006ac2f605607c354d37aa/1:1/w_160/39fa1f0ccafe731f2ee88d0b98401aba.633x633x1.png,2019-06-12 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/polo-g-die-a-legend/,Columbia,"Chicago rapper Polo G is a writer in a world full of freestylers. In the data-dump era, where artists churn out as much music as they can, he makes two songs in the time it might take others to make 20. He is careful and meticulous, malleable and introspective.  His sound totters between drill and pop, sometimes hard, sometimes smooth. Eventually, he blurs the lines between them. All of this is on full display on his brutal, powerful debut, Die a Legend. The title sounds like an epic fate, the kind that befalls a mythical hero. But for Polo G, it’s more of a cautionary tale. In his estimation, there’s no praise until you’re gone, and by then, it’s too late. He wants to leave a legacy, but he also knows you have to survive long enough to create one. The album art features photos of eight people in the clouds, like the ones you see tacked onto posterboards at funerals. Die a Legend honors their stories, their memories, their legends, with a painstaking account of the kind of violence that cost them their lives. It is one of the finest rap debuts of the year. What draws you even closer to Polo G is the heartfelt essence of his raps. He can dive into the nooks and crannies of his life story or take an eagle-eye perspective, but he does both with a hypnotic, penetrating conviction. His songs are deeply meditative, and, in turn, revealing. “My mind keep racing, I been overthinking, I don’t get no sleep,” he raps. It’s that penchant for overthinking that’s led him to anatomize his own pain so carefully and so potently. His verses are so smooth and vivid it’s like you are a breath away from him at all times. Polo G allows his songs to be jointless. With hardly another guest on this album (save for Lil Tjay on the sullen party hit “Pop Out”), his hooks feed directly into verses, like a snake swallowing its tail. They are simple but well-rendered, each distinctive but of a kind. Sometimes he’ll rap an entire verse in the same rhyme scheme (“Last Strike”), something he likely picked up listening to Gucci Mane. Maintaining the same end rhyme throughout sounds less involved than untangling knotty wordplay, and many purists see doing so as less complex. But it takes a talented rapper to ride out a single current for an entire 16 bars, especially when each of its lines runs right into the next, as on “A King’s Nightmare”: “Spittin’ verses, I’m desperate, I need a mansion and a coupe/You done signed over your life and now you slavin’ in the booth/Now we hang ourself with chains, they used to make us rock a noose/Shorties hoppin’ off the porch ’cause it ain’t shit else to do.” That’s the difference between a wave-rider and a wave-maker. The stakes on Die a Legend are often thrillingly high. The gut-wrenching storytelling of songs like “Dyin’ Breed” and “BST” humanizes revenge killers and reluctant criminals. Even as he parks the Benz at his new Calabasas home on “Picture This”—a lifestyle he didn’t know existed, let alone know that he could live it—he reflects on the bloodsoaked path he narrowly avoided to get there, on how he beat long odds with his rap lottery ticket. He sizes his life and his city up from all angles with acute perspective. The imagery is raw: blood-stained corners, “homicide puddles,” Securus call transfers, face-eating hollow-points. He calls the streets a scam. He compares retaliatory violence to reimbursement. He still gets depressed in his mansion. Both the despair of his past and the optimism of his future are, in part, conveyed by his intoxicating singsong melodies, which bend into any required shape and are ripe with emotional complexity. Through minimal, subtly elegant, and largely keyboard-powered beats, he bares all, nearly stripping himself raw. For 40 minutes, he is so tender and exposed that listening can seem like an invasion of privacy. But he never turns hopeless. “I come from a dark place,” he raps, “I’ll never be there again.”","Polo G blends pop and drill with ease and delivers a standout Chicago street rap debut that is meticulously crafted and honestly told.

TIM,Avicii,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cfe6d71f44363ea37bcba61/1:1/w_160/Avicii_TIM.jpg,2019-06-12 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/avicii-tim/,Universal,"What will Tim Bergling’s legacy be? At his commercial peak, the late dance producer, best known as Avicii, was reliable for field-sweeping big-tent anthems explicitly designed for mass uplift. There’s a scene of magical realism in the recent Elton John biopic Rocketman where, during the piano rocker’s legendary residency at Los Angeles venue the Troubadour, the entire audience literally levitates during an electrifying performance of “Crocodile Rock,” and it’s not hard to imagine something similar taking place in a raver-packed field, a collective festival throng floating on air to the cascading synth chorus of 2011’s EDM totem “Levels.” Despite counting a number of real-deal stars in its confines, EDM itself—a subgenre of electronic music in strict economic terms, less definable by its toplines than its bottom line—has rarely made much hay of those stars’ actual personalities, to the point where some of them rarely (if ever) reveal their faces to the general public. But as his career as Avicii rocketed upwards, Bergling’s personal problems became an inescapable part of his narrative. A warts-and-all 2013 GQ profile chronicled his struggle with alcohol abuse, and he was eventually diagnosed with acute pancreatitis—the symptoms of which include “severe, constant” abdominal pain. Touring took a well-documented toll on Bergling’s health, and his tendency to overwork himself extended to the studio as well. The 2017 documentary Avicii: True Stories depicted marathon recording sessions in which he’d willfully skip meals, while multiple reports on the making of his final and posthumously released album, TIM, have accentuated Bergling’s capacity to push himself to the point of total burnout. For all the jabs that were thrown at EDM’s practitioners during its height, it’s unquestionable that its biggest stars were on a constant grind in a cultural environment that granted easy access to hedonism. Two years after retiring from touring in 2016, Bergling, 28, died by alleged suicide last year in Muscat, Oman. As one of EDM’s most recognizable faces (he even notched a Ralph Lauren campaign the same year as the GQ profile), Bergling has come to represent the EDM era—a musical trend that rippled through popular culture as a whole—in a different light than when he was alive. It’s sadly ironic that, despite Bergling’s fastidiousness, TIM was unfinished at the time of his death; after being approached by Bergling’s father Klas, his friends Carl Falk, Vincent Pontare, and Salem Al Fakir stepped in to help finish TIM, proceeds of which go toward the Tim Bergling Foundation, established by his family to benefit mental-health and suicide-prevention charities. The album’s 12 tracks feature some familiar collaborators from Avicii’s world—Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, who enlisted Bergling to produce their Ghost Stories cut “A Sky Full of Stars,” and R&B singer Aloe Blacc, of “Wake Me Up” fame—as well as Las Vegas pop-rockers Imagine Dragons and singer Noonie Bao. EDM’s big names work in sound and style foremost, and perhaps the biggest takeaway from TIM is that, similar to many of his peers, Bergling saw EDM’s drop-reliant trend crashing and had his sights set on mass-market pop as a whole. The finger-snapping “Bad Reputation” smacks of the sanded-down, adult-contemporary electronic sound the Chainsmokers made their names on, while the closest thing the record possesses to a drop—the bassy “Hold the Line""—is less of the buzzsaw variety and more the soft, cushiony blow that Diplo has embedded into his pop productions. Most curiously, the soothed-out opener “Peace of Mind” is strongly reminiscent of Spanish producer John Talabot’s 2012 single “Destiny,” while Martin and Imagine Dragons’ respective contributions (""Heaven,” “Heart on My Sleeve”) don’t stray too far from the CGI emotionalism that’s come to be expected from both entities. On a purely sonic level, TIM is an easy listen to a fault, but taking in this final artistic statement is more difficult when focusing on the lyrics. For the most part, Bergling’s past discography as Avicii—the 2013 debut True and 2015’s follow-up Stories—kept the mood as light and starry-eyed as EDM gets, the closest thing to pure melancholia being a surprisingly dour cover of Antony and the Johnsons’ “Hope There’s Someone,” on True. But the lyrics on TIM—which Bergling had a hand in penning—explicitly evoke the personal struggles that have since come to light after his death. “We don’t have to die young,” Zachary Charles of A R I Z O N A sings on “Hold the Line”; over the gently pulsing trop-house of “Freak,” vocalist BONN claims, “I don’t want you to see how depressed I’ve been/You were never the high one, never wanted to die young.” Elsewhere, Chris Martin sounds characteristically filled with wonder (and characteristically hammy) on “Heaven,” singing, “I think I just died/And went to heaven.” Such grim lyrical prescience is reminiscent of Lil Peep’s “Life Is Beautiful” from last year’s posthumously released Come Over When You’re Sober, Pt. 2, on which the late emo-rap icon admits, ""I think I’m-a die alone inside my room."" Such a statement coming directly from Peep himself packs an undeniable amount of emotional power—but the overall impact of TIM’s lyrical parallels feels different, almost anti-cathartic. EDM typically relies on guest vocalists to do the lyrical heavy lifting, but hearing TIM’s coterie of voices singing such loaded lyrics seemingly (or at least plausibly) representative of Bergling’s perspective produces an unsettling sensation of remove. The effect of these contributors effectively recasting his personal sentiments over once-unfinished music is haunting in all the wrong ways. It is a sobering reminder that we’re no closer to understanding the roots of his pain now than when he was alive.","The Swedish EDM superstar’s posthumous final album purports to reveal Tim Bergling as he’s never been seen, but the scrum of co-writers and guest singers leaves more questions than answers.

Midnight,Stef Chura,by: Nina Corcoran,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5c7f30a8f9e8674fc9c20562/1:1/w_160/Stef-Chura-Midnight.jpg,2019-06-12 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/stef-chura-midnight/,Saddle Creek,"Sometimes empowerment arrives by way of motivational speeches or transformative adventures, and sometimes it arrives in anger. It did for Stef Chura, the Detroit-based indie rocker funneling passive-aggressiveness into music. “There are some conversations that I need to have that I haven’t,” she told her local alt-weekly. “Instead, I put them in songs.” Whereas her jangly debut full-length, Messes, wrestled with sadness—a close friend had died suddenly, an event that convinced Chura it was time to take the leap into music—its follow-up, Midnight, wrings catharsis from annoyances. By turning up her amp and doubling down on her uncompromising vibrato singing style, Chura defines her Saddle Creek debut in the image of the emboldened ’90s alt-rock feminists that came before her. She’s blossomed so much as a musician, she even surprised herself. Chura has mastered the art of playfully selling herself short, but Midnight should put an end to that. When she sings, she sounds as self-assured as PJ Harvey and as liberated as Alanis Morissette. Producer Will Toledo of Car Seat Headrest contributes bass, guitar, organ, and synths, but if it weren’t for his duet on “Sweet Sweet Midnight,” you’d likely forget all about him in the shadow of Chura’s commanding presence. It helps, of course, that she’s blowing off steam. On “All I Do Is Lie,” an exoneration of an ex-lover, and “Method Man,” a romp through the vexations of a one-sided relationship, her raspy voice pierces through spiraling noise pop. “Scream” confronts the suppression of feminine anger and finds its own solution in elongated, cacophonous hollers. It’s unfiltered and raw, the sound of someone who no longer gives a fuck. The vocals on Chura’s debut had a snuffed quality; here she and Toledo push them to the forefront, though they would’ve demanded the spotlight anyway. Even her quiet croon on lo-fi piano ballad “Trumbull” is engaging, as if overhearing a friend who’s unaware she’s not alone. As she fluctuates between alt-rock and garage pop, Chura finds exhilarating ways to exorcise her angst. She busts out solos that teeter between full-volume shredding and coolly indifferent fret-sliding, waving her guitar like a middle finger. On the bluesy “Degrees,” she waits until the end half to burst through the door with a classic rock tone, scaling her way up the guitar neck in a headbang-worthy moment. Elsewhere, like on “They’ll Never,” she opts for a cleaner, air guitar-worthy solo reminiscent of the Strokes. Chura sounds her best when letting loose on all fronts. So it comes as a surprise when she counteracts her own brisk songwriting with album closer “Eyes Without a Face,” a crisp, double-tracked Billy Idol cover that forgoes a memorable ending for a leisurely, dragged-out conclusion. Several of Midnight’s most rewarding tracks—“Jumpin’ Jack,” “3D Girl,” and “Method Man”—are treasured but shelved demos finally seeing the light of day. Perhaps this helps to explain how Chura manages to sound so much like a modern-day Morissette: She’s fed up, she’s plugged in, and she’s confident enough in her craft to morph these ideas into the anthems she imagined. Midnight is a growth spurt without the usual growing pains. Toledo contributes subtle handiwork throughout, but no studio trickery could replicate Chura’s intensity. From her fuzzed-out garage guitar tone to her grainy music videos, she’s bringing back the ’90s rock truism that angst is transformative—so long as you get it out.","The Detroit indie rocker’s second album fluctuates between alt-rock and garage pop, turning up her amp and doubling down on her uncompromising style.

Grass and Trees,Earthen Sea,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf592a42a3b7b5106fcc693/1:1/w_160/EarthenSea_GrassAndTrees.jpg,2019-06-12 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/earthen-sea-grass-and-trees/,Kranky,"As Earthen Sea, Jacob Long spent more than a decade pulling his music gradually into focus. The erstwhile post-hardcore bassist began recording under the alias sometime after the turn of the millennium, but the project hit its stride in the early years of the 2010s, when the dissolution of the D.C. scene veteran’s groups Black Eyes and Mi Ami led him to concentrate his energies on a foggy, idiosyncratic take on lo-fi ambient. At first, it was a vaporous, secretive sound. “He had two Casio keyboards with the preset beats run through a bunch of pedals so it made these rhythmic rumbling textures,” Long’s former bandmate Daniel Martin-McCormick (aka Ital and Relaxer, and a Pitchfork contributor) recalled of an Earthen Sea live show. “It felt really private, but just with one more step that could go into this whole other area.” Long began taking those steps on 2014’s Mirage and 2015’s Ink, both for Martin-McCormick’s Lovers Rock label, crafting airy, spacious ambient tracks that warily circled the reassuring pulse of dub-techno. With 2016’s The Sun Will Rise, for Nicolas Jaar’s Other People, and 2017’s An Act of Love, on Kranky, his beats continued to assume shape and gather strength. To follow the arc of those records was to trace a slow but unmistakable coming into being. But Grass and Trees, his first album in more than two and a half years, takes a step back into vapor. His music is beginning to dissolve again. All seven of the album’s tracks have similar contours. Most songs consist of just one or two chords run through dub delay until the echoes flicker like a candle in the half-breeze of a humid night. Long’s synthesizers are unfussy, little more than a metallic glint in the darkness. Minor triads predominate, standard for dub techno, but occasionally he strays into unexpected major keys, adding extra color to his dusky sound. Sometimes he drifts outside conventional tonality altogether with synths more like church bells or wind chimes wrapped in muggy, muffled dissonance. If there’s a barely there quality to Long’s tonal register, that goes double for his rhythms. Dub techno’s grounding pulse is largely notional—it seems to exist as a kind of muscle memory, connecting scattered drum hits and glancing chords. He traces a number of different pulses across the course of the album. The opener, “Existing Closer or Deeper in Space,” is propelled by a bassy, deep-diving downbeat; “Window, Skin, and Mirror” is fluid and easy moving, with faint hi-hats run through rapid-fire delay. “Spatial Ambiguity” and “Living Space” have almost no pulse at all—synths and isolated drum hits eddy in place, aimless and uninterested in moving forward. Never does Long indulge the straight-ahead boom-tick of his heaviest tunes, and sometimes his rhythms play tricks on you. No matter how hard I try, I can’t seem to parse the cadence of “A Blank Slate,” which feels like a normal 4/4 groove until you begin counting it out; some black magic seems to govern the relationship between synths and hi-hats. Even at just 34 minutes long, Grass and Trees can get a little samey. There’s not much variation in the tonal palette or sound design, and there’s very little development within any given song—just synths, drums, filters, and delay tumbling in circles, like pebbles in the tide. And the production lacks the fullness of previous albums. These are snapshots of stillness made of moving parts; they are shallow pools reflecting pewter skies. But there is one sound that cuts through the murk of several tracks, providing a surprising through-line to the album: a simple handclap, seemingly human, rather than machine-made. It’s as though you were sitting alongside Long in his studio, listening to this nebulous, otherworldly music hissing from the speakers while he clapped along absent-mindedly. The sound is dry and close in the intimacy of the room. The claps assume a particularly important role on the closing track, “Less and Less.” In the absence of any discernible downbeat, these loose, unquantized claps do their best to provide an anchor, a center of gravity. Gradually, they are met with other claps; the overarching feel is almost but not quite haphazard, like a rhythm unraveled. Eventually, the chords fade out, leaving just a smattering of smacked palms keeping precarious time against a backdrop of silence. Grass and Trees is an exercise in reduction, and eventually, it bumps up against minimalism’s limits. But “Less and Less” is a potent reminder of how much can be burned away without losing the distilled essence of a groove.","Jacob Long’s vaporous, lo-fi ambient tracks feel like snapshots of stillness made of moving parts.

Black Mirror: Smithereens,Ryuichi Sakamoto,by: Daniel Martin-McCormick,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf18def2a3b7bc468fcc46d/1:1/w_160/RyuichiSakamoto_BlackMirrorSmithereens.jpg,2019-06-11 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ryuichi-sakamoto-black-mirror-smithereens/,Milan,"“Smithereens,” the second episode in the fifth season of “Black Mirror,” opens with a rideshare driver meditating in his car, assisted by an app, outside the towering headquarters of a tech giant. It’s a beautifully concise haiku of our historical moment. Observe as the worker, isolated and at the mercy of opaque algorithmic tweaks, hustles his way through the gig economy, using the same technology that has wreaked havoc on job security to steady his mind. He cannot afford to panic, is in fact desperate to stay in the moment. But how much are these attempts at serenity mere flailings against capitalism and the inescapability of the internet? That the episode (in fact the whole season) explores such issues with the milquetoast characterizations and shallow twists of an M. Night Shyamalan film is a disappointment to all who thrilled to “Black Mirror”’s pre-Netflix incarnation. But at least it’s got a classy soundtrack. Ryuichi Sakamoto—composer, electro-pop pioneer, buddy to David Bowie, and synthesizer legend—was brought on to score “Smithereens.” His work since the late 1970s has taken him from the top of the charts to the monastic depths of the avant garde, but regardless of context, Sakamoto’s music has consistently exuded a profound empathy. Whether leading Yellow Magic Orchestra’s cheeky pop, collaborating with cranial ambient artists, or, more recently, confronting his own mortality, Sakamoto’s music expresses in a few elegant gestures the haunting richness of life. “Meditation App” is the first piece on the soundtrack, and, at over five minutes, the only one that truly works as standalone music. Airy and soothing, it floats with a single-minded aspirational splendor. In the episode, the meditation is guided with gentle directions to remain open and non-judgemental to whatever thoughts come up. This profoundly difficult prompt is delivered with a grating, faux-enlightened calm that sidesteps the harrowing depths of the psyche, and “Meditation App” perfectly embodies this flowy, insubstantial bid at inner peace. Its dulcet timbres suggest the immanence of a world without conflict, without pain or paradox, loss or grief. Perhaps we nurse private fantasies of a return to such an Edenic womb, but the music’s effect has a killing-with-kindness quality. Sakamoto plays it straight, never introducing even a drop of skepticism into the mix, and in doing so allows the show to weaponize the language of wellness. “Meditation App” could be looped in the lobby of a high-end spa, and no one would care to ask who composed it. This means Sakamoto did his job. The rest of Black Mirror: Smithereens is filled with the type of dark, pulsating synthesizers that have found equal favor in techno clubs and modern, edgy thrillers. It isn’t surprising that the mood is one of rising tension, with rhythms that suggest a predator on the hunt (there’s even a piece called “Prey”) and thick, gelatinous drones that suck the air out of the room. Sakamoto effectively conveys a looming state of emergency with the bare minimum. Here a bass riff groans and then spasms to life, there a flicker of white noise recalls a nervous tic. “Closing In” lightly clutters its background with distant sirens, then fades into an uneasy clearing. “Flashback” keeps its sentimentalism at bay, cloaking its melody with dissonance and water-droplet sounds before quietly blooming for a moment of pure ache. Isn’t this how memories work, slowly rising from the depths before coming into sharp, agonizing focus? These minor details are easy to ignore while caught up in the drama of Black Mirror: Smithereens. Even listening casually at home, they remain steadfastly integrated in a moody, fluid whole. The 44 seconds of “Gun Is Real” hardly register as music, though they are powerful in context. This isn’t a problem, but it does suggest the score for Black Mirror: Smithereens will be loved by two groups only: those with an abiding hunger for all things “Black Mirror” and those with the same hunger for Sakamoto. Soundtracks are difficult to comment on unless they are either exceptional or awful. The best walk a fine line, enhancing each moment of action while not quite stealing the show. Describing Halloween, actor Nancy Loomis said: “The first time I saw the movie, it was a rough cut without the music, and I thought, ‘Oh, this is so forgettable.’ Then I went to a screening when the score was finished, and I was floored by how terrifying the movie was.” While Sakamoto here offers no iconic melodies, the sentiment holds. “Smithereens” may falter as an episode, but it would be dead in the water without his contributions.","The electronic musician and veteran soundtrack composer turns his interpretive abilities to a single episode of Charlie Brooker’s dystopian Netflix series, to subtle yet compelling effect.

Black Friday,Palehound,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cd59d46c13a454b0fe82957/1:1/w_160/Palehound_BlackFriday.jpg,2019-06-11 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/palehound-black-friday/,Polyvinyl,"A lot of Palehound's last album, 2017’s A Place I'll Always Go, took place indoors. Bandleader Ellen Kempner set her scenes in bedrooms and in grocery stores, singing tightly wound vocal melodies over wiry, anxious guitar riffs. On the Boston band's third album, Kempner breaks down the walls. Black Friday reaches far toward the hazy horizon, letting the nervous energy of Palehound's first two LPs mount and unspool. Kempner wrote many of the songs on A Place I’ll Always Go during a period of grief after a close friend passed away. That weight lifts on Black Friday, which bubbles around the thrill of new love, and also reckons with the stress that falling deeply for someone can bring. Love, both romantic and platonic, can erase self-consciousness in the moment, but it can also heighten self-scrutiny later. Opening yourself up to another person can drive you to ask all sorts of uncomfortable questions about yourself: Am I enough? Can I be enough? What can I do to be enough? Palehound wade through this space with a skillful grip on their newly expanded rock toolkit. A couple of synthesizers and drum machines bookended A Place I'll Always Go; here, those accents get fleshed out, woven in alongside long, languid, reverb-heavy guitar lines. The stunning “Killer,” a menacing Western number about taking cold-blooded revenge on a male abuser, punctuates its chorus with sprinkles of saloon piano. “I wanna be the one who kills the man who hurt you, darlin’,” Kempner sings, perfectly poised, as if her shotgun’s already slung over her shoulder. She barely raises her voice above a stage whisper, which only adds to the song’s chill. It’s not a geyser of white-hot rage, but a cold, calculated expression of venom toward a  deserving target. It’s also a brilliant reclamation of the sounds of the Western, a film genre whose women don’t always make it out alive. “Killer” brings Palehound to some of their darkest places yet, but Black Friday also opens space for moments of levity. With their quick-strummed acoustic guitar and playful vocal melodies, “Urban Drip” and “Stick N Poke” could almost be Sheryl Crow singles from the early aughts. “I think I’m due for a shitty tattoo,” Kempner proclaims at the chorus of the latter, which is such a spectacular way to say “fuck it” that it sounds like she’s running barefoot through summer grass. But nothing else on the album, or in the rest of Palehound's discography, quite compares to the joy of “Aaron,” a song Kempner wrote for her partner as he navigated a gender transition. “My friend, if you want me to/I’ll call you Aaron/I can, I can, I can, I can,"" she sings a little breathlessly. The “I can” becomes a refrain, sometimes morphing into “I will,” an urgent, excited affirmation. The instrumentation—nimble guitars and big, booming percussion—keeps building and ebbing away until finally, in the song’s final seconds, it erupts, a little like the climax of Perfume Genius’ 2012 stunner “Hood.” The moment’s ecstatic, a rush of affection where uncertainty gives way to unconditional acceptance, and it cements “Aaron” as one of the best love songs you're likely to hear in a while. Kempner has excelled at tracing anxiety, fear, and shame through expertly crafted rock songs, and there’s still plenty of those emotions throughout Black Friday—the title track and “Worthy” both tackle the feelings of inadequacy that can attend even the most uncomplicated love. But on her third record, she also allows herself to experience pure joy, and what a treat it is to feel that euphoria along with her.","Guitarist and bandleader Ellen Kempner’s third record breaks down the walls around her wiry, anxious riffs, opening space for levity and the thrill of new love.

Islands,Erin Durant,by: Laura Snapes,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cdc359af2bde6543baad152/1:1/w_160/ErinDurant_Islands.jpg,2019-06-11 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/erin-durant-islands/,Keeled Scales,"There is precious little information available about Erin Durant. She was raised in New Orleans, and now lives in Brooklyn. Complementing those anodyne facts is a beguiling flash of insanity: She refuses to perform on a keyboard, and instead carts her 232-pound stand-up piano to shows around New York City, a Sisyphean folly that earned her a New York Times story in 2015. The tyrannical determination of the image is softened by Durant’s tender connection to her instrument, which is evident from her second album, Islands. Her 2016 debut, Blueberry Mountain, was recorded in her bedroom, a DIY setup that muted that vivid symbiosis. With TV on the Radio’s Kyp Malone on production, Islands polishes Durant’s sound to a resonant and gently rollicking gleam, brightened by dulcimer, guitar, brass, and woodwind. Durant’s songwriting is fine-boned and small-scale, and her lyrics are quietly epic. On “Highway Blue,” she stands in a room where she once danced with a beau, her imagery as beautiful as their vanished love: “Now it’s just an empty room/Like cigarette smoke left as an evening dew,” she sings, marveling that “electricity still plays our records”  even though their spirit is long out the window. Durant lets these moments come and go without stretching them out, and this everyday quality points to her strengths as a writer. She starts “Rising Sun” full of certainty about how “making mistakes” and “costing the game” is “the only way, I think.” But as the song goes on, she crumples in real time, admitting she’s “so tired and a little drunk” and begging to be held, her confident front falling like a dropped beach towel. In the near-seven-minute epic “Good Ol’ Night,” she tells the story of her abandonment with a gimlet eye for details: one minute the “crystal chandelier is turned up bright,” the next, she’s “intensely lonely, sleeping in the car.” The picaresque narrative earns the boozy mariachi band that sways in halfway through. The careful detail of her writing is sometimes obscured by the blinding brightness of the music, and weakened by the songs’ relative structural similarities. “Take a Load Off” is a gorgeous invitation to trust in friends that could do with less pedal steel and fewer syllables. The devastation of “Islands”—in which Durant takes advice to go on vacation, only to find the suggestion was an excuse for the advice giver to disappear from her life—doesn’t register easily amidst the sweetly swaying arrangement and Durant’s cooing voice. As Bill Callahan once sang, Durant finds that “all this leaving is never ending.” As people, places, and time all slip away, you begin to see why Durant might lug a piano around as an anchor. On the final song, the lulling desert drone of “Another Town,” she rues those who “whisper in the wind/Thinking it’ll come back again,” and promises to seize any second chances that may come her way with hand-waving, love-pledging impetuousness. More of that spirit in her future songwriting will be the making of her.","The singer-songwriter and pianist writes quietly epic songs about heartbreak, determination, and loneliness.

Old Star,Darkthrone,by: Kim Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cd594aa5a46c26eb5097e2a/1:1/w_160/Darkhorse_OldStar.jpg,2019-06-11 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/darkthrone-old-star/,Peaceville,"Norwegian metal duo Darkthrone’s career has been a long, strange trip, one that’s always hinged upon the relationship between two rock’n’roll obsessives from Kolbotn. The band’s sound has morphed from the grating, lo-fi black metal barbarism that won them international acclaim in the 1990s into a looser, black metal/punk vibe that debuted on 2006’s The Cult Is Alive and injected new life into their career. Since then, they’ve ditched their more abrasive tendencies in favor of a sonic mish-mash that trumpets the duo’s joyful debt to classic heavy metal to the rafters. Darkthrone’s 18th album, Old Star—which perennial mouthpiece Gylve “Fenriz” Nagell has described as the band’s “most ’80s album so far”—is a celebration of their storied past, produced by Ted “Nocturno Culto” Skjellum in his own Necrohell 2 Studios and polished by veteran knob-twiddlers Sanford Parker’s mix and Jack Control’s mastering job. Both members of Darkthrone share vocal, guitar, and bass duties (with Fenriz also putting in time on the drums), and over the years, they have forged the kind of bond most musicians can only dream about. This new album is in line with what fans of the band’s more recent (as in, post-2006) material have come to expect, but with a new twist—namely, the outsized impact that traditional doom bands like Candlemass and Solitude Aeturnus seem to have had on the songwriting. Darkthrone still stand firmly in the heavy metal (with a dash of punk) camp, but they’ve definitely got a soft spot for old-school gloom. There’s a melodic strain running through Old Star, particularly on tracks like the delectably doomy “Alp Man” (which suits Nocturno Culto’s breathy rasp) and the up-tempo “Duke of Gloat” (two of several delightfully nonsensical titles on this release. What is an “alp man”? We’ll never know!). “Duke of Gloat” is also the only track on Old Star that could convincingly be labeled “black metal”; despite Darkthrone’s roots in the second wave, their status as genre godfathers, and the designation on their label’s promo materials, the duo’s true Norwegian black metal days are long over. However, with its icy, mid-tempo malevolence and Satanic bent, this song is a thrilling reminder of past evils. “The Hardship of the Scots,” on the other hand, is pure Celtic Frost worship, with a twist—as metal site Last Rites astutely noted, the song’s main riff is a fairly blatant homage to AC/DC’s “Let Me Put My Love Into You.” Darkthrone and Fenriz in particular seem to delight in sneaking references to other beloved bands into their music, lyrics, and album artwork, and while it isn’t quite as apparent as on albums like F.O.A.D. or Circle the Wagons, Old Star is no exception. That rock’n’roll influence serves them well in the more rollicking moments of songs like “I Muffle Your Inner Choir,” and on upbeat album closer “The Key Is Inside the Wall,” and keeps things from getting too serious. All in all, they’ve come a long way from Ravishing Grimness. Fenriz firmly cemented his status as heavy metal’s timelessly cool, occasionally goofy uncle years ago, and has only settled more comfortably into the role as he and his counterpart have reached the upper reaches of both metal legend and middle age. Over three decades into their career, neither of them have anything left to prove, or anyone left to impress. The band didn’t even bother sending out promos for Old Star, preferring that journalists and industry types hear the new record at the same time as fans, because Darkthrone doesn’t need the hype, or advance accolades. They don’t need to worry about festival slots or booking headlining tours, because they don’t play live; as Fenriz proudly proclaimed on the 2010 track “I Am the Working Class,” they both have day jobs (and live in a country with a high standard of living and robust social safety net), so album sales aren’t a pressing concern. At this point, one gets the distinct impression that, unlike so many other elder headbangers who keep on churning out new material and touring themselves into the ground—because, hey, the mortgage payment is due and the kids gotta eat—Fenriz and Nocturno Culto are just doing this for fun. Darkthrone keeps pumping out albums a full 25 years after their best-known records dropped, simply because the two dudes in the band sincerely, obsessively love heavy metal, and like making music together. It shows an impressive commitment to both their friendship and to rock’n’roll, and, for all their warts and spikes and grunts, there’s something almost sweet about that.","With their true Norwegian black metal days behind them and nothing left to prove, the longrunning duo trumpet their joyful debt to classic heavy metal.

Widow’s Weeds,Silversun Pickups,by: Zoe Camp,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf04c277fd40d03ebdba43b/1:1/w_160/SilversunPickups_WidowsWeeds.jpg,2019-06-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/silversun-pickups-widows-weeds/,New Machine,"Silversun Pickups’ greatest strength has always been turning crippling anxiety into consumable, cathartic alternative rock. Forged at the turn of the millennium in Los Angeles’ Silver Lake scene—a subculture commonly tossed aside as hipster runoff despite giving us Beck, Rilo Kiley, and Elliott Smith—the band successfully recast “California cool” as a kind of shoegaze-tinged sun poisoning. Their songs were just subversive enough to net them indie appeal, but also mainstream recognition. Their two best-known tracks, “Lazy Eye” (from 2006’s Carnavas) and “Panic Switch” (from 2009’s Swoon) split the difference between understated seething and incendiary angst, sometimes within the span of a single verse, for a listening experience that makes panic attacks sound thrilling. Were these two firestarters sufficient to stave off their career-long Smashing Pumpkins comparisons, or their frequent write-offs as a garden-variety ’90s throwback band? Probably not—but over a decade later, the staying-power of those two songs has yet to be depleted, thanks to their legendary histrionics. No such luck on Widows Weeds, a set of mid-tempo snoozers Silversun Pickups may well have penned after a long nap. Rather than reprise synths and sparseness, the band, together with producer Butch Vig, have catapulted themselves “into the deep end of all things warm and wooden,” or so frontman Brian Aubert says. His description dissolves into a disappointing half-truth. Several arrangements skew earthy, yes. The violin-spiked “Simpatico” weaves a bit of bluegrass into their bar-rock balladry, and lead single “It Doesn't Matter Why” fills out a minimal post-punk stomper—propelled by a hummable, sticky-fingered arpeggio from bassist Nikki Monninger—with orchestral sighs and steady woodblock plunks. But they're also over-refined, hermetically sealed, and worst of all, safe. That album opener “Neon Wound” lacks even a microgram of the menace implied by its title is partially due to its lack of dynamic friction and wasted sonic space, but mostly because it could pass for a track off Neck of the Woods, 2012's half-baked dalliance into Metric-style electro-pop. Songs like “Songbirds” and “Straw Man” aren’t all that different from the plastic-packed fruit one finds at the grocery store; the sticker might say “organic,” but the telegraphed melodic arcs, vacuum-sealed pianos, and predictably-polished drumming suggest the opposite. Their penchant for melodrama, too, remains well-intact on Widows Weeds. Most of it comes through in the aforementioned string sections strewn across the record, superfluous strands of tinsel, masquerading as expansive textural accoutrements. Consider the epically awkward chorus of “Freakazoid,” which pairs earnestly sung elementary prose from Aubert (”I believe you’re trying/To keep us all from dying/I believe you’re crying/To keep this whole thing flying”) with a self-serious orchestral motif made all the more stagy by the plaintive piano plinks. Or “Straw Man,” a would-be “Tonight, Tonight” weighed down by needlessly-overcrowded hooks and uninspired simpering. Accordingly, the album’s best moments are those where Silversun Pickups shake off their malaise, drop the Grand Guignol act, and get real. After spending so much of the record banging out anonymous motoriks (“Doesn’t Matter Why”), slackened snare taps (“Simpatico”), and standard 4/4 patterns performed as if on autopilot (“Bag of Bones”) drummer Christopher Guanlao—whose frenetic, deliriously out-of-pocket fills made him the band’s secret weapon on Carnavas and Swoon—brings some much-needed chaos to the forefront on closer “We Are Chameleons”; his staccato bursts perforate the surrounding, warped grungescape like vampire fangs, giddily feeding off his bandmates’ energy so as to sublimate it into something bigger. “Don’t Know Yet” abandons its warbling electronics partway through to make way for arena-sized choruses, wailing guitars, and a serviceable guitar solo redolent of Third Eye Blind’s “Jumper,” the album’s sole believable feint. “Being open and vulnerable is something I’ll always have to struggle with,” Aubert admitted recently, likening his songwriting process to the classic board game Operation: “You’re just completely naked, and at any moment, something will zap.” But Widows’ Weeds contains little in the way of electrifying suspense or carefully-hidden, internalized trinkets—only empty gestures and lazy execution. Nearly 20 years into Silversun Pickups’ existence, we see them for what they are: a little big, a little brooding, but mostly boring. “You think about us all the time—don't,” Aubert instructs us on “Doesn’t Matter Why.” Sound advice, if you ask me.","For a rock band who excels at high-intensity drama, their latest is set of mid-tempo snoozers that are over-refined, hermetically sealed, and safe.

Sirens,Kevin Richard Martin,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ceec2e893a536c31f1ee502/1:1/w_160/KevinRichardMartin_Sirens.jpg,2019-06-10 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kevin-richard-martin-sirens/,Room40,"What no one really tells first-time fathers about childbirth is how intensely fucking scary it can be, especially when something goes wrong. Watching, waiting, and realizing there’s almost nothing you can do while your partner endures acute physical pain and your child struggles in its first brutal moments is a surreal, savage experience with few parallels in sanitized modern life. Kudos, then, to Kevin Richard Martin—better known for his work as the Bug and King Midas Sound—for tackling the subject on Sirens, a solo album that charts his emotional response to new parenthood, an experience heightened by his wife's emergency procedures and his son’s medical problems. The song titles alone are enough to give parents bad dreams: “There Is a Problem,” “The Deepest Fear,” “Life Threatening Operation 2,” “Necrosis.” (Fortunately, it resolves on a happier note, with “A Bright Future.”) Sirens works as a kind of companion piece to King Midas Sound’s 2019 album, Solitude, which tracked the grim aftermath of a failed relationship. Both are howls of impotent rage at situations that seem beyond our control: childbirth and its complications on Sirens; yearning for someone who won’t be coming back on Solitude. Both albums share a footprint of drones, dread, and rumble, a kind of vaporous sonic creep that wafts out of the speaker like the pungent smell of death. On Solitude, this was balanced by Roger Robinson’s doleful vocals, which gave a stagnant, bitter life to the proceedings. But Sirens is an instrumental record, the only clear human touches provided by a heartbeat rhythm on “Too Much” and the tearjerking song titles. That Sirens has its origins in a 2015 live performance makes sense. Room40 label boss Lawrence English has spoken of the gig’s “absolute, crushing bass,” and you can imagine the gothic distortion on tracks like “There Is a Problem” and “Life Threatening Operation 2” being majestic at skull-crushing volume. On record, though, Sirens becomes a more thoughtful work, less physically impressive but probably more interesting; it opens the door for questions. Why, for example, does the childlike sound of glockenspiel (or something very similar) feature on “Alarms,” its bell tone breaking through the ambient murk? Is it a sign that the infant life force is stronger than the drones of death? Or does Martin just like the sound? Toward the end of the album, on tracks like “Kangaroo Care” and “The Deepest Fear,” volume is replaced by whispery melody, in line with Brian Eno’s vision of ambient music as part of the environment. These delicate melodic clouds are among the most rewarding parts of Sirens: songs that invite you to lean in and lose yourself in the experience. At its best, Sirens is a work of deep texture and curdled shade; it resembles a smudged imprint of Aphex Twin’s Selected Ambient Works 2 where only memories of melody remain. It is both abstract and primal, the recorded equivalent of a panicky feeling in the gut; its moments of staggering dark intensity bring to mind the nameless dread of the best horror soundtracks. Sirens’ unrelenting nervous abstraction can be difficult to take over 14 songs, but perhaps that’s the point: The arrival of parenthood is long, intense, and frequently troubling, so why should Sirens be any different?","The low-end mastermind behind the Bug and King Midas Sound turns his gut-rumbling frequencies and queasy atmospheres to the terrors of new parenthood.

Mirroring,Yohuna,by: Abby Jones,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cd59b79fa43fd6cd5067a06/1:1/w_160/Yohuna_Mirroring.jpg,2019-06-10 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/yohuna-mirroring/,Orchid Tapes,"Johanne Swanson’s debut album as Yohuna, Patientness, narrated her nomadic tendencies and countered their turbulence with evocative, delicate synth-pop. Now settled in Brooklyn, Swanson has a newfound grasp on stability, and her second album, Mirroring, demonstrates the personal growth she’s undergone between LP releases. Reaping the benefits of “a lot of time in therapy,” her music now feels like an expression of emotional epiphanies. More heterogeneous than the steady tranquility of Patientness, Mirroring allows Swanson to float between new aesthetics: Grand, shoegazey guitars and classical strings are a striking left turn, especially to those who’ve followed Yohuna since her early industrial-tinged EP, Revery. In Swanson's words, Mirroring is “a metaphor for psychological projection,” and the title track takes a straightforward approach to the concept: “What’s you?/What do you see/And choose not to?” she sings, a tough-love invitation to evaluate (and maybe scrutinize) yourself through her lens. On the optimistic “Stranger,” she flips the idea, admiring the “calm confidence” of an elusive subject: “Strange how I’m your mirror.” Mirroring goes both ways; Swanson’s journey of self-discovery has enabled her to examine others’ traits in relation to her own. The wisdom she’s gained is palpable. That’s evident in the album’s astute breakup songs, where Swanson explores shattered relationships from multiple angles. The well-wishing “Fades to Blue” realizes lessons from past lovers in her own “thank u, next”-style prose: “Thanks for showing me my truth/Not all pathways lead to you.” She reminisces fondly as she lets go (“I wish I wasn’t blacked out during our first kiss/I made my bed so you would come over and sit on it”), even as she regrets not having been entirely present in the moment. “Waiting” aches in a partner’s absence, asking, “When is the perfect day that doesn’t start with you?” On “Dead to Me,” the usually cordial Swanson sounds near furious as she recalls an inexcusable betrayal by someone she once held close. “Can’t consent when you withheld the truth/Yeah, you’re dead to me, too,” she sings, the drawn-out “too” implying the sting of mutual animosity. Swanson wrote and co-produced every song here, but the additional performers include some familiar names: frequent (Sandy) Alex G collaborator Emily Yacina, Told Slant’s Felix Walworth, Foxes in Fiction’s Warren Hildebrand (founder of Swanson’s label, Orchid Tapes), and LVL UP’s Mike Caridi and Greg Rutkin, among others. Though Patientness was similarly a group effort, Mirroring sounds less cohesive in the latter half. “Mirroring” and “Dead to Me” feature piercing guitar whammies. The gentle strums on “Waiting” recall the hazy acoustics of Hovvdy or Elvis Depressedly, and “Stranger” gives way to a cello solo. Reverbed vocals in “Find a Quiet Place” are swallowed by a run of harp arpeggios, which, while stunning, feel rather out of place in the middle of an otherwise modern-sounding album. Rather than blending these ideas into a unique sound, Mirroring’s songs remain compartmentalized, giving the album as a whole an air of disarray. It feels especially ironic on a project that aims to illustrate how Swanson has found center. Still, her weighty lyricism and intellectual acuity testify to artistic maturation. Yohuna’s identity is still mutable, but on Mirroring, Johanne Swanson seems much more assured.","On her second album, singer and songwriter Johanne Swanson is wiser, steadier, and more willing to explore. Her music now feels like an expression of emotional epiphanies.

Paradise,The Mattson 2,by: Linnie Greene,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ceff1d3f2bde6498caada8d/1:1/w_160/Mattson2_paradise.jpg,2019-06-10 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-mattson-2-paradise/,Company Records,"Humble ambitions are easier to realize. Opening a blank document and aiming for one perfect sentence is less daunting than aspiring to a Pulitzer; so too for the component parts of a song, where one lyrical nugget or breezy lick can become an accessible entry to a denser, polished whole. It’s easy to imagine the Mattson 2, Californian twins Jared and Jonathan Mattson, espousing this ideology as they shaped the songs on Paradise. Theirs is a variety of jazz more liquid than jagged, more 10cc than Charlie Parker, and their latest, the brothers’ second venture with Chaz Bear’s Company Records, doesn’t feign loftiness. Paradise is chill and accessible by design, and it voyages to fewer far-out places than its predecessor, 2017’s ambitious and collaborative Star Stuff. This is “a record to throw a frisbee to,” the Mattsons write, and it’s practically suffused with the San Diego sunshine seeping into their recording studio. Jared’s guitar works sinuous loops around Jonathan’s tight cymbals and staccato snares, and like so many famed sibling outfits (think the Carter Family, the Montgomery Brothers, or the Knowles sisters), there’s something almost alchemical about their mutual precision, the way these songs feel as structurally intertwined as DNA. This sense of sequence and intuitive flow pervades the entire record, one song merging seamlessly into the next; it’s made for holistic listening over its full 32-minute runtime, rather than as plucked-out singles. The most conventionally structured and accessible songs are, counterintuitively, the album’s least memorable moments. Tracks like “Essence” and “Shell Beach” mark the duo’s first recorded foray into vocals, and while the abstracted lyrics and affectless delivery cohere with the stoned, West Coast aesthetic, the traditional pop framework fences in some of the band’s weirder, jazzier capabilities. These tracks are by no means bad—as its title would indicate, Paradise is the equivalent of a sunny stretch of coastline, and even when the tempo ratchets down, there’s nothing to complain about. Still, it’s hard not to think of Star Stuff’s excellent “JBS” and wish for a little more intensity, for the edible to wear off so you can swim out deep again. Lyrically, the brothers’ sentiments are standard relationship fodder. “Your energy just seems so impersonal,” they sing on standout track “Wavelength,” before plunging further into an embellished riff. “Let’s take a walk into the dark and find the light.” The song succeeds because it manages to wiggle between both poles, the dark and the light, riffing in a place that feels more like the powerful sweep of an ocean current than an unbothered amble through the park. These moments, scattered throughout Paradise, are its best and most textured. The Mattsons are experts at channeling the sounds of light and ease, but it’s when they orient them within melancholy, distress, or oddity that the contrast is most striking. “There is a crack in everything, that’s how the light gets in,” sang Leonard Cohen, and when Paradise transcends chill, its fissures offer a glimpse at what the Mattson 2 are capable of.","The twin-brother jazz duo are experts at channeling the sounds of light and ease, and there’s something almost alchemical about their mutual precision.

Never Say Goodbye,Roky Erickson,by: Rebecca Bengal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf52c83b14512b8f5667403/1:1/w_160/RokyErickson_NeverSayGoodbye.jpg,2019-06-09 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/roky-erickson-never-say-goodbye/,Emperor Jones,"The 13th Floor Elevators viewed their music as a healing force. If you weren’t consuming vast quantities of LSD, as the pioneering Texas band frequently did, their hallucinatory rock’n’roll, and Roky Erickson’s masterful performances still conspired to take the listener to a higher plane. A kind of spirituality existed in their music—escapist but communal. “We were known as the first psychedelic band, the first one to be able to play music that would make you see things if you wanted to, and then lay back and envision things like Dylan does,” Erickson said in 1975. “We were responsible for loosening up a lot of people.” His remarks were offered in one of the most lucid interviews of his lifetime, the first after his release from the Rusk Hospital for the Criminally Insane (since renamed Rusk State Hospital) in East Texas. In 1969, near the end of the band’s brief but monumental run, Erickson was arrested atop Mount Bonnell in Austin for felony possession of a marijuana joint. To avoid 10 years in prison under Texas’ draconian drug laws, Erickson would later say he had feigned insanity. He was institutionalized for three years. “There’s injustice in justice,” Erickson said of his time in Rusk Hospital. “By the end of one day, you’ve already thought up ages of thinking. You’ve thought everything you could think in a million years.” In his Elevators years, Erickson believed dropping acid was an art, a way to surround yourself with positivity. At Rusk, he was embedded in a world of the negative, given electroshock therapy and heavy sedatives. His fellow patients included convicted murderers; he started a band, the Missing Links, with some of them, and tried to overcome the daily nightmare of his situation. “Most of the time, Roky would have a yellow legal pad, and he’d be sitting in the hallway somewhere writing music, real weak and slumped down,” Rusk psychiatrist Bob Priest remembers in the 2005 documentary You’re Gonna Miss Me. Erickson’s wife Dana brought him cigarettes, a television, and a 12-string guitar. At Rusk, he later reckoned, he’d written close to a hundred new songs. “It seems like I’ve broken through that,” he said when asked whether it was possible to surpass the Elevators in their prime. “I have 85 songs written, and as I write, I find out that I’m getting better instead of just writing something.” His mother, Evelyn, a talented singer who’d given her oldest son his first guitar lessons, pressed play on the recorder. Sitting across from her, he played her quiet, hymnlike compositions and some of the starkest, purest love songs he’d ever written, songs that would for the most part go unheard for nearly 30 more years, until the 1999 release of a lesser-known collection, called Never Say Goodbye, resurrected from these tapes and other home recordings from 1971 to 1985. For Erickson, whose diagnosis of schizophrenia and early affinity for psychedelics too often overshadows readings of his songs, the question of where his music comes from tends to shortchange what it is. Dwell instead on what his art can do—the Elevators offered escapism, at Rusk music offered survival, and in the mid-’70s through the mid-’80s, it would be a catharsis. But in periods when music was not at the center of Erickson’s daily living, and when his schizophrenia went untreated, particularly during the late-’80s and ’90s, it became painfully clear to close friends and family that his well-being was in trouble. Over the course of his lifetime, which ended May 31 at the age of 71, the songs he wrote summoned equal parts deliverance and salvation, something he enacted in his music, perhaps more so for his listeners than he did for himself. After Rusk, Doug Sahm got Erickson into the studio to record a single, “Starry Eyes,” a perfect jangling love song where Roky’s “you-hoo-hoo-hoo” echoes Buddy Holly’s “Peggy Sue-ooh-ooh.” “The very best ones are sent from heaven by Buddy Holly,” Erickson once said of his songs. “The rest take the better part of an afternoon to rip off.” Sahm’s recording injected renewed vitality into Erickson’s career with his band the Aliens, with whom he recorded The Evil One in 1981, and two solo albums Don’t Slander Me, and Gremlins Have Pictures, both released in 1986. He called it his “horror rock” era—the period that yielded his great rockers of monsters and ghosts—“Night of the Vampires,” “I Walked With a Zombie,” “Creature with the Atom Brain.” Throughout the ’80s, he continued to write other new songs whose only recordings remained on the cassettes he made at home to remember them. But by the early ’90s, when Casey Monahan—who later directed the Texas Music Office, a state-run agency to promote the industry—found his way into Roky’s orbit, Erickson was in poor health and bad financial straits. Through a series of raw deals typical of the recording industry for musicians of his generation, he was earning little to no money from his music. Monahan chanced to photograph Erickson in 1987 for The Austin-American Statesman in one of his last performances for some time. “My first encounter with him was oblique,” he emphasized to me recently. Sometime after, he became one of a series of people who helped resuscitate Erickson financially and spiritually, and became a key figure in the making of Never Say Goodbye. By the mid-’90s, Roky was living on disability checks doled out in $20 increments by Evelyn and taking up residence in a partially subsidized apartment 10 miles south of Austin among a dozen radios and TVs tuned to various and conflicting stations and channels set to piercing volume. It was as if he’d recreated the cacophony of Rusk, minus the salve of music at its core. Covering the floor were more electronics and impulse purchases from home-shopping channels. The stillest point in the midst of this storm of noise was Roky. One day, driving around town, Monahan asked Erickson if he might like to go back in the studio again. Roky was game. “Sure!” Erickson said genuinely, in what Monahan describes as a “high-pitched, nasally, not-yet-a-scream-yet-still-heard-three-aisles-over voice.” “Long as it’s fun!” Monahan gathered musicians Speedy Sparks, Paul Leary, Lou Ann Barton, and Charlie Sexton for the stellar 1995 album All That May Do My Rhyme, released by King Coffey’s Trance Syndicate label, which also put out another acoustic Erickson demo, the B-side “Please Judge.” “He was why I was even in this position in the first place,” Coffey, longtime drummer of the Butthole Surfers, wrote on Facebook, the night of Erickson’s death. “He invented Texas punk.” In another effort to help restore Roky’s songwriting credits, Monahan gathered dozens of tapes and handwritten pages that had accumulated over Roky’s career, transcribing all of his lyrics for a collection eventually published, by Henry Rollins, as Openers II. Evelyn Erickson delivered some 40 songs, including her own recordings of her eldest son at Rusk. For Monahan, these were a revelation, and they inspired the making of Never Say Goodbye. “I had a little cassette recorder with pitch control, and I hit play and I stopped, and played it again, and again, slowing it down, listening,” Monahan told me. He played the cassettes for Coffey’s longtime partner, now husband, Craig Stewart, who ran the label Emperor Jones. It was Stewart who heard an album in Roky’s rough cuts and lo-fi, deteriorating tapes. These artifacts were scattered over Stewart’s kitchen table for months, and with the help of Monahan, he pored over the music and assembled a collection of 14 songs recorded in the years 1971 to 1985—just Erickson and a guitar in a room, quiet and stirring and haunting and deceptively plain constructions. What emerges as Never Say Goodbye feels like the record of a vast and deep wandering, a pilgrim embarking on a meandering search for connection. Erickson repeats and wrangles emotion out of the simplest lyrics (“I’ve never known this till now”) and turns out extraordinary phrases—a desire for “unforced peace,” what a concept. “The crescent silver moon is mine,” he sings on the title song, playing so tenderly you hear the guitar as rippling dark water. All his songs harbor gnomic, vivid truths, but “Be and Bring Me Home” is the album’s apex, with lyrics both enigmatic (“Her jewelry drops all its grime”) and weirdly astute (“I won’t jump on you though we are all rubber”) organized around a heartbreaking plea: Suddenly my fireplace is friendly
Bringing me home
Suddenly I may control
Take little things meaning big so’s I’m not alone
Suddenly I’m not sick
Won’t you be and bring me home “Someone is missing love,” Erickson sings, “and now that someone is going home.” Absent on Never Say Goodbye is Erickson’s incandescent wolverine scream, the one he perfected on “You’re Gonna Miss Me,” the Elevators’ lone entry onto the pop charts. You could imagine a scream emerging on another version of say, his song “Birds’d Crashed,” in its driving and resolute affirmation: “We’re here, I’m here,” but it’s a gift to hear these in their original expression. The songs on Never Say Goodbye possess a faraway sound that feels deliberately metaphoric, as if they were issued from deep inside a tunnel, amplifying the loner quality of the seeker at the heart of it all. When tape hiss enters it feels like a welcome presence too, perhaps a validation of one of Erickson’s other indelible lyrics: “When you have ghosts, you have everything.” On Scott Newton’s cover photograph of Erickson, he’s winsome and scruffy, wearing a corduroy jacket with a dog wandering at his heels and a guitar in hand. But the Roky Erickson who recorded most of these songs at Rusk was newly shorn and lost: “They cut my hair completely bald, just as mean as they could, and they put me in khakis,” he recalled after his release. “When I got there it was like, ‘Here comes this guy with long hair and a top hat.’ And they said, ‘Oh, boy. We got him. If I had been wearing a tuxedo it would have been just as bad.’” Listening, you envision a person not just piecing himself back together again, but shoring himself up against the world that would always tend to view his lyrics as outlandish. He knew he was an alien. Never Say Goodbye’s impact was felt in tiny waves, reviewed by a handful of writers, including a much younger me, writing for a tiny zine in North Carolina, where a core of friends replayed “Pushing and Pulling” and “You’re an Unidentified Flying Object” and “Be and Bring Me Home” incessantly. When I moved to Austin not long after its release, it still felt to me like a city small enough where you might encounter your heroes. Idly, I paged through the phone book, looking up names. To my surprise, Roky Erickson was listed. Now I wish I’d torn out the page. I drove past the address, curious but too shy to call or to attempt to knock on the door. The album itself is a survivor of strange and remarkable accidents. “The fact that he could make art like this—these beautiful, vulnerable love songs—when he’s inside a psychiatric hospital, to me that’s incredible,” Coffey told me recently. The fact the songs were recorded at all is a feat, too; that they were saved for years and salvaged and made known at all makes it even more impossible and rare. The fact that the youthfulness and the fragility of Roky’s voice is preserved here is astonishing. “Ten years later, when he had more management and was thinking about recording again, I don’t know if a record like this would have happened,” Coffey said. “At the time it was released, we thought he might never record again.” For at least a decade, Erickson steadfastly refused to see a doctor or dentist. Eventually, in 2001, his youngest brother Sumner, managed to intervene and get him into medical care for the first time in at least a decade. Henry Rollins paid for Erickson’s new teeth. In the decade of Erickson’s final renaissance, he recorded an album with Okkervil River, including new versions of “Be and Bring Me Home,” “Think Of As One,” and “Birds’d Crash” from Never Say Goodbye. “He was a pioneer,” Monahan told me, as if dictating an epitaph over the phone. “He stayed true to his music. He never compromised. He survived.” More importantly, he emphasized, Erickson was far more self-aware than people realized. “People projected their insanity onto him. A lot of people lived through Roky. They could feel a little less crazy because Roky was there.” And they could, one surmises, draw calmness from the visionary music of a person who wandered the edges of the world they didn’t dare explore themselves. People close to Erickson do speak of how hard it was to help him when he was at his most troubled, but mainly of the innate goodheartedness he transmitted. “He occasionally seemed psychic, attuned to some dimension of the present that the rest of us weren’t seeing,” Will Sheff of Okkervil River wrote recently. Perhaps that is the condition of being truly psychedelic. “Special and magical music,” Erickson sings on “Be and Bring Me Home,” “these are feelings from one to another.” In the ’90s, Monahan and other friends were part of a de-facto Roky Erickson supper club, taking him out to eat twice a week. One evening, when Monahan showed up, Erickson waved him away. “He was cheerful about it,” Monahan said. “He told us, ‘You know what, I’m not gonna go today, you guys go on without me. I’ll just be here relaxing for you!’ I mean, right? What a sweetheart, Roky. ‘I’ll be relaxing for you.’”","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

"Personal Best / Captain My Captain / Choices, Chances, Changes: Singles & Comptracks 1994-2000",Team Dresch,by: NM Mashurov,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf149787fd40df575dba51d/1:1/w_160/TeamDresch_PersonalBest.jpg,2019-06-08 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/team-dresch-personal-best-captain-my-captain-choices-chances-changes-singles-and-comptracks-1994-2000/,Jealous Butcher,"People who talk about Team Dresch’s music say it saved them. It’s not an exaggeration. The feminist queercore band was active for only about five years, leaving behind two albums and a collection of singles, but the records’ knowing intimacies made them pre-Tumblr beacons of community for isolated queers in their darkest moments. A life is shaped by minute experiences; when a great punk song captures the emotional specificity of those moments, it wins our lifelong devotion. Team Dresch mirrored the experiences of people who weren’t used to having their lives reflected back to them. In doing so, their work shattered isolation. In the early 1990s, Donna Dresch lived in the Martin apartments in Olympia, Washington alongside many members of the rising riot grrrl movement, worked for K Records, published the queercore fanzine Chainsaw, and played in bands such as Dinosaur Jr. and Screaming Trees. When Jody Bleyle, then drumming in the Portland band Hazel, met Dresch after a show, she expressed a longing to play in “an all-dyke band.” Her desire would materialize in spring of 1994, when the two were joined by Marcéo Martinez (of Calamity Jane) and Kaia Wilson (of Adickted), who herself had once written long letters to Dresch as a lonely gay teenager living in conservative rural Oregon. In poetic fragments dripping with humor and pain, 1995’s Personal Best recounted evergreen stories about crushing on straight or closeted girls (“Freewheel,” “She’s Crushing My Mind”), making your mother cry by shaving your head (“Growing Up in Springfield”), and dreaming of leaving it all behind and moving to the woods (“Screwing Yer Courage”). “She told me I needed God/I told her I just needed her,” Wilson sings on “Growing Up in Springfield,” named after an Oregon town which, in 1992, became the first municipality in the nation to include anti-gay language in its city charter—a measure pushed by a conservative Christian organization called the Oregon Citizens Alliance, which also advocated to classify homosexuality as “abnormal, unnatural, and perverse.” Team Dresch responded to these attitudes with “Hate the Christian Right!,” where metalcore screams, melodic vocal lines, shredding guitar, and rapid-fire drum fills combined to create a sick-of-it-all rage spiral, a plea for an out that might never exist. Everyone in the band was already a skilled musician in their own right, and Personal Best was tight and catchy, packing deft, shifting melodies and numerous ideas and genres into less than half an hour. The bridge on “#1 Chance Pirate TV” sounds quintessentially mid-’90s emo, and “She’s Crushing My Mind” precedes one of the Promise Ring’s most memorable melodies. “Fake Fight’”s longing for tree forts and bike rides is one banjo short of folk-punk, while “Freewheel” delivers “go back to your boyfriend” levity with power-pop glee. But the album’s emotional centerpiece, destined to grace many a mixtape, is “She’s Amazing”: a tribute to every outspoken woman and queer root that did for Team Dresch what they would do for countless others: “She’s amazing/Her words saved me/She holds her head as if it’s true.” Dresch’s Chainsaw zine grew into Chainsaw Records, which, along with Bleyle’s Candy Ass Records, co-released both Personal Best and the band’s second album, Captain My Captain. Chainsaw also released notable records by bands such as Heavens to Betsy, Tracy + the Plastics, and Sleater-Kinney, and hosted an online message board where community and conflict played out in real time. As grunge blew up and major labels began courting bands from the Pacific Northwest, independent artists felt the weight of their mission. Bleyle, whose band Hazel had been signed to Sub Pop, was familiar with the industry and wanted to remain autonomous. Team Dresch funded their own European tour, wrote to fans directly when mainstream gay magazines wouldn’t interview them, and worked to inform their peers. “The more bands and labels that… are willing to cooperate with one another—to share information and talk about what these major-media people are saying to them—the easier it will be to resist commodification,” she told Punk Planet. “There’s no way you can up against this by yourself. Once you’ve dealt with labels like this you realize that’s what they want: for everyone to be isolated.” Operating through DIY channels meant Team Dresch didn’t have to compromise, assuring fans that behind every release stood a tangible community of like-minded co-conspirators. By the time Captain My Captain came out in 1996, with Melissa York replacing Martinez on drums, Team Dresch recognized their status as visible dykons. They wrote longer songs that were intentionally aimed at their audience, with more straightforward hooks, more legible structures, and more prominent vocals. Even without the metal screams, their directness was often combative. Take the hurtling chosen-family ode “Uncle Phranc,” where Bleyle slams a mother’s conditional love as “emotional blackmail,” or when, at the end of a ponderous musical break in “The Council,” Wilson belts a cathartic call-out of scene gossip. There’s also an enormous amount of sweetness, not just in love songs to partners (“107,” “Take on Me”), but in love songs to the community that urge listeners to survive, find their people, and live on their own terms (“Musical Fanzine,” “Remember Who You Are”). Throughout, lines about writing your own Rubyfruit Jungle or figuring out whether you’re butch or femme signalled familiarity. “Live your truth” messaging can be cloying, but Team Dresch sang it in earnest, sounding more like a trusted sibling than a sloganeer. On Captain, Bleyle also started writing intentionally about her struggles with mental illness—a topic that wasn’t being discussed much, even in underground circles. One of the most affecting examples is “Don’t Try Suicide” (not to be confused with the Queen song of the same name), where a deflated Bleyle talks about being “scared to leave the house/scared to go to sleep.” The second chorus tells of a girlfriend’s attempt at reassurance, and Bleyle’s voice is raw as she screams, “I don’t believe her/But it makes me feel better anyway.” With queer suicide—particularly queer youth suicide—an ongoing national epidemic, these moments are, tragically, some of the record’s most prescient. The opportunity to reevaluate these albums comes as Portland label Jealous Butcher reissues both of them on vinyl, CD, and streaming platforms, along with a CD-and-streaming-only singles compilation called Choices, Chances, Changes: Singles & Comptracks 1994-2000. A soft case with a band photo collage on the outside cover and a chronologically sequenced array of miscellaneous releases on the inside, it feels like a promo CD you might get at a punk fest and end up treasuring. Selections include fan favorite “Hand Grenade” (a track that first appeared as a 7"" on Kill Rock Stars), an early version of “Fake Fight,” the bratty Tribe 8-reminiscent “Song for Anne Bannon” (released on Candy Ass’s Free to Fight self-defense compilation), and several songs recorded after Wilson left the band in 1996. Less cohesive than the full-lengths, it’s a compilation for collectors and true fans, demonstrating the band’s range and offering sought-after bonus tracks for when two records are just not enough. Listening to the Team Dresch reissues in 2019 feels different than I imagine it did in 1995. The internet has made it easier for queers to find each other, and there are more openly queer artists than ever before. Transmisogynist elements in riot grrrl, like Wilson’s 1999 defense of the Michigan Womyn’s Music Festival’s trans-exclusionary attendance policy, seeded enduring distrust, though many current scenes are working to become more inclusive. (Wilson’s own views have since changed as well.) Still, much of the music feels and sounds as relevant as ever—both because the band’s words continue to resonate and because their harmonies, melodic defiance, and true-to-life lyrics echo through much of today’s DIY punk (Waxahatchee has covered “Freewheel” live). As a new generation discovers classics like 1985’s Desert Hearts and realizes we don’t have to settle for straight-authored queerbaiting, there is a lot to learn from queer elders, especially those that never conceded to marketability. Indeed, one of the most striking aspects of Captain is the unabashed sexuality, stated plainly rather than cloaked in coded desire: Bleyle finding solace in cruising on “Remember Who You Are,” or Wilson asking a lover to boss her around on “Yes I Am Too, But Who Am I Really?” and declaring herself “a flaming S&M rubber dyke” on “I’m Illegal.” Fifty years after the Stonewall riots, mainstream Pride events are often sanitized and corporate, but it still feels revolutionary to put on “Musical Fanzine” and sing along: “Queer sex is great, it's fun as shit/Don't kill yourself cause people can't deal with your brilliance/Sometimes I can’t remember why I want to live/Then I think of all the freaks and I don’t want to miss this.”","A new reissue collects the work of the pioneering icons of queer punk, whose uncompromising approach and knowing intimacies made them pre-Tumblr beacons of community.

Weeping Choir,Full of Hell,by: Kim Kelly,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf049de7fd40d1cefdba439/1:1/w_160/FullOfHell_WeepingChoir.jpg,2019-06-08 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/full-of-hell-weeping-choir/,Relapse,"Full of Hell can be hard to parse, even for those well-versed in grindcore or for connoisseurs of harsh noise. The East Coast outfit—with its members split between Maryland and Pennsylvania—have made their name by cracking apart genre conventions like oracle bones. Grindcore, hardcore, and death metal meet within their music to produce something feral and unknowable, doubly so when they team up with other like-minded oddballs like The Body or Merzbow. There’s just something about them, a reason that they’ve been met with such acclaim and fervent fandom. The nihilistic vibe helps—when Samuel DiGristine gurgles, “All goes onward and outward/All collapses” on “Silmaril,” it’s hard not to shudder. Recorded by the legendary Kurt Ballou at God City, the band’s third album (and Relapse Records debut) is intended as a companion piece to the band’s innovative 2017 LP, Trumpeting Ecstasy, but even a passing listen shows that the band’s interests have shifted a bit. The band’s affinity for the most bestial side of grind is on full display, and on Weeping Choir, only death is real. “Burning Myrrh” blasts the record wide open with two minutes of pummeling grind, dual vocalists Dylan Walker and Samuel DiGristine frantically trading off registers like they’re pulling a double shift in hell’s biggest department store. “Haunted Arches” abruptly ends with a few seconds of warped, ghostly audio reminiscent of The Caretaker’s bastardized 1930s parlor recordings, before “Thundering Hammers”—an apt title if there ever was one—comes crashing down, its destructive grooves redolent of classic Morbid Angel. They veer between the swampy, old-school stomp of death metal and cerebral, choppy swaths of experimental brutality, keeping the tone and pace unpredictable. “Downward” veers away from the bludgeoning pace of the album’s first half into more complex territory, while “Silmaril” is distinguished by its inhuman howls and gleefully ignorant goregrind stomp. The track that separates the two, “Armory of Obsidian Glass,” is an album highlight—a measured dollop of thoroughly haunted death/doom that stretches to nearly seven minutes, periodically collapsing into puddles of sometimes-wretched, often-lovely ambient noise and featuring guest vocals from Lingua Ignota’s Kristin Hayter. The profane marriage of old and new, big ugly riffs and shrieking noise, beauty and brutality seems like the clearest marker indicating where Full of Hell may intend to head next.","On their Relapse debut, the infernal Full of Hell crack apart metal genres like oracle bones.

Pale Bloom,Sarah Davachi,by: Thea Ballard,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ce32205fa43fd6e96067fdc/1:1/w_160/SarahDavachi_PaleBloom.jpg,2019-06-08 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sarah-davachi-pale-bloom/,W.25TH,"Each of Sarah Davachi’s releases develops a distinct sense of place. Though her last few records have comprised subtle electroacoustic renderings of instrumental textures, Davachi has also intermittently played with compositional restraints, and Pale Bloom picks up that idea, beginning from the austere confines of the piano solo. The organ tones that undergirded much of her recent work suggested a secular version of the church nave. Here, the walls close in and we’re transported somewhere deceptively plain, to what might be an afternoon recital in someone’s home. Piano was Davachi’s first instrument, and on “Perfumes I–III,” the three-part suite that makes up Pale Bloom’s A-side, it plays an elemental, if ultimately complex, role. Before eventually returning to the sustained tones that characterize so much of her work, the album first wanders through the field of classical composition. The melody on “Perfumes I” is minor, elegant, affecting but grayscale. More dramatic than the piano notes themselves is the cold silence that punctuates them, lasting for seconds at a time. Midway through, a drone (the piano processed backwards?) begins to pulse its way to the forefront. It intensifies the sound—the piano takes on a slight dynamic insistence as it begins a heartrending ascent into a higher register—and also makes strange our sense of environment. It is as if a window in the room had let in an unsettling breeze from an advancing storm. “Perfumes II” begins with another subdued piano performance, winding its way to a yearning cluster of notes. This piece also hinges on the introduction of a new element at its midway point: a vocal performance by Fausto Dayap Daos, whose layered tenor phrases are swirled into a haunting chorus. Some iterations of his voice remain distant, but the piano stays close, our solid ground. On the suite’s concluding entry, space is at last filled all the way in with a series of sustained tones from an organ, which the piano accents in deliberately applied chords. In place of the movement of the two preceding pieces, here she explores a developing relationship between the two sets of tones; it invites sinking in, an unexpected encounter with the sublime. I’ve been turning to Davachi’s work when craving a kind of blossoming pathos; recent compositions like “Third Hour” and “Buhrstone” ache their way to vivid peaks. In a productive rebuke of that habit of listening, there’s a focused severity here—again, the recital quality, a sense of solemnity—that forecloses any dramatic displays of emotion. That doesn’t mean that the stark lines of Pale Bloom don’t resonate with feeling, but it is, perhaps, a feeling distilled, feeling so concentrated we have to work a little harder to make sense of it as listeners. The album’s B-side, “If It Pleased Me to Appear to You Wrapped in This Drapery,” matches “Perfumes I–III” in the way it builds up from musical elements at their most reduced. Single-note threads of viola and violin perform a call-and-response dance and eventually intersect in crystalline layers. When they’re joined by the warmth of pipe organ in a lower register, the unadorned fullness of the sound is nearly overwhelming. The physical tension that makes these affecting notes possible resonates in the body, and when the entire thing turns discordant in the piece’s final minutes, we’re folded into its thread-by-thread dissolution. Even at their most rigorous, these compositions manage to hold the listener close—a bare but rewarding intimacy.","The Canadian composer turns from electroacoustic minimalism to contemplative, deeply focused compositions for piano, organ, voice, and strings.

Originals,Prince,by: Rebecca Bengal,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cdc329393a53637c91edb9b/1:1/w_160/Prince_Originals.jpg,2019-06-07 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/prince-originals/,Warner Bros.,"It was said that only Prince knew the combination to his legendary, quite literal vault with the spinning wheel doorknob. But sometime after his death on April 21, 2016, the hulking door was drilled open, revealing an astounding archive of unreleased songs—so many thousands of tapes and hard drives that his estate could allegedly release a Prince album every year for the next century. Now, the latest from the vault, comes Prince: Originals, a compilation of 14 previously unreleased songs written for other performers that prove once and for all that a Prince demo was often better than most other musicians’ finished songs. It offers a window onto the playfulness of his improvisations and, in a structure that mimics the range of an actual Prince album, shifts nimbly between up-tempo songs and ballads, sweat and tears, near impossible to stay sitting still while listening. In the winter after the release of his third album, Dirty Mind, 22-year-old Prince moved into what he’d call Kiowa Trail Home Studio in suburban Chanhassen, Minnesota, not far from what would become Paisley Park. Prince had its cream-colored exterior repainted with his favorite hue; it was nicknamed the Purple House. Outside was the driveway where he’d do motorcycle laps practicing for Purple Rain and the gates he decorated with a sculpted heart and peace sign. Inside, he outfitted his studio with a 16-track recorder and later upgraded to a 24-track Ampex MM1200, with a piano upstairs for any sudden inspiration. Inside the Purple House, large parts of Controversy, 1999, Purple Rain, and Sign o’ the Times were recorded, as well as about half the songs on Originals (most of the rest were recorded at Sunset Sound in Los Angeles). In 1985, when he sat with a Rolling Stone reporter on the white plush carpet of the bedroom at Kiowa Trail, he said that he finally came to understand why his musician father was so hard to live with. “When he was working or thinking, he had a private pulse going constantly inside him,” Prince said. “I don’t know, your bloodstream beats differently.” Discovering some of the unscripted moments in Originals feels like taking that pulse. Written into his Warner Bros. contract was a clause that allowed him to recruit and produce other artists. It essentially assured him access to a congregation of performers who would spread the gospel of his music—the pop-funk he’d canonized in his early records, and a vast and uncharted road ahead, both under his own name and others. Sometimes he adopted an alias—as Joey Coco, for instance, for the power crooner “You’re My Love,” one of the surprises on Originals. It appeared on Kenny Rogers' 1986 album They Don't Make Them Like They Used To, but Rogers’ version pales next to Prince’s, who uses a deeper, full-throated register that sounds an imitation of what he thought Kenny Rogers should sound like. But the Prince of Dirty Mind and Controversy didn’t exactly mesh with Nashville of the 1980s—what would the world have thought then if he released a country song? Giving that song to another voice freed him to fly elsewhere. Better known is his alias for “Manic Monday,” which charted at No. 2 for the Bangles, second only to Prince’s own smash “Kiss.” Here, Prince is “Christopher,” a reference to his character from his 1986 film Under the Cherry Moon. The song, triggered by a dream he wrote into the lyrics, is essentially a rewrite of “1999,” and Prince’s rendering of it here centers on a synthesized harpsichord and the psychedelic flourish of the song’s bridge, which sounds as if Alice just dropped in the rabbit hole. Most of the other tracks on Originals represent even greater gifts. Prince gave songs to Minneapolis’ great performers: Morris Day, Sheila E., Jill Jones, Apollonia, among others. By spreading out the credits, “he was creating the wave, but he made it seem like there was a lot of people doing that thing in Minneapolis, which was brilliant,” engineer David Z once said. To the press, Prince acted nonchalant. “I usually try to give up a groove to somebody if they ask me,” he said. These grooves are the dance-floor core of Originals. Prince’s version of “Jungle Love” is close to the rendition on the Time’s Ice Cream Castles and the Purple Rain soundtrack, down to the “oh-we-oh-we-oh” chorus, but embedded with his ad-libs (“If you’re hungry, take a bite outta me!”). Prince had showed up in the studio shirtless with one bandana around his neck and another tied on his ripped red pants, but he loosens up in the recording. “Somebody bring me a mirror!” you hear him shout midway through. He gets it in “Make-Up,” a torrid electric number that was fine on Vanity 6’s lone solo album but made surprising and transgressive by Prince, who voices the lyrics in robotic staccato bursts: “Blush. Eyeliner. Hush. See what you made me do.” It has the percussive electricity of Liquid Liquid and maybe a little Kraftwerk too, androgynous Prince at his most diva: “Smoke. A. Cigarette,” he retorts to an impatient lover. “I’m. Not. Ready Yet.” How wild that a chronicle of a lost era can feel so modern when all over it are musical markers of the ’80s: synths and drum machines and clap tracks and extended breakdowns and of course, sax solos. Nostalgia, even rendered fresh, works on the ear in invisible ways, as does the sequence of these songs. We careen between slow-burning love songs (witness Prince’s glorious falsetto over the heartbeat percussion of “Baby, You’re a Trip,” which Prince wrote for Jill Jones, about the time she snooped in his diary after he read hers) and more quintessential dance hits. “Holly Rock,” which he gave to Sheila E. for the Krush Groove soundtrack, is snappily upbeat, Prince punctuating the chorus with James Brown-esque flourishes (“I’m bad, good god!”) and a snarky taunt at the end: “Now try to dance like that,” he says. “Nothing Compares 2 U,” the best-known and most-loved of all the songs here, became a massive hit for Sinéad O’Connor, whose rendition was, in fact, a cover, not one of Prince’s gifts. Here, in its original incarnation, Prince turns it into a torch song for himself. He lets a love-worn raggedness occasionally creep into his voice, lets it tremble ever so, powered by the saxophone accompaniment of longtime Family and Revolution member Eric Leeds. The video shows a collage of Prince and his band running through stage choreography: dressed in a scarf worn as a backless shirt, or suspenders and white high-heeled boots, he delivers perfect splits, kicks, and spins. But the arrangement here is stark and lonely and beautiful, the closest you get to hearing Prince’s own pulse. Arriving at the end of this set of originals, and with the promise of hearing more from that vault, it becomes an affirmation too. Maybe all those flowers you planted in the backyard will bloom again.","Hearing Prince sing these songs that he gave to other performers brings you close to the pulse of his artistry: transgressive, funky, sexy, a testament to his genius even in the form of demos.

What the Brokenhearted Do...,Tim Heidecker,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf57cef13c07d454115db78/1:1/w_160/TimHeidecker_WhatTheBrokenheartedDo.jpg,2019-06-07 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tim-heidecker-what-the-brokenhearted-do/,Jagjaguwar,"As a singer-songwriter, Tim Heidecker maintains an intimate connection to mankind at its most pathetic. This extends to the most powerful men—his 2017 set of protest songs about the president—to the most mundane. On 2016’s In Glendale, he set music to the kinds of banal stories you reserve for lulls in conversation around people with whom you have very little in common: the time you ran into a celebrity in Los Angeles, that morning when you were too hungover to go into the office. Where Tim Heidecker the comedian is interested in exploding these familiar scenes with surrealism, nihilism, or his trademark is-he-even-kidding-anymore dickish persistence, his songwriting presents adult life in the dry, unromantic scenes it’s mostly filled with. The joke is that there is no joke; start getting used to it. A breakup album seems like the logical next step for this fascination. It helps that Heidecker’s musical influences—Los Angeles heroes like Randy Newman, Harry Nilsson, and Warren Zevon—are known for making their ugliest thoughts sound clever and sweet. Produced by Foxygen’s Jonathan Rado to sound like the spur-of-the-moment brainstorming session that it probably was, Heidecker’s latest album, What the Brokenhearted Do…, captures vignettes of the newly divorced in all their moments of crisis and stasis. You sense that he sourced his pain from a long history of classic rock bummer anthems, and there’s something inherently entertaining in hearing him carve out a space among them. Of course, there’s one thing that all those breakup albums have that Heidecker does not: actual heartbreak. He’s been clear about this record being “non-autobiographical.” It was inspired by a rumor spread by right-wing trolls about his wife leaving him, and the pain in the songs rarely feels like more than just a writing prompt. In the place of emotional specificity or raw nerves, he gives us spot-on genre exercises (the On the Beach drag of “Finally Getting Over,” the sunny jangle of “Insomnia”) and a few keyed-in moments of inspiration. “When I Get Up” is an incessantly upbeat pop song that makes a point of going nowhere. As with his brilliant comedy series “On Cinema at the Cinema” and “Decker,” Heidecker’s dry delivery and the seemingly strict template belie how much craft is actually going on under the surface. The pose of rudderlessness and effortlessness, as always, suits him. Spreading this mood across 11 folk-rock tracks, Heidecker seems to take a “Well, how hard can it be?” approach to songwriting—an openness to cliché, stream-of-consciousness, and the first rhyme that comes to him. It’s a tendency that also shows why he is particularly gifted at parodying (and forecasting) the late-career work of artists like Bob Dylan. (“As great as he is,” Heidecker once observed, “He only has so many moves.”) His own songwriting takes similar short-cuts, as he limits his scope to the immediately visible and moves as swiftly as possible from one idea to the next. In the music video for “When I Get Up,” Heidecker plays himself pitching an elaborately choreographed visual accompaniment, only to be told that the budget is not nearly big enough to accommodate the concept. “We’ll figure something out,” he mutters in defeat, conceding to the low stakes of this type of project as a whole. Even with its humble aspirations, Brokenhearted makes a compelling case for Heidecker as a musician, beyond his more recognizable creative outlets. His career has long been defined by an instinctual drive to not repeat himself; as soon as one of his ideas starts to gain traction in popular culture, he’s often moved onto something new, in a different medium, with different collaborators. This deep-rooted adventurousness and indifference to popular perception actually aligns him more with fellow indie artists on Jagjaguwar than any comedian he came up with in the ’00s, and by this metric, Brokenhearted is his fullest musical statement yet. In mining songwriting’s most fruitful subject matter for its most unglamorous revelations, Heidecker leads us toward a punchline consistent within his catalog: it’s a breakup album, with all the heart scooped out.","The comedian and musician brings his dry absurdity and taste for 1970s singer-songwriters to a novel venture: a fake breakup album.

Lust for Youth,Lust for Youth,by: Larry Fitzmaurice,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cefef2693a53659ed1ee6b8/1:1/w_160/LustForYouth_LustForYouth.jpg,2019-06-07 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lust-for-youth-lust-for-youth/,Sacred Bones,"Coldwave never cared about you. The minimalistic, machine-driven sound that bubbled up twice in the past half-century—once in the midst of post-punk's late-1970s heyday, and again in early-2010s Brooklyn—was largely reliant on keeping its audience at bay, all but ensuring its limited shelf life. With synth lines so brittle that you could snap them over your pinky finger, hissy drum machines, and vocals that frequently bordered on atonality, coldwave was purposefully alienating. A lot of DIY or home-recorded music from this decade gained recognition from its warmth and inviting textures; in stark opposition, coldwave's practitioners rarely seemed interested in whether anyone was listening at all. The subgenre's aesthetic limitations are baked in, and practically a virtue, which makes Lust for Youth's trajectory over the last three years all the more fascinating. When Swedish synth aesthete Hannes Norrvide's project emerged with his 2011 debut Solar Flare, all the marks of coldwave's sub-zero sound were present and accounted for, and it was still mostly business as usual when Loke Rahbek (who also founded the aptly-named Posh Isolation label) joined up for the following year's Sacred Bones debut Growing Seeds. But as Lust for Youth persisted, there emerged signs of life after coldwave. Pomegranate from 2013—billed as a collaboration between Norrvide and Rahbek's Croatian Amor project—explored the opalescent clouds of new age; Perfect View from the same year incorporated conversational vocal samples not unlike something from the Swedish imprint Sincerely Yours. When International arrived in 2014—the fifth Lust for Youth release in the span of four years, evidence of coldwave’s one-take prolificacy—the group had expanded to a trio and tilted towards the explicitly poppier sounds of new wave, a journey they continued on 2016's Compassion. Their latest, a self-titled effort, finds Lust for Youth back to a two-person setup, Rahbek having departed while Norrvide and Malthe Fischer soldier on. The paring back of personnel isn't reflected in the record's sound, though; instead, Norrvide and Fischer pick up where Compassion left off, with gleaming synths and crisp drum patterns lovingly recalling the dour, sweet-and-sour synth-pop of New Order, Depeche Mode, and their thousands of imitators. Norrvide's vocals are front and center, and his voice often possesses a lovely ugliness that's alluring when cast in the right light, as when he scales the jagged pop mountains of “Adrift” or drapes himself over “Great Concerns.” Lust for Youth is at its most engaging when Norrvide and Fischer throw curveballs. They find an able collaborator in Danish musician and philosopher Soho Rezanejad, whose vocals add a glowing and gloomy texture to the slow-dance duskiness of “Fifth Terrace”; with wavering atmospherics lying under a cumulus of spoken-word, “Imola” suggests a sparser take on the starry-eyed synth fantasias of M83. Otherwise, Lust for Youth trades in one kind of over-familiarity for another. The gloriously mopey sound of new wave might be novel to Norrvide and Fischer, but there's not much here that stands out in synth-pop's always-crowded field. In a sense, that's fine; Lust for Youth wear this sound well. But Lust for Youth shows they might have escaped coldwave’s dead end only to settle into a rut.","Hannes Norrvide's long-running coldwave synth project breaks into the greener pastures of Depeche Mode-style new wave.

Spiritual 2,TENGGER,by: Jonathan Williger,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ce58225fa43fd3fb006808e/1:1/w_160/Tengger_Spiritual2.jpg,2019-06-07 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/tengger-spiritual-2/,Beyond Beyond is Beyond,"A fascination with devotional sound-making is at the heart of TENGGER’s music. In a list of inspirations for their new album, Spiritual 2, the South Korea-based duo of itta (harmonium and voice) and Marqido (analog synth) includes a video of Zen master Shunryu Suzuki speaking about sound in Zen practice, as well as recordings of medieval organ music and shamanistic rites. Their Minishiko cassette collects sounds from a pilgrimage to the Japanese island of Shikoku, layering the ambience of 88 Buddhist temples. What joins all of these things is sound’s ability to point the mind toward the unseen—to express what lies beyond the reach of everyday human perception. The duo’s music, largely indebted to new age, krautrock, and various strains of Asian folk, is built around immersive drones and trance-inducing repetition. These are characteristics common throughout many different devotional styles, from Hindustani classical music’s use of tamboura to the ecstatic call and response of gospel. Though synthesizer is their primary tool, there is a naturalistic feel to the pieces on Spiritual 2, which unfold slowly and deliberately. Even when the tempo is fast, as on opener “High,” which is underpinned by an incessant motorik beat, elements enter and recede at a defiantly gradual pace. Spiritual 2 is best at its most nebulous, when the music focuses predominantly on texture and immersion. “Kyrie,” named for a Popul Vuh song, from Hossiana Mantra, that features Korean singer Djong Yun, is a remarkable slow build, with gossamer, high-pitched synthesizer pads cyclically ceding to waves of bass-heavy harmonium. Each successive crescendo becomes more harmonically complex, tones stacking incrementally, joined in the final swells by itta’s wordless intonations. The album’s centerpiece, the 16-minute “Wasserwellen” (or “Water Wave”), has a similar structure of recession and expansion, with overlapping drones building almost imperceptibly to an arpeggiated crescendo that slowly decays throughout the last half of the piece. TENGGER's evocation of ecstatic states is less effective when they draw more explicitly from krautrock's rhythmic template. The repetitive motorik beat is inherently minimalistic, but it can become tedious. “High” and “Ajari” feature virtually identical drum-machine patterns and bouncing synth lines that share more than a passing resemblance. In Shunryu Suzuki’s seminal text Zen Mind, Beginner’s Mind (which itta and Marqido reference as an influence and guide), he describes repetition as the basis of enlightenment: “Actual practice is repeating over and over again until you become bread.” But here repetition feels less like the path to enlightenment and more like a lack of substantive development beyond a few basic musical building blocks. There is a renaissance happening in the wider Asian psychedelic music scene right now, building on the legacies of bands like Les Rallizes Denudes, Ghost, and Far East Family band, with labels like Guruguru Brain, which released TENGGER’s 2017 album Segye, leading the charge. TENGGER have the potential to be a major force here: Their music is conceptually  rich and frequently rewarding, and on Spiritual 2 they come close to fully integrating the lessons from the devotional styles they admire. The further they drift towards formlessness, the more effective they become.","The Seoul duo taps into devotional music’s focused intensity in trance-inducing pieces that draw on new age, krautrock, and folk.

Leak 04-13 (Bait Ones),Jai Paul,by: Ryan Dombal,Features Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf52a887fd40d3e59dba73d/1:1/w_160/JaiPaul_Leak04-13(BaitOnes).jpg,2019-06-06 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jai-paul-leak-04-13-bait-ones/,XL,"This is not the debut album from Jai Paul. It’s a collection of largely incomplete drafts that was stolen and illegally posted online in April 2013. Ever since, the 16-song release has lived on via dusty MP3s and cobbled-together YouTube playlists as a testament to boundless, unrealized promise. All the while, the London singer and producer stayed almost completely silent, creating a vacuum for an insatiable internet to fill with conspiracies, desires, and frustrations. That is, until last weekend. On June 1, along with two totally new songs, Paul put this work that was once ripped from his hands onto streaming services as well as his own website, alongside a heartfelt note to fans. “I’ve grown to appreciate that people have enjoyed that music and lived with it, and I accept that there is no way to put that shit back in the box,” the 30-year-old wrote. “Looking back, it’s sad to think about what could have been, but it is what it is and I had to let go.” Elsewhere in the statement, he candidly discussed the seismic breach of trust he felt following the initial leak as well as an unmoored feeling of being perpetually misunderstood. He wrote of a withdrawal, a breakdown, and a slow trek toward recovery, aided by therapy. The official release of the unofficial document Paul has decided to call Leak 04-13 (Bait Ones)—Bait Ones being a slangy working title for the project during the original sessions—brings with it a sense of closure, of finally wrangling some dominion over chaos. An ability to control the uncontrollable is part of what made Jai Paul’s music so mesmerizing in the first place. On the couple of songs he properly released before the leak, “BTSTU (Edit)” and “jasmine (demo),” he bent pop music to his off-kilter will. Both tracks, which also appear on Bait Ones, are at once propulsive and elusive, like quicksand pumping out of a speaker cone, with Paul’s mumbling falsetto self-consciously buried in the mix (in the recent note, he mentioned, “It will always be a little painful for me to listen to myself.”) Here was a guy in his early 20s spiking his obsessions with J Dilla, Michael Jackson, and D’Angelo with uncanny pauses, flyby instrument breaks, and laser zaps—a meticulous introvert whose slippery sound was soon being sampled by Drake and Beyoncé. When Paul arrived at the start of the decade, he found himself among a vanguard of innovative and ambitious musicians who were opening up a dialog with the major pop establishment. James Blake was stretching Destiny’s Child songs into alien new shapes; Bon Iver’s Justin Vernon was wailing on Kanye records; Rostam Batmanglij was toying with Auto-Tune in Vampire Weekend and Discovery; Frank Ocean was covering Coldplay with startling sincerity. Leading up to the 2013 leak, some of the feverish anticipation surrounding Paul’s official debut album involved the widespread notion that it was high time for him to fully claim his place alongside such peers—and that, if things fell into place, he could very well surpass them all. Then, everything fell apart. But the sketchy tracks that now comprise Bait Ones endured for good reason. To be clear, there are some differences between the original leak and this new version: Both are 16 tracks long and run around 38 minutes, but Bait Ones does not include some of the goofily endearing snatches of dialog from “Gossip Girl,” Harry Potter movies, and Tomb Raider video games due to sample-clearance issues. The fidelity of Bait Ones is sharper and richer than the low-quality leaked version, though the tracks were not remixed. Instead, an engineer combed through Paul’s archive of high-quality files in order to find the closest matches to each leaked song, according to his label, XL. Generally though, perhaps the most surprising thing about this peculiar re-release is how much hasn’t changed. Paul himself commented on the awkwardness of the endeavor in his statement. “It’s completely surreal to me that this music will now exist officially in this form, unfinished, and even sequenced by the people who leaked it!” he admitted, adding that, “Much of the tracking and production work was there, but it’s a shame about the scratch vocals and the overall mix.” The titles of 11 of the 16 songs here are amended with a word that serves as a lowkey warning, and a reminder: “Unfinished.” This is a little ironic, considering how the excitement of Paul’s music was always tangled up in its undoneness; official early singles “BTSTU (Edit)” and “jasmine (demo)” both had parenthetical notes in their names, suggesting eternal works in progress. All of it hinted at a keen understanding of the forever-tweaking online realm years before Kanye deemed his morphing The Life of Pablo a “living, breathing, changing creative expression” in 2016. But now, Paul’s tendency to leave threads dangling seems less like soothsaying and more like a compulsion: We may never know exactly how unfinished a lot of these tracks are, because Jai Paul may never know, either. Throughout Bait Ones, Paul sounds like he’s battling his own tentativeness, as he oscillates between indecision and bravado. Like his hero D’Angelo, who sang about his own notoriously measured creative pace on Voodoo’s “The Line,” Paul could be commiserating with impatient fans with lines here like, “This ain’t no quick ting, I won’t lie/It’s gonna take time.” On “Zion Wolf Theme,” he offers up a host of questions about his own fate without any definitive answers. “Can I make you fall in love with me?” he asks over a syncopated, sinister beat that would make prime-era Timbaland envious, perhaps addressing a potentially adoring public. Given the internet drama—and police investigation—surrounding the leak, along with Paul’s subsequent vanishing act, another couplet in the same song now feels tragically prescient: “In the company of thieves/Will I stay or will I leave?” Elsewhere, though, there are moments where Paul sounds exuberant, like he’s vanquishing his anxious demons one gargantuan synth riff at a time. If “jasmine (demo)” is a slurry drunk dial of a love song, “Genevieve” is its effervescent counterpart. Paul woos back an ex with confidence over a peacocking production jam-packed with cowbell, sci-fi blips, and orgasmic moans (it’s also the only song on Bait Ones with a notable addition compared to the leaked version, in the form of a pleading, minute-long outro). “100,000” is similarly preening, with Paul proclaiming his dominance over any and all competition while copping to the hard work he put in to attain that dominance; in his note, he mentioned that he had been working on the Bait Ones material for six years leading up to the 2013 leak. His conflicted attitude—hesitant but resolute—is stated best on the hook to “BTSTU (demo),” his first-ever release and the last song here, where he deadpans, “I know I’ve been gone a long time/But I’m back and I want what is mine.” There is just one full track on Bait Ones that does not come with some sort of parenthetical disclaimer in its title: According to this Jai Paul-sanctioned release, “Str8 Outta Mumbai” seems to be, maybe, dare I say—finished. Which makes sense, because it would be impossible to improve upon this. The mind reels when imagining the colossal impact this song could have made if it was given a proper release years ago—the charts it could have climbed, the brains it could have blown, the joy it could have spread. Propelled by samples of Ravi Shankar’s soundtrack for the 1979 Bollywood film Meera, “Str8 Outta Mumbai” is a miracle of cultural synthesis, in which a young British man of Indian descent gloriously expands what pop music can be. At the song’s apex, right when you expect a Prince-ly guitar solo to hit, a Hindi vocal sample erupts instead. I’ve listened to this song hundreds of times across the last six years, and that moment still fills me with awe. It’s the sound of borders breaking, of traditions mingling, of a utopian closeness that so often seems so far away.","The decade’s most tantalizing pop enigma officially releases a trove of unfinished material that was originally leaked online six years ago.

Venq Tolep,Robag Wruhme,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cd597ef93a536a67d1ed8b6/1:1/w_160/RobagWruhme%E2%80%94VenqTolep.jpg,2019-06-06 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/robag-wruhme-venq-tolep/,Pampa,"In Robag Wruhme’s world, the sun is forever on the horizon—the sky turning peach, the birds gently chirping, the moon hung just so. Once upon a time, the German producer born Gabor Schablitzki pursued a more antic muse. Both solo and in the duo Wighnomy Brothers, with Monkey Maffia, his productions epitomized the fidgety energy of the genre known simply as “minimal”: dry, scratchy rhythms, bristly as an anti-static brush, flecked with hiccupping repetitions and crisscrossing strobes. His 2004 album Wuzzlebud KK remains a masterpiece of the period, as burly a profile as minimal ever managed, but as the style’s flame faded and Wruhme’s rhythmic tics fell out of favor, he pivoted toward the moodier sounds of 2011’s Thora Vukk, finding a middle ground between his bruising dancefloor instincts and pensive jazz piano. Now, eight years later, Venq Tolep shows how much Wruhme has mellowed with age. This is the prettiest music he has ever made: The album is suffused with the wistful glow of radiant synths, the occasional piano or string ensemble, and largely wordless vocals. Lysann Zander, of the groups Stereofysh and Send More Cats, is credited on the first two tracks, but her voice has been rendered unintelligible, as pure, silky tone color. Rather than a collection of club tracks, Venq Tolep is poised in the gray area between home-listening house, ambient, and half-remembered vestiges of IDM. Sometimes it feels like an attempt to fashion a new kind of songwriting, one less dependent upon lyrics than simple human presence. The music isn’t beatless, by and large—as always, it swims in rippling drum programming, a stream of syncopated hi-hats and glitchy fills that move like liquid. His arrangements move in similar ways, surging forward and falling back just short of the anticipated peak. That curious sense of motion plays out across the album, translating to the only slightly frustrating thing about the record: Especially in its first half, as it skips across a succession of short, sketch-like pieces, Venq Tolep struggles to get going. The gentle “Westfal,” all backwards hi-hats and sighing vocoder, would make as fitting an introduction as the album’s actual opener, which precedes it; track three, “Iklahx,” peters out after a couple minutes of pitter-pat clicks and heavenly coos. Only with track four, “Ak-Do 5,” does Wruhme really find his percussive groove, wedding the airy sounds of early Boards of Canada to a crisp, decisive drumbeat, but then it’s back to the hammock, as though he were worn out from the brief exertion. Still, as horizontal house goes, it doesn’t get lovelier than this, and the album’s reluctance to deliver dopamine hits when they’re expected also translates to one of its more alluring qualities: the frequent tension between the harmonic and melodic qualities of traditional song form and dance music’s linear, repetitive structure. There’s only one fully vocal track: “Nata Alma,” a remix of Bugge Wesseltoft and Sidsel Endresen’s 1999 song “You Might Say,” a haunting plea from the depths of a failing relationship. This actually isn’t the first time Wruhme has reworked the song; the Wighnomy Brothers delivered a punchier version of it in 2003, but this one sounds little like the earlier remix. It’s sadder, slower, and more expansive. Endresen’s delivery is the perfect foil for Wruhme’s tearjerking: There’s real pathos there—you can practically make out the contours of the lump in her throat—but there’s even more restraint. The album ends with an outro that might at first seem like overkill, given the preponderance of intros, sketches, and interludes. It’s a simple conceit: Over plangent piano chords, friends from around the world phone in, say their names and hometown, and count to three in their native languages. Some names are familiar (Pampa boss DJ Koze, labelmate Axel Boman), some less so; they come from San Francisco, Hamburg, Tel Aviv, Santiago, and if there’s no obvious organizing principle, the scattered map points suggest a picture of international community, the kind fostered by a lifetime in independent music. It’s strangely affecting, this tender portrait of a chosen family, and proof of how Wruhme can elicit real emotion out of such humble stuff.","The German producer offers his prettiest, silkiest, and most poignant minimal electronic music ever.

April is the Cruellest Month,Masayuki Takayanagi New Direction Unit,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf00ffb85a35d2f53e64cc6/1:1/w_160/AprilIsTheCruellestMonth.jpg,2019-06-06 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/masayuki-takayanagi-new-direction-unit-april-is-the-cruellest-month/,Blank Forms,"Few record labels provided succor for generations of freaks, seekers, and weirdos like ESP-Disk. Founded by lawyer Bernard Stollman in New York’s bustling East Village in 1963 to promote the language of Esperanto, it soon pivoted to another kind of international language—music—introducing to the world the searing, ecstatic jazz of Albert Ayler and Sun Ra as well as the stoned folk of the Fugs and Pearls Before Swine. The ESP catalog still sounds like little else in recorded music, radically obliterating all preconceived notions of what a saxophonist, a jazz singer, percussionist, or rock band might sound like. If only the label had gotten to the singular guitar of Masayuki “Jojo” Takayanagi. That was the plan back in 1975 at least, when Stollman first encountered the Japanese guitarist and offered to put out a record on ESP-Disk. Takayanagi and band recorded a session in the spring of that year only to lose touch with Stollman over the summer. By fall the label was bankrupt and Takayanagi’s April is the Cruellest Month sat on a shelf, only seeing release on CD in Japan some 16 years later. Now rescued by New York’s Blank Forms label, April attempts to properly answer the big “What if?”s around it and to properly place Takayanagi as paterfamilias for the likes of Keiji Haino, Merzbow, Acid Mothers Temple, Michio Kurihara, and the PSF roster. There’s no need to blow the dust off, as it sounds as vital and unfettered in 2019 as it did forty years ago. Versed in blues, jazz standards, and modal excursions, but equally comfortable transforming his guitar into a gale-force storm (this particular concert from 1972 highlights his astonishing range), Masayuki “Jojo” Takayanagi got his start in cool jazz bands back in the 1950s. But his development paralleled that of jazz from halfway around the world, in particular the likes of 1960s Coltrane, forever seeking new vistas even as it challenged and alienated audiences. Takayanagi began to explore the sound of feedback as well as the kinds of sounds he could make by lying his guitar on a table top and attacking it with all manner of objects, be it a violin bow or metal. There are aspects of his sound that bring to mind the likes of Western peers like Jimi Hendrix, Sonny Sharrock, Derek Bailey, or AMM’s Keith Rowe, but those players’ sensibilities rarely overlap save in Takayanagi’s work. By the ‘70s, Takayanagi began to turn away from jazz completely, concerned less with chords and structure and more with conjuring elemental forces. One need only a few opening seconds from a live ""Mass Projection"" from 1973 to not so much hear as feel Takayanagi. April is the Cruellest Month captures Takayanagi during a fertile, frantic creative outburst in 1975, coming between formidable albums like Eclipse and Axis/ Another Revolable Thing. Had it come out back then, it would have been a mighty triumvirate for Takayanagi and a coup for the Japanese free-jazz scene, putting one of their most incandescent acts on the same roster as Ayler and introducing Japan’s music to the world at large. Similar in structure to Eclipse and Axis, April presents three different approaches across three long tracks gradually increasing in intensity and ferocity. “We Have Existed” features Kengi Mori’s flute, Nobuyoshi Ino’s kinetic bowed cello, and Hiroshi Yamazaki’s careening freeform percussion. Each member scrabbles away at their sound and Jojo’s guitar binds it all together. Approaching 20 minutes, “My Friend, Blood Shaking My Heart” is about as close as one can get to having a cyclone churn through your living room. In the ‘80s, Takayanagi would collaborate with John Zorn and perform at international jazz festivals, but it was a missed opportunity to not have the Western world know what fierce sounds were arising from Japan. It would take until the 1990s for adventurous listeners to have their eardrums blown out by the likes of Keiji Haino, Les Rallizes Dénudés, and the like. How many budding young American guitarists might have stumbled across Takayanagi and April is the Cruellest Month knowing that they too could push even further into the unknown? Cruelly unreleased at the time, Takayanagi’s sound remains formidable and transformative.","Unreleased at the time, the Japanese guitarist's elemental free jazz opus provides the missing link between Albert Ayler, Merzbow, and Acid Mothers Temple.

Out of Sight,Jake Xerxes Fussell,by: Jesse Jarnow,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cc9f131c13a45614ee82242/1:1/w_160/JakeXerxesFussell_OutOfSight.jpg,2019-06-06 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jake-xerxes-fussell-out-of-sight/,Paradise of Bachelors,"Musicians like Jake Xerxes Fussell are nearly as rare nowadays as the material he performs. “All songs are traditional & in the public domain,” reads the sole composition credit on Out of Sight, Fussell’s often-transcendent third album. Put another way: Each of these nine songs survived the great folk-pop copyright round-up of the 1950s and ’60s (and beyond), when publishers hunted down and claimed untold numbers of “traditional” melodies as their own. Fussell, as well as contemporaries like House and Land, Marisa Anderson, and others, are folk’s equivalent of organic farmers, reclaiming the genre from clever songwriters and pop mutators alike and expressing their voices by different parameters. Calling something “traditional” can be misleading—as House and Land’s Sarah Louise recently pointed out—but Out of Sight is a powerful reminder of music’s many vital, noncommercial pathways. More than a mere interpreter, Fussell is a folkie in the preservationist, pre-Bob Dylan sense—learning from field recordings, folklorists’ transcriptions, archives, other musicians, and even YouTube videos, notating his sources, and reanimating the music through rites of joyous antiquarianism. Arrangements like “Jubilee” and “The River St. Johns” honor the past through transformation rather than reinvention, placing Fussell closer to the ideals of the reverent ’50s folk revivalists than their radical ’60s counterparts. Most often playing a clean electric guitar rather than the expected acoustic, a subtle and effective twist, Fussell’s touch is light and dreamy. While the tempo and density might scan as “chill,” the music is so elegant as to resist stereotyping. It’s relaxing in the way that pondering a Zen koan is relaxing, and sweet in the way that the wounded, honey-voiced blues of Mississippi John Hurt are sweet. At its best, Out of Sight is timeless, both contemporary and not, its logic and concerns relatable, its arrangements neither rigidly authentic nor conspicuously modern. While this strategy might yield middlebrow twang in lesser hands, Fussell steps into the space naturally. On his earlier solo recordings, he created an ambience with only his guitar and voice; this album is his first to feature a band on all tracks. Drums make any patch of folk melody sound “new,” but can be a challenge to pull off without diminishing the music’s atemporal mysteries. On “The Rainbow Willow,” especially, Fussell’s next-level mellowness seems to emanate through the surrounding players, particularly pedal steel guitarist Nathan Golub and drummer Nathan Bowles (himself an acclaimed modern folk revivifier). When the rhythm section falls into this mode, they find that ambience, too—a warm and collective musical charisma that defines the sound of Out of Sight. On occasion, the album hovers at the fine line between laid-back and merely tasteful. The Irish song “Michael Was Hearty” (“See: ‘The Grand Match,’ Moira O’Neill, Songs of the Glens of Antrim, 1900”) edges on pub-folk fare. The music loses some of Fussell’s glow when it builds more on Bowles’ drums, finding grooves that veer towards the earthier sides of classic rock. “Winnsboro Cotton Mill Blues” (learned via Pete Seeger) sounds a bit like the Band, and the conversational pocket of “Oh Captain” (“a variant of deckhand’s song” first recorded in 1927) isn’t far from off-brand early-’70s Grateful Dead. It’s all enjoyable, but Fussell’s uniqueness gets lost. Most often, his bliss comes through in the atmosphere, which is when the music transcends notions of new or old, and Fussell’s particular creative voice rings most clearly. On “16-20,” a minimalist interpretation of a folk dance, Libby Rodenbough’s violin, Casey Toll’s bowed upright bass, and James Anthony Wallace’s organ combine and shift under Fussell’s guitar. It is perhaps the album’s most startling and contemporary-sounding moment, the instruments locking together into a powerful and nearly electronic vibration. It’s easiest to call it folk music, but it also resembles some of Yo La Tengo’s dronier moments. Though the music isn’t always urgent, Fussell is no nostalgic channeler, either, even if the songs are nearly 100 years old. For all its wholesome ingredients and folk-on-sleeve earnestness, Out of Sight settles into a space out of time, one immediately adjacent to our own, where perhaps the ancient magic hasn’t dissipated. The past is always present; Fussell’s trick is to reveal that—if you know how to look—the present is always past, too.","Neither rigidly authentic nor conspicuously modern, the North Carolina folk scholar honors the past through transformation rather than reinvention.

She Is Coming EP,Miley Cyrus,by: Katherine St. Asaph,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf528fdb14512cf8b667401/1:1/w_160/MileyCyrus_SheIsComingEP.jpg,2019-06-05 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/miley-cyrus-she-is-coming-ep/,RCA,"Everyone who’s paid attention to pop music this decade, even just a tiny bit, has likely had some small piece of their brain melt away, replaced forever with Miley Cyrus Discourse. The moments are there still, probably forever: Twerking. Foam fingers. Weed. Molly. Dolly. Nicki: “Miley, what’s good?” Happy Hippies. Dead Petz. Liam Hemsworth. Robin Thicke. The time she told Billboard she was done with hip-hop because it was “too much Lamborghini, got my Rolex, got a girl on my cock”; then walked that back after realizing it sounded ever so slightly insulting toward the genre she’d flung herself at; then released a few soft-rock singles so studiedly contrite it’s a wonder she didn’t go Mandy Moore and offer past buyers refunds; then declared herself “over it” before the album even came out. Why so fickle? Sales, partly (it’s easy to be over an album when the singles underperform) but also an underlying restlessness, especially with anything uncontroversial. In retrospect, the money quote in that Billboard story was near the beginning: “People stare at me anyway, but people stare at me a lot when I’m dressed as a ­fucking cat.” On She Is Coming, Miley Cyrus is not literally dressed as a fucking cat, but figuratively she might as well be. Nary a minute passes where she doesn’t remind us that she’s nasty, evil, unholy, obscene, a witch, a freak. She Is Coming is the first of three EPs that, along with the forthcoming She Is Here and She Is Everything, will eventually become a full album. EP trilogies like this are increasingly common, providing fans (and streaming services) with a steady drip-feed of new content, and providing labels with live A/B testing of musical styles: redefining yourself live without having to commit. Miss the days of Mike WiLL Made-It? He’s back, with more guest rappers. Relieved when Miley abandoned rap for chaste country songs? Mark Ronson follows up last year’s “Nothing Breaks Like a Heart” with another one. Fan of “RuPaul’s Drag Race”? Ru is on “Cattitude.” The stylistic whiplash is kind of like Charli XCX’s Pop 2, except not for experiments but for the many ways Miley Cyrus is back on her bullshit. We’ve heard Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz; this is Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Horse. “Unholy” is a book-report summary of “We Can’t Stop”; “Mother’s Daughter” is like Katy Perry’s “Swish Swish” and “Dark Horse” cooked together with a sprinkle of heartland corn. “Cattitude” is a RuPaul song that Cyrus crashes in a pussy hat; she may call herself nasty upwards of a dozen times, but she leaves the actual nastiness to RuPaul. Then, looming in the middle of the album, is the Ghostface Killah-featuring “D.R.E.A.M.” If you have even a glancing familiarity with the Wu-Tang Clan original, you know what’s coming. (Actually, you can probably think of about three things the D might stand for, each worse than the last.) But after an over-languid beat—the “C.R.E.A.M.” sample and Ghostface don’t come in toward the end, as if consciously distancing themselves from the song—and a truly puzzling first verse (“You’re in my bed uninvited/It’s fine ‘cause I’m in the mood/Hope you don’t mind if I spike it”) the only surprise is how anticlimactic it sounds when Cyrus sings the inevitable: “Drugs rule everything around me.” Cyrus has one of pop’s lustier, more robust voices, but here and elsewhere she rushes and swallows her lines, as if somehow ashamed. For a six-track EP, She Is Coming is remarkably repetitive, but it does manage a few OK spots. “Mother’s Daughter,” produced by Andrew Wyatt (Miike Snow), has a decent enough beat and the bridge gets in a good hook, albeit one nicked off Frank Ocean’s “Swim Good.” Swae Lee and Mike WiLL manage some late-summer languor on “Party Up the Street,” particularly the sumptuous “Downhill Lullaby” strings at the end. And while Cyrus isn’t exactly doing the most on “The Most,” it’s the best she's coasted on a country-ish arrangement since “The Climb.” But there’s the thing, the elephant in the room: The Cyrus family got its largest infusion of goodwill in decades after Billy Ray Cyrus joined the remix to “Old Town Road,” which has been No. 1 for nine weeks now. Not only is a 57-year-old more believably at the nexus of rap, country, and virality, but he’s also charting higher. SHE IS COMING, the title proclaims; problem is, people are already there.","The first EP of a forthcoming trilogy from the pop icon is all over the place. It misuses her talents and makes for a largely unrewarding listen.

solipsisters,Katie Dey,by: Miles Bowe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cf046b3779003859edb9ce7/1:1/w_160/KatieDey_Solipsisters.jpg,2019-06-05 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/katie-dey-solipsisters/,Run for Cover,"The internet can be a lonely place, but Katie Dey treats it like a one-way transmitter to other people feeling trapped in their homes, heads, or bodies. On her debut asdfasdf, the Melbourne songwriter shot her fragmented voice out of her isolated world and right into your own. Her heavily pitch-shifted coo on songs like “don’t be scared” and “fear o the dark” made the words difficult to understand, but the ineffability of the feelings was clear. If her vocals sometimes sounded more electrical than human, they also reminded you that, hey, brains run on electricity. On the new solipsisters, Dey moves closer to the mic than ever before, revealing the powerful lyricist hidden in plain sight. For all the scrambled sonics running through her music, Dey has proven a knack for careful pacing. Asdfasdf kicked in like a generator, building to an energetic peak on “Unkillable,” while 2016’s Flood Network staggered its songs with short interludes running from “(f1)” to “(f8).” solipsisters pushes off gently with “waves,” pairing crashing water and crumbling, distorted pulses that flow seamlessly into the title track. “solipsisting” builds with warm drums that swoop and crack in the air, and rather than ending after its ascendent climax, it simply floats in the immaculate atmosphere. Dey’s voice slides into textural fog, where acoustic guitars and synths tie loose knots that recall Feels-era Animal Collective, whose songs seemed to curiously wander past their logical conclusions. Dey’s attention to how her songs start, end, and connect has never been keener or better controlled. As seamlessly as “solipsisting” sneaks into view, “stuck” snaps to attention with crisp piano lines and pristine drums. “I was born inside this body and I’m stuck there/I’m a storm inside a rotting false construction,” Dey sings with surprising clarity. Her words, shared in a lyric sheet for the first time, nestle their sharp edges inside candy-coated sounds and unexpected details. “stuck” amplifies her strengths without losing the homespun intimacy that made her work so special, like when she punctuates a soaring chorus with a soft, throat-clearing cough. solipsisters’ suite-like uniformity and more balanced mix are a departure from the chaotic highs and lows of Dey’s early work, allowing the songs to support and play off one another. Repeated references to shells and waves ripple from the stunning centerpiece, “shell,” where Dey opens a reflection on her own voice with the line, “My soul sings in higher octaves than my larynx will allow.” In a recent interview, she explained that her virtuosic pitch-shifting was not only an artistic decision, but “a way of relieving dysphoria and making my own music more palatable for me to listen to so that it didn't upset me—like putting an Instagram filter on your face.” Over flourishes of drums and glowing synths, she finds melody and poetry in knotty phrases like, “Morphing esophageal practices hardening the lumps up in my throat/My heart throbs in impossible rhythms my head could never erode.” It’s transcendent enough to illuminate even the album’s darkest passages. In that same interview, Dey explained of solipsisters: “There’s a lot of ‘you’ and ‘me’ and ‘we,’ but it’s really all just about me, because I was so totally alone while I was writing these songs. You end up talking to yourself a lot if you’re isolated.” The album’s depictions of disconnection and depression are not easy to hear, even when surrounded by sounds that are, but in writing so passionately and honestly, Dey has initiated a powerful act of communion.

Introducing Juan Pablo,Juan Wauters,by: Steven Arroyo,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ce40b4cc13a45dc99e831e0/1:1/w_160/IntroducingJuanPablo_JuanWauters.jpg,2019-06-05 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/juan-wauters-introducing-juan-pablo/,Captured Tracks,"Introducing Juan Pablo is dotted with field recordings, snippets of real in-person or phone conversations between Juan Wauters and his family and acquaintances. It’s the first time the Uruguayan-American singer-songwriter used this technique on an album, which may come as a surprise if you’ve followed his work. Wauters’ style of songwriting already tends to feel just like those recordings: unspectacular moments captured in real time, in detail, featuring people as they are. His previous LP from earlier this year, La Onda de Juan Pablo, took that quality to a new level with songs inspired by and featuring musicians that he met while traveling across Latin America for two years—some written and recorded right there with them. Wauters’ name (Juan Pablo Wauters in full) graces the titles of both of these albums, but ultimately in more of a “the world according to…” kind of way. It’s as if the more he tries to take a self-portrait, the more those around him come into focus. On Introducing Juan Pablo, Wauters again seeks international inspiration, but less geographically focused this time. Introducing pulls from recording sessions in Toronto, London, Paris, and Wauters’ hometowns of Queens and Montevideo, Uruguay, while alternating between English and Spanish—his standard practice before the all-Spanish La Onda. It also features covers: a brief take on “Bolero” by the early-20th-century French composer Maurice Ravel, an altered version of a standard by Uruguayan singer Jaime Roos, and a gentle spin on Queen’s “Doing Alright” on top of a stray “Bohemian Rhapsody” interpolation elsewhere. If La Onda was a single category of Wauters’ inspirations, Introducing is a grab bag, a much wider, looser look at the songwriter through the lens of what interests him. This scattered focus ends up sacrificing some of what made La Onda such a compelling project, and the charming sloppiness occasionally bleeds too much into the writing and recording. Introducing strings together sonically sparse songs about being with and without others—and with far fewer backing musicians this time, it feels a little more “without.” “Rubia” still succeeds wonderfully on these terms, a longing love letter to someone with a memorable nose in a far-away country that Wauters drives home with one sweet, sensitively plucked acoustic melody for the outro. “Straighten Up and Lose,” an ode to risk-taking, ends the album in similar fashion with a small, high piano line made massive atop a blanket of drone. Wauters’ gift for these little musical phrases becomes the best part of Introducing. When the song “Letter” re-appears later in the album as a duet with the singer and visual artist Maxine Yolanda, whom Wauters met while traveling through Switzerland, it doesn’t feel superfluous. At the center of Introducing is the Jaime Roos cover, “El Hombre de la Calle,” translated into English and stripped down to a rudimentary single-piano arrangement. Roos’ original is exactly the type you’d expect would strike a chord in Wauters: a folk song describing a man who’s both anonymous and everywhere, popping with details as pedestrian as “a veces compra un diario” (“sometimes he buys a newspaper”). But Wauters sings his version in first person instead of third, as if he relates to Roos’ character too much to be a neutral narrator. He swaps in several new lyrics, too, most noticeably the final words of the chorus, which he sings in a suddenly strained, almost despairing tone: “People say I’m hard to read.” He sounds like he can’t for the life of him understand why this is. It’s true, though, in part because his focus is so often pointed outward rather than inward. When he keeps his sights focused that way, figuring him out is half the fun.","The Uruguayan-American singer-songwriter’s latest is a charmingly loose grab bag, dotted with field recordings and snippets of sampled conversation.

Mandy & the Jungle,Santi,by: Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ce5675d93a53605e31ee058/1:1/w_160/Santi_MandyAndTheJungle.jpg,2019-06-05 05:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/santi-mandy-and-the-jungle/,Monster Boy,"Santi is the de facto leader of Nigeria’s alté (or alternative) scene, a burgeoning collection of young artists who are defined by a moody, Western eclecticism and by an urge to separate themselves from the mainstream. To listeners in the United States, however, Santi’s music will feel distinctly familiar: It’s in intimate conversation with Views-era Drake, with Benny Blanco and Diplo. Like those artists, Santi makes smoothly effortless composite pop songs that sound like everywhere and nowhere. The 27-year-old Lagosian was raised on the Western music of the late ’90s and early ’00s, along with local music he was exposed to, he’s said, by “the gateman or the house help.” He started out as a rapper, under the name Ozzy B, and slowly incorporated other genres into his music. On Mandy & the Jungle, his sound—an ultra-simple, hyper-processed rap/R&B hybrid—is the sound of the airport lounge, of the antiseptic spaces in between more-exciting locales. With their sing-song melodies and light dancehall rhythms, tracks like “RX-64 (The Jungle),” “Sparky,” “Maria,” “Turn Down Mami,” and “Where You Been” make their way into your consciousness like air conditioning. They’re the twice-removed second cousins of seasonal favorites by artists like Baby Bash, Lumidee, and Wayne Wonder. Everything here is something you have heard, vaguely, somewhere else: “Murvlana” splits the difference between K-Ci & Jojo and Ryan Hemsworth. “Rapid Fire” includes a sudden, delightful interpolation of J-Lo and Ja Rule. And the guitar chords of “DSM” carry just the faintest echo of “Party in the USA.” This sense of constant recognition and recombination recalls Night Ripper or Feed the Animals. Like those Girl Talk albums, Mandy & the Jungle has no shortage of ear candy; also like those albums, it might make you a little sick after a while. Santi makes sure to interpolate Nigerian music alongside American hits, but the album never really feels local to anywhere. The songs are uprooted, placeless, all the more so when they refer explicitly to places. “Morocco” isn’t about anything, North African or otherwise. (Though Santi told ID it was about “a man who stumbles upon a land filled with women who appear to have mysterious powers.”) On “Monte Claire,” Santi mentions a big night in Sweden, and the only explanation for his choice of country is either that “Sweden” kind of rhymes with “leavin’” or that Santi’s been listening to Yung Lean. These songs are the sonic equivalents of screen savers, soothing in their artificiality, but disappearing the moment you focus on them. A few of the guests add life. On “Settle Down,” Ghanaian singer Amaarae says that “she’s swag-surfing off the San Francisco Bay,” which sounds like fun. GoldLink appears on “Maria,” perhaps the catchiest song here, and also avoids getting sucked into the Santi super-synthesis void. There comes a point where eclecticism become more depressing than impressive, and Santi’s music dances on top of that point. Santi has emphasized that Mandy is a concept album, but the lyrics are all over the place. Lines like “Do you remember the times we had?” or “I can breathe in Morocco” or “Mama’s always chasin’ the cop car, yeah yeah” are meant to float in through your ears with minimal friction or thought. DRAM sounds like the album’s superego on “Demon Hearts,” a familiar lament about digital alienation, double-tapping and backed-up mentions; eventually he dismisses social media in favor of money. A stranger and balder example comes on “Raw Dinner” when Santi says of a woman that “she don’t taste like anything.” Too often, this album doesn’t either.","The omnivorous Nigerian rapper-singer makes smoothly effortless genre hybrids that feel like everywhere and nowhere all at once.

ZUU,Denzel Curry,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ce57eda5a46c20d1609878f/1:1/w_160/DenzelCurry_ZUU.jpg,2019-06-04 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/denzel-curry-zuu/,Loma Vista,"Three years ago, Denzel Curry was working out how to represent Carol City, the Miami Gardens neighborhood he grew up in. The music he was making didn’t scream South Florida, the way, say, Kodak Black’s does, but he was a South Florida boy through and through, and he wanted to make that known. He’d rapped about how his city shaped him on songs like “Chief Forever,” but he could never quite channel and embody that love. It wasn’t until now, on his new album, ZUU, that he figured out how to show appreciation for and celebrate one of rap’s most underrated regions. Of course, Curry’s music has always been deeply indebted to the culture of his hometown. His initial mandate was to simply prove that Miami was more than Scarface, Art Basel, and spring breakers. “Most people come down here expecting that South Beach shit,” he said in 2014. “It’s not just that. We got hoods too.” ZUU dives even deeper. There is a familiarity that feels like watching a secret handshake. It doesn’t shy away from the nastier aspects of learning to love a violent place; on “P.A.T.” he raps, “I grew up in a city where most people have no goals/Just cold-blooded niggas in a place that never snow.” Deeply referential, ZUU scans Carol City, Dade County, the Greater Miami Area, and the wider South Florida milieu. From the Miami Bass of the ’80s to Port of Miami-esque coke-rap epics and the chants of Trick Daddy and Trina, through Raider Klan phonk and the bass-boosted rioters Curry helped pioneer with Ronny J, the album maps the sounds of Florida and his path through them. These are all touchpoints along a journey of self-discovery placing Curry’s music in the lineage of his great Miami forebears. It samples MC Cool Rock & MC Chaszy Chess, has a Bushy B interlude, references Blackland Radio 66.6., dusts off Ice Billion Berg, and pays homage to Plies. (The only person missing is fellow Carol City High alum Flo Rida.) There’s drug money, and speedboats, and ass shaking, and the U swagger. You can hear and come to appreciate his love for this place and its music. The album is so rich with the subtext of Florida, and local rap history, it feels lived in. He does this with Australian production duo Finatik N Zac, or FnZ, backing him. With credits on every Denzel Curry project since 2016’s Imperial, they have been as instrumental to his success as Ronny J. Here, they help realize his vision of a Miami rap mood board. They produce or co-produce eight of the 10 songs (excluding the two skits), stitching together something both nostalgic and forward-thinking. Their distinctive and vibrant octave-shifting synth lines help bond disparate templates, including the kingpin excesses of the Rick Ross-assisted “Birdz,” the twerker energy of “Shake 88,” and the trunk-rattling lows of “Carol Mart.” But the binding agent is Curry, who puts himself at the heart of the city. Inside the swirling, expansive tribute to his hometown, Denzel constructs his origin story. The album is at once personal and communal, splicing throughlines of individual identity and civic pride. “This what you made me, Carol City raised me/Trick said ‘I’m a Thug,’ that’s the hate you gave me,” he raps on the title track, connecting a local psalm to cross-generational hip-hop scripture. There are lessons from parents, memories from a since-demolished Miami Gardens flea market, quiet eulogies for XXXtentacion, who he recently described as his brother, the way Poseidon and Hades were brothers, and his actual brother Treon “Tree” Johnson, who died in 2014. Even more impressive than his mastery of the local musical language is how he puts his own music and story at the center of it all. He is the bridge connecting all these things. Since 2013’s Nostalgic 64, Curry has been a proven polymath. His raps can be blunt or sharp-edged. He’s as comfortable barring out over Wu-Tang beats as he is covering Rage Against the Machine. ZUU mines all of it to construct his most complete and thrilling music yet. It can be dark, it can be funny, it can irreverent, it can be urgent, but it’s never tonally unbalanced. He runs the full gamut from singsongy shapeshifter (“Wish”) to nuanced, panoramic storyteller (“RICKY”) to aggro black metal terrorist (“P.A.T.”). He has been all of these things before but he’s never put it all together like this. He took up freestyling while recording TA13OO last year and continued to do so in these sessions, and there’s a looseness to his verses that lends itself to the process of recall. Memories come flooding back with immediacy. He performs as if it’s all just coming to him in flashbacks, as if that history is in him. Being “raised off of Trina, Trick, Rick, and Plies” is his pedigree. There are few forces more powerful than the feeling of belonging. In creating his stunning Miami rap opus, Denzel Curry taps into that, demonstrating that he belongs among its most distinguished representatives in the process.","The South Florida rapper puts on for his city and delivers the best, most dynamic, and altogether hardest album of his career.

In the West,Silkworm,by: Sam Hockley-Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ceebc0885a35dec0ee64b07/1:1/w_160/Silkworm_InTheWest.jpg,2019-06-04 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/silkworm-in-the-west/,Comedy Minus One,"The same year that the Missoula-born, Seattle-based band Silkworm released their In the West, Kurt Cobain killed himself, ending an entire phase of rock music as we understood it. 1994 was an inflection point for alternative rock: Soundgarden released Superunknown. Weezer released The Blue Album. Hole’s Live Through This came out, as did Green Day’s Dookie and Pavement’s Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain. Silkworm’s album, despite being produced by Steve Albini, who finished In Utero for Nirvana the previous year, was lost in the shuffle. Much of that has to do with Silkworm’s sound, which gestured at popular rock music of the time, but used the form to create weird songs that sounded like they were scrawled on a napkin just before last call in a dive bar. Guitarist and vocalist Joel Phelps would soon leave the band, but In the West provided a blueprint for Silkworm’s entire catalog: discursive songs that devolved into twirls of feedback, mantra-like lyrics about escaping life, drinking, lost love, and feeling uncomfortable in your skin. Though Silkworm would later produce more focused efforts—1996’s Firewater chief among them—In the West is a fascinating document of nascent indie rock that sounds revelatory 25 years later. In Silkworm’s world, loneliness is inevitable, happiness deserves suspicion, and nostalgia is extremely dangerous. “This is the place that I miss the most, but this town is full of ghosts and I always feel like I am inside the throat of the devil here,” bassist Tim Midyett sings on “Garden City Blues,” the first words on the first song. One of Silkworm’s great tricks was that they managed to make overwhelming depression sound nimble. In the West is a heavy listen, but there is a deadpan quality to some of Phelps’ starkest declarations. There’s a nearly audible smirk in lyrics like, “Go into the woods and live with the bears/That way you can kill someone and nobody cares/And when we’ve had enough then it’s time to ascend to heaven.” There is no place for delusion in Silkworm’s world of hard-won epiphanies, and wherever there is clarity, there can be humor. The band keeps the emotions as messy around the edges as the arrangements. The volatility kept them unpredictable, which means that when Phelps erupts into a brief gut-wrenching scream midway through album centerpiece “Raised By Tigers,” it is so genuinely startling that it sounds improvised, a moment of catharsis that disappears as soon as it surfaces. In the West is a brief snapshot of a fascinating band hitting on a sound at exactly the wrong time. It was too heavy to slot next to other indie rock of the time, not heavy or self-serious enough to hang with the post-Nirvana grunge set. A lot of ‘90s rock music wallowed in misery, and Silkworm was certainly miserable. But they lived inside that pain with wry good humor and sang (and screamed) about it with a light touch. They didn’t point to a way through suffering, but they showed how to bear up under it with grace. This reissue somehow manages to offer too much bonus material without much new context. They seem to include every possible version and iteration of songs recorded circa In the West, and while it’s mildly interesting to listen to alternate takes, live versions and an entire concert from 1993, none of the material feels essential to anyone but devoted fans. Even for us, this stuff is a curio at best. Still, it’s worth calling out Albini’s rework of his own production here. The original’s density was occasionally frustrating: Phelps’ lyrics were sometimes lost in the mix, the bass overtook everything to the point that some of the more interesting guitar moments were muddled, and many tracks sounded like first takes cut right to tape. The reissue does a lot to clear that up, or at least more properly define what is supposed to be heard when. The bass is still very high in the mix—you can never not hear it, but thanks to Albini’s work on this reissue, you get a real sense that these songs were recorded in an actual room. The songs still resemble first takes, but they’re supposed to sound that way. Twenty five years later, it’s clear that In the West was the vital sound of a band of outsiders trying not to implode, and then realizing that sometimes imploding is part of human nature. In other words, it’s the sound of messy acceptance.","Though the Seattle band would produce more focused efforts, In the West is a fascinating document of nascent indie rock that sounds revelatory 25 years later.

Hot Spring,Spencer Radcliffe & Everyone Else,by: Thea Ballard,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ced6a9fc13a45c12ce83637/1:1/w_160/SpencerRadcliffe_HotSpring.jpg,2019-06-04 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/spencer-radcliffe-and-everyone-else-hot-spring/,Run for Cover,"Observational humor is a nice way to come to terms with anxiety, a good means by which to develop a gentler relationship with your environs. Spencer Radcliffe’s last full-band album, 2017’s Enjoy the Great Outdoors, was a treat for apocalyptically minded worrywarts, using dusty indie rock to frame an ill-fated attempt to escape a burning city that ended with the getaway car hitting a deer. The world evoked in that album’s sequel, Hot Spring, is just as fraught, but the songs are notably more relaxed. And it might be that by relaxing—by looking out and taking in instead projecting landscapes of nervous ideation from within—Radcliffe the songwriter can access and conjure a fraught world in richer detail. Great songs can come from both places, but Hot Spring taps something special with its wry experiential poetics. Among what Radcliffe sees around him: birds, bugs, dirt, neighbors, love. Ever attentive to the relentless passage of time, his lyrics place the listener in seasons, even if, per the album’s title, spring’s gotten so hot it might as well be summer. The scenery activated in his songs edges into the territory of some new American pastoral, and so it fits that the music itself takes on a rootsy sound. In the early moments of album opener “The Birds,” cello and pedal steel (a new addition to the Everyone Else band, by Pat Lyons) hum beneath bright acoustic-guitar chords, soon joined by padding drums and a sweet whisper of piano. Simple structures are thickened into full-scale landscapes. If the country-music thing does occasionally slide into the realm of winking pastiche, in general the instrumentation builds a stable ground that wasn’t there in the looser, more guitar-driven sound of Radcliffe’s earlier work. That sonic fullness translates into a kind of humidity, a persistent and sometimes dread-tinged sense of the buzz of living things. A handful of Radcliffe’s lyrical narratives hinge on journeys interrupted, which in turn become transformations of consciousness or self. On the slow-burning, sing-song “Clocktower,” he’s looking for a solitary walk when the person next door stops to chat. Their conversation shifts to an interior monologue about labor, time, and presence, and the song ends in two and a half minutes of the phrase “tick-tock” sung as a cheerful dirge over noodling guitar. In “Walking Back,” the album’s airiest and most wistful folk micro-anthem, Radcliffe realizes, mid-nostalgic stroll, the accidental violence of his movement: Ah, you could feel the heat
Of a thousand breaths
A thousand tiny cries rising up begging for mercy sweet
Though I’d been gentle in my step
To the bugs below, I was a giant
I meant certain death
The unplanned violence of a quest laid bare Bugs are everywhere in this album, an oddity that drifts Radcliffe’s plainspoken observations into something charmingly weird, even posthuman. “True Love’s Territory” trades environmental specificity for folk-song classicism; a chance meeting with a beau upends the narrator, who goes from a happily directionless flea to an explorer carving a path into the unknown. I could dig into Hot Spring’s latent themes—so delicately yet ironically tucked into all-American musical stylings—of climate change, of the (multispecies!) relationships that might guide our survival. It is, however incidentally, one of the better nature-in-a-post-natural-world albums I can think of. Still, there’s nothing lofty or terribly conceptual in the way these things emerge in Radcliffe’s breezy and mature songs, nor does the album push for anything more specific than looking closely and curiously at what’s around you. Hot Spring is of the everyday, and so even when it opens itself to deeper, darker places, it does so in a way that’s admirably comfortable and composed. I think of the lyrical ambivalence of the single “Here Comes the Snow,” one of my favorite songs from the album, which I listened to compulsively riding my bike around my North Carolina town during the tail end of our own literal hot spring. In one verse, darkness “dull[s] out the brightest things and cut[s] right to the core” so that “they don’t shine no more”; in another, a “new kind of light” is seen “lighting up the darkest parts/Melting the snow beneath your feet.” In lightness or in dark, the weather comes to pass, but I’m glad to have my senses widened by the detail with which Radcliffe renders the changing modes of its arrival.","The more relaxed, country-adjacent follow-up to 2017’s Enjoy the Great Outdoors pairs pastoral modes with surreal meditations on a warming world.

The Peyote Dance,Soundwalk CollectivePatti Smith,by: Sophie Kemp ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ceeba5f93a5361ed31ee4fd/1:1/w_160/SoundwalkCollectivePattiSmith_ThePeyoteDance.jpg,2019-06-04 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/soundwalk-collective-patti-smith-the-peyote-dance/,Bella Union,"In 1936, the celebrated French poet, playwright, and theorist Antonin Artaud traveled to Mexico’s Sierra Tarahumara to escape the confines of insular bourgeois society, seek out mystical ways of being, and kick an opioid addiction. He found the key to all three quests in peyote. The result of his hallucinogenic journey to the mountains was a 1945 collection of writing called The Peyote Dance, which today reads uncomfortably as a dated account of a European engaging in some drug tourism. It is as snooze-inducing as listening to someone you don’t like very much telling you about their experience with doing edibles on study abroad. It is also the source text of the second album from Soundwalk Collective with Patti Smith. Like the group’s last effort, The Peyote Dance features Smith interpreting another poet’s work over a series of field recordings processed through electronics and delay. Tracing Artaud’s footsteps, Soundwalk Collective went to Mexico to capture the sounds on the album (gusts of wind, crackling fire, a breeze flowing through leaves); one member actually took peyote while he was there. Following a Spanish-language introduction set to ritual drumming and read by Gael García Bernal in which Artaud describes experiencing “the two or three happiest days of my life,” the darkness sets in. Artaud’s writing offers a panoply of grotesque imagery (“urinary camphor from the bulge of the dead vagina which smacks us when we spread it out”) designed to shock. The poet was deeply influenced by Surrealism, which looked to dreams as a source of hidden truths.  And what better way to access dream states than through drugs? Reeling off line after line (“What does it mean? It means that Daddy-Mommy no longer buggers the innate pederast, the filthy tusk holes of the Christian fuckfests”) of Artaud’s psychoanalytical soul-dredging, Smith brings an undeniable urgency to the task, her voice a gravelly hiss. It’s too bad that her tenacious and tactile approach to these words is largely dwarfed by such monotonous backing tracks. You can only listen to thunderclaps in the distance for so long, and whatever Soundwalk Collective traveled to Mexico to capture—the spirit of the Rarámuri people, the echo of Artaud’s presence there—it doesn’t translate to tape. The music is hypnotic only in that it never seems to end. Artaud’s writing hasn’t aged well. Today, it smacks of exoticizing a persecuted group of people for the benefit of a privileged European traveler’s self-discovery. Smith’s interest in the subject matter makes sense, particularly given the prevalence of addiction among her friends and peers in New York’s underground. Still, hearing a piece like “Tutuguri: The Rite of Black Night” treat the Mexican landscape as one big drug-fueled apparition doesn’t feel great. The static-filled “Alienation and Black Magic” is more compelling, attacking “insane asylums [as] conscious and premeditated receptacles of black magic.” “There is nothing like an insane asylum for gently incubating death,” Smith intones, offering a bleak premonition of the final years of the poet’s life, as he cycled through one institution after another. Fortunately, one song on the album is unhindered by Artaud’s ramblings: the only track that Smith wrote, “Ivry.” On this nearly seven-minute lullaby, the proto-punk icon sings of vines, mothers, and lovely mornings. The fingerpicked guitar sparkles like a celestial body painted on a bedroom ceiling. It is a moment of clarity on an otherwise foggy and disappointing record, and it leaves you feeling full of light and ease, at least for a moment.","Over field recordings sourced from the Mexico of Antonin Artaud’s travels, the New York singer gives voice to the French poet’s hallucinogenic visions.

Rocketman (Music From the Motion Picture),Various Artists,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ced66dec13a459be3e83631/1:1/w_160/RocketmanOST.jpg,2019-06-03 05:00:00,,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/various-artists-rocketman-music-from-the-motion-picture/,Interscope,"Records are the constant in Elton John’s life. Records gave the young Reginald Dwight refuge during an unhappy childhood, records delivered him to stardom, records were his indulgence during the height of his 1970s stardom—Tower Records on the Sunset Strip used to shut down so Elton could ransack the racks in private—and records were his sustenance during his recovery from his myriad addictions, providing him a path into a stable, sustainable life and career in middle age and beyond. Which is why it’s odd that Rocketman (Music From The Motion Picture), by many respects the record of Elton John’s life—at least his life as it is depicted in Dexter Fletcher’s fantastical film of the rock star’s journey—is such a stilted affair. Much of the blame can be laid at the feet of Fletcher and producer Matthew Vaughn, who decided the music be sculpted to fit the contours of the silver screen, reworking and re-creating John’s original hits so they matched the emotional tenor of the stylized story being told. To that end, the production team hired the right music supervisor for the job: Giles Martin. Known now as the man overseeing reissues of the prime jewels in the Beatles’ catalog, Martin cut his teeth bringing the Fab Four to Vegas, creating the mashups that fueled Cirque Du Soleil’s extravaganza Love. Rocketman doesn’t take nearly as many risks as Love—at no point on the soundtrack are digital drum beats grafted upon the melodies—but Martin doesn’t quite treat the original recordings as sacred gospel. Sometimes, Martin slyly opens up a familiar tune so it feels slightly left of center: “Saturday Night’s Alright (For Fighting)” begins with a blast of guitars before dabbling in both mock-reggae and diluted psychedelia. But more often he favors productions that carefully tease out nostalgic memories without succumbing to rote replications. “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road” swaps out melancholy majesty for pomp and circumstance and “Take Me To The Pilot” submerges Paul Buckmaster’s gorgeous strings in aggressive R&B rhythms. The alterations aren’t as much reimaginations as they are a play upon our collective subconscious. By design, Martin’s new arrangements are made for the big screen, so every gesture is oversized and aimed at the cheap seats. This is a subtle but notable difference from John’s original records, evident in thick layers of choirs and strings, but also the studio band, who sound considerably stiffer on the rowdy early rockers (“Rock & Roll Madonna,” “Hercules,” “Honky Cat”) than Elton’s loose original crew. This is a problem that plagues Rocketman: The professional players can hit the marks but not with the same aplomb as the musicians who created the recordings in the first place. Such stuffiness was perhaps inevitable. During the 1970s, Elton John led a rock’n’roll band—and they were a band, not a collection of session musicians; he kept bassist Dee Murray, drummer Nigel Olsson and guitarist Davey Johnstone with him through the years, with the latter two still playing with Elton to this day—so his original recordings have a certain intangible raw soulfulness underneath Gus Dudgeon’s supple productions. Here, the music is intentionally buttoned up, meant to evoke memories instead of creating them. To that end, this precision is preferable for the actors who populate the cast of Rocketman, but their vocals are the ultimate undoing of the original soundtrack. Where the Queen biopic Bohemian Rhapsody relied on original Freddie Mercury vocals, Rocketman features Taron Egerton—a veteran of the Matthew Vaughn Kingsman film franchise—as Elton John, with occasional contributions from co-stars Jamie Bell, Kit Connor, and Bryce Dallas Howard. Egerton possesses a vocal timbre that’s reasonably similar to Elton John’s and he’s an adept enough vocalist, but he sings like an actor: He’s intent on playing a part instead of inhabiting a song. While this approach may be well-suited for a film, when his performance is heard as strictly a recording, his thinness as a vocalist becomes apparent. Egerton never digs into the meaning of the lyric—granted, Bernie Taupin’s obtuse words have been known to stump the best singers—preferring to glide by on cozy melodies and exacting replications of phrasing, a choice that undoes the ballads “Your Song” and “Amoreena” and keeps the wilder moments tame. The gap between Egerton and Elton comes into sharp relief on “(I’m Gonna) Love Me Again,” the triumphant number that closes the film and soundtrack alike. A seemingly effortless evocation of John’s buoyant mid-’70s peak, “(I’m Gonna) Love Me Again” is as autobiographical as Captain Fantastic & The Brown Dirt Cowboy—it prefers myth-making to soul-baring—but the revelation is how the duet finds John towering over Egerton. Older but still spry, Elton John commands attention on this newly-written number, a track that works because it’s as much a record as it is a song: the colors pop, the beat bounces, horns punctuate each hook, and the interaction between the singer and actor feels like an intentional act of dominance. And, in that sense, “(I’m Gonna) Love Me Again” illustrates once again that records are Elton John’s salvation, since even this single overshadows the mediocrity of Rocketman (Music From The Motion Picture), proving that even if somebody else is playing Elton John, the role still belongs to Reginald Dwight.","The music from Elton John’s life sinks into the uncanny valley with a studio band, a substitute singer, and a silver-screen production that misses the finer points of the legendary performer’s career.

Run Around the Sun,Sacred Paws,by: Arielle Gordon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cddbf4885a35d295ae64072/1:1/w_160/SacredPaws_RunAroundTheSun.jpg,2019-06-03 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sacred-paws-run-around-the-sun/,MergeRock Action,"The neon sheen of Carly Rae Jepsen may not be the first thing one associates with Sacred Paws, the UK duo known for Rachel Aggs’ loose guitar licks and Eilidh Rodgers’ punchy percussion. But the Canadian queen was evidently on their minds as they recorded their second album, Run Around the Sun: “We don’t make similar music but we want to create a similar feeling,” Aggs said of Jepsen in a recent interview. Over ten propulsive tracks, the similarities to Jepsen’s pop philosophy come into view: lyrics that detail arguments, anxieties, and regrets are set against the duo’s most exuberant work to date. Take “Life’s Too Short,” the bright and brassy third track. Its snappy snare hits and warm horn section feel primed for a party, but the duo is focused on an absentee lover: “I don’t know what you want/I don’t care, life’s too short.” “Shame on Me” similarly masquerades as a celebration filled with rubbery guitars, but Aggs’ and Rodgers’ sunny vocals wax nostalgic about a past romance: “Can’t you see this was meant to be forever?” The song ends as they repeat the titular phrase, an act of self-flagellation set to breakneck arpeggiated chords. Speed is perhaps the point here; whereas 2017’s Strike a Match punctuated energetic pacing with more meandering tracks, Run Around the Sun barely stops for breath. Aggs has called Sleater-Kinney’s The Hot Rock one of her biggest influences as a guitarist, and that album’s frenzied urgency manifests in the reverberating guitar squeals of “Brush Your Hair.” Sacred Paws’ lyrics share this immediacy; their strongest verses tend to open in media res. “Fresh air was everything,” Aggs declares on “What’s So Wrong,” and suddenly the scenery zooms into a perfect summer’s day. Sacred Paws have also mastered Sleater-Kinney’s fiery instrumental give-and-take, a shifting rhythm that constantly reestablishes the band’s center of gravity. Seven songs in, as the onslaught of Aggs’ fretwork threatens to send the record into a tailspin, “Is This Real” finds Rodgers unleashing a chorus of bells and claves. The power exchange extends to the verses, which diverge into anxious repartee that conjures miscommunication in a long-distance relationship. “The Conversation” sounds like an argument over a broken telephone (“Why would we even try to have this conversation?” Aggs asks stubbornly; “It can take a while,” Rodgers offers patiently). “Write This Down” finds the two nervously singing over each other, backgrounded by drum fills and crashing symbols. But more often than not, these parallel verses melt into triumphant harmonies. These moments, where Aggs and Rodgers tackle two distinct narratives that meet at the chorus, cement the band’s dynamic: controlled chaos that, against all odds, finds its way to a central refrain. Sacred Paws used to be a multi-city affair—Aggs in London, Rodgers in Glasgow—a fact that provided consistent interview fodder, and one they seem to nod to here. “It’s just a page on a map that’s keeping us apart,” they sing over Aggs’ meandering noodling on “How Far.” It’s by far the record’s slowest song, and one could read the chorus (“How long, how far”) as a plea to reconcile the miles between them. But if much of Run Around the Sun is concerned with repenting for past mistakes, the present looks brighter: Aggs recently relocated to Glasgow, where the two bandmates now share a back garden. On the closing track, “Other Side,” they reach an uneasy peace. “I found you/Nothing can stand between us,” Rodgers sings, while Aggs’ answer is more ominous: “I have changed in ways I can’t explain.” But her final riffs, reviving the song after its last refrain, hint that she’s having more fun than she might’ve let on.","The Scotland-based duo delight in controlled chaos, interweaving arguments and anxieties with their most exuberant work to date.

Pianoworks,Eluvium,by: Brian Howe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ced63ef93a536e7101ee488/1:1/w_160/Eluvium_Pianoworks.jpg,2019-06-03 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/eluvium-pianoworks/,Temporary Residence,"In 2004, Matthew Cooper released his second Eluvium album, An Accidental Memory in the Case of Death. The electronic ambient of his debut ceded the stage to unaccompanied piano, a choice that marked him as an artist who understood the true nature of the instrument. The piano is memory incarnate, an instrument made for remembering true things, which you can’t do without forgetting false ones—one track was called “Nepenthe,” a mythic elixir of amnesia. Since then, he’s tacked between electronic drone, quasi-chamber music, ambient pop, post-rock, and points outlying. But the piano has remained a stabilizing presence, holding up some of Cooper’s most memorable tracks, like the Philip Glass pastiche “Prelude for Time Feelers”. Pianoworks is his second solo piano record, and, considered alongside its 15-year-old predecessor, it reflects how he’s changed and how he hasn’t, as any mirror worth its magic should. Most obvious is Cooper’s growth as a player and a recording artist. An Accidental Memory sounds like someone sunk an old upright in the Pacific Ocean for a while, then hauled it up and stuck a microphone in it. Cooper’s unadorned etudes are as winsome and lulling as a baby’s mobile, which accounts for their classical-gateway-drug charm. But Pianoworks is clearly a more professional recording, with a broad, pearly sound, softly curved instead of flat and shrill. The compositions are consummate Eluvium, but the signature childlike wonder is underscored with mature regret and intellect. It is as if a musician once governed by stark emotions can now feel one thing while thinking another, in the middle of life, tugged by the immediacy of youth from one end and the mysteries of mortality from the other. Cooper has been tinkering with this record for years, and happily, it sounds like he spent much of that time paring it down. There’s no grandstanding in his playing, nothing inessential, nothing hidden in the fixed but flexible figures. Not every track earns its spareness: “Transfiguration One” feels static. But usually, Cooper’s tunes find the edge where memory blends into dream and linger there, their opening intervals stirring echoes of near-recognition (the first four notes of “Paper Autumnalia” nearly quote “Silent Night”) that isn’t broken when they take their own course. Eluvium is defined by instant legibility, and at worst, it can feel effective but easy, confected from the surface froth of 19th-century impressionism, 20th-century minimalism, and modern indie classical. You could say Cooper’s virtue and vice are the same: simplicity. But I’m not sure we’d have it any other way, and Pianoworks, retaining the virtue while dispersing the vice, hints that the farther he gets from the almost-remembered paradise he seeks, the richer his music is going to become.","Matthew Cooper's second solo piano record in 15 years glows with a childlike wonder underscored by mature regret.

Where Future Unfolds,Damon LocksBlack Monument Ensemble,by: Phillip Mlynar,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ce31b86c13a453494e8316f/1:1/w_160/DamonLocksBlackMonumentEnsemble_WhereFutureUnfolds.jpg,2019-06-03 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/damon-locks-where-future-unfolds/,International Anthem,"Four years ago, the Chicago-based improvisational artist Damon Locks began layering vocal samples of speeches from the Civil Rights movement over original beats programmed on a drum machine. These politically charged sound collages gradually expanded and transformed into the Black Monument Ensemble, a 15-member performance collective that features singers from the Chicago Children’s Choir and musicians active on the city’s jazz and improv scene, including clarinetist Angel Bat Dawid, drummer Dana Hall and percussionist Arif Smith. Where Future Unfolds is the fruit of Locks' vision, an ensemble performance recorded live at the Garfield Park Botanical Conservatory last year. Locks' project feels revelatory in its bridging of the past and future, its blend of old and new. This is uplifting activist jazz for tumultuous times. ""Statement Of Intent/Black Monument Theme” fires the ten-track album into life. It’s a song commandeered by Locks, who delivers an impassioned sermon against a backdrop of shimmering wind chimes and rattling percussion. “Confrontation/Dislocation by avenues and blocks/Whole neighborhoods upturned/Officials constantly re-framing, presenting, re-presenting, composing and positioning,"" roars Locks in a similar fashion to hip-hop poet Saul Williams, before reaching and repeating the climatic mantra “Some things never change—black monuments.” The music moves easily between Afrofuturist gospel—typified by the spacy synths of “Which I Believe It Will” and the luminous electro beats of “Which I Believe I Am”—and hip-hop grime. “The Colors That You Bring” sets the choir’s soulful harmonies against wavering strings and murky boom-bap drums, like a civil rights protest movie scored the RZA. Upping the intensity, sampled fragments of archived speeches are embedded in the songs; on “Solar Power” a voice proclaims, “There's no black person on this planet that will disagree with freedom.” These spoken snippets give the album a militant edge, recalling interludes from the classic Public Enemy records, where speeches from social reformers like Frederick Douglass were fused with steely breaks. Where Future Unfolds began as a retelling of the Civil Rights movement of the ’50s and ’60s, but as the title suggests, it is also concerned with what is to come. At one point we hear the sweet, youthful voice of Rayna Golding—the daughter of Black Monument Ensemble singer Monique Golding—leading the choir in a vow: “I can rebuild a nation no longer working out.” The line comes to encapsulate the tenor of the album: gritty sentiments that radiate an optimistic glow. In the way that music from old eras can be sampled and repurposed into new forms, Locks’s majestic work strives to reach better days by looking back and learning from the past.","The Chicago-based improvisational artist layers politically charged sound collages over drum machines and a children’s choir.

Terror Twilight,Pavement,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cdd9da8f2bde64243aad1da/1:1/w_160/Pavement_TerrorTwilight.jpg,2019-06-02 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pavement-terror-twilight/,Matador,"With the release of their second album, 1994’s Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain, Pavement seemed poised to become the next Nirvana—or at least a cooler, funnier, unrulier R.E.M. They conceded to releasing videos that could actually get played on MTV and lollygagged their way through a “Tonight Show” appearance, but their ambivalence to join the raging alt-rock revolution was made plain by album highlight “Range Life.” It used the most uncool sound at the time (throwback ’70s country rock) as a platform to take shots at the biggest bands at the time (Smashing Pumpkins, Stone Temple Pilots). To fans, “Range Life” was a form of quiet, casual protest against the increasingly homogenized world of post-Nirvana alt-rock; to detractors, it was proof of indie rock’s inherently elitist disdain toward the tastes of common people. In a SPIN interview from April 1994, lead singer Stephen Malkmus revealed that, actually, both sides had it wrong. “‘Range Life’ is supposed to be a person from the ’80s country-rock era, like Lone Justice or Dream Syndicate, not being able to keep up with what’s going on today,” he said. “It’s not a really a diss on [Smashing Pumpkins and Stone Temple Pilots]. It’s more like, ‘I don’t understand this MTV world.’ Like Brian Wilson’s ‘I Just Wasn’t Made For These Times.’” Here was Malkmus, at the very peak of his hype, forging a spiritual kinship with an obscure subgenre of a previous generation that had been deemed unfashionable by the shifting cultural tides. Maybe he knew that it would only be a matter of time before he’d find himself in a similar position. The next year, Pavement’s infamously difficult Wowee Zowee doubled down on their refusal to conform to the modern-rock marketplace—a possibility that seemingly died for good the moment the alt-bros started hurling mud bombs onstage during one of their Lollapalooza sets that year. But surprisingly enough, the crisp, crystalline follow-up, 1997’s Brighten the Corners, had all the markings of a concerted crossover bid. And where Pavement’s earlier albums spawned a hundred sloppy ’n’ sarcastic indie bands in their misfit-preppie image, by ’97, their influence was impacting the biggest rock acts in Britain. Blur’s Graham Coxon famously credited Pavement with inspiring his band to ditch Britpop for lo-fi noise on their caustic 1997 self-titled release. Elastica’s Justine Frischmann—then in the process of dismantling her own band’s pop appeal—became Malkmus’ duet partner and London crash-pad host. And though they seemed to exist in a completely different aesthetic universe at the time, Radiohead were professed fans, too. Pavement had gone mainstream, if only by proxy. But the indie culture that they once epitomized and still very much inhabited was rapidly shifting away from their brand of wry, off-kilter fuzz-rock, toward sensitive singer-songwriter expressionism and dramatic post-rock impressionism. The country-rock cosplay fiction of “Range Life” was slowly becoming their reality. So for a group that always sounded torn between playing ball and throwing the game, Pavement’s fifth album, Terror Twilight, was a suitably conflicted, ambiguous document of a band that wasn’t sure if it was ready to break big or break up. On the one hand, it presents us with a group that still hadn’t completely given up on the idea of expanding their cult—for the first time in their career, Pavement hired a big-time producer to take a more hands-on approach in reining in their stray slack. On the other hand, Pavement hardly resembled a hungry band with their eye on the prize. From Stockton, California (where Malkmus formed the band with childhood friend Scott “Spiral Stairs” Kannberg) to the University of Virginia (where Malkmus befriended percussionist/band mascot Bob Nastanovich), to New York (where superfan-turned-bassist Mark Ibold and Nastanovich’s old drummer pal Steve West came into the fold), the logistics of Pavement were always a challenge. By the late ’90s, all five members were living in different states spread across the country; the simple act of getting a practice together often required calling a travel agent. At a certain point, Malkmus wondered if all the frequent-flyer miles were worth it. Following a long Brighten the Corners PR campaign that left him “pretty fried,” Malkmus told Rolling Stone that maybe it was time for the band members to lay down some roots, sparking whispers of a breakup. After settling in Portland, he debuted a clutch of new songs at a couple of local acoustic shows in 1998, an uncharacteristic move that suggested if there were to be another Pavement album, it would be a Pavement album in name only. Nastanovich later admitted as much: ""Pavement music at this stage is Stephen Malkmus,"" he said in a 1999 interview. ""He’s the main songwriter, and the other four guys in the band are trying to make his songs as good as possible.” But for Malkmus, that process wasn’t happening nearly fast enough. As detailed in Rob Jovanovic’s 2004 Pavement bio, Perfect Sound Forever, Malkmus was growing increasingly tired of the band’s long-distance-relationship status and, once they were finally in the same room together, he’d get frustrated with the time it took to bring everyone up to speed. “I think he realized that we were at one pace, and he was at another pace,” West recounted, “He didn’t really want to have the patience to coax us along in music creativity.” With their time together at a premium, the band opted to focus on Malkmus’ readymade batch of songs, at the expense of developing ideas brought forth by Kannberg (who, despite bringing his power-pop A-game to the band’s most recent releases, would get no spotlight turns on the finished album). After a by-all-accounts dispiriting attempt to get the album off the ground in Portland, the band decided they needed a professional second opinion. Through their UK label head, Laurence Bell of Domino Records, they learned that another high-profile Brit had joined the Pavement fan club: producer Nigel Godrich, fresh off the consoles for Radiohead’s game-changing OK Computer and Beck’s celebrated space-folk detour Mutations. At the recommendation of the latter, Pavement hired Godrich over the phone without so much as a face-to-face meeting. But once the two parties got down to business, it soon became clear that Pavement’s haphazard work ethic didn’t so easily adapt to the producer’s discipline. Being a big fan of the band—and recognizing they didn’t exactly have a Radiohead-level budget to work with—Godrich offered Pavement the starving-artist’s special, forgoing his usual fee for future royalties and crashing on friends’ floors to keep expenses in check. But Godrich still had technical standards that were far more elevated than what Pavement were used to working with. After scrapping the band’s initial plan to record at Sonic Youth’s rehearsal room studio in Manhattan, Godrich moved operations to a proper 24-track facility nearby and then over to London’s famed RAK Studios for overdubs. Where the band previously used the studio as a sandbox, often emerging with a whole extra album’s worth of outtakes, Godrich had them focus on 12 songs, which were whipped into shape through a militaristic, blister-inducing regimen of repeated takes. (Only one, an instrumental freakout dubbed “Shagbag,” didn’t make the final cut.) And with the producer naturally conferring with Malkmus on most creative decisions, other band members started to feel disconnected from the process. (As Nastanovich claims in Perfect Sound Forever, over a week into the sessions, “I went to talk to Nigel and it was pretty clear that he didn’t know what my name was.”) In the end, Pavement were no longer the sort of band that left the mistakes in, even if it meant taking certain members’ contributions out: During the overdub sessions, West’s drum tracks on three songs were re-recorded by High Llamas drummer Dominic Murcott (ironic, since West was initially brought on to be the rhythmic anchor after the 1993 departure of wild-card original drummer Gary Young). On an album-by-album basis, Pavement tended to alternate between clamor and clarity. Terror Twilight, however, wound up pulling them in both directions at once. Depending on your vantage, it is either the band’s most polished, pop-friendly album or their darkest, most volatile one—laid-back in the classic West-coast Pavement style, yet atypically on edge at the same time. But Terror Twilight is the sort of counterintuitive album where the most melodically intricate songs feel so effortless, yet the slapdash irreverence that once came so naturally to Pavement feels more forced. The superior tracks further refined the eloquent songwriting Malkmus had introduced on the 1996 stop-gap single “Give It a Day,” where his signature, Velvet Underground-schooled drawl starting to give way to a more byzantine, classically British melodicism. “Spit on a Stranger” and “Ann Don’t Cry” also chipped away at the popular caricature of Malkmus as the aloof, inscrutable slacker, foregrounding the romanticism that’s always been lurking beneath the sardonic surface, where phrases that are difficult to understand allow him to access emotions that are difficult to express. (“My heart is not a wide open thing,” he sings knowingly on the latter track, a rare moment of candor where he fesses up to his aversion to candor.) If Malkmus had sung the line “bring on the major leagues” back in 1994, it would’ve been interpreted as a withering comment on moving up the corporate-rock ladder, but on Terror Twilight’s wistful serenade “Major Leagues,” it sounds like he’s bracing for the familial responsibilities that lay ahead in middle age. Godrich’s trademark atmospheric production finds its most natural fit with these more serene songs, casting them in a moonlit, magic-realist glow and letting the guitars sparkle. When they weren’t supporting Malkmus’ improved pop craftsmanship, the Pavement of the late ’90s were gradually turning into the world’s wooliest jam band. It’s a side of the band that really came to light on the Brighten the Corners tour, where songs like “Type Slowly” would get substantially stretched out and beefed up. They also frequently test-drove a new track called “And Then” that took the Slint-like mid-sections of songs like “Stop Breathin’” and “Transport Is Arranged” and invested them with a more ominous intensity. “And Then” would find a home deep into Terror Twilight’s second side, where it appeared with new lyrics and a new title, “The Hexx.” The Terror Twilight recording dials back the nasty psychedelic fuzz of the ’97-era live versions for more of a trembling chill, with Malkmus dropping creepy couplets (“Epileptic surgeons with their eyes X-ed out/Attend to the torn up kid/Salivate and reckon with all the sick things that you did”) as if entering a two-sentence horror-story challenge. “The Hexx” made a convincing case that Pavement’s future lay in weightier guitar workouts. However, the band’s other attempts to flex their rock muscle on Terror Twilight felt a bit like they were puffing out their chests. “Platform Blues” might have made more sense stitched into Wowee Zowee’s unwieldy sprawl, but feels too scattered to fill the role of centerpiece track—its spastic rave-ups (powered by guest harmonica-honkin’ from Radiohead’s Jonny Greenwood) come off like bar-band blooze delivered with air quotes. “Billie” disrupts one of Malkmus’ prettiest verses with an ugly sore-thumb of a chorus. And while “Speak, See, Remember” follows the same loose-intro/motorik-rock-out template as Wowee Zowee highlight “Half a Canyon,” it’s executed with half the focus and intensity. Compared to the unabashedly posh, big-ticket indie rock albums being released by their peers in 1999—like the Flaming Lips’ The Soft Bulletin and Guided by Voices’ Ric Ocasek-tweaked Do the Collapse—Terror Twilight’s willful oddness meant Pavement remained an island unto themselves. Despite the break-up murmurs, Terror Twilight was received by critics not as an assumed swan song, but a genuine next-level move.  The A.V. Club opined that “the time and effort invested in the new Terror Twilight seems to indicate that the group has no intention of throwing in the towel.” And for a while there, that seemed to be the case. Asked about his lack of songwriting contributions on the album, Kannberg told Rolling Stone there just wasn’t enough studio time to hash out his ideas before optimistically speculating he’d “just have more songs for the next record.” In Lance Bangs’ 2002 Pavement documentary Slow Century, we even see the band workshopping a new song during rehearsals for the Terror Twilight tour. That song, “Discretion Grove,” would soon see the light of day, but not on a Pavement album. It was the lead single from Malkmus’ self-titled 2001 solo debut, the first in a series of consistently enjoyable if far less-hyped albums with his current band, the Jicks (who he’s now fronted for nearly twice as long as Pavement—I guess there is something to be said for living in the same city as your bandmates). That first Malkmus record surfaced 14 months after Pavement played their final shows together in November 1999 at London’s Brixton Academy, at the end of a six-month promotional campaign where Malkmus reportedly turned more insular and unhappy over the course of the tour. Shortly thereafter, Domino announced the band would be “retiring for the foreseeable future”—a somewhat vague communique that further muddied the waters between those who wanted a proper break-up (Malkmus) and those who were anticipating a hiatus (everyone else). Ever since, it’s been hard to listen to Terror Twilight without sensing the 1000-point-font writing on the wall. After a decade of playfully confounding listeners with his elusive wordplay, Malkmus opened “Ann Don’t Cry” with a line so frank and literal, it essentially became Pavement’s epitaph: “The damage has been done/I am not having fun anymore.” Even now that he’s several years removed from the difficult circumstances that spawned the album, Malkmus’ estimation of Terror Twilight hasn’t exactly improved. Tellingly, it’s the one Pavement album that never received a deluxe 10th-anniversary reissue, a circumstance that can’t help but feel like an implicit judgment of the record. In a 2015 interview with Pitchfork, Malkmus half-jokingly called it “the accidental child of the Pavement catalog,” and in a 2017 Talkhouse podcast interview that detoured into an extended tangent on the album’s recording process, he quipped, “No one really cares about this album that much.” That’s not entirely true, of course: Kannberg holds a much more positive opinion of the record. And there’s evidence to suggest that Terror Twilight’s overtures toward pop accessibility didn’t fall completely on deaf ears—Grammy-winning bluegrass outfit Nickel Creek’s mandolin-tinged cover of “Spit on a Stranger” helped propel their 2002 album, This Side, into the Billboard Top 20. But if Terror Twilight was by no means a perfect album, it stands today as a perfectly emblematic one—of the band's demise, yes, but also the demise of the very underground/underdog idealism that Pavement represented. In its aesthetic tug-of-war between hi-fi futurism and contrarian weirdness, Terror Twilight portended an indie-rock landscape on the brink a dramatic sea change—a brand new era where Apple commercial syncs and selfie-sticked festival culture dictate that advertising looks and chops are indeed a must. Also, in their own oblique way, the album’s dark undercurrents and convulsive outbursts seemed to be subliminally preparing us for the more unsettled, chaotic world that awaited us on the other side of the new millennium. So maybe Terror Twilight is not merely the flawed, premature final act of an often brilliant band, but more like a savvy act of planned obsolescence from a group smart enough to sense the times were a-changin’, and honest enough to admit that they just weren’t made for them anymore.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible. Today, we revisit Pavement’s divisive final album, full of clamor and clarity that presaged the end of the underground.

Water Memory / Mount Vision,Emily A. Sprague,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cc9c4bcfa43fd7ec206719d/1:1/w_160/EmilyASprage_WaterMemory:NightVisions.png,2019-06-01 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/emily-a-sprague-water-memory-mount-vision/,Rvng Intl.,"When Los Angeles-based musician Emily Sprague steps away from her folky indie pop trio Florist to make music with modular synthesizers, her music becomes a tool for perception. Listening to it, you start to notice things. Not just about what’s unfolding in the music itself, but also about what’s going on in the room where it plays, and maybe even what happens when the music stops. Water Memory/Mount Vision collects two tapes of Sprague’s ambient music, both of which were created in the last two years, and frames them with brief spoken-word pieces. Along with artists like Kaitlyn Aurelia Smith, Sprague is part of a wave of artists returning ambient music to its spiritual roots, which is to say it’s not afraid of being called new age. Artists like Sprague often use old tools—modular synths instead of computers—and create spaces for relaxation and contemplation. Sprague is more or less a minimalist, but her work also carries hints of tension. She’s especially adept at taking two compelling elements and exploring how they interact, finding a third “thing” that ultimately becomes the piece. “A Lake,” a slowly unwinding drone consisting of a throbbing bass tone at the bottom and shimmers of high-pitched tones at the top, uncannily evokes the body of water in its title, hinting at lights on a rippling surface and an invisible world spreading out beneath. Its beauty brings to mind the lyricism of Takagi Masakatsu, but Sprague composes with more patience, content to let held tones linger in place for minutes at a time. The primary motif in “Water Memory 1” is a rising and repeating synth tone. Set against a sound that recalls a French horn, it vaguely suggests an orchestrated waltz that got stuck in place, not unlike William Basinki’s Disintegration Loops, but hopeful rather than forlorn. The Mount Vision half is a shade darker, and also finds Sprague incorporating acoustic sounds. “Synth 1” and “Synth 2” are more focused and intense and also a touch more psychedelic, their fat drones bringing to mind outer space instead of the natural world. The bubbling “Huckleberry” is suggestive of Suzanne Ciani, demonstrating how in the right hands electricity moving through a modular set-up can sound uncannily alive. “Piano 1” sounds like a recording of the instrument falling apart in slow motion, as Sprague takes a repeating keyboard phrase and pulls it apart taffy, finding a sense of wonder through subtle shifts in tempo and EQ. A variation of the track, “Piano 2,” closes the set, and features the piano sounds mixing with recordings of birds and insects. As it unfolds, a second recording of the piano part appears, slightly out of phase with the first, and the gaps in the notes become longer and it takes on an oblong gait, like a limp. These small, subtle changes define this music. When you return to silence after it’s over, you start to think about what else you might be missing.","The L.A.-based Sprague steps away from her indie pop trio Florist for rippling, patient, and redemptive ambient drone works for modular synthesizers.

From Here to Eternity,Kyle Bobby Dunn,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cd493effa43fd9877067808/1:1/w_160/KyleBobbyDunn_FromHereToEternity.jpg,2019-06-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kyle-bobby-dunn-from-here-to-eternity/,Past Inside the Present,"Kyle Bobby Dunn’s music is often described as “ambient drone,” but where that style can be austere and even forbidding, the Montreal musician’s work is warm and welcoming; where drones are often static, Dunn’s music is powered by deep harmonic movements, as fundamental as the tides, and just as imperceptible. His albums, all of which resemble each other in their broad strokes and abiding stillness, sometimes feel like invitations to disappear into a mood, the precise nature of which might vary depending upon your own headspace: contemplative, beatific, serene, sorrowful, perhaps some sublime amalgam of all those things and more. Or maybe they’re just invitations to disappear, period. An early album was called Music for Medication—glance quickly at the title and you might think of yoga or Zen, but no, that’s “medication” with a “c,” and the word is well suited to his blissfully horizontal pieces, their promise of both sweet release and its bitter, mortal kin. For all the obvious beauty of his work, with its gentle play of tension and resolution, there is also a terrifying finality implicit in pieces whose broad arc threatens to outlast us all. Keyed to a time beyond time, Dunn’s recordings tend to go long: 2012’s Bring Me the Head of Kyle Bobby Dunn, an IV drip of liquid tones, meted out 15 tracks in the space of two hours; 2014’s equally drifting Kyle Bobby Dunn & the Infinite Sadness stretched slightly longer. From Here to Eternity, his first album in five years, runs almost three hours. The shortest piece is less than two minutes, the longest more than 23, but unless you’re really paying close attention, you will not notice these durations; all his tracks are but shadows of a single permanence. It’s difficult if not impossible to say how he has made these pieces; the source material sounds acoustic, with the rich, buzzing resonance of strings, piano, oboe, and bowed metal, but smeared until there are no audible attacks, no evident origins whatsoever, just sounds that have always been there and always will be, moving like kelp or clouds. This is hardly a music without precedent—there are similarities to the work of Tim Hecker, the Caretaker, and, especially, Stars of the Lid and A Winged Victory for the Sullen—but something about the gracefulness of Dunn’s signature, as well as its inky intensity, is his alone. What does become apparent over time is the range he manages, even with such broadly consistent materials and themes. Despite the uniformly glacial pace, it becomes clear that not all glaciers are alike: There are tracks that sound like the instant after a church bell has stopped ringing, stretched toward infinity; there are elegiac pieces reminiscent of Gavin Bryars’ The Sinking of the Titanic; there are environments that build from darkness to blinding light, like the last moments of a life played out in slow motion. A few are deeply affecting for reasons I can’t pinpoint.
“Years Later Theme” and “La Stationnement de finders,” with their gently detuned layers and air of resignation, are two of the saddest songs I’ve ever heard. Dunn’s approach has remained so consistent across his career that the difference between this album and its predecessors is one of degree, not type, but it’s safe to say that From Here to Eternity plumbs newfound depths: There is a coppery burnish that was not there before, a tendency to float just beyond the bounds of our usual limits of musical perception. There is a sense of presence here that’s hard to put your finger on—an undercurrent, a shadow, something felt but not heard. It’s particularly noticeable in the closing “Eternity, the Stars & You,” an 18-minute track that starts out sounding like an ambient remix of the Cocteau Twins or This Mortal Coil: Deep in the mix, way below the shimmer of what might be reeds or hurdy gurdy, rumbles something like the drone of a faraway airplane. The sound intensifies and the harmonic intervals of his chords collapse, become dissonant. There might be voices in there; they sound like angels wailing. It’s beautiful and terrifying all at once, and it just builds like that until, some invisible peak having been reached, it fades swiftly to blackness. To try to capture the infinite on tape is a fool’s errand; what is so rewarding—so honest—about Dunn’s attempt is his willingness to look beyond his majestic vistas and stare directly into the sun.","The Montreal ambient musician’s albums all resemble each other in their broad strokes and abiding stillness. They are beautiful, terrifying, and bittersweet all at once.

Boat,Pip Blom,by: Margaret Farrell,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ce3202f5a46c2dfb9098687/1:1/w_160/PipBlom_Boat.jpg,2019-06-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pip-blom-boat/,HeavenlyPIAS,"Since the dawn of the internet, multitasking has become a way of life. In her namesake four-piece band, 23-year-old Amsterdam native Pip Blom cleverly weaponizes lapses in concentration to craft perky, grunge-lite melodies. “I’ll watch a documentary while playing guitar,” she explained earlier this year. “When I play something on my guitar that stands out more than the documentary does, then that becomes something I should use.” While she’s immersed in stories about interesting people or mental illness (her preferred choice of docs), a hypnotic melody or peculiar chord progression pushes to the front. These become the quartet’s thumping heart: moody riffs, steady post-punk percussion, and ebullient hooks that sink deep. The catchiness and ease of the songs on the band’s debut album Boat overshadow the self-aware lyrics. Blom’s vocals, although clear, are undercut by just the right amount of pop-fuzz aggression. Boat is an enjoyable and uncomplicated listen, but it’s hindered by the sense that the production and vocals are built on top of each other, instead of building space for each other. Some songs feel rambling, while others have clear conviction. On standout “Bedhead,” lethargic strums and tempered drums build around Blom’s vocals in perfect symbiosis. “I woke up, felt like I never slept/No one knew what was wrong,” she sings, describing a mental exhaustion that goes well past everyday grogginess into a dark, depressive hole. Her voice comes closer during the chorus, strengthening the band’s scruffy pop with emotional intimacy. In the rustling urgency of “Daddy Issues” and the zig-zagging laxity of “Sorry,” Boat offers many crisp, cozy moments. Throughout, the band teeters between themes of distraction, isolation, and victory over apathy. On “Ruby,” Blom sings about the dilemma of finally recovering: “The worst days are all over/But now that I feel fine, I don’t know what to do with all that time.” Whatever scenarios surround these new feelings are mysterious, sometimes sinister. Elsewhere, Blom seeks to numb her emotions as she prepares to act on an unnamed mistake—seemingly one of passion. A grimy bassline lurks like a devil on her shoulder, urging her to follow through. “Caught off guard by feelings/I felt happy,” she sings, with eerie perplexity during “Tinfoil.” Blom has said that it’s fine if listeners don’t hear all her words; she “finds the melody more personal.” By focusing on melody, their greatest strength, the band also emphasize their struggle to fully captivate. The songs on Boat are comfortable but far from the irreverent edge of the earlier singles like “School.” Some tracks have the excitement and magnetism of an encounter with a fascinating stranger, while others are merely pleasant. There’s solace in distraction; it can be satisfying just to let the noise wash over you, whether it’s an obscure documentary or a pacifying wave of distortion. There is no grand thesis or groundbreaking concept on Boat, but Pip Blom provide a welcoming nook for spacing out.","The Dutch quartet undercut their perky, grunge-lite melodies with just the right amount of pop-fuzz aggression.

Dispassionate EP,Together Pangea,by: Abby Jones,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ce6cccafa43fd7ba306813c/1:1/w_160/TogetherPangea_DispassionateEP.jpg,2019-06-01 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/together-pangea-dispassionate-ep/,Nettwerk,"Since their 2010 debut, Together Pangea, the Los Angeles trio behind songs like “Blood, Blood, Blood,” “Shitty,” and “Sick Shit,” have been heralded among their Southern California peers for blazing, surfy garage punk. Known for crude lyrics, boozy gigs, and tours supporting established rockers Alkaline Trio and Twin Peaks, the group arrived at a sweet spot on their most recent album, 2017’s striking rock’n’roll bruiser Bulls and Roosters. Rather than release a full-length follow-up, they opted to split a February 2018 recording session into three disparate EPs: the acoustic Sleeping Til Sunset, last October’s tizzied Non Stop Paranoia, and the milder Dispassionate. The pleasant reworkings of older songs on Sleeping Til Sunset successfully highlighted Together Pangea’s mellower side, so it’s not as if the band loses all their appeal when they set aside their usual lawlessness. But in contrast to the full-bodied Bulls and Roosters, 2014’s fervent Badillac, and even the gaudy synths of Non Stop Paranoia, Dispassionate feels watered-down. Its retro influence sounds less like the work of Burger Records alumni and more like a squeaky-clean throwback to “The Ed Sullivan Show.” Opener “Bet You Wish I Would Call” is inspired by the real-life unreachability of frontman William Keegan, who went phoneless for years. His razor-sharp riffs carry the song, but they’re bogged down by cliches like “Summer days are meant to sleep ’em away” and “Listening to all my favorite songs,” Together Pangea’s own best crack at Bruno Mars’ “The Lazy Song.” The beachy “Never Said I Wanna” offers a seed of thematic development, but lines like, “Time is ash boy, I was 21/Crossing a great divide, trying to follow the one/It’s in the past boy, like a dying sun,” wind up more muddied than profound. The EP’s title track is simultaneously its most glum and most kinetic, kicking off with a twee xylophone ditty before the lyrics lurch toward oblivion. “It’s Monday, vodka and cigarettes again/I’ve hell to pay, I’ll be inside this week,” Keegan sings, belting the word “dispassionate” a few times. It’s a recurring habit: Three of Dispassionate’s four songs make heavy use of their respective titles in the chorus. With so little substance elsewhere, it feels like a crutch. “Moonlight Lately” brings the most muscle, as drummer Erik Jimenez saunters through flourishes that rattle with the gusto of Spanish folklorico. The lyrics detail a violent crash: “The screeching of tires, the burning of rubber/The breaking of glass, and the witness, my brother/That's when my baby hit the ground!” With a blown-out saxophone solo taking over halfway through, it feels like Together Pangea’s take on an ’80s action-drama soundtrack, and it’s the song most closely in line with the band’s traditionally reckless ethos. Though Together Pangea are capable musicians and songwriters, Dispassionate succumbs to its own sense of anhedonia. The band attempts to mask the anonymity with their tried-and-true rumbling drums and animated guitars, but this time, their edge can’t cut it.","The California surf-garage rockers extend their recent series of EPs, and succumb to their own sense of anhedonia.

Ignorance Is Bliss,Skepta,by: Will Pritchard,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ce6a9a35a46c2083c09889c/1:1/w_160/Skepta_IgnoranceIsBliss.jpg,2019-05-31 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/skepta-ignorance-is-bliss/,Boy Better Know,"In May 2016—before Brexit, before Trump, before plastic straw bans—Skepta released Konnichiwa, an uncompromising blow to the establishment and one of the best grime albums of the decade. The Mercury Prize-winning album quickly turned the heads of UK execs bent on ignoring homegrown talent, becoming a beacon to younger MCs who sought broader recognition. It received an unprecedented Top 10 placement in the UK charts, leading the way for a number of rappers who would follow in his slipstream. Now, with Ignorance Is Bliss, Skepta is faced with meeting the high-water mark he set for grime what seemed like ages ago. In the years following Konnichiwa, Skepta dropped a handful of new tracks and features but mostly occupied himself with designing Nike trainers, launching a high-end streetwear line, and causing a mild tabloid stir by posing unclad with supermodel Naomi Campbell for the cover of GQ. He also set up a youth music facility in his hometown of Tottenham, London, was made a chief in Nigeria, and, late last year, became a father. Somewhat fittingly, Ignorance Is Bliss is an album that swings between the glamorous life of a tastemaker and someone grappling with new responsibilities both practical and esoteric in nature. Searing political barbs and fiery rhetoric have become the lingua franca of the UK’s new class of MCs. Breakthrough rappers such as Dave, Stormzy, and slowthai are lauded as dissident voices for a young audience largely overlooked by the country’s legislators. This arguably comes less easily to Skepta (last year he became a short-lived meme after sticking his fingers in his ears at the very mention of politics.) Of course, he can engage when he wants to. “Glow In The Dark” offers deft commentary on political hypocrisy and identity politics. On album opener “Bullet From A Gun,” he flows effortlessly over a skittish slice of grime, covering everything from petty break-ups and juvenile braggadocio, to the never-ending rotation of the earth and his role in the long bloodline of Adenuga men. Skepta is at his best when he nails this kind of disaffected nonchalance. It makes the occasional flash of intimacy or vulnerability all the more powerful—“Recently I’ve been learning a lot/All I know is there’s no better feeling/Than getting home and seeing my little girl in her cot,” he off-hands on “Bullet From A Gun.” Some of the flourishes in his production are exquisite here. The beat to “Same Old Story” is a fresh take on the kind of golden-era emotive grime peddled by Ruff Sqwad, and the 90 seconds of glistening synths and stream-of-conscious monologue that begin “Animal Instinct” feels genuinely inventive, too. But these bright moments stand out against a sometimes patchy showing: The beat to “No Sleep” is as jarring as the insomnia it conjures and serves only to mask Skepta’s skippy flow; “Going Through It” feels like a half-baked idea that should have been left on the cutting room floor; “You Wish” is a lesson in how chorus-led grime tunes will always be a hit-or-miss affair. In a statement accompanying the album, Skepta said: “The internet is making everything and everyone politically correct but that takes away the artistry.” But in the context of tone-deaf metaphors such as “slap it like Ike Turner” on “Redrum,” the freedom of speech he’s so aggrieved about hardly seems worth it. In the video for “Bullet From A Gun,” Skepta sits in a North London underground station watching over a stroller while the trials of inner city life swirl around him. As so often with Skepta, whose tight one-liners and impeccable diction have set him apart since the days of fuzzy pirate radio broadcasts, the message is clear and unselfconsciously simple: Fatherhood has offered him a new perspective. But as the album plays out with its series of sketches that flip between the trivial and contemplative, and as Skepta tussles to find his place in the world, you’re left wondering whether he craves the bliss of youthful innocence or the responsibility of being a voice for a generation. Unfortunately, Ignorance Is Bliss is a deferral, splitting the difference with a series of half-measures. When he apes fellow UK rapper J Hus’ freestyle flow on the second verse of “What Do You Mean” it’s hard to determine whether it’s pure homage or a kind of time-warped nostalgia, a yearning to return to his own breakthrough days.","Three years after he galvanized a new class of UK rappers, the grime MC tries to meet the high bar he set for himself.

Rainford,Lee “Scratch” Perry,by: Ben Cardew,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cdc313b85a35d5670e63ee0/1:1/w_160/LeeScratchPerry_Rainford.jpg,2019-05-31 05:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lee-scratch-perry-rainford/,On-U Sound,"Lee “Scratch” Perry is the living embodiment of the notion that history would, on the whole, prefer its musical heroes to stop making music. If Perry had packed it in toward the end of the 1970s, leaving his 1977 collaboration with the Clash on “Complete Control” as his parting gift, he would be enshrined in legend as the man who helped invent dub reggae, pioneered the idea of the studio as instrument, and recorded Bob Marley. And he is remembered for all that. But as Perry continued to pump out the tunes—he has more than 50 albums to his name since 1980—he gradually mutated into a cartoonish character best known for his Delphic proclamations and penchant for wearing mirrors. Fans today come to him for his classic recordings and eccentric persona, but not so much his recent catalog. In this, Perry resembles a pre-American Recordings Johnny Cash, another artist whose continued output in the 1980s did little good for his reputation. And if Rainford, Perry’s new album, isn’t quite the Cash-esque late-period renaissance that producer Adrian Sherwood has compared it to, it is at least somewhere in the same ballpark, thanks to the album’s sympathetic contemporary production and personal appeal. You can best hear this newfound clarity on album standout “Autobiography of the Upsetter.” While recent Perry tracks, like Orb collaboration “Ball of Fire,” could be a lot of fun, you’d be hard pressed to divine what his rambling vocal lines were actually about. On “Autobiography of the Upsetter,” Perry plays things relatively straight, narrating his life story from childhood in 1930s Jamaica to his burgeoning musical career, only occasionally veering into the kind of free-associative babble that litters his more recent work. Perry’s vocal may not be particularly melodic, but there is something profoundly moving about hearing a musical legend who often seems at odds with the modern world relate tales of Bob Marley and his mythical Black Ark studio in a tone of guttural gravitas, while backing vocals lilt around him in a tender embrace. Rainford is helped along by the instinctive production of longtime Perry collaborator and British dub pioneer Adrian Sherwood, whose work here balances classic reggae tropes—off-beat guitar chops, cavernous bass lines, and one-drop drums—with modern production touches and idiosyncratic effects, doing much of the melodic lifting along the way. “Cricket on the Moon” combines classic reggae lurch with an occasional digital stutter; “Let It Rain” offsets a dancehall beat with a string section that is slurred yet elegant; and “Makumba Rock” introduces Brazilian instrumentation to a rolling bassline. For all Sherwood’s musical nous, though, the strength of the album is in collaboration, with Perry’s iconic vocal tone—a mixture of phlegmy rasp, biblical command, and childish wonder—giving life to Sherwood’s lolloping grooves, much as Johnny Cash’s funereal baritone anchored Rick Rubin’s minimalist production on American Recordings. The brilliance of “African Starship” lies in the interplay between the song’s rusting metallic skank and Perry’s sky-gazing humanity, while Perry’s melodic vocal is not enough to rescue the rather drab production on “Run Evil Spirit,” a song that outstays its welcome two minutes in. Rainford is unlikely to rejuvenate Lee “Scratch” Perry’s career in the way American Recordings did for Johnny Cash. The songwriting is too inconsistent, and there are too many moments of musical flab. It’s also possible that Perry hasn’t fallen quite as far in the popular imagination as Cash had; his groundbreaking early work casts a long shadow that his more unfocused later years have’t dimmed. But Rainford marks a welcome return for an artist who for far too long had been rendered all but invisible behind his abstruse wit, esoteric demeanor, and all those mirrors.","After years spent trading on a bulletproof back catalog and eccentric persona, the Jamaican titan teams up with UK dub heavyweight Adrian Sherwood for a welcome return to form.

43VA HEARTLESS,Moneybagg Yo,by: Will Schube,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ceeae315a46c2c40a098c87/1:1/w_160/MoneybaggYo_43vaHeartless.jpg,2019-05-31 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/moneybagg-yo-43va-heartless/,N-LessInterscope,"Who listens to Moneybagg Yo? The question is a Beckett play for the streaming era: An extremely solid rapper with no discernible standout qualities regularly racks up charting numbers off of mixtapes, puts out collaborative albums with NBA Youngboy, and has Future roll through to hop on the occasional track. It’s hard to figure out who, exactly listens to Moneybagg, and if there’s such a thing as the diehard Moneybagg Yo fan. But here he is with 43VA HEARTLESS, another very good record that refuses to make a case for or against his role in rap’s hierarchy. One look at the 43VA HEARTLESS tracklist betrays Moneybagg’s secret-star status. Gunna, Offset, Lil Durk, and Kevin Gates appear, as do upstarts City Girls. 2018’s Reset—his eighth for Yo Gotti’s Interscope subsidiary CMG—features J. Cole, Future (twice), Kodak Black, Kevin Gates (again), Jeremih, and YG. That’s a star-studded cast, showcasing the pull and attraction of rap’s quietest elite member. Despite the support, the emcee born Demario DeWayne White Jr. is at his best when he’s solo and cold-blooded, going after heads of rivals with a nonchalance that borders on sociopathy. Stylistically, the influence of Gotti and the various stars he entertains on 43VA HEARTLESS is there, but Moneybagg’s flow most resembles that of Gucci Mane. The rhyme patterns, the schemes and style all recall the East Atlanta Santa, and rather than run away from this comparison, Moneybagg tweaks it to great effects. It can be a bit distracting—sometimes he sounds too much like Gucci—but White is able to highlight Gucci’s greatest strengths and make them his own. He has that same casual menace, the laughing delivery that masks something much more sinister. You can almost see the blank stare in Moneybagg’s eyes as he spells out the ruthlessness it took to become a star: “Got no heart/Just a black hole on my soul,” he raps on the Lil Durk-featuring “On My Soul.” The best songs on HEARTLESS dig deep into a fractured psyche. On the DrumGod produced “Toxic” he’s not necessarily heartbroken—he would never admit to that—but he’s tired and depleted from a ruined romance. He sounds hurt, and it’s the first time on the album that Moneybagg’s vulnerability leads a song instead of his confidence. “Didn't wanna seem like I left you for dead/I knew you would let that shit go to your head/And say that I changed for the bread,” he raps. The little moments—his girl scrolling and posting after he falls asleep—are the ones that elevate 43VA HEARTLESS. Moneybagg’s strength is in his versatility, with no aspect of his style standing above the rest. The hooks are solid, and his songwriting never falls beneath a certain quality standard. In an era of inconsistency and 15-minute fame, perhaps what makes Demario White stand out is the guaranteed commodity. You know what you’re getting with a Moneybagg Yo record, and it’s always very good. Moneybagg Yo is the reliable drop, and as such, we’re always ready for more.","The consistent Memphis rapper continues his workmanlike grind to the top.

Swim Team EP,Christelle Bofale,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cd4952285a35d3767e63c00/1:1/w_160/ChristelleBofale_SwimTeamEP.jpg,2019-05-31 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/christelle-bofale-swim-team-ep/,Father/Daughter,"Christelle Bofale plays the sort of guitar chords you could swim in. The Congolese American songwriter grew up immersed in the sounds of soukous, a rumba-inspired genre of dance music from the Congo. She first started writing songs on her father’s guitar when she was 13 years old. Now 22 and living in Austin, she uses her instrument to trace vast spaces that couch thorny emotional quagmires. In its sumptuousness and delicacy, her debut EP Swim Team calls back to the way the Antlers float guitar lines through foggy air, or the ribboned arpeggios on Frank Ocean’s “Ivy.” There are songs on Swim Team that soothe, letting the ear bathe in a warm glow even as Bofale describes intense pain. “I built a home for you/You tore it up,” she sings on “Love Lived Here Once,” her voice ringing through a sea of minor chords. The EP’s centerpiece “U Ouchea” grows slowly over seven and a half minutes, each new refrain bolstered by tighter, denser guitar lines. “I’m glowing with fear/I’m pregnant with fear/I’ve gotta get out of here,” Bofale sings, using the image of pregnancy to describe the toxicity that secretly attends so many romantic partnerships. A seemingly happy relationship can quietly harbor abuse; an externally tragic breakup can actually be a story of escape. Swim Team treads the murky waters of violence disguised as love, and all the weird feelings that can emerge with such a relationship's destruction. “Origami Dreams,” the most straightforward pop-rock song, cruises along on a beat full of momentum and excitement. “Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry up,” Bofale sings at the chorus, as if impelling herself to get loose from all the history that’s weighing her down. She punctuates the refrain with a chain of notes on guitar that seem to point at some gleaming future, a place of calm and respite she's urging herself toward. Healing from trauma generally isn’t a linear process. You don’t wake up a little better every day; some days you coil around yourself and collapse back into the sludge you're trying to escape. Bofale’s songs also wind in circles, reaching for peace and acceptance and then shrinking back into harsh reality. The way she plays guitar, layering chords on top of each other and sequencing them so they never quite seem to resolve, allows more than enough room for the complexity of her lyrics. She ends the record by repeating the words, “I am lost out here,” voice rising to a timbre that hangs between despair and thrill. She may be lost, but she is out here and not in there. In there, there's only suffocation. Out here, there are places she can go.","The Congolese American songwriter and guitarist’s debut EP winds in circles, tracing vast spaces that couch thorny emotional quagmires.

REMEMBER THE FUTURE,ionnalee,by: Eric Torres,Editorial Producer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ce6b070f2bde6766caad4d9/1:1/w_160/ionnalee_RememberTheFuture.jpg,2019-05-31 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ionnalee-remember-the-future/,To whom it may concern.,"Jonna Lee, aka ionnalee, moors cavernous electronic pop with regularly discomfiting theatrics. Her three audiovisual albums with producer Claes Björklund as iamamiwhoami were mysterious, occasionally sinister curios driven by tensile electronics and dance pop, paving the way for creative collaborations with Comme des Garçons and Röyksopp, with whom she was a touring member. The Swedish artist turned inward last year with her debut solo album as ionnalee, Everyone Afraid to Be Forgotten, assembled following a cancer scare and diagnosis of a thyroid disorder that threatened Lee’s ability to sing. The discovery spurred her to a leaner vision of iamamiwhoami’s mannered electronic pop, with candid lyrics, front-and-center vocals, and warlike drums and electronics forming some of her strongest music yet. Follow-up REMEMBER THE FUTURE maintains Lee’s off-kilter, spare approach to pop music while adding a broader one to her themes, homing in on a murky vision of dystopia, sci-fi retrofuturism, and the hope that lies beyond whatever misfortune may lie ahead. REMEMBER THE FUTURE joins rank with other contemporary electronic-pop albums with similar future-shock leitmotifs, most memorably from the Knife and Austra. Lee’s approach is more tactile, reflected in the tin robot she built for the album art, a “retro space-age symbol” expressing idealized and wide-eyed space-race ambition. As a result, the frozen-over REMEMBER THE FUTURE feels like watching an arthouse disaster movie with a bittersweet ending, tracing the expressive outlines of a downfall, its aftermath, and the inevitable path to an optimistic ending. Whether it’s about literal ecological destruction or interpersonal turmoil seems to be beside the point, as the two become interchangeable in Lee’s hands: She is often ornate and in distress, walking among “the shatters at the bottom of our ocean” and icing over into “crystal in the mouth of your river.” Lee’s seesawing melodrama is tempered by new shades of disco and darkwave. “WIPE IT OFF” frets over “meds wearing off” on top of a manic, fleet-footed dance track with bright, vigorous synths. Lee is loose and unencumbered, like she’s enjoying the upshot of delirium, wiling away the night at some snowed-in club. The inevitable crash comes on “MATTERS”: Zola Jesus arrives like a serene angel of death among muffled drums imitating the hammer of a heartbeat while Lee laments the indelible image of a “thin blue line” across a “fatal sky.” Atmospheric and stretching to nearly seven minutes, “MATTERS” is the album’s pulsing core, a gloomy intimation of the dangers of tunnel vision before an impending disaster. Yet Lee remains generous, offering up confidence in a pacifying, crystalline tone: “We matter/Raise our voices/Hum until their walls shatter.” Occasionally Lee conveys her sci-fi themes a little too obviously. On the ascendant title track, she processes her voice through a hammy vocoder, as if giving voice to her ersatz robot, and she relies on alien synthesizers on the meandering “RACE AGAINST.” She adds similar processing to better effect on the propulsive highlight “SOME BODY,” throwing shapes over a rubbery synth line and pressurized drums. Toward the end of REMEMBER THE FUTURE, however, Lee finds a new apex, recruiting Röyksopp for a cover of Angelo Badalamenti’s “Mysteries of Love,” from the soundtrack to David Lynch’s nightmarish 1986 film Blue Velvet. Cocooned in slow-moving, Vangelis-sized synths and steered by Lee’s reverberating voice, it feels like a beaming, natural progression for her fabulist style of music. Here, Lee honors a direct forebear of her unearthly visuals in her own devoted, unique way, revealing the best sides of her music with a dreamy flourish.","On the follow-up to her debut solo album, the former iamamiwhoami member tilts her off-kilter electro pop toward compellingly dystopian visions.

Apollo XXI,Steve Lacy,by: Nathan Smith,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ce6a850fa43fd37cc068137/1:1/w_160/SteveLacy_ApolloXXI.jpg,2019-05-30 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/steve-lacy-apollo-xxi/,3qtrAWAL,"Though seldom acknowledged, there’s long been a kinship between hip-hop and bedroom pop, two genres whose music is often given life by bored teenagers in home studios cobbled together from egg cartons, bedsheets, and cracked copies of FL Studio. There are clear differences between the two styles, of course, but the aesthetic features of DIY hip-hop and lo-fi pop are often products of necessity. Steve Lacy’s music is where those two musical traditions intersect. Lacy’s only 21, but he’s put together an accomplished resume as a member of the Internet and a contributor to tracks by Kendrick Lamar, Vampire Weekend, Blood Orange, Mac Miller, and Solange. Lacy got interested in music as a kid through Guitar Hero, which encouraged him to start playing a real guitar. He’s gotten a lot of attention not just for his young age, but for his distinctly youthful method of making music. Lacy started out making beats on his iPhone, and that’s how he produced almost all of his 2017 debut EP Steve Lacy’s Demo, as well as “Pride” from Kendrick Lamar’s DAMN. Apollo XXI is less funky than Lacy’s work with the Internet, operating in a relaxed indie-pop mode that makes it obvious why Ezra Koenig would keep Lacy in his Rolodex. Lead guitar dominates as much as bass, if not more, with gentle synths along the edges. Lacy’s voice is often laid-back, sometimes lethargic; other times it gently ascends to the higher plane alluded to in the album’s title. There’s more crispness to his delivery when he’s rapping, like on “Outro Freestyle/4ever,” but the straight-up hip-hop here isn’t his most compelling mode. As Lacy has a history of recording vocals on his phone, sometimes words slip by, uncertain and unnoticed. But there are moments when his intentions are clearer. The album’s clear centerpiece is the second track, “Like Me,” which marks Lacy’s coming out not only as a solo musician but also as a bisexual man, which he has discussed in interviews but never explicitly in song. In a spoken introduction, Lacy reveals that he had felt timid about touching on the subject of his sexuality. “I just want to relate to everyone,” he says, before launching into the song: “I only feel energy/I see no gender.” It’s a fairly straightforward plea for connection and acceptance; over and over again, Lacy asks how many of his listeners have struggled like he has. As if in front of a mirror, he uses the repetitive plea of the song’s chorus—“How many out there just like me?”—as a way to try on his identity and see if it feels comfortable, turning the conventional, hook-based structure of pop music songwriting into a powerful method of introspection. In spirit, “Like Me” could have been the album’s first track, a proper introduction to Lacy’s ambitions, anxieties, and identity. But it also sounds like a closer, with several clear tonal shifts that turn the song into a multi-textured pop suite. After the catchy, chorus-heavy first third of the song, we shift into a trippy, Thundercat-like instrumental; then silence, a musical sequence centered around a glockenspiel, then silence again before Lacy, his guitar, and a gentle drum pattern serenade us for the song’s final minute. Beyond the serious themes addressed in its lyrics, the curious structure of “Like Me” is further proof of Lacy’s skill, even if his artistic voice is still developing. “Like Me” features a verse from the vocalist DAISY, which I admire in intent—Lacy answers his call for relatability by bringing in another artist to share their own similar journey to sexual and personal self-acceptance. But it’s also the only credited appearance from a guest vocalist, and Lacy’s quest for togetherness needs more than just one more extra voice. That’s ultimately the problem with Apollo XXI: For an album whose highlight is a song about the urge to extend beyond the limits of your own experience and find solace in collective acceptance, it all feels surprisingly timid.

Escape From New York,Beast Coast,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ced3e3693a5364ee11ee417/1:1/w_160/BeastCoast_EscapeFromNewYork.jpg,2019-05-30 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/beast-coast-escape-from-new-york/,Columbia,"Ever since 1999, the rappers and producers of the Beast Coast collective have been pegged as Golden Age evangelists and neoclassicists. They were a New York City squad with throwback New York City values, out to restore the soul to what de facto leader Joey Bada$$ called rap’s “very trash state.” A supergroup made of three smaller Brooklyn rap groups—Pro Era (Bada$$, Kirk Knight, CJ Fly, Nyck Caution, Powers Pleasant), Flatbush Zombies (Meechy Darko, Zombie Juice, Erick the Architect), and the Underachievers (Issa Gold and AK the Savior)—they spent their early years trying to conjure Biggie’s era by showing utmost reverence to the sacred land he stood on. As they’ve grown up, the crew has softened a bit on revivalism. The Pro Era kids started singing more. The Zombies ventured into trap. Joey Bada$$ ghostwrote some of “Rockstar.” On Escape From New York, the first album by Beast Coast as a unit, they seem eager to escape their own provincial past. “This is actual, like, music,” Meechy told Hot97. “Nothing wrong with the boom-bap shit, but we didn’t really try to follow a format that everybody tried to lay for us.” Produced primarily by Erick Arc Elliott and Powers Pleasant, with Elliott serving as the project’s executive producer, Escape From New York turns its title into a metaphor. Beast Coast attempt to move beyond the boundaries established by the hallowed ground of their home, finding a deeper inspiration in brotherhood. Despite their intentions, the album still often feels like wandering into a pointless cypher. Elliott pushed against nine-minute songs or “this Wu-Tang reincarnation kind of thing,” but most of the songs are still huge posse cuts, just with more condensed verses. Some songs have as many as nine. Some members squeeze in for a measly four bars. Sometimes it can be like watching too many people cram into an elevator; everyone would probably be better off if a few stepped off and caught the next one. They go to such lengths trying to ensure that everyone gets enough mic time that the process can feel restrictive. They don’t even get particularly cute with the matchups: Flatbush Zombies largely stick with their own, and Nyck Caution and Kirk Knight, who already teamed up for 2017’s Nyck @ Knight, almost always appear together. There is a level of comfort that also feels like complacency. “I play these songs for people sometimes and they’re like, ‘Is that you or Joey?’” Meechy Darko told Complex. “I love that, because it’s me and Joey going after each other and that means we are in sync together.” But that smudging can also speak to a lack of originality. While they all do tend to follow one another, there isn’t much synchronicity in what they choose to rap about outside of “Problemz.” There is very little continuity. It can be difficult to get three performers on the same page, much less ten. Cream rises to the top in situations like this, and Joey Bada$$ and Meechy Darko separate themselves from the pack. Bada$$ remains the best rapper this crew has to offer; the most technically proficient in a collective that prides itself on that sort of thing, and the artist with the highest ceiling. Meechy raps with such personality that he’s the only person who benefits from shorter verses. He could chew up scenery during a cameo. “You never get what you deserve, just what you negotiate/You want the bag, I want the safe/Click-clack, nobody safe,” he raps on “Rubberband,” howling like a berserk preacher. On at least two occasions, he gets two verses on the same song, and he earns them. On the flip side, no pairing underachieves quite like the Underachievers, who seem to shrink away at nearly every occasion. They suffer the most in this rigid format. There isn’t nearly enough time for their verses to pick up any momentum. The other members of Pro Era may as well be cardboard stand-ins most of the time. Escape From New York is most engaging when it doesn’t try to force droning lesser rappers on listeners and instead focuses on making the “actual music” Meechy talked about. Songs like “Snow in the Stadium” and “Desperado” show that this group is, in fact, capable of producing not just functional but enjoyable rap songs under these tight conditions. But there isn’t enough of this balance, and a lot of that work is undercut by songs reinforcing the pecking order like “Puke,” a hookless bar-fest that crescendos into an all too meta Bada$$ breakdown: “I don’t even keep score, bitch I got the win/They need me like oxygen/On me, the whole block depend,” he raps, and it’s hard not to read that as rap Atlas bearing the entire Beast Coast on his shoulders. Bada$$ is the most talented and most famous member of the collective, and the Zombies have carved out their own little niche, but the Beast Coast album’s most insurmountable challenge is convincing the listener that the rest could ever hope to escape New York without them.","On their first album as a collective, Beast Coast attempt to move beyond the boom-bap revivalism that made them famous.

Falaw,Luka Productions,by: Phillip Mlynar,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ce6ad35f2bde6490baad4d7/1:1/w_160/LukaProductions_Falaw.jpg,2019-05-30 05:00:00,Global,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/luka-productions-falaw/,Sahel Sounds,"Luka Productions crafts music that fuses global hip-hop styles with folktronica vibes. The brainchild of Mali’s Luka Guindo, a producer and vocalist who records in his home studio in the capital city of Bamako, the project is at its most potent when it mines a similar sonic tract to the productions Timbaland and the Neptunes served up for Missy Elliott, Clipse, and NORE around the turn of the last century—only with the sinewy sitar and synth riffs switched out for lines of ngoni, a West African string instrument. But when the 27-year-old Guindo moves on from the loop-based foundation of the album’s most infectious tracks and wanders into more musically expansive territory, the extra layers of instrumentation wind up skewering the appealing punch of his beats. Falaw, whose title translates to Orphans, opens strongly: The introductory title track features lilting ngoni cushioning Guindo’s fleet yet tender vocals, which he recites in his native Bambara tongue in a sing-song flow. (Lyric translations are included with the album.) The run of tracks that follows contains the album’s gems. The raucous “Bbni” bubbles with dancehall-influenced rhythms and moody flashes of melody. “Foret” is even more addictive, with Guindo demonstrating his own brand of loop science by chopping up an acoustic ngoni like he’s working with an unearthed sample source. The sparse structure of the song is its charm: Vocals appear only briefly, in a call and response fashion, and when it locks into its repetitive mid-section, the track brings to mind a funky and absorbing West African beat tape. Frustratingly, every time Guindo builds up a degree of cohesive momentum with pockets of songs like these, he can’t resist throwing in an oddly sequenced moment that derails the experience. This happens first with “Indienfoli,” whose four-to-the-floor rhythm and disco stylings come across as clunky rather than upbeat. This unfortunate dampening of the vibe repeats: The hypnotic “Djessou” pulls you in, but the grander, more fleshed-out “Sitanba” breaks the spell, sounding like an errant jazz-funk outing; the playful back-and-forth male and female vocals of “Damonson,” which features the endearingly sweet but husky voice of Rokia Kane, are swamped by closing cut “Dogonodoon,” which threatens to blast off into Detroit techno territory. The core of Falaw ably showcases Guindo’s talent at hooking up ear-catching loops and channeling the traditional sounds of his region through a hip-hop lens, but he too often seems to become impatient or distracted; he muddles the mix by adding too much instead of letting his songs settle. Much like the tradition of crate-digging that inspired the album, Falaw shines brightest when Guindo narrows his focus on the magic of the groove.","The Malian producer employs ngoni and other regional sounds in hip-hop-inspired fusions that, at their best, suggest a West African beat tape.

Full Upon Her Burning Lips,Earth,by: Marc Masters,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ced696e85a35d36e9e64a5b/1:1/w_160/Earth_FullUponHerBurningLips.jpg,2019-05-30 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/earth-full-upon-her-burning-lips/,Sargent House,"“I would hear riffs from bands that I liked, and I’d want them to keep playing that riff,” Dylan Carlson recalled recently. “I was always wondering what would happen if you just stuck on that one riff.” That such a simple idea could spawn a varied, lasting musical career seems impossible. Yet over three decades, Carlson’s band Earth have crafted a rich discography by doing just that. Early on, they stretched single chords into minimalist epics—inspired equally by La Monte Young and Black Sabbath—to coin a drone-metal style later perfected by descendents Sunn0))). But even as Earth’s sound has grown since returning from a late ’90s hiatus, Carlson remains infatuated with the power of repetitive riffs. Though he and drummer Adrienne Davies have been constants in Earth Mk II, many musicians have flowed in and out of the group over the past 15 years. That culminated in 2014’s Primitive and Deadly, their first record to include vocals, courtesy of guests such as fellow Seattle veteran Mark Lanegan. Five years later, perhaps sensing their expansion had hit a ceiling, Carlson and Davies have finally made a record by themselves. Full Upon Her Burning Lips fits the cliché of the “stripped down, back to basics” album, with Carlson intentionally limiting his sonic options and the duo refocusing on elemental repetition. But Earth’s previous explorations earned them the right to reset, creating a new peak in an already highlight-filled discography. Full Upon Her Burning Lips hits that upper echelon not just through signature repetition, but also the quality of the riffs themselves. Lately, Carlson has insisted that repetition by itself isn’t enough (“[the riffs] should be something that you want to hear again,” he said), and the range of memorable hooks throughout these ten tracks is indeed crucial. Take the wiry curve in “Cats on the Briar”, the hints of funky groove in “Exaltation of Larks,” the beatific circles in the meditative “Descending Belladona” and the poignant denouement “A Wretched Country of Dusk.” Full Upon Her Burning Lips might actually be more catchy than what many consider to be Earth’s best album, 2008’s The Bees Made Honey in the Lion’s Skull. Though the confident swing of these songs can feel contemplative or even languid, the duo’s knack for adding small shifts and subtle accents injects a lot of tension. In that, credit is due to Davies’ drumming as much as Carlson’s guitar and bass playing. The way she both leads and supports the songs’ winding paths remains impressive, especially since they could easily drag. Her precision calls to mind drone legend Tony Conrad’s early epiphany that playing slowly is actually harder than playing fast, and “the secret of playing well was playing more slowly.” Davies has recently acknowledged the challenge “to get it as slow as you can get, but still have your momentum.” It’s a task she masters throughout So Full Upon Her Burning Lips, mixing serenity and accuracy into a force that both controls and propels Earth’s music. That forward motion makes So Full Upon Her Burning Lips more than just a return to a classic sound. There are enough surprises here that what could’ve been just a comfortable glance backward. That’s clearest on “The Colour of Poison,” which opens with a rare Carlson move: chopping up chords rather than letting them ring out, which in the Earth universe counts as a seismic event. But a few minutes in, he turns back with a riff that ranks among the band’s most overtly Sabbath-styled. John Peel’s iconic assessment of the all-time kings of repetition, the Fall, is apt here: “They are always different, they are always the same.” It’s a big thing to say about any band, but in the 30 years since Carlson first struck an Earth chord, he and Davies have earned it.","The minimalist drone-riff masters pare away excess and focus on the seismic repetition that made their best work so resonant, creating a new peak in their long discography.

Atlanta Millionaires Club,Faye Webster,by: Anna Gaca,Associate Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cc0cb6c71b196b2a447fe9a/1:1/w_160/FayeWebster_AtlantaMillionairesClub.jpg,2019-05-29 05:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/faye-webster-atlanta-millionaires-club/,Secretly Canadian,"Few R&B albums have a pedal steel; few alt-country albums have a rap feature. Faye Webster’s Atlanta Millionaires Club somehow has all of the above. Even stranger, she manages to smooth these apparent contradictions into serene folk-pop with a mellow soul tinge. A musician and photographer known for monochromatic, winkingly humorous portraits of Atlanta hip-hop figures, Webster is releasing her third album at just 21 years old. It has the melancholy clarity of someone twice her age, and a dreamy transience perfect for an overcast Sunday. Webster’s very first album, 2013’s Run & Tell, was polished traditional folk, inspired by country and bluegrass passed down by her musician mother and grandfather. While not adventurous, it’s remarkably pleasant; it’s hard to believe it’s the work of a 16-year-old, much less one who’d only been writing songs for two years. After a brief stint at college in Nashville, she returned home to Atlanta and recorded a self-titled 2017 album for Awful Records, the musical collective better known for its roster of left-field rap acts. Alongside artists like Father and Ethereal, Webster was an anomaly, but her arty individualism represented an important common value. Faye Webster kept the pedal steel but traded twangy guitars for soulful orchestral accents and groovier rhythms, gliding on the spun-gold thread of Webster’s voice, now sounding less like Emmylou Harris and more like herself. She’s not a particularly powerful singer; she aims for the wistful plaintiveness to match her self-deprecating acceptance that things sometimes work out for everyone else but you. The album cruises with a casual slackness that can camouflage the precision of its production, like the horn flourishes that enliven light-stepping tearjerkers “Hurts Me Too” and “Jonny.” Kacey Musgraves and Natalie Prass are apt comparisons, but Webster sounds equally at home on a country song as she does singing hooks for Awful recording artists. Father murmurs a nonchalant verse on “Flowers,” the most unusual song here, with a molasses-slow boom-clap and tinkling music-box melody. “What do you prefer?/I don’t have that much to offer,” Webster sings, shifting into whispery sing-song. Webster’s hyper-modern brand of cool moves with a swiftness that can make her interest in internet rap seem vintage, and her throwback non-musical passions—baseball and trick yo-yoing—seem trendy. Yet her sharply observed and simply stated lyrics land with immediacy. “The day that I met you I started dreaming,” she sings on album centerpiece “Kingston,” a lush, slow-building fantasy of romantic escape. She writes with refreshing obviousness about life as a homebody (“My dog is my best friend, and he doesn’t even know what my name is”), or how it feels to end a relationship with someone who’s also in the entertainment biz (“Right now your picture is all over Atlanta, no matter which way that I drive”). Even at her lowest, she doesn’t sound sorry for herself, preferring to let the pedal steel do the crying. Plenty of currently trendsetting popular music resists precise categorization. In the case of a Khalid or a Diplo, this impulse can lead to stream-friendly mush. Webster is a bit too weird to fall into that trap; even when her path appears incongruous, one never has the sense that she’s acting other than as she intended. Idiosyncratic yet understated, Atlanta Millionaires Club wraps in a little of everything without doing too much of anything.","The 21-year-old singer-songwriter’s third album is serene folk-pop with a mellow soul tinge and the melancholy clarity of someone twice her age.

Destroyer,Black Mountain,by: Stephen M. Deusner,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ce405f293a53617d41edfa0/1:1/w_160/BlackMountain_Destroyer.jpg,2019-05-29 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/black-mountain-destroyer/,Jagjaguwar,"Like a bitchin’ phoenix airbrushed on the side of a tricked-out ’78 Dodge B200 van, Black Mountain is a band always in the process of being reborn. Turnover has been almost constant in the metal outfit’s 15-year history, with each album boasting a slightly different lineup. Founding members Joshua Wells and Amber Webber left the group in 2016, shortly after the release of their fourth album, handily titled IV. That leaves frontman/chief songwriter Stephen McBean and keyboard player Jeremy Schmidt as the sole founding members, and that makes it all the more tempting to label this something like a solo project, one whose mission is to realize one man’s vision of heavy rock in the new millennium. But the remarkable thing is how much Black Mountain remains a band, how vital each member’s contributions are. What in the early 2010s looked like it might be a one-note project has pulled out of the skid to redefine itself and its relationship to crunch and riff. Conceived and sequenced as a soundtrack to an epic desert road trip, Destroyer introduces a new gang of Black Mountaineers, most of whom are actually replacing Webber. That includes one singer, Rachel Fannan of Sleepy Sun, and three drummers: Adam Bulgasem of Dommengang, Kliph Scurlock formerly of the Flaming Lips, and Kid Millions from Oneida. Their version of the band has a lot less boogie but a lot more swamp, a lot more Frank Frazetta fantasy, a lot more majestic doom. As on IV, Jeremy Schmidt stands out as a co-writer and arranger, and his synths taunt McBean’s sludgy guitars, adding friction to the gnashing opener “Future Shade” and dystopian menace to “Closer to the Edge.” As befits a band that imagines a Ballard-esque tower block as “the loneliest cock in the sky,” this version of Black Mountain have a healthy sense of the ridiculous, which is food of the gods where heavy guitars roam. McBean can deliver a line like, “One thousand horses form in a Flying V” with no smirk of irony and no Darkness-style in-joke. On one of the album’s gnarliest moments, he ends “Pretty Little Lazies” with a coda of menacing, tortured la la la’s, each one sounding more regurgitated than sung, his voice distorted with metal poisoning, like Zardoz puking up an arsenal of assault rifles. Together, this iteration of Black Mountain allows the songs to take on new shapes: “Horns Arising” opens with a robotic voice delivering apocalyptic lyrics, breaks down into an ambient section that borrows liberally from Schmidt’s Beyond the Black Rainbow soundtrack, and finally ends with a fanfare that tries to raise the dead out of hell. It’s all the more bracing for being so unpredictable. Unfortunately, some of that energizing ridiculousness leaks out of Destroyer by its second side. The most memorable thing about “Boogie Lover” is its title, and “Licensed to Drive” goes nowhere but at least breaks the speed limit getting there. Just when it sounds like they’ve run out of gas, “FD 72” actually manages to keep this hotrod between the ditches. Wherever Black Mountain are headed, they’re not out of road yet.","Reinvigorated with a whole host of new members, the metal outfit prove there's plenty of life left in their road-trip rock.

i'll show you stronger,pronoun,by: Sophie Kemp ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ce6ae7093a53600c61ee106/1:1/w_160/pronoun_I'llShowYouStronger.jpg,2019-05-29 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/pronoun-ill-show-you-stronger/,Rhyme & Reason,"Pronoun’s Alyse Vellturo has a backstory so earnest and precious it seems impossible to hate. The Brooklyn-based musician attended Berklee College of Music, got spooked by how talented her classmates were, and then retreated into the shadows for a decade until she finally gained the confidence to give music another shot. Now Vellturo is 30, and she’s finally released her debut, i’ll show you stronger, a record of small dream-pop ditties largely about heartbreak. The record is a labor of love, albeit a not entirely realized one. Vellturo knows her way around reverb-heavy guitar parts, emo-inflected vocals, and pop-punk percussion, but i’ll show you stronger doesn’t fit easily into any of those columns. She has no brand allegiance to a specific sound, which for the most part lends itself to compelling results. Take “you didn’t even make the bed,” a song that’s coated in Sunny D on the outside and oozes anguish from within. Here, Vellturo plays a tenderly picked guitar line that gets rejiggered and muddled up by competing vocal lines and incandescent production flourishes. Then come the lyrics, which are some of the record’s most candid: “I said talk to someone your own age/Not fuck a 45-year-old/Who’s expired,” she sings, sounding like an emo Victoria Legrand who chews on consonants and doesn’t quite have the necessary breath control. It’s a painfully intimate scene that she keys us into, making a point early on that i’ll show you stronger is written for Vellturo and Vellturo alone. “Stay” has a similarly cheery exterior, while the lyrics compare falling out of love with getting run over by an 18-wheeler. Both the song and the experience it depicts feel kind of unresolved, unfinished, and messy around the edges. You still might get weepy, though. On the following track, “Sadie,” Vellturo addresses the person making her miserable. “So Sadie, don’t act like I’m the problem/When you ran out of money and sought out your rock bottom,” she sings, with a fixed gaze. Vellturo is raw, and her pain isn’t fleshed out yet. Neither is the song. A lot of music attempts the happy-on-the-outside, sad-as-all-hell-on-the-inside sort of thing; Robyn has made a career of dancefloor bops that make you want to bawl your eyes out. This is the kind of company Vellturo’s music aspires toward, and there are moments on the album that come really close. If she never quite finds those bombastic sweet spots that turn a good song into an anthem—well, that’s ok. It may have taken a decade, but it’s a debut. Vellutro hasn’t quite figured out what function her art will serve. She’s nervously dipped her toes into the water, and wrote her truth into existence. That’s more than enough to get started.","The Brooklyn-based musician’s long-percolating debut is a collection of small dream-pop ditties that only feel cheery on the outside.

Zoospa,J-E-T-S,by: Michelle Kim,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cdc2f7093a5369c071edb98/1:1/w_160/J-E-T-S_ZOOSPA.jpg,2019-05-29 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/j-e-t-s-zoospa/,Innovative Leisure,"At the top of the 2010s, when Machinedrum’s Travis Stewart and Jimmy Edgar were releasing projects on the UK label Hotflush, they started a collaborative duo under the moniker J-E-T-S. It was the latest addition to a long list of individual and collaborative pseudonyms: Edgar previously contributed to X District, Her Bad Habit, and Plus Device, while Stewart has issued material as Syndrone, Tstewart, and Sepalcure. J-E-T-S released an EP in 2012 and another in 2015, each offering a handful of soul-inflected DayGlo house and techno tracks. Now, almost seven years after their inception, they’ve returned with their debut full-length Zoospa, a futuristic patchwork of bass, hip-hop, and R&B. Zoospa plays as if Stewart and Edgar tossed their favorite bits of American pop in a blender, printed them on a floppy disk, used it for a game of hopscotch, and then scanned it back into Ableton. In a recent interview, the duo highlighted the influence of ’90s gospel and noted their use of a chord voicing called quartal harmony, a technique popular in synthesizer music of the early ’70s. They were also adamant that Zoospa should not sound too “throwback,” creating a new sound pack through Edgar’s “super complex modular system” in a bid to avoid unwelcome familiarity. As a result, Zoospa’s musical elements feel cohesive, even as they bounce across genres and eras, often within the same song. The instrumental “Hyper Hibernate” evokes Steve Reich as a vaporwave artist, with marimba-esque synths that fall into a serene, orderly pattern, like a digitally rendered Ikebana arrangement. The intense squelches and trap hi-hats of “Team Effort” sound like the type of beat SOPHIE would produce for Charli XCX. Zoospa takes a more outwardly R&B turn on the Dawn Richard-featuring “Potions,” where pumping, respirating synths call to mind Nao’s collaborations with British producer Mura Masa. The frenzied amalgamation of genres is a natural progression for both Stewart and Edgar; the former enlisted versatile R&B vocalists like Richard and Jesse Boykins III for his 2016 Machinedrum record Human Energy, and the latter co-produced “745” on Vince Staples’ 2017 avant-garde dance rap opus Big Fish Theory. But the real magic comes from the guest vocalists, who both match the bouncy dynamism of Stewart and Edgar’s productions and bring their own refreshingly weird energy. Mykki Blanco is in his element on “Play,” punching out some words with tenacity and morphing the pronunciation of others. “Get down with doggies, bet you got fleasies/Opp bitches lurkin’, they not my species,” he says, teasing sass from the final syllable of each bar. The standout “Real Truth” features rising Australian artist Tkay Maidza, who raps with a breezy candor. “I ain’t scared of a dude with a suit baggy,” she says, lending her own quirky flair to the inverted grammatical structure. Stewart and Edgar digitize her vocals until she sounds robotic, becoming one with the track’s synthetic elements. Besides Big Fish Theory, Zoospa is also reminiscent of Flume’s latest Hi This Is Flume mixtape, which similarly weaves elaborately arranged instrumentals with appearances from inflammatory MCs slowthai and JPEGMAFIA. On both projects, the vocalists serve as inspiration and instrument, yet another reference point for their respective producers to chop up, mess with, and resituate. J-E-T-S play with elements from the past, but their take on future-pop aligns perfectly with today’s forward-thinking trends.","The first collaborative full-length by producers Machinedrum and Jimmy Edgar bounces across genres and eras, but the real magic comes from the guest vocalists.

Reward,Cate Le Bon,by: Sam Sodomsky,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cb4e811c7c0dc2dd52f551b/1:1/w_160/CateLeBon_Reward.jpg,2019-05-28 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/cate-le-bon-reward/,Mexican Summer,"What does solitude sound like? Reward, the fifth album by Cate Le Bon, offers a strange and beautiful approximation. Le Bon grew up on a farm in rural Wales, and her earliest music—with its humble, organic whimsy—exuded the buoyant charm of someone trying to make a connection. Since then, her work has grown more alien, reflective but devilishly playful: a turn away from the world and into the landscape of her own mind. Increasingly adept at expressing this topography through wobbly, romantic post-punk, she has delved deeper into its recesses and invited more people along with her. The more elaborate and eccentric her music becomes, the more she sounds like herself. If Crab Day, Le Bon’s 2016 breakthrough, felt like a collage made from cut-out pieces of construction paper, then Reward is like a series of tissue paper flowers, featherlight and diaphanous. She wrote the songs while living alone in England’s mountainous Lake District, in a rented cottage where she played piano late into the night. And while her treatment of these songs is fuller than anything on her previous records, she still turns to refrains you might find yourself singing once the idea of actual company becomes a distant fantasy. “Love you, I love you, I love you, I love you/But you’re not here,” goes one chorus. “You must die a little/You must exercise,” goes another, like an existential to-do list scrawled between dreams. While Reward is defined by such pillars of aloneness, it is far from lonely. The arrangements are lush and warm and ornate, drawing on breezy synths and keyboards to maintain a patient, crystalline momentum. Like Greek filmmaker Yorgos Lanthimos, Le Bon takes pleasure in blending horror and fairytale, elegance and absurdity, and her music can soothe and disorient in the same measure. The deceptively complex arrangement of mid-album breather “Here It Comes Again” makes it difficult to distinguish between each instrument; they blend into a carousel of bobbing melodies with Le Bon’s plaintive voice conducting from afar. “Man alive,” she sings. “This solitude is wrinkles in the dirt.” You can get lost in it. With the jagged edges of her recent work smoothed out, her surroundings turn luxurious. When she does roughen things up—the art-punk slink of “Mother’s Mother’s Magazines,” the motorik pulse of “Magnificent Gestures”—the feeling is less pent-up anxiety than unleashed nerves, a colorful parade of fire ants rushing toward you. These songs also serve as runways for the album’s longest moments of uninterrupted musical chaos: descending patterns that derail and don’t stop until the woods becomes too thick to pass through. This is Le Bon’s idea of jamming; her role is the crazed traffic conductor. Still, her music speaks loudest in its calmest moments, and Reward is an album most remarkable for how it fills its space. The trademarks of her sound—blasts of saxophone, music box percussion, silvery, oblong guitar licks—are still here, but the presentation is more distanced and refined. Note the contented sigh two minutes into “Home to You,” or the brief, elated yip after each chorus in “The Light.” After producing music for Deerhunter and Tim Presley, her bandmate in the duo Drinks, it’s easy to imagine any number of artists turning to her for this kind of open planning in their own work. While writing Reward, Le Bon attended architecture school to study the art of chairmaking. She described the craft as being both “unbelievably nourishing and really physically hard,” and she seems to have applied a similar discipline to her own songwriting. “The more you feel, the more you have to lose,” she sings in a mournful ballad called “Sad Nudes,” just before the music parts ways and threatens to collapse. This clarity is new from her—a stab at usefulness beyond her tightly-crafted universe. Reality comes crashing in again at the end, during the elegiac closer “Meet the Man.” Accompanied by woozy keys, Le Bon introduces the harshest words imaginable in her music: “Back to life.” You can hear the tug in her voice, the precise moment when a fantasy starts fading to the everyday. Learning to be alone is one thing; next comes finding that solitude in the sad, screaming world around you.","On her fifth album, the Welsh musician is at her best. The more elaborate and eccentric her music becomes, the more she sounds like herself.

The album is a celebration of movement, full stop: Propelled by wave after wave of polyrhythmic hand percussion, these are some of the wriggliest, ripplingest drum tracks Aguayo has ever created. Years ago, Aguayo was a member of Closer Musik, a duo whose winsome minimalism helped define the Kompakt label’s pop-ambient era. For the past 14 years, as a solo artist, he has gradually moved away from house and techno, at least as they’re typically understood, toward a more expansive—and inclusive—vision. He had a minor hit in 2008 with “Minimal,” a playful rebuke of minimal techno’s tick-tock tedium; on 2009’s Ay Ay Ay and 2013’s The Visitor he focused largely on his own voice, layering chants and beatboxed rhythms into supple Afro-Latin grooves. Just as important as his stylistic innovations is what he’s accomplished with his label Cómeme (Spanish for “eat me”), which he and cofounder Avril Ceballos have spent a decade developing into a platform for alternative dance music from the margins of the global club scene. What began as a pan-Latin concern has gradually expanded to encompass artists from Johannesburg, Bucharest, and beyond. Support Alien Invasion is a co-release between Cómeme and Belgium’s Crammed Discs, which seems fitting; since 1981, Crammed has blurred the lines between the European avant-garde and its allies around the globe. This is Aguayo’s first all-instrumental album, which might be surprising, given its political subtext. But the seriousness of the subject matter is plainly audible in the music’s steely tone. Aguayo’s productions have frequently flashed a sly sense of humor, but the mood here is driven, focused, heads-down. His drum programming is as slinky as ever, but there’s a newfound force to it; his drums could double as battering rams. Glowering rave stabs give “2019” the menacing air of European hardstyle over hard-charging polyrhythms that flout the hegemony of the four-to-the-floor groove. On “We Have Seen Another World,” the bass synth blares like a warship’s warning siren. “Insurgentes” is slow and menacing, made all the more ominous by the fact that there’s so little to it—just a side-winding, minor-key synth melody; in place of drums, just steady, time-keeping handclaps, as though the song’s titular guerrillas were counting down to a pre-dawn assault. Some tracks are subtler. In the “The Fold,” the opening song, interwoven drums and queasy, carousel-like synth streaks establish the unsettling mood that permeates the album, drawing you deep into his imagined borderland. Tonally, it’s a little like stepping from brilliant sunlight into a shuttered room: Your eyes struggle to adjust to the gloom, but minuscule variations of gray soon become clear. Aguayo can be playful, too: The Errorsmith-like “Laisse-moi parler” is sculpted around a bass synth, halfway between a growl and a sigh, that writhes like an outlandish Claymation creation. Whether in protest or celebration, the album could have benefited from some vocal tracks. “Between the Risings,” a gloomy drone cut, doesn’t add much to the overall picture, and by album’s end, Aguayo seems to run out of things that can be expressed with drums alone. One example of where he might have gone with this material can be found in his own single “Rain,” from late last year. Its shuffling triplet drums are cut from the same cloth, but there, he turned to a South African singer named Mujaji the Rain, a fixture on Johannesburg’s feminist and queer scene, whose woozily ecstatic vocals in English and Zulu—a supplication to the clouds, rain dance as erotic metaphor—make the song unusual. It’s not what she sings, but how she sings it: She intones her lines with an emotion so rapturous it feels almost dangerous; there’s a real sense of things spilling over, of a pleasure that can’t be contained. In its joyful patchwork of identities, the song invoked the kind of communal experience that can’t be restricted by lines on a map. At its best, Support Alien Invasion picks up that cry, wordlessly—a rain dance calling down the force that will wash all borders away.","The Chilean-German producer’s steely, slinky polyrhythms are a repudiation of borders and a celebration of the freedom of movement.

Act Surprised,Sebadoh,by: Stuart Berman,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cd1b75385a35db9c6e6392f/1:1/w_160/sebadoh_act%20surprised.jpg,2019-05-28 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/sebadoh-act-surprised/,Dangerbird,"Arriving a good 14 years after its predecessor, Sebadoh’s Defend Yourself, in 2013, was less a comeback than an act of closure, like one of those standalone reunion specials that follow the demise of a beloved long-running TV series. Where much of the indie-rock icons’ celebrated 1990s catalog invited us to eavesdrop on Lou Barlow’s roller-coaster romance with his main muse (girlfriend-turned-wife Kathleen Billus), his contributions to Defend Yourself updated their relationship status one last time with a striking degree of finality. “Someone else has found her way into my soul,” he sang at the top of album opener “I Will”: “Things have changed, no longer need to be with you.” Even if you were a casual listener with little knowledge of Barlow’s personal life, the line still stung, because it also summed up the average Sebadoh fan’s relationship with the band at the end of the ’90s. The trio’s 1999 major-label debut, The Sebadoh, didn’t just fail to expand its audience, it was a dealbreaker for many longtime fans in an era when making an elaborately produced crossover record was enough to get even the most acclaimed indie-rock band cancelled. While Defend Yourself saw Barlow singing once again with the sort of characteristic candor that inspires tribute songs from veteran emo bands, musically it felt a little shell-shocked, as if memories of The Sebadoh’s Icarian leap inspired a reactionary retreat into a mid-tempo ’90s-indie comfort zone. But on their first album in six years, Sebadoh sound like a band free of baggage, whether personal or professional. Now they just have our raging shit-show of a world to worry about. Act Surprised assumes the familiar form of Sebadoh’s mid-’90s Sub Pop classics, with Barlow and his habitual foil Jason Loewenstein evenly splitting the songwriting, while accommodating a lone wild-card contribution from the drummer (currently Bob D’Amico, formerly of the Fiery Furnaces). Instead of merely contrasting the tunefully heartfelt Barlow with the more erratic, irascible Loewenstein, the new album finds them mining common topical terrain—namely, the emotional toll of perpetually wading in a sea of misinformation—through their respective personalities. As they take stock of a polarized culture, Sebadoh are unafraid to wade into gray areas. The deceptively chiming “Medicate” is Barlow’s contribution to the growing dialogue surrounding mental health, but it’s more than just an admission of addiction—when he sings, “Oh, I miss it when the sorrow tempts me again,” he’s questioning whether it’s actually better to feel pain than being drugged into feeling nothing at all. Loewenstein, meanwhile, uses the twitchy “Phantom” and twangy “Raging River” to parrot the sort of paranoia endemic to conspiracy-theorist culture. But he’s not just making a turkey shoot of easy targets—as an admitted enthusiast of UFO cover-ups on the early internet, he’s imagining the kind of tinfoil-hatted wingnut he could’ve turned into had he continued to slip deeper down the dark-web rabbit hole. To channel our fraught current condition, Sebadoh eagerly reclaim their license to confuse by emphasizing a quality that was far less perceptible on Defend Yourself: their inherent volatility. Though often hailed as lo-fi folk heroes who taught indie rockers how to get in touch with their feelings, Sebadoh were also weirdo hardcore kids raised on Minutemen and Meat Puppets, and those eccentric influences are given more room to run wild here. Barlow’s “Celebrate the Void” may begin as a sluggish anthem of indecision, but it abruptly shifts gears into an exhilarating motorik free fall, while Loewenstein’s “Follow the Breath” finds a common language between needling math-punk guitars and arena-toppling Keith Moon drum rolls. That sort of inspired energy proves tough to sustain over Act Surprised’s 45-minute run, particularly when the album veers into more temperate 1980s college-rock territory (“Vacation,” “Act Surprised”). But the album’s stellar closing trifecta—comprising the winsome power-pop of “Belief,” the adrenalized, Feelies-esque duet “Leap Year,” and the equally odd and elegiac “Reykjavik”—confirms Act Surprised’s status as the strongest Sebadoh release since 1996’s Harmacy. In a recent podcast interview, Barlow quipped that, extended hiatuses notwithstanding, Sebadoh “will never break up,” and on “Sunshine,” he spells out his recipe for endurance: “I need sunshine/To ignore/I need a room with heavy curtains, double lock up on the door.” With the way the world is heading, the future promises plenty more reason to curl up in the dark.","Where 2013’s cautious Defend Yourself attempted a belated recovery from a disappointing major-label debut, the indie-rock icons’ latest sounds like the work of a band refreshingly free of baggage.

Paradox,Nocturnus AD,by: Andy O'Connor,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cb64b7d6b4f552db4d68b0d/1:1/w_160/NocturnusAD_Paradox.jpg,2019-05-28 05:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nocturnus-ad-paradox/,Profound Lore,"Nocturnus’ “Destroying the Manger,” from their 1990 record The Key, is one of the most perplexing songs in death metal. It details an unnamed protagonist traveling back in time to kill a newborn Jesus, thus eliminating Christianity and allowing evil to reign over Earth. Going Terminator on Jesus is exactly the kind of fervent anti-Christian energy on which death metal thrives, and “Manger” is an iconic example of it. But if there were no Jesus to oppose, there would be no death metal. This contradiction epitomizes how absurd “Manger” is, which is also what makes it one of the best death metal songs ever. Nocturnus were one of the first death metal bands to incorporate sci-fi themes, and they outfitted their bizarre visions with an equally unlikely blend of new age keyboards and hyper-technical guitar, drummer/vocalist Mike Browning whipping the cosmic chariot along with brimstone-as-paradise energy. While Tampa’s death-metal sound has long been the world’s death-metal sound, no band has ever been able to capture The Key’s singular weirdness, which is why it remains a cult record among the faithful. That is until Browning revived Nocturnus as Nocturnus AD, with members of his band After Death. Thus, Paradox is less of a debut than a continuation, and in every respect it  proves a worthy successor to one of death metal's lost classics. Leadoff track “Seizing the Throne” follows The Key’s opener “Lake of Fire” in structure, beginning with drifting keys and wind chimes before quickly descending into a whammy bar-driven frenzy. Save for the fresh 2019 production, you’d think it was ripped from a lost B-side. It’s remarkable how well Browning and his new band replicate The Key’s sound: Demian Heftel and Belial Koblak are faithful to original Nocturnus guitarists Mike Davis and Sean McNenney, who were more technically advanced than a lot of death metal at the time but still moved with chaotic unpredictability. “The Bandar Sign” ends with tight, frantic syncopations like a death-metal Moving Pictures. Even the keyboards sound like they haven’t been taken out of the vault since The Key’s release. They are not secondary or mere texture — they drive an already-maddened band to their brink. Keyboardist Josh Holdren abuses the pitch shifter in “Bandar Sign,” making the guitars sound more even more out-of-control and hyperspeed. In “Aeon of the Ancient Ones,” he goes from faux-orchestral placidity to doomy, cobweb-ridden synth organ, and in instrumental closer “Number 9,” he conjures a fevered intersection of “The Final Countdown,” “Mr. Crowley,” and Klaus Schulze. The keyboards are permanently set to ""ridiculous,"" and Nocturnus AD wouldn’t be the same without them. Paradox is both a revival record and a continuation of a whacked-out, singular vision. It’s an ideal revamp: familiar enough for those around the first time, fresh enough to rejuvenate the genre. Appending “AD” to your band’s name is usually a tired old-metal-dude move, a way to skirt copyrights and cash in on your legacy. But it is the only such move here: In every respect, Paradox is a fresh blast of hellish air, breathing new life into once-lost possibilities.","The cult death metal act returns with a fresh blast of hellish air, full of joyously absurd keyboards, hyper-technical guitars, and apocalyptic sci-fi visions.

Forever Breathes the Lonely Word,Felt,by: Quinn Moreland,Staff Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ce41116c13a454f1ee8321a/1:1/w_160/Felt_ForeverBreathesTheLonelyWord.jpg,2019-05-26 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/felt-forever-breathes-the-lonely-word/,Creation,"In November 1986, a writer for NME visited the flat of indie-pop enigma Lawrence. The mononymous musician lived in a quiet suburb outside of Birmingham, England, alone except for a collection of records, a set of first edition Kerouac paperbacks, and enough cleaning products to stock a small hospital ward. “A platoon of Airwick Solids stoically occupy strategic vantage points; the toilet bowl harbors not the usual one, but a breeding pair of those Cartland-pink santisers; a wicker basket provides a mass grave for spent aerosol air fresheners.” Since he rarely left the antiseptic apartment, Lawrence explained that his days were typically spent wasting time with mundane activities, like assiduously washing his floppy brown hair. By that point, the legend of Lawrence the recluse, Lawrence the perfectionist was as central to the narrative surrounding his band, Felt, as the music itself. But he was long used to being the odd one out. Too bookish and restrained for mainstream pop, too neurotic for punk, and too bright and structured for post-punk, Felt never quite fit in with the world around them, which is one reason they are still so beloved. Not being trendy was fine because Felt wanted to be timeless. Inspired by New York City romantics like Lou Reed, Tom Verlaine, and Patti Smith, Lawrence wrote vivid songs with verbose, sensual titles like “The World Is as Soft as Lace” and “Sunlight Bathed the Golden Glow.” His characters, desperate loners and anxious misanthropes, searched for some semblance of hope in this cruel world. Yet even their sadness could be sublime. “And all my great plans get blurred/By the softest touch, the gentlest word,” he sang once. Lawrence’s love of beauty was always at odds with his other obsession: success. From their earliest days, Felt was driven by Lawrence’s desire to be somebody. In 1979, Lawrence self-released the first Felt single, a mumbled noise track called “Index” that he recorded on a cheap cassette player in his bedroom. He wanted the song to be a “statement,” he told the Quietus, something that would get him noticed “immediately.” After it was named single of the week in Sounds! magazine, Lawrence decided he needed to look beyond the independent world. “I want to be in the charts,” he realized. “I’ve got to form a band: a proper band, along the lines of Television, with solos everywhere.” He recruited schoolmate Nick Gilbert first, then Maurice Deebank, a classically trained guitarist who once impressed him with a cover of “Mr. Tambourine Man.” According to Deebank, Lawrence himself had basically “no musical skills.” But he had a vision. Lawrence’s plan was to release exactly 10 albums and exist for exactly 10 years, at which point thousands of hypothetical Felt fans would be devastated by their breakup. He was preoccupied with posterity and figured that Felt would be properly evaluated after their demise. “Sure I want to be legendary,” he once remarked. “Is it wrong to think like that?” On the occasion of their first record, 1982’s Crumbling the Antiseptic Beauty, Lawrence was determined to release “the best English debut album ever.” Despite the unapologetically lofty goal, Lawrence was grounded by artistic integrity. He wanted to come by fame honestly, to be known as a generation-defining songwriter who challenged his fans like his underground art rock heroes. He named the band after a line from the Television song “Venus” off Marquee Moon; he was moved by the way Verlaine stressed “felt” and how the word itself—the past tense of emotion—conjured images of nostalgia. “Lawrence wanted Felt to be high art and low art at the same time,” Creation Records’ Alan McGee once said. “He wanted Felt to be in the singles charts and screamed at like a boy band.” Pulling from his rigorous studies of British music magazines, Lawrence closely directed Felt’s presentation, from their haircuts to their photo shoots. His fascination with professionalism carried over to the music itself. He loved the DIY spirit of punk bands but despised music that sounded imperfect. “Being happy with music that sounded like a demo?” he once said. “That was the opposite of what I wanted.” As a result, Felt’s earliest records are pristine and dreamlike, their atmospherics subtle and otherworldly. Carried by the spindly fingerwork of Deebank, Lawrence’s wistful lyrics are exalting. By the time of the NME profile that made Lawrence look like the indie Howard Hughes, Felt had largely moved away from artsy minimalism and towards pure pop. They were the closest to mainstream success they would ever be. A tour with the Cocteau Twins led to Robin Guthrie producing their fourth record, 1985’s reverb-saturated Ignite the Seven Cannons, which spawned the biggest single of Felt’s career, “Primitive Painters.” With thick jangly melodies and the euphoric backing vocals of Elizabeth Fraser, “Primitive Painters” amplified Lawrence’s private sorrows into broad swashes of bliss. In a perfect world, this would have been the transformative moment where Lawrence’s ultimate vision came into view, when Felt would take their place next to their idols. Their first release on Creation, 1986’s Let the Snakes Crinkle Their Heads to Death (aka The Seventeenth Century), withdrew from the blissful opulence of “Primitive Painters.” It was a curious display of Lawrence’s desire to experiment with the melodic limits of pop, composed entirely of minimalist and imaginative instrumental sketches. It was also largely ignored. “We spent all Creation’s money on that record and it was a complete disaster,” Lawrence later said. Perhaps he was unconsciously purging wordless compositions from his system, because Felt’s next record in 1986 was full of fleshed-out compositions with timeless lyrics. It would be the best album of their career. On Forever Breathes the Lonely Word, Felt sound reborn. It’s the most cohesive presentation of Lawrence’s vision, eight songs that tie together pop perfection and misanthropy to glorious ends. Part of this was technical. “I changed the songwriting style a bit,” Lawrence explained. “I wanted to write more concise songs with normal structures, as opposed to the first two LPs which contain long, semi-instrumental, six-minute pieces.” Another cause of this growth was bureaucratic. After many periodic departures and years of personal and creative conflicts with Lawrence, Deebank had finally quit the band after Ignite the Seven Cannons. His guitar’s presence in Felt was filled by the young keyboardist (and future Primal Scream member) Martin Duffy, who joined in 1985; that’s his soft, boyish face gazing out from the cover, as if affirming his integral role on the record. (That said, Lawrence’s creative influence remains undeniable; these are, as the record’s insert cutely phrases it, “Lawrence’s songs coloured in by the band.”) The cheery Hammond that kicks off opener “Rain of Crystal Spires” immediately draws a line between old and new Felt. With Duffy’s organ now serving as the lead sound, Felt’s uptempo melodies provide a foil for Lawrence’s brooding anxieties. In their early days, Lawrence was aggrieved by the constant Velvet Underground comparisons Felt received. (“We were much more mature,” he would protest.) Here, they leaned into the cozy influence of the ’60s on the delightful organ bounce of “Grey Streets” and the lush backup harmonies of “September Lady.” A note on the record’s packaging winks at the throwback: “Any similarity to songs already written is purely coincidental.” With no instrumentals taking up space, Forever Breathes the Lonely Word showcases Lawrence’s best lyricism. He spins tales of weary hearts and wistful longing, of a world that offers little hope, and expresses doubt in religion, celebrity, and faith of all sorts. He imbues these narratives with a familiar intimacy; “I like lost people, because I suppose I’m one,” he once remarked. From the confines of that sterile apartment, Lawrence imagined worlds for his discontent far more magnificent and vivid than his own. The melancholy of “Rain of Crystal Spires” is illuminated by visions of the legendary Arthurian island of Avalon as “Homer’s Iliad lay burning in the fire.” “Grey Streets” evokes images of “Closing eyelids [that] stutter and tumble and turn away/Makeshift memories they collide for another stay.” Later he envisions hallways choking on smoke, dead, uprooted trees, and “a man who’s got three square eyes and a boy with the snakeskin head.” Lest his listeners hear these poetic references and think of him as a “university type,” Lawrence clarified that he just had the ear of an aesthete. “I swear I’ve never read a poem in my life... It’s difficult to explain, but I just love beautiful things, beautiful words,” he objected. “We all know what classic pop music sounds like but there’s never been any classic pop lyrics—not for me anyway. Sure, I can take all the throwaway stuff but I prefer something more magical.” By 1986, Lawrence had become a master at subtle shade in his lyrics, slipping in a snub and changing subjects before there’s time to process it, usually with a flair of the mystical. “I’m not your Jesus so will you get off my cross,” he requests during “A Wave Crashed on Rocks.” “You travelled back four centuries in search of a silver sword/Your self-induced hallucinations they just make me bored,” he taunts on “Gather Up Your Wings and Fly.” “Grey Streets” is especially vitriolic, an account of the power dynamic between a fan idealizing an artist. “And you were attracted to me because my face smiled down from a wall and you said I looked kind,” he tells the fan with a sad smirk. He lays into the fan’s coolness, saying, “You’re so semi-precious about life and you won’t let your feelings show.” (The words “semi-precious” are given a particularly spiteful emphasis.) For all the ennui in his voice, Lawrence was never apathetic. The depths of his despair didn’t need to be vulgarly overstated, they could just breathe. “Grey Streets” gives way to the record’s centerpiece, “All the People I Like Are Those That Are Dead,” the closest thing to a Felt anthem. “Maybe I should entertain/The very fact that I’m insane,” Lawrence begins with characteristic self-deprecation. As guitar melodies twist around Duffy’s organ, Lawrence leans into his despair: “Maybe I should take a gun/And put it to the head of everyone,” he breathily wonders, seeing that as a mercy killing. A little over midway through, the instruments recede and Lawrence murmurs the title serenely to himself in near silence. The five-minute song epitomizes everything revered about Lawrence as a songwriter and Felt as a whole. Even when truly wallowing, denouncing God and all the sorrow he has caused, he never submits to melodrama. He knows he’s not alone in his misery. He just wants to show how much it can hurt when you feel so much. Forever Breathes the Lonely Word was Felt’s crowning achievement and so naturally it was received rather passively by the UK press. Sure, it was beautiful, they seemed to agree, but it was too insular to place on a pedestal. “Felt haven’t reinvented anything, won’t change anything. Only ninnies would turn Lawrence into anything except an armchair camp hero,” wrote NME’s Mark Sinker. “But,” he conceded, “this is a great record.” The record didn’t chart, and it failed to appear on either NME or Melody Maker’s best of 1986 lists. There could only be one surly dweeb romanticizing violence in 1986, and Morrissey won the popular vote with The Queen Is Dead. There’s not one specific reason why Felt never found commercial success. “It was too understated to be commercial, too art to go pop, too pop to go art,” Creation’s Alan McGee once said. Melody Maker put it more bluntly in 1986: “Felt make brilliant records that nobody buys.” Maybe it was the lack of support from BBC host and tastemaker John Peel, who was admittedly not a fan and never championed them on his show. Or it was the time that, shortly after the release of Forever Breathes, Lawrence attempted to mellow his nerves with some acid before a concert. Unfortunately, he got so freaked out that he refused to play until the audience—full of A&R scouts—left. And yet, Lawrence completed his 10-year plan and in 1989, after four more Felt records, the project ended. In the early ’90s, he formed Denim, a snarky ’70s revivalist act who met an untimely end when a song called “Summer Smash” was set to debut right after Princess Diana died in a car accident. Effectively abandoned by EMI, Lawrence went on to perform under the name Go-Kart Mozart, a maximalist electro-pop band still going today. As shown in the documentary Lawrence of Belgravia, the years that followed were marked by struggles with drug addiction and homelessness. But Felt had not been forgotten. As Lawrence once predicted, the band has been cherished in its afterlife. The swoony organ in “Rain of Crystal Spires” alone can be easily linked to the spring in the step of jangle poppers from C86 all the way to Slumberland. The cult of Felt can be heard in the gentle daydreams of the Field Mice, in the bookish malcontent of Glasgow’s Camera Obscura, and in the lucid ponderings of the Clientele. Felt were especially rampant in the 2011 musical conscious, with both San Francisco duo Girls and Irish post-punkers Girls Names naming songs after Lawrence. A few years later, indie pop darlings the Pains of Being Pure at Heart referenced Felt in their song “Art Smock” and then covered “The Ballad of the Band,” with Kip Berman providing a properly bitter Lawrence imitation. But their influence might be most obvious in the introspective songwriting of Belle and Sebastian’s Stuart Murdoch, a gigantic Felt fan who admittedly became obsessed with them only after their dissolution. “Poetic, ambitious, amazing,” is how he once described Forever Breathes the Lonely Word. “It’s hard to imagine this record ever having been released. Hard to imagine it was ever new.” Beyond referencing them in songs and fawning over them in liner notes, Murdoch’s music glows with Lawrence’s solitary introspection and his eye for profound beauty. Though it can feel like a cosmic slight that Forever Breathes the Lonely Word was not recognized as a masterpiece in 1986, this twist of fate feels harmonious with the ideas that Lawrence laid out in Felt songs. “I’d like to be remembered as someone who never lost touch with what he set out to do,” Lawrence told Melody Maker in 1989, after the band’s final record. “Felt never made a timeless classic—the greatest thing would be to make a record that could sit next to Marquee Moon or Horses. They’re on the top shelf, standing alone. And our records are scattered about on the shelf beneath with all the other greats.” Forever Breathes the Lonely Word closes with a song brilliantly titled “Hours of Darkness Have Changed My Mind.” After a record full of warmth, Lawrence presents a sparse sound that harks back to Felt’s first records. He gazes into the darkness and mystery swirling about him and admits a dream. “I’d like to do something that makes somebody somewhere care,” Lawrence sings with a desperation that is quiet but quite clear.","Each Sunday, Pitchfork takes an in-depth look at a significant album from the past, and any record not in our archives is eligible.

California Son,Morrissey,by: Ben Hewitt,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5c994006f3b12a6194bc191b/1:1/w_160/Morrissey_CaliforniaSon.jpg,2019-05-25 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/morrissey-california-son/,BMG,"Like all misfits, the Smiths never seemed entirely comfortable in their own timeline. They clung to old relics: the photographs of niche idols and faded stars on their artwork, the lyrical hat-tips to Oscar Wilde and Shelagh Delaney, the music-hall notes and rockabilly riffs, even a name that was symbolic of an old-fashioned sturdiness. But the nostalgia was always undercut by the sense that though they dreamt of the past, they knew they could never bring it back. “It just wasn’t like the old days anymore,” sighed Morrissey on “Still Ill,” his lips sore from trying to reawaken some distant, dormant magic. How times change. There’s no bittersweet beauty to be found in the reactionarism of today’s Morrissey, who just performed on “Jimmy Fallon” while wearing the badge of far-right political party For Britain. It’s the latest regrettable act in the charmless offensive he’s been escalating since 2017’s patchy, snarky Low in High School, as he continues to cheerlead for risible politicians, trot out his own inflammatory rhetoric, and dismiss dissenting voices as the product of myopic political correctness. At this point, then, it’s hard to trust even an album as supposedly innocent as California Son. Its premise is pure fan service: Morrissey and some (barely audible) high-profile guests rework 12 of his favorite ’60s and ’70s songs by North American artists, some of which flirt with ideas of social justice. The inclusion of those tracks feels pointed. Maybe they’re meant as proof that he’s still on the side of the underdogs, or as a sly suggestion that this is what real progressive politics sounds like. Maybe, as his manager said, there’s no agenda and it’s just supposed to be fun. If he’s right, it’s only to a point. It is more enjoyable to hear Morrissey in thrall to his passions than his peeves, but the toxicity of his public persona still poisons the well. To be clear, a mawkish take on Bob Dylan’s “Only a Pawn in Their Game,” about the assassination of civil rights activist Medgar Evers and the racist killer manipulated into pulling the trigger, would be a bad choice for anyone: However generous your thoughts about the nuances of Dylan’s original or Morrissey’s intentions in covering it, framing racists as victims and excusing their hate crimes seems ill-judged at best and downright reckless at worst in 2019, when the president gladly goes to bat for white nationalists. But it feels particularly disingenuous for Morrissey to bemoan fear-mongering politicians who whip up prejudice, considering some of the unsavory public figures he’s fond of. It’s a shame, because the best bits of California Son are as strong as anything Morrissey’s done in years, thanks to him and producer Joe Chiccarelli ditching Low in High School’s waspish spirit but keeping its zest for new sounds. The strongest songs pull out some inner strangeness from the originals you’d never really heard before. Buffy-Sainte Marie’s “Suffer the Little Children” is recast as a devilish, ramshackle stomp with bluesy keys and a hammily spooky vocal turn: “He keeps his nails clean/Did you think he was a boogeyman?” Morrissey adds a dark surrealism to Carly Simon’s “When You Close Your Eyes,” too, crooning over its twinkling electronics and lush harps like an eerie figure from a children’s fairytale. He and Chiccarelli turn the sci-fi fantasy of Jobriath’s “Morning Starship” into a space odyssey, filling its glimmering score with futuristic squiggles and crunching cosmic guitars, so it’s like being serenaded by the house band on an intergalactic cruiser. When they play it safer, like on their workmanlike strum through Joni Mitchell’s “Don’t Interrupt the Sorrow” or the easy-listening wistfulness of their take on Roy Orbison’s “It’s Over,” the results are less remarkable. And while it’s a relief to be spared Morrissey’s bitterness, sometimes California Son feels too frothy, and he sounds like he doesn’t have any skin in the game at all. He and Green Day’s Billie Joe Armstrong aim for playfulness with Laura Nyro’s “Wedding Bell Blues” and land on cloyingly kitsch instead. Producer Stephen Street once marveled at how Morrissey would build himself up for studio takes like a dramatic actor; here, he’s taking his work about as seriously as a goofy “SNL” sketch. The choice between listening to a misanthropic relative telling you old stories they love or hearing them grouch at the news is a no-brainer, but that doesn’t make some of the sugariness easier to swallow: As hard as Morrissey tries, it’s difficult to enjoy a celebratory gambol with him down memory lane when it’s full of potholes. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it’s the gloomiest moments that come closest to winning you over, like when he turns Tim Hardin’s “Lenny’s Tune” into an exquisite elegy at a doomy cabaret bar, or when he makes Melanie’s “Some Say (I Got Devil)” sound like the darkly dramatic last stand of a vengeful titan. When you hear them, you could almost pretend it was the old days again, even though you know it can never be the same.","Morrissey and some (barely audible) high-profile guests rework 12 of his favorite ’60s and ’70s songs by American artists to mixed results.

Brown Rice,Don Cherry,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ce947a9f2bde65a35aad643/1:1/w_160/R-13641218-1558106413-9774.jpeg-1.jpg,2019-05-25 05:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/don-cherry-brown-rice/,VerveUME,"After the seismic 23 months (1959-1961) in which the Ornette Coleman Quartet flipped the jazz world on its ear, Coleman, drummer Ed Blackwell, bassist Charlie Haden, and trumpeter Don Cherry scattered to the winds. In the decades that followed, Coleman jammed with everyone from the London Symphony Orchestra to his ten-year old son Denardo to the Master Musicians of Joujouka. Ed Blackwell drummed for Eric Dolphy and Yoko Ono while Haden wed Spanish Civil War folk songs to jazz. And Don Cherry set about traversing the globe in search of what he deemed “organic music.” Today, you can find the word “organic” in any Kroger or corner bodega, but in the early ‘70s it was as alien as yoga, world music, and a macrobiotic diet, all concepts that would inform Cherry’s approach to music for the rest of his life. Uprooted from Oklahoma to the Watts ghetto in California when the oil boom destroyed the family land, Cherry was attuned to societal ills from an early age. And while his work was rooted in jazz improvisation, Cherry sought a level playing field in his work that could unite Indian classical, African township jive, Indonesian gamelan, Arabic folk, electric Miles, early minimalism, orchestral music, skronky noise, and more, sometimes all at once. Cherry’s childlike vision of inclusiveness pioneered what would soon be known as “world music.” But rather than a sippable café soundtrack, Cherry’s music was sprawling, free, ecstatic, and devout. Most of his ‘70s albums came in the form of concert recordings that captured him in the heat of the moment, but 1975’s Brown Rice is a thrilling exception. Cut across two studios in New York, the four compositions here present the most focused vision of Cherry’s muse, resembling his wife Moki Cherry’s carefully assembled tapestries rather than the paint splatters of live performance. Featuring Haden on bass, old Coleman drummer Billy Higgins, fiery saxophonist Frank Lowe, and Moki on tambura, with glints of vocals and electronics, the album is searing and psychedelic, pulsing and deeply hypnotic. Abstract, visceral, and deeply personal (the cover photo shows Cherry at Watts Towers), Brown Rice anticipates the boundary-free future of music. But it wasn’t always easy to hear; never reissued on CD in the US, this vinyl reissue comes some 40 years after its original release. In the opening minute of “Brown Rice,” Cherry’s world-embracing vision is made clear. An ode to a time in Cherry’s life when he subsisted only on brown rice “to remind myself there were starving people in the world” (though Julian Cope suggests it might be about heroin instead), it speaks to the two extremes of Cherry, that of the spiritual seeker and the junkie jazz musician. Two electric keyboards chime in tandem, emulating either Chinese classical music or gamelan, while Haden’s wah-wah bass interlocks with electric bongos and forms a groove. Vocalist Verna Gillis purrs an inviting and skin-prickling “ooh.” As it all starts to percolate and cook, Lowe’s bluesy outbursts lance the tapestry and Cherry calmly utters the titular phrase and other ingredients like “miiiiso,” his intonation making that bulk grain sound at once wholly sensuous and slightly sinister. “Malkauns” references one of the oldest raga forms in Indian classical music. Moki Cherry’s tambura acts as a resting breath beneath the expansive composition, slow and deep, as Haden takes an extended solo that’s contemplative, poignant, and unhurried. When Cherry and Higgins enter nearly five minutes in, the piece moves from calm to urgent, casting off the strictures of Eastern and Western musical forms and cresting towards a sumptuous peak. “Chenrezig” is the closest Brown Rice ever gets to sounding like straight jazz, though purists might disagree. Nearly as long as “Malkauns” and with a gaze similarly affixed towards infinity, it’s named for the most revered of all Bodhisattvas (the Dalai Lama is considered to be his reincarnation). After opening chimes and Cherry’s growled incantation set the ritual in motion, his trumpet flutters around Lowe’s melodic, vibrato-heavy solo, leading towards a tranquil center some 8 minutes in. The piece then turns ferocious; ecstatic blues chords from pianist Ricky Cherry urge the song forward and Lowe plows ahead with a shrieking, stratospheric solo, Don Cherry joining him with high-register runs and vocal ululations. Closer “Degi-Degi” suggests a liminal space between German kosmische, Afrobeat, jazz fusion, and electric funk, powered by Haden’s incessant bass and Cherry’s high-arcing solos and whispers about “the goddess of music.” Relentless and incandescent, it rebuffs the notion that spiritual music must be placid. Much like Coleman, Albert Ayler, and John Coltrane did in the ‘60s, Cherry suggests—as Alice Coltrane did in the same era—that true spiritual awakening stems not always from a state of peace but from tumult and upheaval. In its balance of noise and bliss, beauty and chaos, Brown Rice is true world music.","Reissued on vinyl some 40 years after its initial release, Don Cherry’s sprawling, free, ecstatic masterwork defined what came to be known as “world” music.

Diviner,Hayden Thorpe,by: Patric Fallon,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cdedd9a85a35dd67de642c0/1:1/w_160/HaydenThorpe_Diviner.jpg,2019-05-25 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hayden-thorpe-diviner/,Domino,"The British singer-songwriter Hayden Thorpe released “Diviner” in late February 2019, just a year after the final performance of his band Wild Beasts. From its stark opening chords and breathy first line—“I’m a keeper of secrets, pray do tell”—the song sounded markedly personal. With little more than his stately countertenor and humble piano, Thorpe harnessed the energy of quiet solitude and proceeded to pitch that emotion skyward until the music felt bathed in a dim light. After more than a decade with Wild Beasts, “Diviner” pointed to a different direction for Thorpe. That eponymous single opens Thorpe’s debut solo album, which is fitting not just because it was the first song he wrote after Wild Beasts announced their split; it is the central thesis and shining example of his solo music. This 10-song collection was written largely at home on his own piano, which he’s referred to as a “totem.” But you could also think of the instrument as his anchor. Diviner is wholly rooted in stripped-down songwriting and reverent hush; its tonal range is decidedly limited. Thorpe and producer/collaborator Leo Abrahams do flesh out some of the piano pieces with muted guitar, drums, and electronics, in an attempt to break Diviner out of its two dimensions: “Straight Lines” adds an understated funk to what’s essentially an elegy for the inevitable end of all relationships. But the layering of contrasts doesn’t always work. Songs like “Earthly Needs” and “Love Crimes” varnish Thorpe’s piano with the kind of disco-pop patina that marked 2016’s Boy King, yet there’s nothing quite so brash or ornate here, so instead we get what sounds like a hopelessly introspective Boy George singing about “emotional jujitsu” and “living a life of love crime.” Chalk it up to the pitfalls of unabashedly baring one’s interior life while writing a pop album. Thorpe makes up for his more dubious sojourns when he lets his anchor steady him. The second half of Diviner ditches the opening half’s attempts at levity and delivers some of the record’s most impactful music. The conviction of “In My Name” is audible in its ringing chords and whispers. His unusually expressive vocal melody brings depth to “Anywhen,” while the piano suggests the rippling pulse of a Nils Frahm performance. Such standouts aren’t entirely devoid of their own small shortcomings, like the awkward line, “Now when I think of us, I pretty much self combust.” But there’s a charm to these lyrics that’s distinctly Thorpe’s; even a loaded word like “collusion,” sung with a kind of dejected swagger, is freed from its obvious overtones. Diviner is concerned with the passage of time and reckoning with the past, and parts of it are rooted quite deeply in Thorpe's own history. His 2013 cover of “Goodbye Horses” and Wild Beasts’ Boy King closer “Dreamliner” are early incarnations of the sound he explores here. The idea for a solo album came to him while playing the piano at his father's house, which he'd learned on as a boy; the fluttering ambient piece “Spherical Time” dates back to a composition he started at the age of 16. “A world is waiting for us outside,” Thorpe sings at the album’s end, on “Impossible Object,” as if acknowledging that he’s spent too long cooped up in his head. He has spoken of Diviner as “a self-help album,” and to that end, some of its songs are so intimate that their meanings seem all but impossible for an outsider to parse. But in the moments when he decides to push his music out into the light, Thorpe's self-searching takes on a shape we can all recognize.","The former Wild Beasts singer embarks on a new direction on his soul-searching solo debut, stripping back his songwriting to a reverent hush.

Dozakh: All Lovers Hell,Nadia Tehran,by: Michelle Kim,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cd5ca815a46c27b71097e6f/1:1/w_160/NadiaTehran_DozkahAllLoversHell.jpg,2019-05-25 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/nadia-tehran-dozakh-all-lovers-hell/,YEAR0001,"Dozakh: All Lovers Hell, the debut album from Iranian-Swedish artist Nadia Tehran, begins with a recording of her immigrant father, Ali Kardar, saying that he’s not afraid of death. He’s in the middle of describing a near-fatal experience during his time as a soldier in the Iran-Iraq war. “I wake up with unbelievable pain that isn’t just pain from my legs, it’s pain through my whole soul,” he recounts in Swedish. “I didn’t even realize that my leg was gone.” And with that harrowing image, Tehran sets up Dozakh, an album examining emotional purgatory and devastation in all its forms. Dozakh means hell in Persian. But in a statement, Tehran has explained that she conceptualizes the word metaphorically, as “a place of torment one believes they are in when separated from their lover.” In accordance with this thinking, Tehran writes about romantic love as tragedy, weaving in apocalyptic images of death and violence to underscore her point. On the synth-pop song “Down,” Tehran bridges the visceral lyricism of CocoRosie with Sky Ferreira’s twisted romanticism. “I’d be the best girl that you ever had/I’d blow you when you’re sad and lick your wounds when you’ve been bad,” she sings, revealing a fascinatingly warped sense of devotion. Dozakh is saturated with a feeling of hopelessness, but Tehran keeps things moving with deft genre-hopping. As a preteen, Tehran sang in a punk band in her small Swedish town, and she lists her YEAR0001 label mates Yung Lean and Viagra Boys as inspirations. On “Something New,” she sounds like Karen O fronting Show Me the Body, while “Jet” is a snarling takedown of immigrant stereotypes, like a more in-your-face version of M.I.A.’s “Paper Planes.” “Alcoholic Waves” is cloud rap on downers; “True romance is a drank in my cup/True romance is to light it up,” she chants in sing-song, like a depraved lullaby. No matter the style, Tehran’s music matches her nihilistic worldview. But this universal doom and gloom is also a crutch, and Tehran’s songwriting is ultimately not sharp or precise enough to get a singular point across. There are songs about being heartbroken and disillusioned by a former partner (“High,” “Tell Nobody”), ones that have a more pointed political message (“Jet,” “Nazi Killer”), and others that simply describe haunting thoughts of death and genocide (“Come and Go”). But Tehran fails to tie these themes together, leaving it unclear how post-war trauma and romantic heartbreak are inherently connected; the only loose common thread is the pervading sense of self-destruction. Nadia Tehran’s vision of hell is terrifying. But without an incisive message, its impact dulls by the end.","The debut album from the Iranian-Swedish artist offers a fascinatingly dark take on romantic love, filled with images of violence and devastation.

Flamagra,Flying Lotus,by: Philip Sherburne,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cd44ce9c13a4531dfe82805/1:1/w_160/FlyingLotus_Flamagra.jpg,2019-05-24 05:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/flying-lotus-flamagra/,Warp,"You’re Dead! was such a momentous piece of work, and such an inflection point in Flying Lotus’ career, that his earlier albums can now sound conventional by comparison. They were original and daring, but remained planted in soil tilled by pioneers like Dilla and Madlib. You’re Dead! offered a different vision: ecstatic, shapeshifting, deeply collaborative, and with a remarkable ability to mask its making. Where most beat music foregrounds surfaces and processes—the fingerprints on the pads of the MPC, the dust in the grooves of the wax—the 2014 album flowed like magical liquid with no discernable source. Where beat music is grounded, You’re Dead! was pure vapor, a lungful of atoms returned swirling into the universe. You’re Dead! was an album about mortality, one colored by the passing of friends, peers, and family members; it reflected the increasingly cosmic scope of Steven Ellison’s work as Flying Lotus, in which spiritual jazz could exist side by side with sick jokes, the sublime with the ridiculous, fanciful, and ribald. This time, on his sixth album, there is no explicit theme; the through line holding Flamagra together seems to be the creative process itself. Ellison spent the past five years working on the album; 10 tracks swelled to more than two dozen. For a while, it was envisioned as a collection of just beats, no jazz. The jazz eventually wormed its way back in, thanks to longtime collaborators like keyboardists Brandon Coleman, Dennis Hamm, and Taylor Graves; multi-instrumentalist Miguel Atwood-Ferguson; and, especially, bassist Stephen Bruner, better known as Thundercat, a key member of the Brainfeeder brain trust and a co-writer of the majority of these songs. The album’s guiding metaphor was a flame on a hill. “Then I went to this party and heard David Lynch saying the words that he wound up saying on the record,” Ellison says. “And I was like, ‘That’s it, we’re just going to go in that direction.’” For all the clarity that the image of a flame on a hill might suggest, there is a lot of murk and confusion. There’s a lot of everything; fortunately, that goes both ways. There are bouts of thick, gloopy overload but also instances of crystalline focus; there are serpentine jazz-funk rave-ups and moments of profound stillness. In keeping with a lot of beat music, many of these tracks are relatively short. The abundance of minute-and-a-half miniatures means that, for all the viscous density of the stacked keyboards, and all the nervous momentum of Thundercat’s agile fretwork, there’s plenty of room to breathe. On a sensory level the music sounds incredible, crafted with a technical dexterity that only accentuates its vast dimension. Sweeping, prismatic jazz-funk predominates, but there is no shortage of surprises. The 89-second “Andromeda,” a co-write with Thundercat, sounds like Flying Lotus’ take on Radiohead’s version of post-rock. “Say Something,” even shorter, might be Tom Waits soundtracking a Wes Anderson film. “Pygmy,” a late-album highlight, drizzles Thundercat’s high-necked bass melody over rainforest samples and a beat that swishes like a rushing river; it’s as moving as it is simple. The album feels, above all, like a sketchbook—synths from “Takashi,” a funk-lite tune built from Jackson Pollack-like layers of spattered keys, turn up 11 tracks later on “Debbie Is Depressed,” and their recurrence is more than simple déjà vu; it’s a peek into Ellison’s hard drive, a glimpse at the way ideas from a given session are carried into new contexts. Some of the record’s most sketch-like pieces are its most rewarding: Consider “Pilgrim Side Eye,” a cartoonishly swaggering funk miniature that flips, in its final seconds, into gorgeous, sighing chords, soft as baby’s breath. The song, an instrumental, is over in 91 seconds; jazz great Herbie Hancock is in there somewhere, scampering around within the antic changes, but the horizon is egoless. All virtuosity is channeled back into the spirit of group interplay. Tierra Whack pulls off the most striking star turn, on “Yellow Baby,” the album’s sparsest track—just a spindly, ramshackle beat, all errant claps and snares, underpinning the Philadelphia rapper’s wild gyrations. Ellison builds the barest of scaffolding for her to dangle from, and she makes the most of this rickety playground, sounding giddy as she lags dangerously behind the beat. Flying Lotus is known as a maximalist, but here he shows how much he can do with simple materials, especially when paired with the right partner. Even in two- and three-minute doses, 67 minutes of this stuff is a lot. A handful of tracks could probably have been set aside for a separate EP or a deluxe edition of the album. And for all the bold-print clout of the assembled guests—Solange, George Clinton, Toro y Moi, Little Dragon’s Yukimi Nagano—one wishes for more standout songs on par with You’re Dead!’s “Never Catch Me,” featuring Kendrick Lamar. Ellison comes closest on “More,” featuring Anderson .Paak at his raspy, declamatory best. The hook is an expression of existential yearning boiled down to its essence: “There’s gotta be more to life than myself… Gotta be somethin’ more that I can’t tell.” It’s here that the album comes closest to the big-picture soul-searching of You’re Dead! But even when he sets his sights on closer targets, it’s clear that Flying Lotus is a rare talent with enviable range, more next-level bandleader than mere beatmaker. No wonder that David Lynch gets a surrealistic spoken-word solo at the dead center of the album: The shock-headed director’s self-contained universes are an obvious influence on Ellison’s own art. True, Flamagra may not comprise nearly as elaborate a world as those that Lynch conjures, and it doesn’t push Ellison’s art forward in the same way that You’re Dead! did. But the afterlife is a hard act to follow, and in the light of that flame on the hill, Flamagra makes for an engaging way station.","On Steven Ellison’s sixth album, his sweeping jazz-funk feels limitless. It sounds more like a sketchbook with FlyLo crafting each minute with great care and technical dexterity.

4REAL 4REAL,YG,by: Sheldon Pearce,Contributing Writer,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5ce56603fa43fd24a406808c/1:1/w_160/YG_4REAL4REAL.jpg,2019-05-24 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/yg-4real-4real/,Def Jam,"In 2015, YG survived a shooting at a Los Angeles studio. His resulting paranoia birthed 2016’s belligerent Still Brazy, and the effects lingered through his last album, 2018’s chest-thumping Stay Dangerous. “I’m the man, bitch, I walk ‘round like I’m bulletproof,” he rapped, sounding like a man possessed. After surviving an attempt on his life, in what he believed to be a set up, his message was clear: He wasn’t going to be caught with his guard down again. Earlier this year, Nipsey Hussle got shot, too, only he didn’t make it. Nip was a mentor to YG. Despite being in rival gangs, the two rappers formed a bond. They appeared alongside each other representing unity against the evil empire on “FDT.” They’d been planning a joint mixtape together as far back as 2013. After Nipsey’s death, YG pushed the release of his album back out of respect for the fallen, and there’s an inscription in his honor on the cover. In a speech given at Nipsey’s service, which appears as a track on 4REAL 4REAL, YG referred to him as his “brother from the other color” and congratulated him for leaving a lasting legacy and an unbreakable brand before vowing to carry that legacy forward. “The muthafuckin’ marathon continues,” he and Mustard shouted in unison, in keeping with Nip’s decree. 4REAL 4REAL, though dedicated to Nipsey’s memory, doesn’t really expound upon his values. YG doesn’t pick up the financial-freedom mantle. He isn’t really out to educate. He’s a tad too bitter to make something like Victory Lap. Instead, he honors his friend the only way he knows how: by doubling down. That means continuing his War on Snitches and picking up whatever slack remains in representing the West Coast. “Call Dre, Call Snoop, Call Game and Kendrick, too/When you think about the West it’s me and Nip, red and blue,” he raps in the opener, illustrating how diametrically opposed forces can be halves of a whole. If Nipsey was the community organizer, YG is the disruptor. That said, YG is calmer on 4REAL. Not “calm,” but calmer. Credit Nip’s influence. He still reserves plenty of contempt for his favorite targets: broke dudes, snitches, broke dudes who also snitch—but he makes a concerted effort to sidestep real violence. There are fewer confrontations—“Forward progress, I don’t backtrack/That’s my old life, audible, I’m passed that,” he raps on “Bottle Service.” (He does threaten to put someone in a chokehold, but it stops there, which feels like progress.) The energy goes into the rapping, which is cleaner, clearer, and more focused than it has been in a few years. Mustard and YG remain perfect partners for each other, two artists who value cutting straight to the point. Mustard makes YG sound sharper and funnier, and YG seems to embolden Mustard’s wildest beats—check out the mariachi horns of “Go Loko.” 4REAL 4REAL doesn’t quite reestablish YG as the album artist of My Krazy Life and Still Brazy, but what it lacks in a satisfying through line it makes up for in highlights. The breezy, feel-good Cali groove of “Do Yo Dance” and the satisfying block anthem “Do Not Disturb,” both of which feature Kamaiyah, are some of his catchiest cuts. On “I Was On the Block,” YG experiments with a spaced-out, off0-kilter Valee-style flow, and it suits him. “Heart 2 Heart” is the kind of gangsta-empowering, buy-back-the-block tutorial that would do Nipsey proud, with Meek Mill turning up to counsel on enduring prison bids. There’s always at least one cringy song on a YG album, in which he needlessly judges some woman’s sexuality (here, it’s “Keshia’s Got a Baby”), but he rectifies this by letting Compton’s Day Sulan close the album with “Her Story.” It’s a move in line with Nipsey’s ethics: pay it forward, help bring other perspectives to light, uplift your community. The marathon continues.","YG pays heartfelt tribute to the late Nipsey Hussle on his latest while still reserving plenty of vitriol for his favorite targets: broke dudes, snitches, broke dudes who also snitch.

We Get By,Mavis Staples,by: Stephen M.

The mood is dark, the music spare: just a steely electric guitar, a distant tambourine that sounds like rattling chains, and Staples’ mighty voice. She’s mic’d so close you can hear the breath catch in her throat between words, subtle exhalations that reveal her sincerity as well as her age. She turns 80 this year, and she doesn’t mind showing her experience and wisdom. “Heavy on My Mind” grapples with the devastation of loss and the confusion that accompanies grief: “Sometimes I wish, sometimes I fall in the well,” she sighs. “We can wait out the storm or we can stand in the rain/Gonna have to mourn or hide from some pain.” It’s a remarkable vocal performance by an artist who specializes in them, and a reminder of just how easy it is to take Staples for granted. Staples has sung quietly before, in particular on some of the more prayerful songs from her recent trilogy of albums with producer Jeff Tweedy, but “Heavy on My Mind” is a little different, in that it allows her to escape her own legacy and sing for herself. For 70 years—ever since she started singing with her family’s gospel group in the late 1940s—she has conveyed a sense of moral authority, drawing from the faithful certitude of gospel as well as the populist activism of folk. Her voice is so powerful and her disposition so joyful and generous that she sings for every American, as the first-person-plural title We Get By implies: We are all in this together. Her music has a communal glow and a steely determination, but “Heavy on My Mind” shows how hard her walk has been. Perhaps through divine intervention, Staples launched a comeback right when we needed her: celebrating a hopeful new era in American politics in the late 2000s and commiserating the seemingly hopeless era that followed. We Get By is about the strength and determination required to weather these storms, to sing for so many people without losing focus or hope. She and producer Ben Harper don’t shy away from big, public statements about the direction of the country, and songs like opener “Change” (“things gotta change around here”) and “Brothers and Sisters” (“not too far down the wrong road to turn around”) don’t venture far from her recent albums in sound or sentiment. Harper gently harkens back to the Staple Singers with raw, rolling guitar licks that recall Pops’ innovative style and a genially funky rhythm section that would be at home in the concert hall or the church sanctuary. Because Staples has lost little expressiveness with age, We Get By sounds surprisingly raucous and admirably rough around the edges, especially on the percolating “Anytime.” But these songs are more about the small, quiet spaces where Staples can catch her breath and steel her nerves. Weighing particularly heavy on her mind is the idea of change, both the change she’d like to see in our country and the change she’s going through as she outlives beloved friends and family. The recent passing of sister Yvonne Staples looms large over these songs, so much so that Mavis dedicates the album to her. “Grab hold of the days, before the days grab hold of you,” she advises on “Hard to Leave,” which traces the distance between herself and home. Written by Harper, the song might be just another sad tale about the trials a touring musician faces during a life on the road, but Staples lends it extra gravity, as though aware she’s reached an age when each goodbye might be the last. The tone, however, is wistful rather than grim: “I’m passing through time like a warm summer breeze,” she sings. “It’s always hard, so hard to leave.” It’s a heavy burden, but she gets by.","The legendary singer has lost little expressiveness with age, but these songs are about the small, quiet spaces where she can catch her breath and steel her nerves.

Amyl and the Sniffers,Amyl and the Sniffers,by: Stephen Thomas Erlewine,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cdc2e3285a35d6949e63edd/1:1/w_160/AmylAndTheSniffers_ST.jpg,2019-05-24 05:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/amyl-and-the-sniffers-amyl-and-the-sniffers/,ATORough TradeFlightless,"It’s entirely justified to find Amyl and the Sniffers annoying just on the basis that the Melbourne punk quartet romanticizes the dirtbag 1970s to a degree that’s cartoonish. Too young to have experienced Dookie firsthand, let alone Never Mind the Bollocks, Here’s the Sex Pistols, Amyl and the Sniffers are blessed by the callous disregard of youth, adopting ratty mullets and tacky high-waisted jeans as gleefully as they swipe riffs from the Damned and the Stooges. The blatant rips are the point: Irked by dead-end jobs and digital chaos, they’re seeking refuge in the past. What keeps Amyl and the Sniffers from being a boring retread of old rock’n’roll tropes is that apart from their intentionally ugly images—whether it’s their stage getups or the cover art to their eponymous first album, they celebrate the aspects of the ’70s best left forgotten—the band really doesn’t care about the specifics of history whatsoever. No matter how often their fuzzed-out riffs and frenetic rhythms hint at familiar sounds, Amyl and the Sniffers rarely evoke any one specific band on their debut: It’s all a gaudy pastiche, cobbled together from barre chords, spittle, and lager. On their earliest EPs, Amyl and the Sniffers played with this same aesthetic but they were constrained by their homespun origins. The group wrote and recorded the entirety of 2016’s Giddy Up within 12 hours, and its 2017 sequel, Big Attractions, seemed only slightly more considered. Both EPs were textbook exercises in DIY where it was impossible to separate the content from the format; as the songs blazed by in minute-long bursts, the sound thrilled as much as the hooks. By the very virtue of being released on a major label, Amyl and the Sniffers reverses that equation. While the group still tends to run lean—most of the album’s 11 songs clock in well under three minutes, with the whole thing rushing by in half an hour—all of the songs feel formed. Give some of the credit to producer Ross Orton. A veteran of the Sheffield scene—he played drums in Add N to (X) and floated through Pulp’s circles on his way to working on M.I.A.s’ Arular, gaining a noteworthy credit by producing Arctic Monkeys’ 2013 LP AM—Orton gives the band a beefier, bolder sound. This increased heft accentuates how Amyl and the Sniffers can sound like heirs to the sharpie rockers of Australia, a dirty underground movement of the ’70s that traded upon glam and nascent heavy metal—a sound that eventually wormed its way into the gnarly riffs of AC/DC and Rose Tattoo. To an extent, these callbacks are deliberate—certainly, Amyl and the Sniffers borrow heavily from the sartorial style of the sharpies—but what makes the group such a blast is that it takes no knowledge of arcane Australian rock’n’roll to enjoy their debut. The group exists entirely on the surface, cranking amps to 11 and playing like it’s in a rush to head back to the bar. What makes Amyl and the Sniffers slightly preferable to one of the band’s gigs is that Orton channels its energy and then adds definition to its roar. Also, at home it’s easier to catch lead singer Amy Taylor’s knack for the catchphrases and fleeting images that anchor their songs. Perhaps Taylor doesn’t often shape these words into a coherent story—“Gacked on Anger,” a perennial anthem of the underclass (“I wanna help out the people on the street/But how can I help them when I can’t afford to eat”), and the besotted “Got You” come the closest—but it’s enough to suggest she could sharpen this instinct once she bothered to take a breather. Then again, the appeal of Amyl and the Sniffers is that it never bothers to slow down. That doesn’t mean the record lacks slack moments—the opening instrumental fanfare “Starfire 500” feels best left on the stage, where the lads can vamp as audience anticipation for Taylor grows—but the aggressive acceleration means the album never invites any time for contemplation. Such relentless momentum can give the illusion that the songs are sturdier than they are, but that’s also the pleasure of Amyl and the Sniffers: The album exists so thoroughly in the moment that it winds up obliterating the group’s fetishization of the past and just delivers pure, uncut rock’n’roll fun.","The Aussie rockers’ unabashed fetishization of 1970s staples like punk, glam, and their country’s sharpie scene only helps fuel the invigorating rush of their music.

Fever,Megan Thee Stallion,by: Taylor Crumpton,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cded6affa43fd05a9067eb4/1:1/w_160/MeganTheeStallion_Fever.jpg,2019-05-23 05:00:00,Rap,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/megan-thee-stallion-fever/,1501 Certified 300,"When Megan Thee Stallion’s “Big Ole Freak” landed on Billboard’s Hot 100 in April, it was a testament to years of viral freestyles and her devoted “hotties,” whose faithful support on social media helped the song rise to mainstream recognition. The 24-year-old has been prolific—her evolution is displayed through the invention of various rap personas, such as Tina Snow, Megan Thee Stallion, and Hot Girl Meg, the turn-up queen with serious ambition on her mind. “We have so many legends and so many greats,” she recently said of her hometown of Houston, Texas. “But I don’t feel like we ever really had a female rapper from Houston or Texas shut that shit down.” With her debut project Fever, she hopes to succeed in doing just that. At its core is the intersection of two beautiful rap legacies: the women rap tradition started by MC Lyte and Queen Latifah, and Southern rap dynasty ushered in by Houston’s Geto Boys and Underground Kings. From the first song, Megan weaponizes misogyny through the execution of bars worthy of XXL Freshman Class President. South Park’s influence, home to fellow Houston legends Scarface and Lil’ Keke, is felt throughout “Hood Rat Shit,” which transitions into an ass-and clit-eating tutorial for her male tricks on “Pimpin,” where the spirit of Houston’s pimp tradition is embedded within every word. Sinister beats by producers Concept P and KC Supreme amplify Megan’s dedication to her set and willingness to actively to engage in ghetto affairs, despite her newfound rich bitch lifestyle. The track serves as a compliment to Juicy J’s production, which empowered Megan’s passionate highlight reel of recent wins of Houston’s champ. Reminiscent of Pam Grier’s dynasty of heroine Blaxploitation films that inspired Fever’s album cover, Megan’s sexual politics take center stage. For decades, black women in rap have been reduced to one-dimensional characters that lacked complexity, but Megan asserts herself as “Thee Stallion” and undoes the historically male-centered framework in favor of black women’s sexual narratives. Her assertiveness in the fulfillment of sexual desires and pleasures is highlighted by Southern laced samples of UGK, Three 6 Mafia, and Project Pat to illustrate a sizzurp-induced night of ecstasy, where Megan is in charge of her body, and models to “hotties” how to enjoy theirs. “Nine times out of 10, I’m the realest bitch you know/If you ain’t want a pimp then what you fuckin’ with me for,” she raps in “Running Up Freestyle,” challenging any pimps wary of power. Megan’s delivery of perfectly executed bars are comparable to successions from a fully automatic machine gun; a carefully studied aim of fiery stanzas that could only be carried by a rapper with extensive knowledge of the genre’s early practices of battle rap. Her reign is amplified by the embrace of a rich bitch identity, who takes pleasure in ending the lives of those attempt to block her financial avenues and asserts herself as the number one pimp in “Money Good.” Departing from Tina Snow (her pimp persona), Megan shows us more of theHot Girl Meg on “Sex Talk” where the party girl finds sweet delight in ruining her partner’s life in an endless night of cowgirl and oral sex. Although the track’s origins are rooted in sex positivity, its stanzas reveal a character who is all assertion and dominance. It isn’t until “Shake That”—a song that delightfully includes a tribute to Omega Psi Phi Fraternity Inc.’s talent for cunnilingus—that you sense a few cracks in the project, both in sound and subject, that Megan is still finding out what works and what doesn’t for her singular style. Though, imagine being heralded as the future of Houston rap, an iconic sound that marries generational, regional, and gendered heritages of her intersecting identities as a black woman from the South. It's a journey. Just a few months ago, Megan Thee Stallion lost her mother, Holly Thomas, to brain cancer. She was one of her biggest influences, taking her to the studio when she was young to witness her laying down tracks as the rapper Holly-Wood. In the harder tracks on Fever, you can almost see Megan’s mother sparring with daughter, each of them delivering Rocky Balboa-blows to the jaw, becoming stronger together. Megan Thee Stallion is now a piece of Houston’s heart, so when you listen to Fever, you hear lean-induced nights at the strip club, freestyles in South Park, house parties at Prairie View A&M and Texas Southern University, but most importantly you’re starting to hear her. She has prepared her whole life for the opportunity to challenge the coastal elites for a seat at rap’s table, and Fever is her folding chair.","Megan Thee Stallion’s debut is steeped in sex, pimpin, and power; it sounds like a once and future Houston rap classic.

Ecstatic Computation,Caterina Barbieri,by: Miles Bowe,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cdc23d1fa43fd0e1a067c75/1:1/w_160/CaterinaBarbieri_EcstaticComputation.jpg,2019-05-23 05:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/caterina-barbieri-ecstatic-computation/,Editions Mego,"Caterina Barbieri uses music to bend time and space around her. The Italian-born, Berlin-based electronic composer’s 2017 breakthrough, Patterns of Consciousness, utilized whirling synth oscillations over marathon run times to create something akin to a dreamachine for the ears. Like the device conceived by Brion Gysin and William S. Burroughs to create hallucinatory visuals with alpha-wave-inducing flickers of light, Barbieri’s cumulatively building patterns made each track a mind-altering journey. She didn’t so much reach mesmerizing climaxes as induce them right in the listener’s brain. Last year’s Born Again in the Voltage scrambled her musical timeline even further: Functioning as a single, fluid piece, the album sounded like an evolution, but it had actually been recorded in 2014. With Ecstatic Computation, Barbieri’s proper follow-up and debut for Editions Mego, she has folded her sonic universe in on itself once again, delivering a series of tracks that break new ground individually while flowing seamlessly as a whole. Barbieri opens Ecstatic Computation with its longest and most definitive statement, the 10-minute “Fantas.” Though that might be shorter than her earliest tracks, it condenses an arc worthy of an entire album. She’s grown so skilled at programming hypnotic webs of sound that listeners are already put under by the halfway point, but Barbieri doesn’t stop there. After building the tense melodic progression to its logical peak, the track softens and stretches but never stops gaining momentum. It’s a warp-speed jump where everything seems to move slower and faster all at once. The brilliance of “Fantas” is hearing her use that sensory state not as an end, but a foundation to build even further. After Barbieri weaves the central theme back in near the end, it feels as if she could take us anywhere. Instead she shatters everything, distorting the sequence into a crashing electrical storm that’s all the more bracing for how methodically she’s set it up. It’s a breathtaking moment, one that cements her mastery of entrancing listeners by virtue of how dramatically she takes it away. From there, the previously rigid structures of Barbieri’s music melt away like never before. “Fantas” is followed by “Spine of Desire”, an effervescent 94-second rush of endlessly climbing Shepard tones. The shortest piece of music she’s ever released, “Spine” builds a bridge towards club music, bringing to mind the pointillistic trance of fellow Milanese producer Lorenzo Senni. On “Arrow of Time” Barbieri moves into a more classical mode, methodically spacing an 18th-century harpsichord around operatic vocals from singers Annie Gårlid and Evelyn Saylor. The two recently appeared among many voices on Holly Herndon’s album PROTO, where they play a crucial role during one of the “live training” pieces, teaching an A.I. collaborator how to sing. Though Barbieri has used vocals in her music before, Gårlid and Saylor’s gorgeous passages provide an exciting counterpoint to the algorithmic structure of her music: a newly introduced element of the divine in her expanding universe. For every track where Barbieri pushes her sound in new directions, there are others where she simply refines it. Tracks like “Closest Approach to Your Orbit” and “Pinnacles of You” deliver waves of euphoria-inducing synths similar to Patterns of Consciousness highlights like “Scratches in the Readable Surface.” But while Patterns’ sprawling journey was anchored by an emotional return-to-Earth moment in its profound final track, “Gravity That Binds,” the closing “Bow of Perception” avoids catharsis by design. Barbieri builds a spacious atmosphere before delivering a final fakeout: The track unexpectedly speeds into a dizzying new form and abruptly cuts out. If the thrill of her work has always been in its meticulously charted journeys and perfect landings, Ecstatic Computation ends with Barbieri shooting off the map completely, the transmission breaking apart like an out-of-range radio signal. The destination feels completely unknown from here, but rest assured, she knows where she’s going.","The Italian synthesizer composer explores new dimensions of her algorithmic, arpeggiated sound, playing with tempo, duration, and pacing to toy with listeners’ sense of perception.

STFU II EP,Dâm-Funk,by: Jonah Bromwich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5cdedcb0f2bde6c939aad21a/1:1/w_160/DaMFunK_STFUII.jpg,2019-05-23 05:00:00,Pop/R&B,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/dam-funk-stfu-ii-ep/,Glydezone,"The neon music that soundtracked the late-aughts Los Angeles club scene has become a global force. But while luminaries like Flying Lotus and Thundercat are recognized for influencing rap and jazz, the maestro of the Funkmosphere party in Culver City, Damon Riddick, gets less credit for bringing the synthesized sounds of the late ’70s and ’80s back to popular music. Years before Daft Punk made “Moroder,” Dâm-Funk was spinning tributes to the Troutman family, helping to make Afrofuturism the future once again. Toeachizown, Dâm-Funk’s five-LP opus, is now a decade old; it’s been four years since the triple album Invite the Light. Riddick has pivoted from prolificacy to restraint, appropriate for a musician in the latter half of his 40s. These days, he often speaks through others, working with fellow Angelenos like Nite Jewel or arranging tasteful setlists like that of his strong DJ-Kicks entry. Even his new record, STFU II, 38 minutes of new music, gets modest billing: It’s an EP, not an LP, and a sequel to boot. And it’s a modest release, as Dâm eases into cruise-control over the course of six five-minute-plus tracks (and one 54-second interlude called “Inhale, Exhale”). Moreso than the free EP STFU, STFU II picks up where DJ-Kicks left off: Its pleasures, are in steady, buoyant build; peace and love through body-rock. Nothing is too frantic or heavy, and when the bass appears, it’s as soothing as it is booming. The first standout is the second single, “Compos Mentis,” and like all the best tracks on the EP, it’s elevated by a synth odyssey that overtakes a repetitious beat. About three minutes in, Dâm extends a stepladder of bass leading up to a land of dreamy pastel synths and fluttering keys, a Balearic overworld in the clouds. If that sounds good, you may also enjoy “Deeper,” on which Dâm throws together a loop worthy of Floating Points or the Field, then overtakes it with an extraordinary extended synthesizer solo, rising slowly in the mix until everything else is background. Other tracks, though no less pleasant, disappear without leaving much of an impression. Closer “On Code” is the most traditional, G-funk brightened by sun-ray synths. A light-stepping bass shuffles through the opening half of “Ladera Heights,” named for the airport-adjacent neighborhood where Dâm-Funk moved once he started playing parties internationally. Soon enough, though, a well-behaved synth moves the proceedings skyward. Artists’ promotional statements are often misleading, when not pure gibberish, but Dâm’s advice about how to experience STFU II offers as much insight into the record as anything else: “Just lay back, take a deep breath, stay outta trouble and simply ‘glyde’ for a while,” he writes, referring to his label, Glydezone. STFU II is music for relaxation. It’s a long way from the fierce energetic groove that characterized those Funkmosphere nights on Venice Boulevard. You might find that a bit dispiriting, and while you wouldn’t be wrong, you’d be missing the point. We should all hope to age this well.","Picking up where his DJ-Kicks mix left off, the L.A. funk auteur’s newest release explores peace and love through body-rock.

Thanks for the Dance,Leonard Cohen,by: Ben Hewitt,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5d84c50b0480b10008ffa01d/1:1/w_160/LeonardCohen2019_TFTD_5x5_hi-res.jpg,2019-11-21 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/leonard-cohen-thanks-for-the-dance/,Legacy,"Leonard Cohen could always wrangle a good song from a grim situation. Just one example: In 1966, he and a lover stayed in a squalid room at New York’s Penn Terminal Hotel. Everything was broken—the windows, the radiators, the taps, their relationship—but the miserable experience at least yielded “Hey, That’s No Way To Say Goodbye.” Yet not even someone with Cohen’s wry humor would have guessed that, 50 years later, far bleaker circumstances would spur him into saying the most perfect goodbye imaginable. He was living with cancer when working on 2016’s You Want It Darker, and the shadow of mortality made his 14th studio album resemble a last testament. 19 days later, he fell in his home and passed away, aged 82. Few records have sounded so heavy with finality. So it’s initially hard to know what remains to be said on Thanks For The Dance, a collection of bare-bones ideas and vocals lovingly fleshed out into finished tracks by Cohen’s son, Adam, with contributions from admirers including Beck, Feist, and The National’s Bryce Dessner. That’s not to say Cohen’s powers had waned: the elegant reckoning of the opening “Happens to the Heart” finds him still trying to untie the messy knot of sex, love, spirituality, and death with winking self-deprecation, saucy innuendo and rich religious symbolism, before finishing with a disquieting image that lingers like gun smoke: “I was handy with a rifle/ My father’s 0.303/ I fought for something final/ Not the right to disagree.” The fact that his crumbs would be most people’s banquets, though, can’t turn all the sketches into compelling songs. This project was teased with a somber, reworked version of Cohen’s 1998 poem “The Goal” which suggested that, like … Darker, it would be dominated by his awareness of the dying light around him. “Settling at last/Accounts of the soul,” he sighs, finally putting his many affairs in order. In truth, while the other stories here are also full of old ghosts and reflections, they rarely play out as explicit confrontations with Cohen’s fate. Instead, the lead song’s soft, tinkling-glass piano and gentle acoustic guitar are more indicative of the supporting players’ penchant for classy restraint: they employ the light hands of musicians at an intimate soiree, allowing the guest of honor’s ravaged growl to hold court. At times it works brilliantly, not least on “The Goal” itself, which is spun with the delicacy of a spiderweb. On other occasions there’s a sense of drift, a tendency for pristine arrangements to tip-toe around Cohen’s words as if fearful of intruding: although the mournful mandolin of “Moving On” makes for a pretty backdrop, it’s not the only track that’s essentially a poem recited over decorous orchestration. And while Cohen’s favorite flourishes are everywhere—the sweet, sad lilt of Javier Mas’s Spanish laud on the title cut, the Jew’s harp Beck plays on the moonlit rumble of “The Night Of Santiago”—they don’t always cut through or drive the compositions. The reverence is understandable, but you’re left wondering if it stymied bolder invention. Some of Cohen’s greatest triumphs were risks, the result of him pairing his ever-sootier voice with different sounds: the cheap Casio keyboards that sparked his ‘80s renaissance, the haunting strings and choirs of the Adam-helmed … Darker. Unsurprisingly, the best efforts here get closer to a similar alchemy. A mist of eerie piano and ghostly synths fogs “It’s Torn,” creating a quietly menacing score for Cohen’s vision of an unraveling world where the center cannot hold: “The opposites falter/The spirals reverse.” The jaded soul-searching of “The Hills,” meanwhile, is leavened with dry wit and the stately hum of horns and organ, as a pill-popping Cohen tries to make peace with the fact that his slog inside the Tower of Song is nearly at an end. “I know she is coming,” he insists, as his backing singers arrive to soothe his tired croak. When everything clicks with that kind of harmony, the album becomes more than just a graceful, inessential postscript. Most startling is “Puppets,” which starts with the horrors of the Holocaust and grows into a black reflection on human nature, helplessness and inescapable cycles of violence. Rather than raging, the music is a heavenly balm—bells chime, angelic voices sing, ethereal electronics thrum with strange celestial wonder—and the effect is like seeing a Hieronymus Bosch hellscape on a stained-glass window. If Thanks For The Dance can’t one-up … Darker’s grand farewell, moments like that at least make it a worthwhile addition to his legacy.","After the grand farewell of 2016's You Want It Darker, Cohen's son gathers his father's scraps and unfinished ideas and lovingly fleshes them out with help from collaborators like Beck, The National's Bryce Dessner and Feist.

2042,Kele,by: Peyton Thomas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dcb2eca2c290700080ad09f/1:1/w_160/kele.jpg,2019-11-21 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kele-2042/,KOLA,"My favorite song Kele Okereke has ever written—hell, one of my favorite songs ever written, period—is Bloc Party’s “I Still Remember.” The swooning electric guitars rendered the private, quiet pain of gay adolescent yearning on the scale of a fists-in-the-air epic, tracing every incandescent high and bitter low. The song was a bold move in 2007, when the indie rock scene was even more homogeneous than it is now, and it endures over a decade later, having been embraced by new generations of young queer people. As with so many other songs in Okereke’s catalogue, “I Still Remember” proves his gift for subtle, powerful songwriting about subjects as personal as they are political. But the clunky conceptual scaffolding of 2042 often obscures this gift from view. Like slowthai’s Nothing Great About Britain, 2042 announces itself as a blazing indictment of institutional racism in the United Kingdom. slowthai’s record succeeded largely on the strength of his storytelling, which gave listeners intimate, ground-level glimpses of life under white supremacy. Okereke reaches instead, too often, for stock characters and statistics, painting a vivid picture of racist oppression while neglecting to flesh out the people who live under that oppression. On “St Kaepernick Wept,” for instance, Okereke relates the story of a man shot to death by police while his children watched, and then concludes with the blunt clunker of a lyric, “He was just another hand-out for welfare/Headed to the prison-industrial complex.” It’s a strange compulsion that recurs throughout the record, Okereke gesturing broadly at sociological concepts while flinching away from smaller human stories. His stated goal, granted, is nothing less than sweeping, structural change—“Let England burn,” he sings, “so we can start again”—but the broad strokes of his lyrical approach often divest his subjects of distinctions. The stronger moments of 2042 are undercut, too, by jarring sequencing. In the record’s first half, listeners are rushed from earnest hagiography (“St Kaepernick”) to satire (“Guava Rubicon”) to “My Business,” a rap song with all the edge of the antagonist’s big moment in a Disney Channel musical. Past the halfway point, the record is a smoother listen—more sonically cohesive, more given to the kinds of sweet, subtle love songs that Okereke perfected on his last solo outing, Fatherland. “Natural Hair” is particularly lovely, a lilting flirtation between two black boys, as is “Back Burner,” which traces a love story that feels lived-in, tested by conflict and strengthened by years of togetherness: “No, I don’t fuck with The Smiths, but to The Cure I can get down.” There’s a speed-bump in this back half, though, which is particularly emblematic of the problems that plague this album. After the sleek, sexy slow burn of “Catching Feelings,” Okereke inserts “A Day of National Shame (Interlude),” an excerpt of British Member of Parliament David Lammy’s blistering indictment of the wrongful deportation of legal Caribbean immigrants. He backs Lammy’s speech with an echoing guitar track, calm and spacey and deeply tonally inappropriate. He follows it with “Ocean View,” a featherlight waltz without any real connection to the ideas Lammy advanced. It’s hard to say whether 2042 would be a more compelling record with more appropriate sequencing, or if this sprawling sixteen-track album would have made, perhaps, for a better set of separate EPs. What’s all too clear, unfortunately, is that 2042 stumbles precisely where Okereke has proven himself so capable of soaring.","The former Bloc Party frontman attempts a blazing indictment of institutional racism on his latest solo effort, but too often reaches for stock characters and sloganeering.

More Brilliant Is the Hand that Throws the Coin,Margaux,by: Sophie Kemp ,Contributor ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd2b69f81418c0009878d05/1:1/w_160/morebrilliant.jpg,2019-11-21 06:00:00,Folk/Country,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/margaux-more-brilliant-is-the-hand-that-throws-the-coin/,Massif,"More Brilliant is the Hand That Throws the Coin, the debut EP from the NYC-based 20-year-old Margaux Bouchegnies, is uncannily wise and self-assured for someone her age. “I want to see myself malfunctioning/I want to see myself skip in place,” she sings on “Hot Faced,” over a knotty and beautiful string arrangement, sounding a million miles from the moment of shame she sings about. Hearing a line like that makes you think about what it would feel like to watch yourself fuck up from space. Bouchegnies’ music lies two steps away from a lot of familiar indie rock: Her voice recalls Julia Jacklin, and her arrangements might have been plucked from a Fleet Foxes record. But the music she makes from these reference points proves difficult to pin down. A song like “Palm” feels sympatico with jazz standards and Françoise Hardy tearjerkers if anything. “Day time seems as blue and heavy as the lake by home,” Bouchegnies sings, as guitars chirp like cartoon songbirds. When she sings about love, it sounds like she is doing so from the inside of a snowglobe and is asking you to crack the glass with a teaspoon. Her songs often deal with the sort of first love that feels devastating in its purity—the kind that leaves you crying on the couch not because anything bad happened but because one day the joy will dissipate. It is a profoundly early-twentysomething experience, and Bouchegnies writes about it without cliché. “Please keep reading your book out loud/I like to hear your voice/I like to see your mouth,” she sings on “Faced With Fire.” Her voice quivers as she considers “time’s relentless melt,” and behind her an upright bass lurches like a rocking chair on an uneven porch. “Cave In,” is the EP’s most spectacular moment, shifting from low, nervous verses into a thicker, darker chorus, strings and fuzzed-out bass thudding into each other. The arrangement keeps building, each new sound adding to the track’s chattering momentum and amplifying the force of the chorus. The song feels like a first kiss, like drinking a beer at a party too fast because you’re anxious. But “Cave In” is not about collapsing under pressure and feeling small, like the song’s title suggests. It’s a declaration of power. “Lay down/This your final offer,” repeats Bouchegnies in the song’s chorus. More Brilliant is the Hand That Throws the Coin is just that: a statement of serious self possession, a record of huge songs written by a young person with an unnerving degree of precision and command.","The self-assured debut EP from the 20-year-old singer-songwriter deals with those pure and devastating first loves.

Black Space Tapes,Jamael Dean,by: Andy Beta,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd2c2dc0e83ce0008cbb6fe/1:1/w_160/blackspacetapes.jpg,2019-11-21 06:00:00,Jazz,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/jamael-dean-black-space-tapes/,Stones Throw,"To the chagrin of purists, in the late 1960s jazz musicians began to turn an ear to pop radio and Motown chart-toppers, fusing those and similar styles into soul jazz. Drummer Donald Dean could be found on some of the best sessions, like Les McCann’s Invitation to Openness and Layers. Watching his grandfather play, Jamael Dean took cues for his own approach to the piano. “That’s what made me want to play jazz,” Dean recently told Bandcamp. “Watching him interact with his buddies—that was something I could see for myself.” Just 21 years old, the younger Dean already has quite the resume, backing Kamasi Washington on Heaven and Earth, gigging with fellow Angelenos Thundercat, Carlos Niño, and Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and now studying jazz performance at the New School. Black Space Tapes announces Dean’s arrival, and it is an impressive debut, revealing a wide-eyed view of jazz as broad as his grandfather’s. Allowing jazz to imbibe hip-hop, electronic, R&B, and ambient, Dean orients the century-old artform firmly toward the future. All these ingredients are there from the jump in the astonishing, amoebic “Akamara.” The song takes its title from Yoruba cosmology, a concept that Dean breaks down as “the spirit of nothing that expanded the universe into what it is now,” which the piece resembles in form and sound. Across 11 minutes, Dean confidently mingles spiritual jazz and primordial ooze, tension and release, darkness and light. Wordless ululations from vocalist Sharada Shashidhar, field recordings of birds, shamanic percussion from Niño, and looped brass create a vast amount of space at the start, which Dean’s piano whirls through and fills up. It sounds fidgety at first, but as the piece continues to unfurl, Dean nudges the band into uncharted realms, imparting energy during the calmer moments, then easing back as it grows in chaotic density. Throughout, he keeps a firm sense of control, even in those outer-space moments when his touch on the keys is at its airiest. A quarter of an hour later, “Akamara” returns in a decidedly mutated remix, exhibiting more of Dean’s skill set. As a modern jazz player, his talents extend beyond chops to the ability to chop a beat, and his remix proves him as cagey as Makaya McCraven and Karriem Riggins. Dean flits between dizzying upper-register piano loops and a muted horn, mixing it all with a muddy, low-end wobble; in the song’s back half he takes flight with one of the album’s sweeter solos. “Olokun” continues down the eclectic path, with Dean sussing out a head-nodding beat in ocean waves and seagulls, every warped element Silly-Puttying around like some sort of Flying Lotus soundscape. Despite Dean’s knack for conjuring weird ambient headspaces, the most contemplative moments of Black Space Tapes arise when they hew closest to the jazz tradition. “Adawa” simmers and assuredly builds, and Dean is at his lyrical best, his solo bringing to mind the restraint and mindfulness of icons like Ahmad Jamal and Andrew Hill. He structures the piece so that every instrument—from Atwood-Ferguson’s nimble five-string viola to Tim Angulo’s deep-pocket drums—can shine. That sense of balance is integral to his approach. It’s a short album—just six tracks, not even 38 minutes in all—but the brevity works in its favor. As far out as Dean and his group travel, they ultimately remain gracefully grounded.

Aja,Steely Dan,by: Amanda Petrusich,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dbafc8250487d0009bc3cca/1:1/w_160/steelydan_aja.jpg,2019-11-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/steely-dan-aja/,UMG,"For much of my youth and young adulthood, I listened to music for cheap emotional catharsis, and so I preferred songs that were feral, tenuous, unstudied, and impolite—anything that sounded as mixed-up and precarious as I usually felt. I equated wildness with authenticity, and wanted only to be reminded, again and again, that I wasn’t alone or unique in my feelings. This isn’t a particularly unusual way to commune with records, though it is, perhaps, the easiest way. I eventually came to understand that over-valuing anguish and ecstasy—conflating theatrics with feeling, and feeling with Art—was limiting and naïve. Things like pleasure, contentedness, a solid laugh—any good, ordinary moment—are just as evanescent, and certainly just as formidable (and important) to capture. Beginning in the early 1970s, Steely Dan—the duo of Walter Becker and Donald Fagen—made cerebral, clever, formally sophisticated music that resisted any autobiographical extrapolating. Even in the context of the era—the late 1960s had seen the development and rise of both jazz-fusion and prog-rock, two of the brainiest, chops-iest genres going—their work was shrouded in irony and a distancing intellect. There was no pretense of dissolution or even emotion. Listening to their records felt like running my hands along a slab of polished marble—there were no craggy bits to grab on to, no easy way to find purchase—and so for years, I believed that Steely Dan’s seeming aversion to sincerity meant that they were cold and dorky. Did they not just make inert, polished music for men with meticulously groomed facial hair? Then Aja—Steely Dan’s sixth album, from 1977—turned everything around for me: It’s a thoroughly convincing argument against my notion that aggressive or discordant music was inherently real and rebellious, whereas virtuosic or studied songs were always limp and bloodless. Aja is as bold as records get. It’s full of strange, unprecedented, disorienting moves. It is braver, more idiosyncratic, and more personal, in some ways, than any other record I own. Aja is as much a jazz record as a pop one, though in its best moments, it’s both and neither. Steely Dan were so expert at fusing genres it’s often hard to say what bit came from where, or exactly which tradition (fusion, R&B, soul, disco, classical) was being mined or reimagined. Because these songs were rendered so seamlessly, it’s easy to overlook how brazen they were. Aja is like driving down a treacherous, cliff-side road in the most luxurious car ever made: If you sink deep enough into that supple leather seat, it is possible to forget entirely about the twists and turns, the threat of looming destruction. It’s possible to forget about gravity entirely. Steely Dan is generally associated with Los Angeles, where they made most of their records, but Becker and Fagen are both New Yorkers (Becker was born in Queens; Fagen was born in suburban Passaic, New Jersey), and their sensibilities were plainly shaped by a kind of wry, East Coast cynicism. It manifests most palpably in Aja’s lyrics, which are funny, surreal, and, for the most part, narratively ambiguous. On a song like “Deacon Blues,” which they co-wrote, it’s impossible to deny the precision of their phrasing, and the unexpected depth of the song’s sentiment: Learn to work the saxophone
I play just what I feel
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long
And die behind the wheel
They got a name for the winners in the world
I want a name when I lose
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide
Call me Deacon Blues Becker later said the song was about the “mythic loserdom” of being a professional musician—how glorious it might look from the outside, how grueling it is in practice. “Deacon Blues” is a fantasy of art-making, spun by someone who has never had to do the work, and therefore requires a funny sort of narrative distance: Becker and Fagen were looking at their own lives from the perspective of someone who wants what they’ve got, but also someone who fundamentally misunderstands the costs. Aja produced three excellent singles (“Peg,” “Josie,” and “Deacon Blues”) and sold millions of copies, becoming the group’s most commercially successful release. But it was a perplexing bestseller. Steely Dan spent the 1970s getting progressively more esoteric: jazzier, groovier, weirder. Even now, mapping the album’s melodic and harmonic shifts is impossible to do with confidence. Its songs are sprawling and fussy, populated by oddball characters with inscrutable backstories, like “Josie,” from the song of the same name (“She’s the raw flame, the live wire/She prays like a Roman with her eyes on fire”) or “Peg,” an aspiring actress headed who-knows-where, who’s “done up in blueprint blue.” “Blueprint blue”! It’s the kind of simple, perfect description prose writers pinch themselves over. Outside of the studio, Becker and Fagen reveled in being a little rascally. They took long breaks from touring, and when they conceded to an interview, they often appeared self-satisfied, if not antagonistic. Their disdain for the record business occasionally bled into a disdain for their fans, itself a kind of merciless, punk-rock pose. When they did tour—like, say, in 1993, when, after a decade-long hiatus, they booked a few weeks of U.S. dates—they did not pretend to enjoy it. That year, when a reporter from The Los Angeles Times asked Becker how the tour was going, he said, “Well, not too good. It turns out that show business isn’t really in my blood anyway, and I’m looking forward to getting back to working on my car.” Because the production on Aja is so expert—whole stretches are perfect, impenetrable, like the first 31 seconds of “Black Cow,” when that creeping bass line cedes passage to guitar and electric piano, and the backing vocals pipe up for “You were high!”—it’s easy to ignore the sophistication of its architecture. Becker and Fagen used obscure chords (like the mu major, a major triad with an added 2 or 9) and custom-built their own equipment (for 1980’s Gaucho, they paid $150,000 to build a bespoke drum machine). What they were doing was so particular and new, it was often difficult for critics to even find a vocabulary to describe it. On the title track, the verse shifts and dissolves as Fagen croons, “I run to you.” His voice thins as he finishes the line, a little gasp of tenderness. The minute-long drum solo that closes “Aja,” performed by the virtuosic session man Steve Gadd, is dressed with horns and synthesizers, and makes a person briefly feel as if they are being transported to a different dimension. Steely Dan reveled in making technical choices that would have hobbled a less ambitious outfit. That they succeeded still feels like some kind of black magic. By 1977, it is possible that some corners of the culture had become desperate for music that was intellectually challenging but not exactly arduous to consume—something less predictable than Top 40, but not quite as hyperbolic or gnashing as punk. By the end of the 1960s, rock had been relentlessly and breathlessly defined as a frantic, bloody, all-consuming practice, for both performers and fans. Aja, though, doesn’t necessarily require any sort of deep emotional entanglement or vulnerability from its listeners. In that way, the record works as an unexpected balm, a break—a little bit of pleasure just for pleasure’s sake. In 1977, on the day Aja was released, Cameron Crowe interviewed Becker and Fagan for Rolling Stone. Predictably, they were bemused by his questions. Becker told Crowe that they spent most of their time writing, recording, and obsessively tinkering. “We overdubbed a lot of the overdubs over,” he said. By then, whenever Steely Dan decamped to the studio, they hired a cabal of professional musicians—more than 40 are listed in the credits to Aja—and ran the sessions themselves, with militaristic precision. Becker and Fagen seemed to savor the idea that Steely Dan might be mischaracterized, in print, as something as pedestrian and ordinary as a band. “You can get studio musicians to sound exactly like a rock and roll band,” Fagen said. It’s obvious what he meant. They’d pulled one over on us, again.","Today on Pitchfork, we are taking a critical look at Steely Dan—from their early classic rock staples to their latter-day studio sleaze—with new reviews of five of their most influential records.

Gaucho,Steely Dan,by: Alex Pappademas,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dbaf9bb240be10008ccef42/1:1/w_160/steelydan_gaucho.jpg,2019-11-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/steely-dan-gaucho/,UMG,"A man flees west, pursued by saxophones. That’s how Steely Dan’s Gaucho starts, with “Babylon Sisters,” a foreboding melody that creeps into the room like toxic fog, and a lyric about a guy in a car en route to a three-way. While the horn section keeps rupturing the mood the keyboards are trying to set, the narrator spins stick-with-me-baby fantasies of California leisure and hedonism for his female companion(s). There may be no more perfectly yacht-rock tercet in the Dan canon than, “We’ll jog with show folk on the sand/Drink kirschwasser from a shell/San Francisco show-and-tell.” But even the singer doesn’t believe the sales pitch. By the end of the verse he’s talking to himself, or maybe he has been all along. “It’s cheap but it’s not free,” he says. “And that love’s not a game for three/And I’m not what I used to be.” Meanwhile, Randy Brecker’s muted trumpet dances around him, mocking his pain the way only a muted trumpet can. Good times! Is it any wonder Gaucho—the seventh Steely Dan album, and the last one Donald Fagen and Walter Becker would make together until the year 2000—is the one even some hardcore Danimals find it tough to fully cozy up to? The almost pathologically overdetermined production is elegant, arid, a little forbidding, and every last tinkling chime sounds like it took 12 days to mix, because chances are it did. And underneath that compulsive craftsmanship, that marble-slick surface, there’s decay, disillusionment, a gnawing sadness. But that’s what’s great about Gaucho. It takes the animating artistic tension of Steely Dan—their need to make flawless-sounding records lionizing inveterately human fuckups—to its logical endpoint. It’s their most obviously L.A. record, so of course they made it in New York, after spending years out West making music so steeped in New York iconography it practically sweated hot-dog-cart water. And it’s also the most end-of-the-’70s record ever made, 38 minutes of immaculately conceived malaise-age bachelor-pad music by which to greet the cold dawn of the Reagan era. The characters in these songs have taken an era of self-expression and self-indulgence as far as they can. They’re free to do and be whatever and whoever they want, but all that severance of obligation has done is isolate them from other people. The only character who’s having any kind of communal fun is the coke dealer on “Glamour Profession,” who makes calls from a basketball star’s car phone and takes meetings over Mr. Chow dumplings with “Jive Miguel…from Bogotá.” Everyone else is lost out there in the haze, having mutually demeaning sex or reaching for human connection in angry, possessive, usually futile ways. “Gaucho” and “My Rival” are both about relationships into which some threatening/alluring interloper has driven a wedge; both “Hey Nineteen” and “Babylon Sisters” are about older guys who chase younger women and wind up feeling older than ever. Things fall apart, the center does not hold, there’s a gaucho in the living room and he won’t leave, and it’s getting hard to act like everything’s mellow. “The Cuervo Gold/The fine Colombian/Make tonight a wonderful thing,” sings the narrator of “Hey Nineteen,” and then he sings it again, as if that’ll make it true. The narrator of the bouncy, Michael McDonald-enhanced “Time Out of Mind” seems to be in a pretty good mood, but it’s only because he knows he’s going to go somewhere later and smoke heroin until L.A. morphs into Lhasa. Everyone’s alone, or together in a way that’s worse than being alone; every lyric is a one-sided dialogue. There’s a precisely calibrated mix of empathy and irony in the way the Dan observe these poor devils, these sinners in the grip of a checked-out God— Becker, perfectly, called it “a sneer and a tear.” This is, at points, a very funny record—particularly the title track, whose unfolding absurdity builds to the moment where the narrator, having caught his lover holding hands with a bodacious cowboy in a spangled leather poncho, cries out, “Would you care to explain?” in high dudgeon worthy of Frasier Crane. When Becker and Fagen started making this music, it was 1978, and they were coming off the platinum-selling Aja, the biggest hit they’d ever had. They briefly toyed with the idea of putting together a band and touring—a form of strenuous exercise they’d given up years earlier—but instead they went back to work on new music, and didn’t emerge from the studio until late 1980. One of the first tracks they finished was “The Second Arrangement,” a blithe kiss-off from an unapologetic Jaguar-driving lothario whose faithlessness is suddenly fashionable. You can find the song on YouTube in various states of completion—a piano demo with Fagen trying a shaky falsetto on the chorus, a polished instrumental, a bootlegged-sounding full-band version whose discoid thwack evokes a waterlogged “Get Lucky”—but you won’t find it on Gaucho. After an assistant engineer accidentally erased a large chunk of the master tape, Becker and Fagen tried for a while to recreate the track, then gave up on it entirely. It wasn’t the only good song they discarded during the sessions—even with all the king’s sidemen at their disposal, they couldn’t capture “The Bear” or the surreal colonialist fever-dream “Kulee Baba” either—but it might have been the best song on the album if it had survived. They replaced it with the merely-very-good “Third World Man,” a retooled track left over from the Aja sessions, featuring a downhearted soliloquy of a guitar solo by Larry Carlton, who was reportedly surprised to discover he’d played on Gaucho. Fagen later described the “Second Arrangement” debacle to Rolling Stone correspondent Robert Palmer as “one of the most serious emotional setbacks we’ve had in the studio.” There are less-auspicious ways to begin work on a record. But maybe Gaucho was destined to go awry no matter what. By shrinking themselves to a two-man unit (plus longtime producer Gary Katz and engineer Roger Nichols) and forsaking the road, Becker and Fagen had cut down on the entropy to which even moderately successful rock bands usually succumb, but during the course of the Gaucho sessions, they were dealing with a range of high-class problems, from a court battle with MCA Records (who’d just absorbed the Dan’s old label ABC, and believed the final album the band owed that label was now contractually theirs) to Becker’s burgeoning heroin addiction, which made him an inconstant contributor to the band’s creative process. He played some guitar and bass on three songs, but as the sessions wore on, he was busy going through hell. In January 1980, Becker’s girlfriend Karen Stanley, who Becker later said had struggled with depression, died of what may have been an intentional overdose in Becker’s apartment. Then, in April of that year, while walking on a New York street, Becker was hit by a taxi cab. He spent seven months in a cast with a fractured tibia and was effectively sidelined from the studio for most of the three laborious months it took to mix Gaucho. Mixing was Becker’s forte; Fagen was left to muddle through. During a visit to the studio in summer 1980, Palmer watched him sit with Katz and Nichols, “inhaling a cigarette in spasmodic gulps” while endlessly retooling the fade-out at the end of “Babylon Sisters,” eventually spending four hours fiddling with fifty seconds of music. Of the nearly 40 consummate studio pros whose work at the Gaucho sessions made the final cut, the player with the heaviest footprint belongs to “Wendel,” a Paleolithic 12-bit sampling unit designed and built by Nichols, deployed by Becker and Fagen to impose a drum-machine-like consistency on the work of live drummers like Steve Gadd and Rick Marotta. “In the ’80s,” Becker told Mojo years later, “hand-crafted, hand-played music was being overtaken by this increasingly mechanical, perfectionist machine music, and we were just trying to get there first. They had all these disco records that were just whack-whack, so perfect, the beat never fluctuated, and we didn’t see why we couldn’t have that too, except playing this incredibly complicated music…It seemed like a good idea.” Of course, the computerized micro-tweaking of live instrumentation is now as commonplace a part of pop-music production as reverb, but back then the option to program with real drum hits was tantamount to magic, especially for two guys who’d spent much of their professional lives being just a tiny bit disappointed by some of the finest session musicians on the planet. But Wendel was also a bit of a prickly collaborator. “[E]ven the most minute event,” the band wrote in the liner notes to a 2000 reissue of Gaucho, “had to be programmed in the gnarly and unforgiving 8085 Assembly Language, in which all relevant parameters needed to be described in its baffling hexagesimal-base numerical system, which ultimately became the only language Roger Nichols spoke or understood, at least for a time.” The Dan’s commitment to the path of most resistance paid off. “Hey Nineteen” cracked the Top 10, and the album went platinum. Even Wendel got a plaque. Then in 1981, Becker and Fagen took an 11-year break from working together as Steely Dan. It’s probably a coincidence that this album about breakups and estrangements and encroaching age and the corrosive effects of hard drugs on human fellowship immediately preceded the not-drug-unrelated suspension of a longstanding creative partnership between two guys who were just entering their 30s. But we’re talking about Steely Dan here, not Fleetwood Mac—if they ever wrote about themselves, they’d never be uncool enough to admit it. It’s probably better to think of this as a loose concept album about people with a higher-than-average chance of dying in an accident involving downers and a hot tub, but one whose content couldn’t help but mirror the struggles in its makers’ lives. It might not be the best of Steely Dan albums, but it’s definitely the most Steely Dan of the Steely Dan albums. Becker and Fagen are too smart not to know ideals like perfection and grace are for opium dreamers, but can’t help reaching for them anyway.","Today on Pitchfork, we are taking a critical look at Steely Dan—from their early classic rock staples to their latter-day studio sleaze—with new reviews of five of their most influential records.

The Royal Scam,Steely Dan,by: Winston Cook-Wilson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc5d95a3af4630009dbe6ae/1:1/w_160/royalscam.jpg,2019-11-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/steely-dan-the-royal-scam/,ABC,"For decades after their initial discovery in 1868, scholars dismissed the Paleolithic cave paintings of Altamira, located in the north of Spain, as forgeries. The use of cracks and shading to create perspective, and abstract images created out of ghostly impressions of handprints, all seemed too advanced to be the work of prehistoric Homo sapiens. But after similar designs were discovered at nearby sites in France and Cantabria, a French historian published an apologetic paper in 1902 affirming Altamira’s authenticity. In the first half of the century, cave painting blossomed into a major field of scientific study, and in 1976, the caves were fully legitimized, finally, when Steely Dan named the best song on The Royal Scam after them. The narrator begins by remembering a visit to the Spanish caverns as a child—how the animal figures on its walls and ceilings seemed to come to life when he held a candle up to them. He remembers that he “understood” something after leaving the caves—a latent meaning in the “sad design”—but what was it? “Before the fall/When they wrote it on the wall/When there wasn’t even any Hollywood,” the chorus begins, and the question lingers: Why does it matter that Hollywood, specifically, didn’t exist the Paleolithic era? “Sentient life in Los Angeles is a distinct rarity,” Walter Becker sneered to journalist Richard Cromelin in a 1976 interview for Sounds. As New York expats working in West Hollywood during an era that they felt out of step with—“Not much of a decade,” Becker said of the 1970s—nothing in the work or public comments of the increasingly reclusive studio team of Becker and Donald Fagen suggested they thought humankind had progressed much since the prehistoric days their protagonist had fantasized about. If anything, perhaps, we’d gone backwards. Answering fan questions for the BBC in 2000, Becker claimed “Altamira” was about the narrator’s “loss of innocence,” and the rest of The Royal Scam seems to dramatize that descent across a series of more modern case studies. The narrators on the album are the most dissolute bunch Fagen and Becker ever assembled: Kid Charlemagne the washed-up acid guru, the suicidal criminal in “Don’t Take Me Alive,” the kleptomaniac in “Green Earrings,” and the violent cuckold in “Everything You Did,” among others. Recorded somewhat reluctantly at ABC Studios, where the noise reduction system had fried the sound quality of Katy Lied in the previous year, The Royal Scam found Fagen and Becker using their burgeoning studio budget—and the continuing absence of other obligatory collaborators—to create knotty, darkly playful arrangements that animated their dismal fables. The result stands as the bleakest and most narratively vivid album of their career, as well as their most misunderstood. In interviews at the time, Fagen and Becker expressed their disenchantment with a perceived 1970s monoculture, as if working their hardest to nail in their reputation for being sneering curmudgeons. If today we view the decade as one of the most stylistically variegated time periods in popular music—one in which, after all, a band as weird and iconoclastic as Steely Dan could thrive commercially—Fagen and Becker still seemed to view the industry as one big, vapid dance party. “It’s a lot like the ’50s,” Fagen grumbled to Sounds. “The same music on the radio. I think the Four Seasons, when they started really slamming out this current string of hits, that was the capper.” Still, no matter how they might have felt about “December 1963 (Oh What a Night)” and its ilk, modern dance music still seeped into their arrangements. The sound of the rhythm sections on Scam, as much as anything, firmly places the music in 1976, and far away from the band’s roots in more conventional, upbeat radio-rock and harmonized guitar leads. Becker and Fagen consciously wanted “a more live, rhythmic sound” on the record, as Fagen described it to Melody Maker in 1976, and began recording songs with six or seven different rhythm sections. Ultimately, Fagen and Becker used veteran session drummer Bernard “Pretty” Purdie—the namesake of a very particular kind of shuffle beat, purveyor of chattering hi-hat patterns—on all but two tracks. Purdie was a key collaborator during the band’s career, going on to define the groove-based sound of 1977’s Aja and 1980’s Gaucho. On Scam, though, “The Fez” was the closest thing to an attempt at disco, and it seemed to be satirizing itself, incorporating an eerie, vaguely Eastern European synth lick, a short aberrant lyric—either an extended metaphor about the importance of condoms or an unambiguous statement of purpose from someone who insists on only having sex while wearing a Shriner’s hat—and moments of jokey complexity that threw the groove. All of this felt fairly remote from “Play That Funky Music,” to say the least. Although Scam was Steely Dan’s slickest album to date, it was also, in some ways, their ugliest. Its arrangements are a jungle of Rhodes stabs and the most aggressive—and finest—guitar work on a Steely Dan album since 1973’s Countdown to Ecstasy. On “Don’t Take Me Alive,” Larry Carlton seems to take up most of the space, snarling, feeding back, advancing the simmering tension at the song’s stakeout (in a 1979 radio interview, Gary Katz said they’d directed the guitarist to play as “nasty and loud as possible.”) In “Sign in Stranger,” Elliott Randall’s erratic guitar breaks jostle for space with Paul Griffin’s bluesy piano—hard-bop comping in double-time. Together, they seem to mimic the crooked vendors vying for customers in the song’s marketplace, which Fagen claimed to have modeled on the “Sin City/Pleasure Planet” trope from some of his favorite sci-fi stories. Techniques like these illustrate how Fagen and Becker pushed the music on Scam to feel as grotesque as their words—to be vignettes musically as well as lyrically. This tendency toward the theatrical is most apparent in the album’s queasy emulations of reggae and Carribean music. “I think Duke Ellington’s whole exotic jungle trip contributed a lot to our tropicality numbers,” Fagen told Melody Maker in 1976. “It’s an idealized, exotic atmosphere...Showtime, Ricky Riccardo stuff. More I Love Lucy than Bob Marley.” There is the rock-steady backbeat of “Sign in Stranger,” with a closing horn line that sounds like Cuban jazz pouring in from somewhere outside of the song. On the more extreme side is the white elephant in the room: “Haitian Divorce,” complete with an intermittent Jamaican accent and a talkbox-treated guitar that sounds like Charlie Brown’s teacher. Allegedly inspired by tracking engineer Elliot Scheiner’s attempt to finalize a divorce in a matter of a couple of months through a Central American loophole, it was a cinematic bit of storytelling, and Fagen and Becker framed it explicitly as such: “Now we dolly back/Now we fade to black.” It would be easy to write off as a misguided aberration if it didn’t rank among the record’s musically inspired moments: The song’s central modulation when the backing vocalists enter makes for one of the most satisfying chorus drops they ever recorded. It was also the band’s highest-charting single in the UK to date. The song is a microcosm of what makes The Royal Scam both singular and frustrating: a combination of sharp songwriting, a resourceful approach to narrative, piss-take musical references, and willfully poor taste. More than on any album they ever released, Fagen and Becker foregrounded their jarring stylistic pivots, tying them directly to their lyrical scenarios; Aja and Gaucho, on the other hand, would create a sleek musical surface that functioned just as well apart from the sordid narratives. The Royal Scam is the Dan album where the music doesn’t allow the listener to escape the mindset of its characters and their stories’ grim implications: real progress is rarely possible, and we are doomed to repeat our worst behaviors over and over again. Nowhere on The Royal Scam does this feel more apparent than on the title track and closer, a plodding epic about Puerto Rican immigrants in New York City. With little in the way of vocal melody, verbose phrasing inspired by the King James Bible, and a beat that never really seems to kick in, it sounds like a smooth-rock version of what it might have felt like to row a Viking warship. It is based around harsh melodic cells traded back and forth between Fagen’s Rhodes and Carlton’s guitar, with a few solo horn interjections. The motifs feel oddly mechanistic—a process that never gets anywhere. The corruption and abuse that crop up throughout the rest of the album descend on the undeserving populace. “The Caves of Altamira” may be about a loss of idealism, but we never see the fallout; here, Fagen and Becker shove our faces in the characters’ dashed dreams. In the album’s final moment, they perpetuate the scam they fell victim to like a game of telephone, crafting fabricated success stories for their relatives at home: “The old man back home/He reads the letter/How they are paid in gold/Just to babble in the back room/All night and waste their time.” By all indications, the cycle of hope, subjugation, and destruction will begin again.","Today on Pitchfork, we are taking a critical look at Steely Dan—from their early classic rock staples to their latter-day studio sleaze—with new reviews of five of their most influential records.

Katy Lied,Steely Dan,by: Mark Richardson,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dbafd8b892ad400095d26f4/1:1/w_160/katylied_steelydan.jpg,2019-11-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/steely-dan-katy-lied/,UMG,"The notes on the back cover of Katy Lied begin: “This is a high fidelity recording. Steely Dan uses a specially constructed 24-channel tape recorder, a ‘State-of-the-Art’ 36-input computerized mixdown console, and some very expensive German microphones.” The note continues with a laundry list of gear and settings, which are probably real but delivered with a smirk, and then concludes with, “For best results observe the R.I.A.A. curve.” I shudder to think how many people have listened to Katy Lied without observing the R.I.A.A. curve. But this is the kind of thing dudes in the 1970s did—list the gear used to create an album and then give suggestions to the listener about the equipment and settings they might use to realize it. The recording summary reminds me of those on another LP by an audio obsessive that came out in 1975—Lou Reed’s Metal Machine Music, which he may have written while on speed and which definitely makes very little sense. But when audiophile musicians put their music out into the world, they hate losing control of it. What if someone listens to their perfectly sculpted sonic creation on a crappy all-in-one portable turntable with a battered needle? And let’s not even get into what it sounds like on earbuds. The irony of the note on the back of Katy Lied, and possibly the inspiration for its inclusion, is that the album’s sound was, according to the band, deeply flawed. While Walter Becker and Donald Fagen were recording it with producer Gary Katz and engineer Roger Nichols, they employed a then-new technology called dbx, which expanded the dynamic range beyond the conventional limit of analog tape. The system worked by compressing the incoming signal and then expanding it on playback, with some filtering in there to reduce noise. It was more complicated than Dolby, boosting and then lowering a wider array of frequencies, and also, potentially, more effective. But something went very wrong. “It was better sounding than anything you’ve ever heard to this date,” Katz told Cameron Crowe a couple of years later in Rolling Stone. “Even Aja. Unbelievable. We went to mix it, and the tape sounded funny. We found out the dbx noise reduction system we were using was not functioning properly.” Panic set in and some steps had to be done over with the release date approaching rapidly but they salvaged the record, at least as far as the label and the audience were concerned. But Becker and Fagen could never listen to Katy Lied again. The well had been poisoned, and they heard flaws in what to almost everyone else sounded pristine. That’s too bad for them because Katy Lied is a very good album. It captures Steely Dan in the thick of it all, still hungry and energized by their early burst of creativity but not taking anything for granted. Before Katy Lied, Steely Dan were a rock band, but this is the record where they became something else. In 1974, following the shows to support their third album Pretzel Logic, Fagen and Becker decided that they didn’t enjoy touring, didn’t make much money from it, and would prefer to focus on making records. It was like the Beatles after Revolver, except that Steely Dan weren’t especially huge and their lives weren’t especially crazy. More than anything, the shift was an outgrowth of their studio obsession. With no upcoming gigs, they no longer needed a steady band, and Steely Dan became officially what it already kinda was—Becker and Fagen and whatever musicians they deemed good enough to complete their vision. Katy Lied lives at the midpoint of Steely Dan’s first act. Behind them were three records that were incrementally more sophisticated and less rock-centered. After this one were three increasingly finicky and obsessive albums that would find them reaching for a kind of perfection, albums that found them chronicling the decadence around them from the inside. Where they once wrote about the delightfully sleazy underbelly of life in America from a remove, they started to write more about what they saw around them. Katy Lied is the fulcrum in this progression—it’s messier, less sure of itself, besotted neither with youthful confidence nor veteran polish. After the departure of Jeff “Skunk” Baxter following the dissolution of their touring unit, guitars moved a half-step into the background. These are songs for piano, jazzier and lighter, and the keyboards are higher in the mix. Listening to it brings to mind nearly-empty cocktail bars after the people with something to live for have all gone home and cabaret shows in seedy theaters. Fagen sings with gusto but if it’s possible for sweat to make a sound, then you could say he sounds a little sweaty. Almost all the drums were played precocious by a 20-year-old genius named Jeff Porcaro, who would become one of the world’s most in-demand session players, and there are many distinctive background vocals from Michael McDonald, who would become one of yacht rock’s most in-demand session singers. The songs Becker and Fagen came up with are the usual mix of the funny, cynical, and cryptic, but here and there are moments of what seems to be actual sweetness. The brilliance of their songwriting is that they always aimed for complexity and never allowed themselves to be pinned down. Everything was up for negotiation, even when the lyrics were studded with clear meaning. “Black Friday” is a brilliant depiction of chaos, describing what it would be like to make your way out of town and cash your checks when the apocalypse hits. Fagen makes evil sound appealing, suggesting that it might be the only sane response to living in an insane world, but listen with the other ear and you hear the satire and even a kind of yearning from someone who might actually wish for a better world. Meanwhile, Becker plays the best guitar solo on the album, capturing the ragged edge of the moment. Steely Dan made songs about the destructive force of male vanity that came from two people you knew were speaking from personal experience. They never hold themselves above their characters, but they don’t let them off the hook, either. On “Bad Sneakers,” we see a man bopping around the street near Radio City Music Hall like he owns the place. We feel what he feels but also see how ridiculous he looks, while McDonald’s background vocals suggest grace in his awkwardness, celebrating the energy that powers him even though his actions are laughable. “Rose Darling” is the third track in a row to mention money specifically, but on a more casual listen it sounds something like a pure love song. And then two cuts later, the A-side closes with “Dr. Wu.” Lodged in the middle of the album that came in the middle of the decade and in the middle of Steely Dan’s decade-long, seven-album run is one of their very best songs, a weary and funny and specific and mysterious ode to longing and loss. “Dr. Wu” gave the album its title (“Katie lies/You can see it in her eyes”) and crystalizes its essential mood. One moment it’s about drugs, the next it’s about a love triangle, and then you’re not sure what’s next or even what’s real, and weaving through it all is the saxophone solo from Phil Woods, connecting dots between musical worlds both corny and elegant, from Billy Joel to Billy Strayhorn. The characters flailing clumsily throughout Katy Lied are paralyzed by desires they aren’t introspective enough to understand, so all they can do is keep stumbling forward. “I got this thing inside me,” Fagen sings in a bridge on the late album highlight “Any World (That I’m Welcome To)”, “I only know I must obey/This feeling I can't explain away.” Sometimes obeying those desires lead people to something ugly and inexcusable, as on “Everyone’s Gone to the Movies,” a song about a guy who is almost certainly grooming kids for abuse. It’s a Todd Solondz film rendered in sound, and Fagen only shows us the lead-up, forcing us to assemble the pieces in our heads as he hides the crime behind the album’s cheeriest arrangement. This collision between word and sound—in which the precise moral takeaway and is obscured even as the music makes it go down easy—made the band hard to trust. “The words, while frequently not easy to get the definite drift of, are almost always intriguing and often witty,” John Mendelsohn wrote in a review of Katy Lied in Rolling Stone. But a few paragraphs later he concluded: “Steely Dan’s music continues to strike me essentially as exemplarily well-crafted and uncommonly intelligent schlock.” It sounds harsh but Mendelsohn captured how a lot of people think about Steely Dan, then and now. This band was always about asking questions instead of giving answers, and Katy Lied came out in a particular moment of uncertainty and confusion. The fact that Becker and Fagen themselves couldn’t bear to hear their own creation only deepens the mystery. They wanted desperately to render their tragically amusing scenes just so, and the sonic purity they’d been chasing would soon be theirs. But here they give failure a kind of twisted majesty.","Today on Pitchfork, we are taking a critical look at Steely Dan—from their early classic rock staples to their latter-day studio sleaze—with new reviews of five of their most influential records.

Can’t Buy a Thrill,Steely Dan,by: Sasha Geffen,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc5d7873af4630009dbe6ab/1:1/w_160/can'tbuy.jpg,2019-11-20 06:00:00,Rock,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/steely-dan-cant-buy-a-thrill/,ABC,"In December 1972, one month after releasing their debut album Can’t Buy a Thrill, Steely Dan got eviscerated in the pages of The Los Angeles Times for looking like a bunch of car mechanics who had somehow wandered onto the stage at Whisky a Go Go. “Live rock’n’roll is supposed to be a show, and how long can one look at a pair of denim overalls without becoming utterly bored or downright repulsed?” wrote critic Richard Cromelin. He offered a modicum of praise for the band’s “moderately energetic” stage presence, and then immediately tempered it: “If only they can find some time to go shopping.” David Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust persona had made his debut that same year. Lou Reed issued Transformer, a glam rock album with a heavily made-up portrait of him on the cover, in November. Iggy Pop, the New York Dolls, and Alice Cooper were all busy injecting danger and androgyny into American rock, which at the beginning of the ’70s was still finding its feet after the totality of the British invasion. And there were Donald Fagen and Walter Becker, professional songwriters turned curmudgeonly bandleaders, playing jazz-rock with a group of like-minded nerds, wearing overalls and oozing contempt for their glitter-spangled peers. A dark cynicism hardened around Becker and Fagen during their stints as songwriters-for-hire in Brooklyn and Los Angeles in the late ’60s and early ’70s. Both musicians were born on the East Coast—Fagen in Jersey, Becker in Queens—and carried an Atlantic saltiness with them to the streets of California. They had met as undergrads at Bard College, bonding fast over a shared love of jazz and Frank Zappa. Few other white kids in their orbit attached as fiercely to black music at the time: “I thought I was the only person in the world who was into this little secret about jazz,” Fagen said in a 1974 interview. He found Becker, his musical soulmate, and the pair began writing songs together on the upright piano in the lobby of their dorm. After graduating, Fagen and Becker shopped their demos around various record labels, most of which laughed them out of their offices. Producer Gary Katz landed them a job as staff songwriters at the L.A. label ABC Dunhill, known for putting out records by North American rock bands like Steppenwolf and Three Dog Night. The work was steady but boring, and Katz soon encouraged the two musicians to form their own band. Fueled more by a distaste for the early ’70s rock milieu than anything, Becker and Fagen ganged up as Steely Dan, a band named for a rubber strap-on in William S. Burroughs’ surrealist novel Naked Lunch. They must have had some idea of what they were about to become. “The newly formed amalgam [of Steely Dan] threatens to undermine the foundations of the rock power elite,” Fagen wrote under the pseudonym Tristan Fabriani in the liner notes to the band’s 1972 debut, Can’t Buy a Thrill (they got the title from Bob Dylan, one of the few contemporaneous American musicians they could stand). “Amalgam” is right; rather than adhere to a standard rock formula, Steely Dan overloaded their sessions with players who could do Latin jazz or hot electric solos. They were a band who wanted more of everything: more guitarists, more drummers, more singers, spiraling out in a fever dream of excess. Fagen and Becker were the only writers in the room, but the credits for Thrill number a dozen musicians on instruments as far-flung as electric sitar and flugelhorn. Having escaped the sterile confines of commercial pop songwriting, Steely Dan were hell-bent on making a mess. On paper, Thrill sounds as thorny as Italian prog, the product of a bunch of noodlers fiercely guarding their niche. But the record’s core hums with Fagen and Becker’s meticulous admiration for everything that makes pop tick. Bitter-mouthed contrarians in interviews, they wrote songs every bit as charming and delectable to the ear as the peers they claimed to despise. The members of Steely Dan appeared to take themselves as seriously as long-suffering jazz purists in a world drunk on three-chord ditties, and then they shot up the pop charts with sunny, flippant ear candy-like “Reelin’ in the Years.” As badly as they felt the need to differentiate themselves from mainstream rock’n’roll, it was always a part of Steely Dan. They claimed the Rolling Stones, the Beatles, and Dylan as influences before doing so became an outrageous cliché. Echoes of Zombies’ psychedelia and Beach Boys’ sunshine also waft through Thrill. Fagen and Becker stockpiled their debut with hooks aimed straight at your dopamine receptors, with vocal harmonies and gleaming guitar lines braided tight. The weird was there, embryonic, waiting to unfurl on later, more adventurous albums. But it curled itself up in service of pleasure. Take “Dirty Work,” basically an Eagles song, or the “na-na-nas” of the post-hippie strutter “Change of the Guard”: No matter how detached they felt from it, Steely Dan put out pop music. They tried to make a ruckus and ended up polishing gems for broad consumption. “We’re a strange band y’know. The music is all WRONG,” Fagen told Melody Maker in 1974. “Our songwriting process is not unlike the creation of junk sculpture.” If they identified with the gritty combines of mid-century artist Robert Rauschenberg, the songs they turned out were more like the sardonic baubles of Jeff Koons: fun, often hilarious, easy on the senses, and full of an unwavering disregard for the concept of authenticity. Decades into their career, Fagen and Becker would claim the early hits as Trojan horses for complex musical ideas. “It was better to have our songs pass as pop songs and then have whatever else we wanted in them afterwards,” Becker said in 1995, as if the shimmering surface of Thrill were merely an excuse to smuggle their real musical passions into the mainstream. But the cresting harmonies and the guitar solos on “Reelin’” don’t sound like a front. They sound like a blast, like a group of young and insecure jazz dweebs egging each other on until they’ve made something so absurd even they can’t deny its allure. Steely Dan crouched behind irony for much of their early career, and their popular legacy remains steeped in it. The hits from Thrill, “Do It Again” and “Reelin’ in the Years,” blare out from classic rock stations right next to Black Sabbath, Yes, and all the other peers they shit-talked at the time. Their flair for melodrama, humor, and quick compositional turns got sucked right up into the most vapid (and delightful) of late ’70s hair metal hits, like Journey’s “Wheel in the Sky” and Styx’s “Renegade.” They were so skeptical of rock music they ended up gilding it, breaking it down, and piecing it back together strangely enough for it to approach perfection.","Today on Pitchfork, we are taking a critical look at Steely Dan—from their early classic rock staples to their latter-day studio sleaze—with new reviews of five of their most influential records.

Iowa Dream,Arthur Russell,by: Jenn Pelly,Contributing Editor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dc9d6f40e83ce0008cbb415/1:1/w_160/iowa.jpg,2019-11-19 06:00:00,Experimental,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/arthur-russell-iowa-dream/,Audika,"Arthur Russell came from the cornfields of Oskaloosa, Iowa, a quiet kid who checked out library books on minimalism and psychedelics before running away to a San Francisco commune with his cello and his curiosity. In New York City during the 1970s and ’80s, Russell became a kaleidoscope of Downtown: a prism through which to see almost every fascinating corner of music there illuminated anew. His shyness became a strength, the source of his exquisite introspection, as he created serene music—lovelorn folk-pop, post-disco, classical, power pop—in accordance with his Buddhist logic, borderless. Russell was a dance-music innovator who sang of “losing my taste for the nightlife.” He used his cello to create a wall-of-sound equally ecstatic and depressive; those who knew him said he quoted ABBA lyrics like romantic poetry. He was Allen Ginsberg’s accompanist; he is believed, by biographer Tim Lawrence, to have played the spiritual music of Alice Coltrane in her touring band. Russell suggested punk could be art and pop could be minimalism. He foresaw the contemporary notion that we need not subscribe to the tyrannies of genre. Through it all, Russell has become a talismanic shorthand for a superpower across time: His name means a way to persevere in accordance with a misfit’s heart and a boundless mind. “Being sad is not a crime,” Russell sang on “Love Comes Back.” His life makes it believable. Iowa Dream is the latest posthumous Russell release, and it feels in some ways like one of the truest. Unlike the understated beats and pop deconstructions of Calling Out of Context, or the plainspoken country-pop of Love Is Overtaking Me, the 19 tracks of Iowa Dream are presented as demos. But like those warm records, Iowa Dream finds Russell in his singularly comforting singer-songwriter mode: a collection of teardrop piano ballads, sunstruck acoustic songs, and delightfully bewildering studio excursions. As ever, it’s Russell’s voice—clear, graceful, often conversational, with a kind of humility—that makes his music feel like a potential source of enlightenment, no matter the style. He sounds like someone you might know, a friend speaking to you, which is perhaps why so many listeners seem to think they do, sure their personal Russell connection is special. Russell’s vocal turns on “Follow You” are almost painfully gorgeous, as if embodying the “place in the sun [...] a sailboat on the sea” he sings of. In a recent memoir of their brief affair, the late poet Kevin Killian said Russell’s lyrics were “written right on the very edge of English,” which resonates through Iowa Dream’s quotidian images: riding bikes, driving cars, laying in the grass. Russell’s words here are mostly cut from the same untreated cloth as classics like “Nobody Wants a Lonely Heart” and “This Time Dad You’re Wrong”—testifying to Russell’s belief that everyday English could be elevated in pop. Songs like “Just Regular People” and “I Felt” seem pulled from a childhood diary, reflecting on his parents’ normalcy and feeling “empty” at school. On the moving “I Wish I Had a Brother” he reflects on a fantasy of basketball games on the playground. Four Iowa Dream songs are from a doomed 1974 session with famed Columbia producer John Hammond, who once said, “When they write my legacy, they’re going to say ‘John Hammond discovered Billie Holiday, Charlie Christian, George Benson, and then Dylan, Springsteen, and Arthur Russell.’” The stark tearjerker “In Love With You for the Last Time” is anguished but calmly resigned, an almost cheekily despondent rock-bottom: “When I start to think, that’s when I start to sink [...] Now you’ve rejected me for the last time/It’s the last time I’ll sit on this fence for you.” Hammond wanted another lone-genius record, but Russell employed a collaborative exchange in his music: Iowa Dream variously features Rhys Chatham on flute and Henry Flynt on violin. The off-kilter dazzle of “Wonder Boy”—“vibes” are credited to Dave Van Tieghem, a future collaborator on Robert Ashley’s avant opera Perfect Lives—is a stunning statement of self. It captures Russell’s inquisitiveness and self-defeat, hope and melancholy, in such an unassuming manner you could nearly miss it: “I’m a wonder boy/I can’t do nothing/The poster was nailed to a tree/And somebody tore it down/Bits of paper nailed to a tree/That’s all I found.” “Wonder Boy” recalls Ginsberg’s description of Russell as Williams Carlos Williams as a singer—poetic and humble at the same time, as Russell’s music so often is. Many of these songs contain Russell’s wry humor: “I never get lonesome/Especially in the night when you are gone,” he insists through the lightly rollicking “I Never Get Lonesome.” Iowa Dream includes the edges of Russell’s edges, some of his most delightfully odd experiments—like the psych-rock jammer of a title track or “Barefoot in New York,” a Ginsbergian ensemble beat-rap with brilliant full sentences like, “The question is whether or not this kind of music is going to hypnotize you” and “I’ve always disliked the Rolling Stones since I found out what they were up to.” It’s part music-critical essay, part bohemian cartoon. Perhaps this all is what lead the record exec Michael Ostin to once write, on a comment slip now included with Russell’s archives at the New York Public Library: “Who knows what this guy is up to.” The influence of Buddhism abounds in Russell’s music, but especially on the songs culled from early California tapes, like the luminous “Sharp Eyes” and “Come to Life.” The intimate melody of “Words of Love” channels the emotional candor of Joni Mitchell, but with disarmingly beautiful lines of queer yearning: “Soft as a cherry, round as a peach/Into your pocket my slow hands can reach/To see what you carry up close to your thighs/Reaching and looking right into your eyes.” Russell’s friend and collaborator Steven Hall once said that his and Russell’s radical position as queer artists in the Downtown scene meant that “[p]resenting our lifestyle in our work was our political activity.” “Words of Love” is a glimmer of that fact, a sweet prayer for the power of language when speech must be enough. In March 1977, Russell laid out some of his personal pop-music philosophies to Soho Weekly News. It was the dawn of punk, but the 25-year-old Russell was describing how he came to see pop as profound, not merely the sound of jocks and commoners in high school. “In bubblegum music, the notion of pure sound is not a philosophy but rather a reality,” Russell said. “In this respect, bubblegum preceded the avant-garde.” He was erasing hierarchies; he saw music and life as inextricable. “If you misuse your capacities as a musician, you’re misusing your capacities as a human being,” Russell explained, “and you’re taking humanity in the wrong direction.” Each new Russell release makes an effort towards the opposite, as his work did, towards more humanity. One of many Iowa Dream highlights, “You Did It Yourself” was featured in Matt Wolf’s 2008 documentary about Russell, Wild Combination. Russell is seen playing the song in grainy live footage with an acoustic guitar, though here, the song has a lusher, deeper production. In “You Did It Yourself,” Russell seems to be experiencing yet another moment of endearing self-sabotage (“You did it yourself/It keeps you down”) and also reflecting on a “thrilling” film he saw “last night”: “Understood all of it very well/I didn’t like the ending though/Maybe I’m crazy but it just seemed tacked on.” The pieces of his sung critique stream by like a river. Russell was prone to the unresolvable, to the nonlinear, to atmosphere over concrete. The miracle of his catalog is how the seams mend together, stitch by stitch, a different way forward, as if creating no “endings” for himself. Many of Iowa Dream’s tunes instantly find a place in the pantheon of Russell’s best work, though perhaps it’s more fitting to say they create oxygen in his ever-expanding world.","The latest posthumous album from the groundbreaking artist feels like one of his truest, 19 “demos” that reveal his elegant songwriting, his disregard for genre, and his boundless mind.

ATØ,Ziúr,by: Ruth Saxelby,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dd2ce3681418c0009878d42/1:1/w_160/ato_ziur.jpg,2019-11-19 06:00:00,Electronic,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/ziur-ato/,Planet MuObjects Limited,"For several days, I have woken up with Ziúr’s voice in my head: “Now that I’m invisible/I’ll come for you harder.” The Berlin electronic artist delivers the line through a pitched-up cyborg smile on “I Vanish,” from her new album ATØ, extending the syllables the way a child might: in-vis-sib-ble. The approach is deliberate, a way to underline the underestimation—the erasure, even—to which the song’s protagonist has been subjected. The brushed-cotton tones of the lead melody echo the careful placement of Ziúr’s words, paving the way for an extremely effective earworm. It’s by no means the only one on ATØ. For slow jam “All Lessons Unlearned,” Ziúr teams up with pop veteran Samantha Urbani, who vocally figure skates through an icy landscape of marimba and what sounds like a murmuring chorus of awed infants. “Don’t let go/I won’t do,” urges Urbani over and over, breathily stressing the bond that exists even when life separates you from a loved one. The album’s only other collaboration also yields a sticky couplet. On self-preservation anthem “F.O.E.,” which stands for “Friendship Over Ego,” New Jersey rapper Ash B calls time on an unworthy companion: “’Cause I’m picking me over us/’Cause you have broken my trust.” For extra punch, Ziúr mirrors the rasp of Ash B’s delivery in the crackle and crunch of the track’s breaking-point production. Guest features have become the norm on producer albums in recent years, but Ziúr breaks the mold by centering her own vocals. While her discography of club-inspired releases stretches back only a handful of years, her musical sensibility has clearly been shaped by her time fronting punk bands as a teenager. “Back when I was a singer/performer,” she said in a 2018 interview, “I ran into the audience, rolled on the floor.” On ATØ, Ziúr channels that performative energy into using her voice in wildly different ways, creating a series of vivid vignettes in the process. On the seductive “Life Sick,” she is swathed in post-punk melodrama, a singer hanging off a mic stand, head bent towards the crowd. Opener “ATØ” frames her as a shadowy figure in a forest setting, issuing life lessons through a veil of mist. And while the exquisite “Laniakea” doesn’t directly feature Ziúr’s voice, the humor and pace with which she handles the lead synth is reminiscent of her intonation on “I Vanish.” For the most part, the instrumentals are as strong as the vocal tracks, if not stronger. I can’t hear “It’s Complicated” without wanting to trace the shape of every drumbeat and marimba note with my fingers and limbs. It is deserving of many a dance routine video tribute. “Unclaim” is another highlight: A masterpiece of textural dialogue, it opens with plucked strings, makes space for digital severity, and somehow finds a way to bring the two together in a way that negates neither. If I was splitting hairs, the dancefloor-focused “Catch Me Never” and “Fancy Handbag, Broken Zipper” could both have done with some trimming for this album context. The repetition of their patterns feels somewhat stagnant compared with the expressiveness of the songwriting elsewhere. They’re minor complaints, however, and do very little to dent the achievement of ATØ as a whole. Skillfully switching between forward momentum and deep reflection, its 11 tracks prove Ziúr to be a master storyteller. The album title, it turns out, is an artistic abbreviation of The Alliance to Take Over the World; the record, she says, was made for “people who fight for their existence, every day.” “This Record is not here to please,” she continues in the album notes, “but to disrupt & to connect us in Solidarity.” While that is a noble pursuit, ATØ requires no preamble; the album’s innovative use of space and voice, its formidable sound design, and visionary narratives are their own best advocate. Underestimate Ziúr at your peril.

H.A.Q.Q.,Liturgy,by: Grayson Haver Currin,Contributor,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5dced60d34296e0009eb6882/1:1/w_160/haqq.jpg,2019-11-19 06:00:00,Metal,https://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/liturgy-haqq/,YLYLCYN,"Liturgy tend to sort listeners into cynics and disciples. The first camp views the group as posers overthinking intentionally atavistic music—de facto trolls, making headlines for diatribes about their music’s transcendental intentions and its philosophical underpinnings. For the second camp, Liturgy are unapologetic radicals, channeling the basic spirit and sounds of black metal into experimental upheaval. H.A.Q.Q., Liturgy’s fourth album, confirms what must have been right all along: The truth exists somewhere in the middle. Liturgy offer bait for the haters right there on the cover, with the philosophical framework of founder Hunter Hunt-Hendrix—divided, for your convenience, into four categories, like Axiology and Cosmogony—serving as the album’s stark artwork. And Greg Fox, the hyper-precise drummer that even the naysayers respected, is gone. On the other hand, nothing else sounds quite like these nine volatile tracks, where electronic interference interrupts full-metal sprints and where hoarse screams and mutated strings bleed into one. Yes, H.A.Q.Q. cements Liturgy’s try-hard reputation. But it’s kind of thrilling to hear any band try this hard. For Hunt-Hendrix, Liturgy were always a way to explore his ideas about existence, which could make for an uncomfortable band power balance. Indeed, tensions over their dynamic led to a hiatus after 2011’s high-water mark Aesthethica. Only Hunt-Hendrix and guitarist Bernard Gann remain for H.A.Q.Q, with Fox replaced by ringer Leo Didkovsky and bassist Tyler Dusenbury swapped out for the versatile Tia Vincent-Clark. If you never checked the credits, you may never notice the difference: The rhythm section still flips between sprint and silence with light-switch precision, and the blast beats (yes, Hunt-Hendrix still calls them “burst beats”) continue to expand and contract, like lungs in the middle of a marathon. But for Hunt-Hendrix and Gann, the lineup change feels like a permission slip to pursue a more aggressive and demanding version of Liturgy. Those stilted rap verses of The Ark Work notwithstanding, Liturgy have never bulldozed so many disparate sounds into the same claustrophobic space. During “HAJJ,” a lugubrious choir competes, at once, with tentacular harp lines, curdled screams, and guitar lines that prick like pins or slash like rusted razors. “God of Love”—perhaps the quintessential Liturgy track—buttresses wild expanses of black metal with a little choir of glockenspiel and vibraphone. They form intricate shapes within the din, creating a disorienting sense of infinite scale. There’s never very much quarter during H.A.Q.Q., either. Liturgy’s interludes long doubled as the ellipses between connected thoughts, a brief shelter before the next wave hit. But here, these instrumentals are perhaps the most uneasy pieces. “Exaco I,” for instance, recalls the crisscrossing density of composer Conlon Nancarrow—who wrote pieces so tangled he composed them for the player piano—but as pounded out by Cecil Taylor. (Gann’s father, Kyle, is a Nancarrow scholar.) The chiming bells and disembodied operatic vocals of “Exaco II” feel like a moonlit stroll through an ancient graveyard. The album fades away with three minutes of miasmic solo guitar, the distortion strangling each note into one last gasp. It’s the ringing left in your ears after the music is over. Parts of H.A.Q.Q. feel inchoate. And you’ll likely tire of Hunt-Hendrix’s new habit of splicing glitches inside these songs, a device meant to ratchet up tension that mostly produces tedium. But watch Hunt-Hendrix talk about his philosophy, his eyes darting uneasily in bed as he tries to define these ideas. Then listen to these songs, primal and often ecstatic expressions of something bigger than himself. If his ideas are a work in progress, the purpose of Liturgy is to test them, a process bound to include a little failure.","With a new rhythm section, the notorious black metal experimentalists deliver their most aggressive and radical album yet.
